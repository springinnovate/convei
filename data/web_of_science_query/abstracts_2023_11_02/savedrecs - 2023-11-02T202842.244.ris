TI  - Analyzing the Potential Risk of Climate Change on Lyme Disease in Eastern Ontario, Canada Using Time Series Remotely Sensed Temperature Data and Tick Population Modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of Lyme disease cases (Lyme borreliosis) in Ontario, Canada has increased over the last decade, and that figure is projected to continue to increase. The northern limit of Lyme disease cases has also been progressing northward from the northeastern United States into southeastern Ontario. Several factors such as climate change, changes in host abundance, host and vector migration, or possibly a combination of these factors likely contribute to the emergence of Lyme disease cases in eastern Ontario. This study first determined areas of warming using time series remotely sensed temperature data within Ontario, then analyzed possible spatial-temporal changes in Lyme disease risk in eastern Ontario from 2000 to 2013 due to climate change using tick population modeling. The outputs of the model were validated by using tick surveillance data from 2002 to 2012. Our results indicated areas in Ontario where Lyme disease risk changed from unsustainable to sustainable for sustaining Ixodes scapularis (black-legged tick) populations. This study provides evidence that climate change has facilitated the northward expansion of black-legged tick populations' geographic range over the past decade. The results demonstrate that remote sensing data can be used to increase the spatial detail for Lyme disease risk mapping and provide risk maps for better awareness of possible Lyme disease cases. Further studies are required to determine the contribution of host migration and abundance on changes in eastern Ontario's Lyme disease risk.

TI  - Diffusion of the maize root signal (<i>E</i>)-β-caryophyllene in soils of different textures and the effects on the migration of the entomopathogenic nematode <i>Heterorhabditis megidis</i>
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize roots respond to feeding by larvae of the beetle Diabrotica virgifera virgifera by releasing (E)-beta-caryophyllene (E beta c). This insect-induced root volatile attracts entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) and thereby helps to protect the roots against herbivore damage. Previous studies suggest that diffusion of E beta c occurs through the gaseous rather than the aqueous phase in sand and its diffusion is best at low levels of humidity. However, it remains largely unknown how E beta c diffuses in typical natural and agricultural soils. To fully understand the function and efficiency of root-produced E beta c as a belowground signal it is important to know how it spreads in real soils and how soil properties affect its diffusion. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses, the diffusion of two doses of synthetic E beta c (200 ng and 20,000 ng) injected in sand was compared with the diffusion of E beta c injected in clay, clay-loam and sandy-loam soils, at 3 moisture levels (5, 10 and 20% water), and at two distances (5 and 10 cm) from the E beta c injection point. The diffusion of the compound was measured with a Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) fiber every 30 minutes over a period of 9 hours. We found that, in contrast to the pattern observed for pure sand, E beta c diffused best when humidity was high in the three agricultural soils. In subsequent experiments we used glass-trays to create two types of mesocosms to assess the effect of synthetic or root-produced E beta c on the dispersal of the EPN Heterorhabditis megidis and its infection of sentinel hosts in the trays. The presence of synthetic E beta c did not affect the ability of H. megidis to infect the sentinel host. However, under the test conditions, E beta c released from maize roots influenced the migration behaviour of H. megidis depending on soil type. The results suggest that D. virgifera-damaged maize plants may recruit H. megidis more efficiently in clay loam soils than in other types of soil. These new insights into the diffusion dynamics and attraction efficiency of the root-produced signal E beta c may help efforts to develop novel strategies for the sustainable management of the maize pest D. virgifera.

TI  - Ecosystem-dynamics link to hydrologic variations for different land-cover types
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) influence on ecosystem dynamics has been studied only in a limited way owing to the lack of large-scale measurements. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data retrieved using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was successfully used in this study to identify the ecological relationships that involve soil moisture and ET at 132 sites located on different continents around the world. Optimal relationships exist between NDVI and soil moisture within time lags of 10 days at forest and grassland sites, and 25 days at cropland and shrub land sites. The ecological correlations between NDVI and the hydrological variables are affected mainly by the land-cover type. The densely vegetated areas show shorter time lags for NDVI to ET owing to canopy evaporation and plant transpiration, which are almost simultaneous with NDVI.

TI  - Inversion of Remote Sensing Data Using Multiple Ratios of Spectral Radiation Intensities and Neural Networks
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a method for determining the content and temperature on the basis of spectra from remote measurements. The technique uses measurements of a high resolution radiation spectrum that allows the visibility of the individual rotational lines of gases such as CO 2, used here in the range of 2470-2495 cm(-1). At the same time a new algorithm is applied of pre-processing the spectrum, involving the use of multiple ratios of intensity at several wavenumbers as input to an inverse model based on neural networks. Due to it, the dimensionality of the input can significantly be reduced. Additionally, the data interpreted do not have to be measured in units of spectral radiance. Thus only the calibration of the sensitivity of the spectrometer at various wavelengths is required. The neural models were constructed on the basis of data from the simulation. The proposed method works with a uniform layer of radiating gas for determining the temperature and CO2 content. For a non-uniform layer it is possible to determine the line-of-sight temperature profile and average gas content. The method can be extended to different spectral ranges and to other gases present in substantial quantities in the exhaust gases of various processes.

TI  - COMPARISON OF MOSQUITO ABUNDANCE FROM BIOGENTS SENTINEL 2.0 TRAPS WITH AND WITHOUT RAIN COVERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogents Sentinel (BGS) traps have rapidly become a standard for adult Aedes aegypti surveillance. Several investigators have found that trap collections can be damaged easily by heavy dew or rain entering the trap intake port. In addition, water entering the trap may temporarily stop the fan, thus reducing the collection potential of the trap. We evaluated the effectiveness of a rain cover designed to minimize damage to mosquito trap collections from BGS 2.0 traps in a residential backyard in Jacksonville, FL. Rain covers consisted of white fiberglass 51-cm(2) sheets positioned 19, 29, and 39 cm above the air intake of the traps. One BGS trap did not have a rain cover and was used as a control standard for comparison. All traps were baited with the BG-Lure. Generally, traps with rain covers resulted in higher mosquito counts when compared with collections from uncovered traps. Overall mosquito abundance was greater from traps with the rain cover positioned at 29 cm, but this difference was not significantly different when compared with the other cover heights. Covers spaced 29 or 39 cm collected significantly more Culex quinquefasciatus compared with traps at 19 cm and no cover. Species diversity was greatest for BGS traps with the rain cover positioned at 29 cm followed by 39 cm, 19 cm, and no cover; however, differences in diversity among the traps, with or without covers, were not significant.

TI  - A Method for Upscaling <i>In Situ</i> Soil Moisture Measurements to Satellite Footprint Scale Using Random Forests
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geophysical products generated from remotely sensed data require validation to evaluate their accuracy. Typically in situ measurements are used for validation, as is the case for satellite-derived soil moisture products. However, a large disparity in scales often exists between in situ measurements (covering meters to 10 s of meters) and satellite footprints (often hundreds of meters to several kilometers), making direct comparison difficult. Before using in situ measurements for validation, they must be "upscaled" to provide the mean soil moisture within the satellite footprint. There are a number of existing upscaling methods previously applied to soil moisture measurements, but many place strict requirements on the number and spatial distribution of soil moisture sensors difficult to achieve with permanent/semipermanent ground networks necessary for long-term validation efforts. A new method for upscaling is presented here, using Random Forests to fit a model between in situ measurements and a number of landscape parameters and variables impacting the spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture. The method is specifically intended for validation of the NASA soil moisture active passive (SMAP) products at 36-, 9-, and 3-km scales. The method was applied to in situ data from the SoilSCAPE network in California, validated with data from the SMAPVEX12 campaign in Manitoba, Canada with additional verification from the TxSON network in Texas. For the SMAPVEX12 site, the proposed method was compared to extensive field measurements and was able to predict mean soil moisture over a large area more accurately than other upscaling approaches.

TI  - Long-term analysis of turbidity patterns in Danube Delta coastal area based on MODIS satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of coastal areas is becoming an urgent necessity in the context of increased pressure over these ecosystems due to climate change and human activities. Long term evaluation of specific parameters regarding water quality can now be achieved, thanks to the increased number of archived Earth Observation satellite data, now covering decades. Within this study, 12 years of MODIS information were used to compute surface water turbidity products that were further temporal binned into composite datasets (e.g. monthly, annual). A regional algorithm, based on local in situ measurements, was used in order to inverse remote sensing reflectance values into turbidity units. The interpretation of the final maps revealed important characteristics of the processes that play a major role in the regional turbidity dynamics. Observations were made regarding the relation between surface water turbidity and Danube River's discharge rates, winds, currents and also the bottom sedimentary characteristics of the shelf area. We discuss how different regions are affected by various external factors, depending on their geographical location, and we reinforce the idea that the river solid input is not the only parameter controlling water clarity in the Danube Delta coastal area, resuspension processes playing also an important role.

TI  - Validation of the ANOCOVA model for regional-scale EC<sub>a</sub> to EC<sub>e</sub> calibration
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Two approaches have emerged as the preferred means for assessing salinity at regional scale: (i) vegetative indices from satellite imagery (e.g., MODIS enhanced vegetative index, NDVI) and (ii) analysis of covariance (ANOCOVA) calibration of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) to salinity. The later approach is most recent and least extensively validated. It is the objective of this study to provide extensive validation of the ANOCOVA approach. The validation comprised 77 fields in California's Coachella Valley, ranging from 1.25 to 30.0 ha in size with an average size of 12.8 ha. Mobile electromagnetic induction (EMI) equipment surveyed the fields obtaining geospatial measurements of ECa. Soil sample sites selected following ECa-directed soil sampling protocols characterized the range and spatial variation in ECa across the field. From the data, a regional ANOCOVA model was developed. The regional ANOCOVA model successfully reduced cross-validated, average log salinity prediction error (variance) estimate by more than 30% across the 77 fields and improved the depth-averaged prediction accuracy in 58 of the 77 fields. The results show that the ANOCOVA modelling approach improves soil salinity predictions from EMI signal data in most of the surveys conducted, particularly fields where only a limited number of calibration sampling locations were available. The establishment of ANOCOVA models at each depth increment for a representative set of fields within a regional-scale study area provides slope coefficients applicable to all future fields within the region, significantly reducing ground-truth soil samples at future fields.

TI  - A comparison of the predictive potential of various vegetation indices for leaf chlorophyll content
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf chlorophyll is an important indicator of nutritional stress, photosynthetic capacity, and growth status of plants. Therefore, it is important to accurately estimate leaf chlorophyll content over a range of spatial and temporal scales. However, traditional methods for chlorophyll measurement mainly rely on chemical analysis, which is not universally applicable to dynamic monitoring of plants in large areas because it is time consuming and requires destructive measurements. Hyperspectral remote sensing has enormous potential for accurate retrieval of plant biochemical parameters. Therefore, it has become the most popular means to retrieve chlorophyll content, by establishing empirical relationships between different vegetation indices and chlorophyll content. In recent years, many vegetation indices have been developed for the inversion of chlorophyll content. Only the vegetation indices that are less affected by the external environment are used, in order to establish a strong and robust model. Therefore, it is very important to assess the anti-disturbance ability of different vegetation indices. In this paper, a new method is proposed to quantitatively assess the anti-disturbance ability of vegetation indices. The anti-disturbance ability of several vegetation indices that are commonly used for chlorophyll estimation was evaluated using this method. We concluded that the anti-disturbance ability of VogD, TCARI/OSAVI, and Datt99 is stronger than the other vegetation indices tested. However, if a vegetation index is not sensitive to chlorophyll content, predicting chlorophyll content holds no value even though it has a strong anti-disturbance ability. Therefore, we used the slope of the best fitting function between the vegetation index and chlorophyll content (defined as d(VI)/d(Chlorophyll content)) to measure the sensitivities of different indices to chlorophyll content. Finally, we found that TCARI/OSAVI was one of the best vegetation indices to estimate chlorophyll content at the leaf level. However, we have only considered three factors to evaluate the anti-disturbance ability of different vegetation indices, which is still far from enough because the canopy reflectance is affected by many factors. Therefore, we should account for more factors in the future.

TI  - Isolation and Genotyping of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in Brazilian Dogs
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Strains of Toxoplasma gondii in Brazil are highly genetically diverse compared to strains from North America and Europe. Dogs are epidemiologically important because they act as sentinels for T. gondii infections in humans and are good indicators of environmental contamination. The aim of this study was to isolate and genetically characterize T. gondii strains from tissues of naturally infected Brazilian dogs. For this study, 21 blood samples were collected from dogs at the Zoonosis Control Centers of Ilheus and Itabuna cities, Bahia, Brazil. The sera were examined for T. gondii antibodies using the indirect hemagglutination test. Brains and hearts of seropositive dogs were bioassayed in mice to isolate and characterize T. gondii parasites by PCR-RFLP using 10 genetic markers (SAG1, newSAG2, SAG3, BTUB, c22-8, c29-2, GRA6, PK1, APICO, and L358). However, T. gondii was isolated from only 4 (57.1%) dogs, designated TgDgBr6, 13, 17, and 21. All strains were virulent, causing clinical changes (rough hair coat, lethargy, and abdominal distention) and the death of all mice within 8-20 days after inoculation. Genetic analysis of these 4 T. gondii isolates revealed 4 distinct genotypes with different clonal lineage combinations (types I, II, and III) and 2 atypical alleles. Using PCR-RFLP with several markers, this study contributes to evaluations of the genetic diversity of strains circulating in Brazil.

TI  - Screening Mississippi River Levees Using Texture-Based and Polarimetric-Based Features from Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article reviews the use of synthetic aperture radar remote sensing data for earthen levee mapping with an emphasis on finding the slump slides on the levees. Earthen levees built on the natural levees parallel to the river channel are designed to protect large areas of populated and cultivated land in the Unites States from flooding. One of the signs of potential impending levee failure is the appearance of slump slides. On-site inspection of levees is expensive and time-consuming; therefore, a need to develop efficient techniques based on remote sensing technologies is mandatory to prevent failures under flood loading. Analysis of multi-polarized radar data is one of the viable tools for detecting the problem areas on the levees. In this study, we develop methods to detect anomalies on the levee, such as slump slides and give levee managers new tools to prioritize their tasks. This paper presents results of applying the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL)'s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) quad-polarized L-band data to detect slump slides on earthen levees. The study area encompasses a portion of levees of the lower Mississippi River in the United States. In this paper, we investigate the performance of polarimetric and texture features for efficient levee classification. Texture features derived from the gray level co-occurrence (GLCM) matrix and discrete wavelet transform were computed and analyzed for efficient levee classification. The pixel-based polarimetric decomposition features, such as entropy, anisotropy, and scattering angle were also computed and applied to the support vector machine classifier to characterize the radar imagery and compared the results with texture-based classification. Our experimental results showed that inclusion of textural features derived from the SAR data using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) features and GLCM features provided higher overall classification accuracies compared to the pixel-based polarimetric features.

TI  - Crop Classification in Satellite Images through Probabilistic Segmentation Based on Multiple Sources
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification methods based on Gaussian Markov Measure Field Models and other probabilistic approaches have to face the problem of construction of the likelihood. Typically, in these methods, the likelihood is computed from 1D or 3D histograms. However, when the number of information sources grows, as in the case of satellite images, the histogram construction becomes more difficult due to the high dimensionality of the feature space. In this work, we propose a generalization of Gaussian Markov Measure Field Models and provide a probabilistic segmentation scheme, which fuses multiple information sources for image segmentation. In particular, we apply the general model to classify types of crops in satellite images. The proposed method allows us to combine several feature spaces. For this purpose, the method requires prior information for building a 3D histogram for each considered feature space. Based on previous histograms, we can compute the likelihood of each site of the image to belong to a class. The computed likelihoods are the main input of the proposed algorithm and are combined in the proposed model using a contrast criteria. Different feature spaces are analyzed, among them are 6 spectral bands from LANDSAT 5 TM, 3 principal components from PCA on 6 spectral bands and 3 principal components from PCA applied on 10 vegetation indices. The proposed algorithm was applied to a real image and obtained excellent results in comparison to different classification algorithms used in crop classification.

TI  - Measuring Moran's I in a Cost-Efficient Manner to Describe a Land-Cover Change Pattern in Large-Scale Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and analysis of a land-cover change pattern from remotely sensed imagery have gained increasing research interests in recent years. A number of spatial statistics and landscape pattern metrics have been explored for this purpose. Moran's index (Moran's I) of spatial autocorrelation is one such spatiostatis-tical measure, which has been proved to be useful in characterizing the land-cover change, especially in Landsat data. However, since the Moran's I estimation needs to deal with spatial weight between each pair of spatial data objects, it becomes almost unfeasible to apply Moran's I in the case of large-scale remote sensing data, containing several millions of pixels. This paper proposes a method for computing Moran's I in the Hadoop MapReduce framework and thereby helps in describing spatial patterns in large-scale remotely sensed data. The contributions of the work include: 1) the exhaustive description of the Mapper and Reducer implementation for cost-effective estimation of Moran's I, and 2) the computational complexity analysis of the respective algorithms. Furthermore, two case studies have been presented, considering both the rook case and the queen case of spatial contiguity. Case Study 1 demonstrates the computational efficiency of the proposed implementation, and Case Study 2 illustrates an application of Moran's I in describing the urban sprawling pattern in two large spatial zones in Kolkata, India.

TI  - Melanoma during pregnancy: a report of 60 pregnancies complicated by melanoma
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of melanoma during pregnancy is challenging as maternal benefits and fetal risks need to be balanced. Here, we present an overview of the incidence, the demographic and clinical characteristics and the treatment modalities used. After analysis of obstetric, fetal and maternal outcome, recommendations for clinical practice are provided. From the 'International Network on Cancer, Infertility and Pregnancy' database, pregnant patients with melanoma were identified and analysed. Sixty pregnancies were eligible for analysis. Fifty percent of the patients presented with advanced melanoma during pregnancy (14 stage III and 16 stage IV), and 27% were diagnosed with recurrent melanoma. Surgery was the main therapeutic strategy during pregnancy. Only four patients with advanced melanoma were treated during pregnancy with systemic therapy (n=1) or radiotherapy (n=3). Premature delivery was observed in 18% of the ongoing pregnancies, all which were induced and 78% of which involved patients with advanced melanoma. Thirty-nine percent of the patients died within 5 years; all had been diagnosed with stage III or IV disease during pregnancy. Melanoma can present in a more advanced stage during pregnancy. New systemic therapies may be beneficial for patients with metastatic melanoma but may not be pregnancy compatible. In these patients, preterm induction of labour need to be discussed, despite the short-term and long-term negative effects on the child. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

TI  - Urban driving forces and megacity expansion threats. Study case in the Mexico City periphery
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The megacity proximity produces significant stress in the surrounding areas with fast changes in land conversion, mainly in the urban sprawl growth. The swiftness facilitates studies about land use changes to urban in short-term. The principal boosting urbanization factors, either socioeconomic or physical geographical, are usually identified as the driving forces (DF) to be considered in the regional planning programs and prospective urbanization modeling.The land-use-change-to-urban (LUCU) phenomenon was studied by Landsat images along the 2000 2014 period in the Northern periphery of Mexico Megacity. The study case was delimited in the Pachuca-Tizayuca Valley, Hidalgo State. Municipalities and the whole area showed high annual urbanization growth rates (2.89%-4.14%) and 3.39%, respectively. The urban area's increase in each unit allowed calculation of three dependent variables as LUCU quantitative descriptors, which were further applied in three statistical approaches. In the first one, multivariate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) was performed to evaluate the correlation coefficient (R) and the sensitivity factor (13) for the urbanization rate (814) vs. each socioeconomic or physical factor. In the second one, the urbanization ratio (U-R14) vs. independent variables mean values were used in spatial OLS and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis. Finally, the third approach applied Cramer's V test based on the number of pixels converted to urban (PUc(14)) as LUCU descriptor and all independent variables. Cramer test allowed the best factors' analyses, while not all fitted the OLS and GWR requirements. The whole process leads to a methodologic pathway to identify land change DFs to urban use.The study case acknowledged the following main DF to urbanization: the welfare; the population growth rate; the population proportions of immigrants, scholar age, workers in second and third economic sector; and the distances to quarry stones, schools, urban areas and roads. Cramer's V reach 70.5 accuracy values in the urbanization modeling with the mentioned DFs by the Multi-Layer Perceptron of the Land Change Modeler (Idrisi). The spatial urban area increase in the 2029 year was predicted based on these DFs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Compared to ecosystem conservation in territorial seas, protecting the open ocean has peculiar geopolitical, economic and scientific challenges. One of the major obstacle is defining the boundary of an open ocean Marine Protected Area (MPA). In contrast to coastal ecosystems, which are mostly constrained by topographic structures fixed in time, the life of marine organisms in the open ocean is entrained by fluid dynamical structures like eddies and fronts, whose lifetime occurs on ecologically-relevant timescales. The position of these highly dynamical structures can vary interannually by hundreds of km, and so too will regions identified as ecologically relevant such as the foraging areas of marine predators. Thus, the expected foraging locations suggested from tracking data cannot be directly extrapolated beyond the year in which the data were collected. Here we explore the potential of Lagrangian methods applied to multisatellite data as a support tool for a MPA proposal by focusing on the Crozet archipelago oceanic area (Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean). By combining remote sensing with biologging information from a key marine top predator (Eudyptes chrysolophus, or Macaroni penguin) of the Southern Ocean foodweb, we identify a highly dynamic branch of the Subantarctic front as a foraging hotspot. By tracking this feature in historical satellite data (1993-2012) we are able to extrapolate the position of this foraging ground beyond the years in which tracking data are available and study its spatial variability.

AB  - To assess the role of single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT-CT) for the identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with early stage (T1-T2) oral cancer and a clinically negative neck (cN0).In addition to planar lymphoscintigraphy, SPECT-CT was performed in 66 consecutive patients with early stage oral cancer and a clinically negative neck. The addition of SPECT-CT to planar images was retrospectively analyzed for the number of additional SLNs, more precise localization of SLNs, and importance of anatomical information by a team consisting of a nuclear physician, surgeon, and investigator.Identification rate for both imaging modalities combined was 98% (65/66). SPECT-CT identified 15 additional SLNs in 14 patients (22%). In 2/15 (13%) of these additional SLNs, the only metastasis was found, resulting in an upstaging rate of 3% (2/65). In 20% of the patients with at least one positive SLN, the only positive SLN was detected due to the addition of SPECT-CT. SPECT-CT was considered to add important anatomical information in two patients (3%). In 5/65 (8%) of the patients initially scored SLNs on planar lymphoscintigrams were scored as non-SLNs when SPECT-CT was added. There were four false-negative SLN biopsy procedures in this cohort.The addition of SPECT-CT to planar lymphoscintigraphy is recommended for the identification of more (positive) SLNs and better topographical orientation for surgery in sentinel lymph node biopsy for early stage oral cancer.

TI  - Evaluating Site-Specific and Generic Spatial Models of Aboveground Forest Biomass Based on Landsat Time-Series and LiDAR Strip Samples in the Eastern USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-area assessment of aboveground tree biomass (AGB) to inform regional or national forest monitoring programs can be efficiently carried out by combining remotely sensed data and field sample measurements through a generic statistical model, in contrast to site-specific models. We integrated forest inventory plot data with spatial predictors from Landsat time-series imagery and LiDAR strip samples at four sites across the eastern USAMinnesota (MN), Maine (ME), Pennsylvania-New Jersey (PANJ) and South Carolina (SC)in statistical modeling frameworks to analyze the performance of generic (all sites combined) versus site-specific models. The major objective was to evaluate the prediction accuracy of generic and site-specific models when applied to particular sites. Pixel-level polynomial model fitting was applied to the time-series of near-anniversary date Landsat variables to obtain projected metrics in the target year 2014 for which LiDAR strip samples were available. Two forms of models based on ordinary least-squares multiple linear regressions (MLR) and the random forest (RF) machine learning approach were developed for each site and for the pooled (i.e., generic) reference data frame. The models were evaluated using national forest inventory (NFI) data for the USA. We observed stronger fit statistics with the MLR than with RF for both the site-specific and the generic models. The proportions of variances explained (adjusted R-2) with the site-specific models were 0.86, 0.78, 0.82 and 0.92 for ME, MN, PANJ and SC, respectively while the generic model had adjusted R-2 = 0.85. A test of statistical equivalence of observed and predicted AGB for the NFI locations did not reveal equivalence with any of the models, possibly due to the different resolutions of the observed and predicted data. In contrast, predictions by the generic and site-specific models were equivalent. We conclude that a generic model provides accuracies comparable to the site-specific models for large-area AGB assessment across our study sites in the eastern USA.

TI  - Validation of quasi-invariant ice cloud radiative quantities with MODIS satellite-based cloud property retrievals
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Similarity relations applied to ice cloud radiance calculations are theoretically analyzed and numerically validated. If tau(1-pi) and tau(1-pi g) are conserved where tau is optical thickness, pi the single-scattering albedo, and g the asymmetry factor, it is possible that substantially different phase functions may give rise to similar radiances in both conservative and non-conservative scattering cases, particularly in the case of large optical thicknesses. In addition to theoretical analysis, this study uses operational ice cloud optical thickness retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 2 Collection 5 (C5) and Collection 6 (C6) cloud property products to verify radiative similarity relations. It is found that, if the MODIS C5 and C6 ice cloud optical thickness values are multiplied by their respective (1-pi g)factors, the resultant products referred to as the effective optical thicknesses become similar with their ratio values around unity. Furthermore, the ratios of the C5 and C6 ice cloud effective optical thicknesses display an angular variation pattern similar to that of the corresponding ice cloud phase function ratios. The MODIS C5 and C6 values of ice cloud similarity parameter, defined as [(1-pi)/(1-pi g)](1/2), also tend to be similar. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Diverse sources of syndromic surveillance including over-the-counter (OTC) drug sales, hospital and school-based influenza-like illness (ILI) and Baidu search queries estimate influenza activity in Tianjin, China. The purpose of this study was to determine which syndromic surveillance systems had the strongest correlation with laboratory-confirmed influenza activity.Data were obtained from sentinel hospitals and laboratories; sentinel hospitals also reported percentage of ILI. OTC sales and school-based ILI absentee data were provided by public pharmacies and schools. Baidu search queries for influenza surveillance were analyzed. Spearman correlation analysis examined correlations of syndromic systems with laboratory-confirmed data.Syndromic data for hospital ILI%, OTC sales and school-based ILI correlated well with laboratory data (r = 0.732, 0.490 and 0.693, respectively; P < 0.05). Baidu, the predominant Chinese Internet service, searches for 'influenza', 'cough' and 'fever' correlated best with laboratory-confirmed activity; queries for 'fever' were strongest (r = 0.924, P < 0.001). Correlations between school-based ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza increased from 0.693 to 0.795 after a 1-week lag (P < 0.05).A Baidu query of 'fever' provided the strongest correlation to laboratory surveillance. School-based ILI absence reporting detected influenza virus activity 1 week earlier than laboratory confirmation. Use of diverse syndromic surveillance systems in conjunction with traditional surveillance systems can improve influenza surveillance.

TI  - Ultimate resistance behavior of rectangular concrete-filled tubular beam-columns made of high-strength steel
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - High-strength steel is permitted in steel structures, whereas, further studies are needed to allow the use of high strength steel in concrete-filled tubular (CFT) structures. In this study, twelve rectangular CFT columns using Q460-grade steel were tested under eccentric load and the test results were discussed. A nonlinear finite element model (FEM) was developed to predict the load-displacement and ultimate resistance behaviors of the test columns. Parametric studies were conducted using the verified FEM to investigate the influence of aspect ratios, steel strength, and width-to-thickness (h/t) ratio of steel plate. The ultimate resistance calculated by European Code (EC4), American Code (AISC 360) and Chinese Code (CECS 159) is compared with the FEM predictions to evaluate their feasibility in the use of higher aspect ratios, high-strength steel, and various h/t ratios. The results indicate that the three design codes are safe in the design of columns with higher aspect ratios. EC4 is conservative in the design of rectangular CFT columns with high-strength steel up to 690 MPa under its h/t ratio limitation. AISC 360 method can accurately predict the maximum resistance of rectangular CFT columns with steel strength 550 MPa. CECS 159 method is highly conservative and can be safely extended to the use of steel strength up to 690 MPa and plate slenderness ratio 85 root 235/fy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ultrasound-Guided Needle Biopsy of Neck Lymph Nodes in Patients With Suspected Lung Cancer <i>Are the Specimens Sufficient for Complete Pathologic Evaluation to Guide Patient Management</i>?
T2  - ULTRASOUND QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of ultrasound guided needle biopsy of a neck lymph node to provide adequate tissue for complete pathologic evaluation of suspected metastatic lung cancer, including molecular testing for epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations by pyrosequencing and anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization.Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained and the requirement for informed consent was waived. All ultrasound guided neck biopsies performed July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2015, were retrospectively reviewed, and all biopsies performed for suspected lung cancer metastatic to supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes were included.Results: Forty patients with suspected lung cancer underwent ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of an abnormal appearing neck lymph node identified on preprocedure computed tomography or positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Thirty-seven patients were subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer and 3 were diagnosed with lymphoma. A definitive pathologic diagnosis was rendered in 95% of neck node biopsies (38/40; 95% confidence interval, 84%-99%). Of the 36 specimens diagnostic for lung cancer, 16 were considered for further molecular testing and the specimen was adequate for molecular testing in 15 (94%; 73%-100%) cases. Therefore, the neck node biopsy specimens were adequate for complete pathologic workup in 93% (37/40; 81%-98%). No complications related to the biopsies were observed.Conclusions: In patients presenting with suspected lung cancer and suspicious neck lymph nodes, ultrasound-guided needle biopsy frequently provides adequate tissue for complete pathologic evaluation and eliminates the need for more invasive procedures.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We reorganised the combined (acute and rehab) stroke unit (SU) at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital into a hyperacute stroke unit (HASU) and a rehab SU where patients are moved after spending about 72 hours on HASU. Continuous monitoring of physiological variables was introduced and consultant job plans were reorganised to provide a HASU physician of the week model with enhanced 7-day senior presence along with redistribution of junior medical staff. Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) data for 14 months preceding the reorganisation (n=1,049) and 14 months after (n=974) were accessed for outcomes. More patients were admitted directly to the HASU with favourable reductions in time to computerised tomography scanning and stroke consultant assessment after the change. There were significant reductions in length of stay, pneumonia and urinary tract infections at 7 days and a favourable shift in modified Rankin scores (odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.36-1.89, p<0.001) on discharge from hospital.

TI  - European Rice Cropland Mapping with Sentinel-1 Data: The Mediterranean Region Case Study
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice farming is one of the most important activities in the agriculture sector, producing staple food for the majority of the world's growing population. Accurate and up-to-date assessment of the spatial distribution of rice cultivated area is a key information requirement of all stakeholders including policy makers, rice farmers and consumers. Timely assessment with high precision is, e.g., crucial for water resource management, market prices control and during humanitarian food crisis. Recently, two Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellites carrying a C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor were launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) within the homework of the Copernicus program. The advanced data acquisition capabilities of S-1 provide a unique opportunity to monitor different land cover types at high spatial (20 m) and temporal (twice-weekly to biweekly) resolution. The objective of this research is to evaluate the applicability of an existing phenology-based classification method for continental-scale rice cropland mapping using S-1 backscatter time series. In this study, the S-1 images were collected during the rice growing season of 2015 covering eight selected European test sites situated in six Mediterranean countries. Due to the better rice classification capabilities of SAR cross-polarized measurement as compared to co-polarized data, S-1 cross-polarized (VH) data were used. Phenological parameters derived from the S-1 VH backscatter time series were used as an input to a knowledge-based decision-rule classifier in order to classify the input data into rice and non-rice areas. The classification results were evaluated using multiple regions of interest (ROIs) drawn from high-resolution optical remote sensing (SPOT 5) data and the European CORINE land cover (CLC 2012) product. An overall accuracy of more than 70% for all eight study sites was achieved. The S-1 based classification maps reveal much more details compared to the rice field class contained in the CLC 2012 product. These findings demonstrate the potential and feasibility of using S-1 VH data to develop an operational rice crop monitoring framework at the continental scale.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the management of early breast cancer: Safety considerations and timing
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the last decades, breast cancer treatment has become more personalised. Treatment plans are based on the biology of the tumour rather than the stage. Consequently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is commonly the primary therapy for early breast cancer as well as locally advanced disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is standard axillary management for women with node-negative disease. This review looks at the relevant literature and gives guidance on the timing of SLNB when NACT is planned and evaluates the safety of performing an SLNB rather than an axillary clearance.

TI  - From Producers to Consumers: The Challenges and Opportunities of Agricultural Development in Iraqi Kurdistan
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture and rural life in the Middle East have gone through several changes in the past few decades. The region is characterized by high population growth, urbanization, and water scarcity, which poses a challenge to maintaining food security and production. This paper investigates agricultural and rural challenges in the Duhok governorate of Iraqi Kurdistan from biophysical, political, and socio-economic perspectives. Satellite data is used to study land use and productivity, while a review of government policies and interview data show the perspectives of the government and the local population. Our results reveal that these perspectives are not necessarily in line with each other, nor do they correspond well with the biophysical possibilities. While the government has been trying to increase agricultural productivity, satellite data show that yields have been declining since 2000. Furthermore, a lack of services in rural areas is driving people to cities to seek better opportunities, which means that the local population's incentive to increase agricultural activity is low. Governmental plans suggest land extensification to increase production and self-sufficiency, but the land use classification shows little available land. Instead, we recommend supporting small-scale traditional agriculture development as a more sustainable and feasible alternative. Additionally, more resources need to be focused on improving rural infrastructure and services to increase access to education and health care as a means of gaining support from the local population.

TI  - Integration of remote sensing and aeromagnetic data for mapping structural features and hydrothermal alteration zones in Wadi Allaqi area, South Eastern Desert of Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and aeromagnetic data provided significant information for detecting potential areas of mineralization in Wadi Allaqi in the South Eastern Desert of Egypt. Application of band ratios and Crosta technique of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Landsat-8 successfully highlighted the hydro thermal alteration zones and the structural elements represented by lithologic contacts and faults/fracture zones. Structural lineaments were also successfully extracted using remote sensing and aeromagnetic data. Center for Exploration Targeting (CET) Grid analysis and CET Porphyry Analysis techniques were applied for constructing the structural complexity heat map and probable near circular features of porphyry intrusions respectively. Combining data of lineaments, alteration zones and porphyry intrusions after obtaining a consequence of each map allowed predicting and mapping areas of probable high mineral resources. Overlaying the present sites of mineralization on the final map validated the prepared mineral predictive map. Overall results clearly revealed that areas of high structural complexity, fractures/faults density are in agreement with the detected areas of hydrothermal alterations which also matched with the known mineralization mines in the study area.

TI  - Effects of urban tree canopy loss on land surface temperature magnitude and timing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) plays an important role in moderating the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) effect, which poses threats to human health due to substantially increased temperatures relative to rural areas. UTC coverage is associated with reduced urban temperatures, and therefore benefits both human health and reducing energy use in cities. Measurement of this relationship relies on accurate, fine spatial resolution UTC mapping, and on time series analysis of Land Surface Temperatures (LST). The City of Worcester, Massachusetts underwent extensive UTC loss and gain during the relatively brief period from 2008 to 2015, providing a natural experiment to measure the UTC/LST relationship. This paper consists of two elements to this end. First, it presents methods to map UTC in urban and suburban locations at fine spatial resolution (similar to 0.5 m) using image segmentation of a fused Lidar/WorldView-2 dataset, in order to show UTC change over time. Second, the areas of UTC change are used to explore changes in LST magnitude and seasonal variability using a time series of all available Landsat data for the study area over the eight-year period from 2007 to 2015. Fractional UTC change per unit area was determined using fine resolution UTC maps for 2008, 2010, and 2015, covering the period of large-scale tree loss and subsequent planting. LST changes were measured across a series of net UTC change bins, providing a relationship between UTC net change and LST trend. LST was analyzed for both monotonic trends over time and changes to seasonal magnitude and timing, using Theil-Sen slopes and Seasonal Trend Analysis (STA), respectively. The largest magnitudes of UTC loss occurred in residential neighborhoods, causing increased exposure of impervious (road) and pervious (grass) surfaces. Net UTC loss showed higher monotonic increases in LST than persistence and gain areas. STA indicated that net UTC loss was associated greater difference between 2008 and 2015 seasonal temperature curves than persistence areas, and also larger peak LST values, with peak increases ranging from 1 to 6 degrees C. Timing of summer warm period was extended in UTC loss areas by up to 15 days. UTC gain provided moderate LST mitigation, with lower monotonic trends, lower peak temperatures, and smaller seasonal curve changes than both persistence and loss locations. This study shows that urban trees mitigate the magnitude and timing of the surface urban heat island effect, even in suburban areas with less proportional impervious coverage than the dense urban areas traditionally associated with SUHI. Trees can therefore be seen as an effective means of offsetting the energy-intensive urban heat island effect. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

T2  - DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of a polyphenol-rich fraction (TMEF) obtained from Terminalia muelleri Benth. were measured. The analgesic activity of TMEF was tested using acetic acid-induced writhing and hot plate models in mice. The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed using carrageenan-induced paw edema model by measuring PGE(2), TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 plasma levels as well as the paw thickness. TMEF was tested at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg p.o. and diclofenac sodium was used as a standard (100 mg/kg) in all experiments. The group treated with 400 mg/kg of TMEF showed a greater inhibition in the number of writhes (by 63%) than the standard-treated group (61%). Pretreatment with TMEF increased the analgesic effect in hot plate test in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect after 120 min. TMEF pretreatment alos reduced the edema thickness by 48, 53, and 62% at the tested doses, respectively. TMEF administration inhibited the carrageenan-induced elevations in PGE(2) (by 34, 43, and 47%), TNF- (18, 28, and 41%), IL-1 (14, 22, and 29%), and IL-6 (26, 31, and 46%). Four phenolic compounds were isolated from Terminalia muelleri for the first time. Drug Dev Res 78 : 146-154, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Time series evaluation of landscape dynamics using annual Landsat imagery and spatial statistical modeling: Evidence from the Phoenix metropolitan region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a natural and social process involving simultaneous changes to the Earth's land systems, energy flow, demographics, and the economy. Understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of urbanization is increasingly important for policy formulation, decision making, and natural resource management. A combination of satellite remote sensing and patch-based models has been widely adopted to characterize landscape changes at various spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the validity of this type of framework in identifying long-term changes, especially subtle or gradual land modifications is seriously challenged. In this paper, we integrate annual image time series, continuous spatial indices, and non-parametric trend analysis into a spatiotemporal study of landscape dynamics over the Phoenix metropolitan area from 1991 to 2010. We harness local indicators of spatial dependence and modified Mann-Kendall test to describe the monotonic trends in the quantity and spatial arrangement of two important land use land cover types: vegetation and built-up areas. Results suggest that declines in vegetation and increases in built-up areas are the two prevalent types of changes across the region. Vegetation increases mostly occur at the outskirts where new residential areas are developed from natural desert. A sizable proportion of vegetation declines and built-up increases are seen in the central and southeast part. Extensive land conversion from agricultural fields into urban land use is one important driver of vegetation declines. The xeriscaping, practice also contributes to part of vegetation loss and an increasingly heterogeneous landscape. The quantitative framework proposed in this study provides a pathway to effective landscape mapping and change monitoring from a spatial statistical perspective.

TI  - Case study of dust event sources from the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts: An investigation of the horizontal evolution and topographical effect using numerical modeling and remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A severe dust event occurred from April 23 to April 27, 2014, in East Asia. A state-of-the-art online atmospheric chemistry model, WRF/Chem, was combined with a dust model, GOCART, to better understand the entire process of this event. The natural color images and aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the dust source region are derived from datasets of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) loaded on a NASA Aqua satellite to trace the dust variation and to verify the model results. Several meteorological conditions, such as pressure, temperature, wind vectors and relative humidity, are used to analyze meteorological dynamic. The results suggest that the dust emission occurred only on April 23 and 24, although this event lasted for 5 days. The Gobi Desert was the main source for this event, and the Taklamakan Desert played no important role. This study also suggested that the landform of the source region could remarkably interfere with a dust event. The Tarim Basin has a topographical effect as a "dust reservoir" and can store unsettled dust, which can be released again as a second source, making a dust event longer and heavier.

M3  - Article
AB  - Taking the coastal zone of Xiangshangang Bay as a study area, based on the information of four TM images of 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015, the land use types are divided into eight categories. Then, through calculating four kinds of index models: land-use dynamic index, conversion matrix, land use structure information entropy, and comprehensive index of land development and utilization intensity, researched and analyzed the speed, structure, degree, and the temporal and spatial variation in the land development and utilization of Xiangshangang Bay coastal zone from 1985 to 2015. The results showed that: (1) From 1985 to 2015, the expansion speed of farming land and salt pan of Xiangshangang Bay coastal zone was the fastest, the highest dynamic degree could up to 11.97 %, construction land expansion ranked the second, and its increase in the area was the most significant; tidal flats reduced by a maximum speed, and the area of farmland decreased obviously. (2) In the past 30 years, the main trend of land type change in Xiangshangang Bay coastal zone was arable land turn into construction land, followed by woodland turn into farmland. (3) Information entropy increased by period, the land use structure heterogeneity constantly strengthened and regional development became gradually mature. (4) The change rate of land use intensity in each period was greater than zero, and the intensity of land development and utilization in Xiangshang Bay coastal zone land is enhanced continuously.

TI  - Connotations of pixel-based scale effect in remote sensing and the modified fractal-based analysis method
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Scale problems are a major source of concern in the field of remote sensing. Since the remote sensing is a complex technology system, there is a lack of enough cognition on the connotation of scale and scale effect in remote sensing. Thus, this paper first introduces the connotations of pixel-based scale and summarizes the general understanding of pixel-based scale effect. Pixel-based scale effect analysis is essentially important for choosing the appropriate remote sensing data and the proper processing parameters. Fractal dimension is a useful measurement to analysis pixel-based scale. However in traditional fractal dimension calculation, the impact of spatial resolution is not considered, which leads that the scale effect change with spatial resolution can't be clearly reflected. Therefore, this paper proposes to use spatial resolution as the modified scale parameter of two fractal methods to further analyze the pixel-based scale effect. To verify the results of two modified methods (MFBM (Modified Windowed Fractal Brownian Motion Based on the Surface Area) and MDBM (Modified Windowed Double Blanket Method)); the existing scale effect analysis method (information entropy method) is used to evaluate. And six sub-regions of building areas and farmland areas were cut out from QuickBird images to be used as the experimental data. The results of the experiment show that both the fractal dimension and information entropy present the same trend with the decrease of spatial resolution, and some inflection points appear at the same feature scales. Further analysis shows that these feature scales (corresponding to the inflection points) are related to the actual sizes of the geo-object, which results in fewer mixed pixels in the image, and these inflection points are significantly indicative of the observed features. Therefore, the experiment results indicate that the modified fractal methods are effective to reflect the pixel-based scale effect existing in remote sensing data and it is helpful to analyze the observation scale from different aspects. This research will ultimately benefit for remote sensing data selection and application.

TI  - Land adjacency effects on MODIS Aqua top-of-atmosphere radiance in the shortwave infrared: Statistical assessment and correction
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite measurements of coastal or inland waters near land/water interfaces suffer from land adjacency effects (LAEs), particularly in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths. Here a statistical method was developed to quantify the LAEs as the ratio of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) total radiance (L-t, W m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1)) between near-shore pixels and LAE-free offshore pixels (>12 pixels away from land). The calculations were conducted using MODIS Aqua images between 2003 and 2012 over the Madagascar Island, with results showing the dependency of LAEs on different environmental and observational factors. The LAEs decrease dramatically with increasing distance from shoreline, and increase with decreasing aerosol optical thickness at 869 nm (tau(869)). The nearby land surface albedo also plays a role in modulating the LAEs, but the impact is only prominent under low-aerosol conditions. Based on these observations, a look-up-table (LUT) to formulate a correction scheme was established. Tests of the correction scheme using satellite observations over the Hawaii Islands and using in situ measurements in the Chesapeake Bay show significant improvements in Lt (LAEs much closer to 1 than uncorrected data) and retrieved surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a, mg m(-3)), respectively. Furthermore, the number of Chl-a retrievals within the range of 0-64 mg m(-3) also increases by >60%. While the ultimate solution of correcting the LAEs for coastal/inland water applications still requires further work, these preliminary results suggest that the method proposed here deserves further tests for other estuaries and lakes.

TI  - Anxiety Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence: A Primary Care Approach
T2  - PEDIATRIC ANNALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fears and worries are normal feelings that help us adapt to the ups and downs of life. Those ups and downs are especially normal as children and adolescents grow up and try to find where they fit in the world. With changing relationships at home and in social circles, they are establishing their worldview and solidifying their identity. These feelings of fear and worry can sometimes become overwhelming, and anxiety disorders can develop. Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders with onset in childhood. Pediatricians are often a trusted confidant for children and adolescents, and they may be the first people to hear when normal stress becomes overwhelming and progresses into an anxiety disorder. This article is intended for primary care pediatricians to help them identify normal stresses versus anxiety disorders, and help their patients move, through psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, toward wellness.

T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence due to underground resources exploitation is a well-known problem that affects many cities in the world, especially the ones located along the coastal areas where the combined effect of subsidence and sea level rise increases the flooding risk. In this study, 25years of land subsidence affecting the Municipality of Ravenna (Italy) are monitored using Advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (A-DInSAR) techniques. In particular, the exploitation of the new Sentinel-1A SAR data allowed us to extend the monitoring period till 2016, giving a better understanding of the temporal evolution of the phenomenon in the area. Two statistical approaches are applied to fully exploit the informative potential of the A-DInSAR results in a fast and systematic way. Thanks to the applied analyses, we described the behavior of the subsidence during the monitored period along with the relationship between the occurrence of the displacement and its main driving factors.

TI  - Mapping trees in high resolution imagery across large areas using locally variable thresholds guided by medium resolution tree maps
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Large area tree maps, important for environmental monitoring and natural resource management, are often based on medium resolution satellite imagery. These data have difficulty in detecting trees in fragmented woodlands, and have significant omission errors in modified agricultural areas. High resolution imagery can better detect these trees, however, as most high resolution imagery is not normalised it is difficult to automate a tree classification method over large areas. The method developed here used an existing medium resolution map derived from either Landsat or SPOTS satellite imagery to guide the classification of the high resolution imagery. It selected a spatially-variable threshold on the green band, calculated based on the spatially-variable percentage of trees in the existing map of tree cover. The green band proved more consistent at classifying trees across different images than several common band combinations. The method was tested on 0.5 m resolution imagery from airborne digital sensor (ADS) imagery across New South Wales (NSW), Australia using both Landsat and SPOT5 derived tree maps to guide the threshold selection. Accuracy was assessed across 6 large image mosaics revealing a more accurate result when the more accurate tree map from SPOT5 imagery was used. The resulting maps achieved an overall accuracy with 95% confidence intervals of 93% (90-95%), while the overall accuracy of the previous SPOT5 tree map was 87% (86-89%). The method reduced omission errors by mapping more scattered trees, although it did increase commission errors caused by dark pixels from water, building shadows, topographic shadows, and some soils and crops. The method allows trees to be automatically mapped at 5 m resolution from high resolution imagery, provided a medium resolution tree map already exists. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cloud detection algorithm comparison and validation for operational Landsat data products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are a pervasive and unavoidable issue in satellite-borne optical imagery. Accurate, well-documented, and automated cloud detection algorithms are necessary to effectively leverage large collections of remotely sensed data. The Landsat project is uniquely suited for comparative validation of cloud assessment algorithms because the modular architecture of the Landsat ground system allows for quick evaluation of new code, and because Landsat has the most comprehensive manual truth masks of any current satellite data archive. Currently, the Landsat Level-1 Product Generation System (LPGS) uses separate algorithms for determining clouds, cirrus clouds, and snow and/or ice probability on a per-pixel basis. With more bands onboard the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/rhermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) satellite, and a greater number of cloud masking algorithms, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is replacing the current cloud masking workflow with a more robust algorithm that is capable of working across multiple Landsat sensors with minimal modification. Because of the inherent error from stray light and intermittent data availability of TIRS, these algorithms need to operate both with and without thermal data. In this study, we created a workflow to evaluate cloud and cloud shadow masking algorithms using cloud validation masks manually derived from both Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) and Landsat 8 OLI/FIRS data. We created a new validation dataset consisting of 96 Landsat 8 scenes, representing different biomes and proportions of cloud cover. We evaluated algorithm performance by overall accuracy, omission error, and commission error for both cloud and cloud shadow. We found that CFMask, C code based on the Function of Mask (Fmask) algorithm, and its confidence bands have the best overall accuracy among the many algorithms tested using our validation data. The Artificial Thermal-Automated Cloud Cover Algorithm (AT-ACCA) is the most accurate nonthermal-based algorithm. We give preference to CFMask for operational cloud and cloud shadow detection, as it is derived from a priori knowledge of physical phenomena and is operable without geographic restriction, making it useful for current and future land imaging missions without having to be retrained in a machine-learning environment.

TI  - Analysis and Prediction of Changes in Coastline Morphology in the Bohai Sea, China, Using Remote Sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline change reflects the dynamics of natural processes and human activity, and influences the ecology and environment of the coastal strip. This study researched the change in coastline and sea area of the Bohai Sea, China, over a 30-year period using Landsat TM and OLI remote sensing data. The total change in coastline length, sea area, and the centroid of the sea surface were quantified. Variations in the coastline morphology were measured using four shape indexes: fractal dimension, compact ratio, circularity, and square degree. Equations describing fit of the shape index, coastline length, and marine area were built. Then the marine area 10 years later was predicted using the model that had the highest prediction accuracy. The results showed that the highest prediction accuracy for the coastline length was obtained using a compound function. When a cubic function was used to predict the compact ratio, then the highest prediction accuracy was obtained using this compact ratio and a quadratic function to predict sea area. This study can provide theoretical support for the coastal development planning and ecological environment protection around the Bohai Sea.

TI  - Identification of genetic variants affecting vitamin D receptor binding and associations with autoimmune disease
T2  - HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large numbers of statistically significant associations between sentinel SNPs and case-control status have been replicated by genome-wide association studies. Nevertheless, few underlying molecular mechanisms of complex disease are currently known. We investigated whether variation in binding of a transcription factor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), whose activating ligand vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable factor in multiple disorders, could explain any of these associations. VDR modifies gene expression by binding DNA as a heterodimer with the Retinoid X receptor (RXR). We identified 43,332 genetic variants significantly associated with altered VDR binding affinity (VDR-BVs) using a high-resolution (ChIP-exo) genome-wide analysis of 27 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines. VDR-BVs are enriched in consensus RXR:: VDR binding motifs, yet most fell outside of these motifs, implying that genetic variation often affects the binding affinity only indirectly. Finally, we compared 341 VDR-BVs replicating by position in multiple individuals against background sets of variants lying within VDR-binding regions that had been matched in allele frequency and were independent with respect to linkage disequilibrium. In this stringent test, these replicated VDR-BVs were significantly (q < 0.1) and substantially (> 2-fold) enriched in genomic intervals associated with autoimmune and other diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The approach's validity is underscored by RXR::VDR motif sequence being predictive of binding strength and being evolutionarily constrained. Our findings are consistent with altered RXR::VDR binding contributing to immunity-related diseases. Replicated VDR-BVs associated with these disorders could represent causal disease risk alleles whose effect may be modifiable by vitamin D levels.

TI  - DART: Recent Advances in Remote Sensing Data Modeling With Atmosphere, Polarization, and Chlorophyll Fluorescence
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the life-essential cycles and processes of our planet and to further develop remote sensing (RS) technology, there is an increasing need for models that simulate the radiative budget (RB) and RS acquisitions of urban and natural landscapes using physical approaches and considering the three-dimensional (3-D) architecture of Earth surfaces. Discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) is one of the most comprehensive physically based 3-D models of Earth-atmosphere radiative transfer, covering the spectral domain from ultraviolet to thermal infrared wavelengths. It simulates the optical 3-D RB and optical signals of proximal, aerial, and satellite imaging spectrometers and laser scanners, for any urban and/or natural landscapes and for any experimental and instrumental configurations. It is freely available for research and teaching activities. In this paper, we briefly introduce DART theory and present recent advances in simulated sensors (LiDAR and cameras with finite field of view) and modeling mechanisms (atmosphere, specular reflectance with polarization and chlorophyll fluorescence). A case study demonstrating a novel application of DART to investigate urban landscapes is also presented.

TI  - The Potential of TerraSAR-X to Observe Wind Wave Interaction at the Ice Edge
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper performs a study on sea state and wind fields at the ice edge boundary by utilizing information from different sources including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery, weather and sea state analyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, shipborne in-situ measurements, and AMSR2 ice charts. The basis is a Stripmap scene from the TerraSAR-X satellite acquired on October 18, 2015, at similar to 18 UTC, in support of the cruise of the research vessel R/V Sikuliaq in the Beaufort/Chukchi Sea. This scene covers an area with a length of more than 100 km and comprises both the marginal ice zone and, for the largest part, open water. The wave and wind field is retrieved from satellite at high spatial resolution using empirical retrieval algorithms. These algorithms are XWAVE and XMOD-2 specifically developed for X-Band SAR. XWAVE allows for determining the significant wave height not only for long swell waves, but also for short waves with their wave pattern being hardly visible from SAR. The latter is based on the analysis of image spectrum parameters and spectral noise. As well, the possibility of the imaging quality of longer waves visible from SAR being affected by SAR-specific nonlinear imaging effects is narrowed down. Both the wave and wind field are found to exhibit considerable spatial variability, and their relationship is analyzed. The relevance of the findings of this study with respect to wave/ice modeling is discussed.

TI  - A Conceptual Model for Delineating Land Management Units (LMUs) Using Geographical Object-Based Image Analysis
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land management and planning is crucial for present and future use of land and the sustainability of land resources. Physical, biological and cultural characteristics of land can be used to define Land Management Units (LMUs) that aid in decision making for managing land and communicating information between different research and application domains. This study aims to describe the classification of ecologically relevant land units that are suitable for land management, planning and conservation purposes. Relying on the idea of strong correlation between landform and potential landcover, a conceptual model for creating Land Management Units (LMUs) from topographic data and biophysical information is presented. The proposed method employs a multi-level object-based classification of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) to derive landform units. The sensitivity of landform units to changes in segmentation scale is examined, and the outcome of the landform classification is evaluated. Landform classes are then aggregated with landcover information to produce ecologically relevant landform/landcover assemblages. These conceptual units that constitute a framework of connected entities are finally enriched given available socio-economic information e.g., land use, ownership, protection status, etc. to generate LMUs. LMUs attached to a geographic database enable the retrieval of information at various levels to support decision making for land management at various scales. LMUs that are created present a basis for conservation and management in a biodiverse area in the Black Sea region of Turkey.

TI  - Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Fusion Using Extinction Profiles and Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a novel framework for the fusion of hyperspectral and light detection and ranging-derived rasterized data using extinction profiles (EPs) and deep learning. In order to extract spatial and elevation information from both the sources, EPs that include different attributes (e.g., height, area, volume, diagonal of the bounding box, and standard deviation) are taken into account. Then, the derived features are fused via either feature stacking or graph-based feature fusion. Finally, the fused features are fed to a deep learning-based classifier (convolutional neural network with logistic regression) to ultimately produce the classification map. The proposed approach is applied to two datasets acquired in Houston, TX, USA, and Trento, Italy. Results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve accurate classification results compared to other approaches. It should be noted that, in this paper, the concept of deep learning has been used for the first time to fuse LiDAR and hyperspectral features, which provides new opportunities for further research.

T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The emergence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins represents a major concern globally. The aim of this study was to examine the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of N. gonorrhoeae isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime in Argentina.Methods A total of 1987 isolates were collected during 2009 and 2013. The susceptibility to penicillin G, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin was determined using the agar dilution method. The major extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance determinants (penA, mtrR, and porB1b) were sequenced in 42 N. gonorrhoeae isolates that showed decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], 0.06-0.125 mg/L) and cefixime (MIC, 0.125-0.25 mg/L). Genotyping by N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) was performed.Results Between 2009 and 2013, there was a shift in the modal MICs for ceftriaxone. Among the 42 isolates exhibiting decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime, 95.2% were resistant to penicillin G, 95.2% to tetracycline, 97.6% to ciprofloxacin, and 33.3% to azithromycin. Thirty-five (83.3%) of the 42 isolates had a mosaic penA allele XXXIV, which has been previously associated with resistance to ceftriaxone and cefixime as well as treatment failures. The isolates that contained the mosaic penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2) XXXIV were associated with NG-MAST ST1407 or closely related genotypes.Conclusions In Argentina, N. gonorrhoeae isolates with decreased susceptibility to cefixime and ceftriaxone have now emerged, mostly due to the introduction of the internationally spread multidrug-resistant NG-MAST ST1407.

TI  - Detection and molecular diversity of <i>Giardia duodenalis</i> and <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. in sheltered dogs and cats in Northern Spain
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Domestic dogs and cats may act as natural reservoirs of a large number of zoonotic pathogens, including the enteric parasites Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp., the most relevant protozoan species causing gastrointestinal disease worldwide. A cross-sectional epidemiological study aiming to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. was conducted in an animal rescue centre in the province of Alava (Northern Spain). A total of 194 and 65 faecal dropping samples from individual dogs and cats, respectively, were collected between November 2013 and June 2016. G. duodenalis cysts and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected by direct fluorescence microscopy and PCR-based methods targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of these parasites.Overall, G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in 33% (63/194) and 4.1% (8/194) of dogs, and 9.2% (6/65) and 4.6% (3/65) of cats, respectively. G. duodenalis and Cryptosporidium co-infections were observed in 1.5% (3/194) of dogs, but not in cats. No significant differences in infection rates could be demonstrated among dogs or cats according to their sex, age group, status, or geographical origin. Multi-locus sequence-based genotyping of the glutamate dehydrogenase and beta-giardin genes of G. duodenalis allowed the characterization of 19 canine isolates that were unambiguously assigned to sub-assemblages All (n = 7), BIII (n = 1), and BIV (n = 7), and assemblages C (n = 3) and D (n = 1). Two feline isolates were genotyped as assemblages A and F, respectively. No mixed assemblage or sub-assemblage infections were identified. C. canis (n = 5) and C. hominis (n = 1) were the Cryptosporidium species found in dogs, whereas C. felis (n = 1) was identified in cats. The finding of G. duodenalis sub-assemblages AII, BIII, and BIV circulating in dogs (but not cats) may have zoonotic potential, although most of the All and BIV isolates sub-genotyped corresponded to genetic variants not previously found in Spanish human populations. Dogs may also act as novel suitable hosts for C. hominis. We recommend to considerer companion animals as sentinel surveillance system for zoonotic giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis in order to minimize the risk of spreading of these parasitic diseases among the human population.

TI  - Municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent-induced effects on freshwater mussel populations and the role of mussel refugia in recolonizing an extirpated reach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global human population and urbanization continually increase the volume of wastewater entering aquatic environments. Despite efforts to treat these effluents, they contribute a diverse suite of substances that enter watersheds at concentrations that have the potential to elicit adverse effects on aquatic organisms. The relationship between wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent exposure and biological responses within aquatic ecosystems remains poorly understood, especially at the population level. To examine the effect of WWTP effluents on sentinel invertebrates, freshwater mussels were assessed in the Grand River, Ontario, in populations associated with the outfall of a major WWTP. This watershed, within the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, has a diverse community of twenty-five species of mussels, including nine Species at Risk, and is representative of many habitats that receive WWTP effluents regionally as well as globally. Surveys were conducted to assess the presence and species richness of freshwater mussels. In total, 55 sites downstream of the WWTP were examined using timed visual searches with one or 2 h of effort spent searching 100 m segments. Although seven species of mussels were found in moderate abundance (mean of 8 mussels per hour of searching across 2 sites) upstream of the WWTP outfall, no live mussels were observed for 7.0 km downstream of the WWTP. Long-term water quality monitoring data indicate that ammonia and nitrite concentrations along with large seasonal declines in diel dissolved oxygen were associated with the extirpation of mussels downstream of the WWTP. The first live mussels found downstream were below the confluence with a major tributary indicating that in addition to an improvement in water quality to a state that enables mussels (and/or their fish hosts) to survive, a nearby mussel refuge may have facilitated the recolonization of the depauperate WWTP-impacted zone.

TI  - Utility of single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography for sentinel lymph node localization in breast cancer patients
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesSentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is currently a routine technique in breast cancer management and preoperative scintigraphic imaging plays a crucial role in the process of SLN detection. The guidelines recommend performing planar acquisition and optional single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging. The aim of this study was to verify whether routine performing of SPECT/CT in addition to planar imaging increases the sensitivity of SLN detection in patients with early-stage breast cancer. The secondary aims were to compare radionuclide SLN imaging with intraoperative SLN detection and identify clinical and histopathological factors affecting the SLN detection rate.Materials and methodsA total of 153 early-stage breast cancer patients underwent lymph node scintigraphy in the years 2007-2013. Breast cancer patients with staging T1-2N0M0 were included. Planar and SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy were performed on the day before the surgery. The data on presence or absence of SLN, their number and localization were recorded for both methods and compared with each other as well as with intraoperative blue dye staining and histopathological findings.ResultsSPECT/CT identified SLN in 119/153 and planar scintigraphy in 114/153 patients. Identification rates were 77.7 and 74.5%, respectively. Intraoperative lymph node assessment identified SLN in 76/126 cases with an identification rate of 60.3%. Identification rates for second echelon lymph node were 34.6% for hybrid imaging and 21.2% for planar scintigraphy. Statistical analysis did not yield a significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between these methods; however, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that SPECT/CT significantly increases SLN identification rate compared with planar scintigraphy and intraoperative detection. Histopathological examination of excised SLN showed that 22 nodes were metastatic. SPECT/CT visualized all of these, whereas planar imaging and intraoperative lymph node detection procedure visualized 19 and 18, respectively. No clinical and histopathological factors affecting SLN detection rate were identified.ConclusionHybrid SPECT/CT lymphatic mapping yields a high SLN detection rate in patients with early-stage breast cancer and provides lymph node localization details. It identifies more SLN than planar imaging and intraoperative SLN detection. However, its limited superiority over the remaining two methods does not support its routine use for SLN localization. We suggest using SPECT/CT for SLN detection in case of equivocal planar imaging results.

TI  - REPURPOSING THE STARS: MANILIUS, <i>ASTRONOMICA</i> 1, AND THE ARATEAN TRADITION
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article argues that the structure of Astronomica 1 is based on Aratus' Phaenomena and the Latin Aratea. Manilius' text, of course, addresses numerous topics unknown to the Aratean tradition and promotes an astrological worldview foreign to Aratus. By enthusiastically incorporating non-Aratean material into his Aratean book and repurposing the framework and language of the Aratean tradition, Manilius composes a "Hyper-Aratea" that implicitly critiques the value and outlook of figures like Aratus, Cicero, and Vergil. This maneuver contributes to Manilins' self-representation as a literary Phaethon who sets fire to the Aratean heavens, and reveals the contention surrounding Aratus at Rome.

TI  - Approach for estimating the dynamic physical thresholds of phytoplankton production and biomass in the tropical-subtropical Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Threshold is defined as the point where small changes in an environmental driver produce large responses in the ecosystem. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to estimate the thresholds and contribution of key dynamic physical variables in terms of phytoplankton production and variations in biomass in the tropical-subtropical Pacific Ocean off Mexico. The statistical approach used here showed that thresholds were shallower for primary production than for phytoplankton biomass (pycnocline < 68 m and mixed layer < 30 m versus pycnocline < 45 m and mixed layer < 80 m) but were similar for absolute dynamic topography and Ekman pumping (ADT < 59 cm and EkP > 0 cm d(-1) versus ADT < 60 cm and EkP > 4 cm d(-1)). The relatively high productivity on seasonal (spring) and interannual (La Nina 2008) scales was linked to low ADT (45-60 cm) and shallow pycnocline depth (9-68 m) and mixed layer (8-40 m). Statistical estimations from satellite data indicated that the contributions of ocean circulation to phytoplankton variability were 18% (for phytoplankton biomass) and 46% (for phytoplankton production). Although the statistical contribution of models constructed with in situ integrated chlorophyll a and primary production data was lower than the one obtained with satellite data (11%), the fits were better for the former, based on the residual distribution. The results reported here suggest that estimated thresholds may reliably explain the spatial-temporal variations of phytoplankton in the tropical-subtropical Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico.

TI  - A machine learning approach to the potential-field method for implicit modeling of geological structures
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Implicit modeling has experienced a rise in popularity over the last decade due to its advantages in terms of speed and reproducibility in comparison with manual digitization of geological structures. The potential-field method consists in interpolating a scalar function that indicates to which side of a geological boundary a given point belongs to, based on cokriging of point data and structural orientations. This work proposes a vector potential-field solution from a machine learning perspective, recasting the problem as multi-class classification, which alleviates some of the original method's assumptions. The potentials related to each geological class are interpreted in a compositional data framework. Variogram modeling is avoided through the use of maximum likelihood to train the model, and an uncertainty measure is introduced. The methodology was applied to the modeling of a sample dataset provided with the software Move(TM). The calculations were implemented in the R language and 3D visualizations were prepared with the rgl package.

TI  - Ten-year survey of cyanobacterial blooms in Ohio's waterbodies using satellite remote sensing
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms are on the rise globally and are capable of adversely impacting human, animal, and ecosystem health. Blooms dominated by cyanobacteria species capable of toxin-production are commonly observed in eutrophic freshwater. The presence of cyanobacterial blooms in selected Ohio lakes, such as Lake Erie and Grand Lake St. Marys, has been well studied, but much less is known about the geographic distribution of these blooms across all of Ohio's waterbodies. We examined the geographic distribution of cyanobacterial blooms in Ohio's waterbodies from 2002 to 2011, using a nested semi empirical algorithm and remotely sensed data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard the European Space Agency's Envisat. We identified: 62 lakes, reservoirs, and ponds; 7 rivers; 6 marshes and wetlands; and 3 quarries with detectable cyanobacteria pigment (phycocyanin) concentrations. Of the 78 waterbodies identified in our study, roughly half (54%; n = 42) have any reported in situ microcystins monitoring results from state monitoring programs. Further, 90% of the waterbodies identified reached phycocyanin pigment concentrations representative of levels potentially hazardous to public health. This gap in lakes potentially impacted by cyanobacterial blooms and those that are currently monitored presents an important area of concern for public health, as well as ecosystem health, where unknown human and animal exposures to cyanotoxins may occur in many of Ohio's waterbodies. Our approach may be replicated in other regions around the globe with potential cyanobacterial bloom presence, in order to assess the intensity, geographic distribution, and temporal pattern of blooms in lakes not currently monitored for the presence of cyanobacterial blooms.

TI  - Religiosity: Its Impact on Coping Styles Among Women Undergoing Fertility Treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Israeli worldview places great significance on childbearing. This could create emotional and ethical difficulties for women coping with fertility issues in addition to their treatments. This study examined the relations between coping strategies and level of religiosity in 159 women undergoing infertility treatment. Statistically significant relations were found between the problem-solving coping style and religious observance (p < 0.01) and religious beliefs (p < 0.05). An inverse correlation was found between the emotional coping style and religious beliefs (p < 0.001). Health professionals should recognize the patient's coping styles and understand the patient's religious belief system as part of an ongoing fertility treatment.

TI  - Quantitative Evaluation of the Feature Space Transformation Methods Used for Applications of Visual Semantic Clustering of EO Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data visualization guides the process of indexing and retrieval, strengthening the link between low-level image features and high-level human understanding of image content. In this regard, we have described the semantic content of a multidimensional dataset using its descriptors to derive high-dimensional feature spaces. The dimensionality of these spaces is further reduced to three in order to provide a three-dimensional (3-D) representation of the dataset items. Our main challenge was to identify the transformation that projects the high-dimensional feature set into a 3-D space preserving its semantic content. To overcome this issue, we have compared the efficiency of 11 feature space transformations: one feature selection algorithm and ten dimensionality reduction methods. As long as the dataset properties, during mapping, may differ depending on the chosen algorithm, the performance comparison of multiple algorithms is a difficult task. Therefore, three quantitative measures have been used: "Trustworthiness," "Continuity," and "QNX"-the number of points preserved in data neighborhoods over projection. The mapping algorithms have been applied to three remote sensing datasets achieved from different sensors: LANDSAT 7 ETM+ and WorldView-3.

TI  - A Method of Panchromatic Image Modification for Satellite Imagery Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The standard ratio of spatial resolution between bands for high resolution satellites is 1:4, which is typical when combining images obtained from the same sensor. However, the cost of simultaneously purchasing a set of panchromatic and multispectral images is still relatively high. There is therefore a need to develop methods of data fusion of very high resolution panchromatic imagery with low-cost multispectral data (e.g., Landsat). Combining high resolution images with low resolution images broadens the scope of use of satellite data, however, it is also accompanied by the problem of a large ratio between spatial resolutions, which results in large spectral distortions in the merged images. The authors propose a modification of the panchromatic image in such a way that it includes the spectral and spatial information from both the panchromatic and multispectral images to improve the quality of spectral data integration. This fusion is done based on a weighted average. The weight is determined using a coefficient, which determines the ratio of the amount of information contained in the corresponding pixels of the integrated images. The effectiveness of the author's algorithm had been tested for six of the most popular fusion methods. The proposed methodology is ideal mainly for statistical and numerical methods, especially Principal Component Analysis and Gram-Schmidt. The author's algorithm makes it possible to lower the root mean square error by up to 20% for the Principal Component Analysis. The spectral quality was also increased, especially for the spectral bands extending beyond the panchromatic image, where the correlation rose by 18% for the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.

TI  - Intraoperative Assessment of Tumor Resection Margins in Breast-Conserving Surgery Using <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging: A First-in-Human Feasibility Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In early-stage breast cancer, the primary treatment option for most women is breast-conserving surgery (BCS). There is a clear need for more accurate techniques to assess resection margins intraoperatively, because on average 20% of patients require further surgery to achieve clear margins. Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) combines optical and molecular imaging by detecting light emitted by F-18-FDG. Its high-resolution and small size imaging equipment make CLI a promising technology for intraoperative margin assessment. A first-in-human study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of F-18-FDG CLI for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in BCS. Methods: Twenty-two patients with invasive breast cancer received F-18-FDG (5 MBq/kg) 45-60 min before surgery. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed using an increased Tc-99m-nanocolloid activity of 150 MBq to facilitate nodal detection against the gamma-probe background signal (cross-talk) from F-18-FDG. The cross-talk and Tc-99m dose required was evaluated in 2 lead-in studies. Immediately after excision, specimens were imaged intraoperatively in an investigational CLI system. The first 10 patients were used to optimize the imaging protocol; the remaining 12 patients were included in the analysis dataset. Cerenkov luminescence images from incised BCS specimens were analyzed postoperatively by 2 surgeons blinded to the histopathology results, and mean radiance and margin distance were measured. The agreement between margin distance on CLI and histopathology was assessed. Radiation doses to staff were measured.Results: Ten of the 12 patients had an elevated tumor radiance on CLI. Mean radiance and tumor-to-background ratio were 560 6 160 photons/s/cm(2)/sr and 2.41 +/- 0.54, respectively. All 15 assessable margins were clear on CLI and histopathology. The agreement in margin distance and interrater agreement was good (kappa = 0.81 and 0.912, respectively). Sentinel lymph nodes were successfully detected in all patients. The radiation dose to staff was low; surgeons received a mean dose of 34 6 15 mu Sv per procedure. Conclusion: Intraoperative F-18-FDG CLI is a promising, low-risk technique for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in BCS. A randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of this technique on reexcision rates.

TI  - An Initiative to Improve the Quality of Care of Infants With Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome
T2  - PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), a constellation of neurologic, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal disturbances associated with opioid withdrawal, has increased dramatically and is associated with long hospital stays. At our institution, the average length of stay (ALOS) for infants exposed to methadone in utero was 22.4 days before the start of our project. We aimed to reduce ALOS for infants with NAS by 50%.METHODS: In 2010, a multidisciplinary team began several plan-do-study-act cycles at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital. Key interventions included standardization of nonpharmacologic care coupled with an empowering message to parents, development of a novel approach to assessment, administration of morphine on an as-needed basis, and transfer of infants directly to the inpatient unit, bypassing the NICU. The outcome measures included ALOS, morphine use, and hospital costs using statistical process control charts.RESULTS: There were 287 infants in our project, including 55 from the baseline period (January 2008 to February 2010) and 44 from the postimplementation period (May 2015 to June 2016). ALOS decreased from 22.4 to 5.9 days. Proportions of methadone-exposed infants treated with morphine decreased from 98% to 14%; costs decreased from $44824 to $10289. No infants were readmitted for treatment of NAS and no adverse events were reported.CONCLUSIONS: Interventions focused on nonpharmacologic therapies and a simplified approach to assessment for infants exposed to methadone in utero led to both substantial and sustained decreases in ALOS, the proportion of infants treated with morphine, and hospital costs with no adverse events.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on historical/Xam and recent Kalahari San (Bushmen) sources, the paper examines an aspect of San hunting that is underreported in the ethnography on these hunter-gatherers (as opposed to other such peoples elsewhere in the world, specifically in the context of the New Animism paradigm): its relational and mystical i.e. myth-, spirit- and ritual-informed aspect. I show how myth and ritual express the animistic theme of human-animal identity blurring that is at the core of San cosmology, in different, mutually reinforcing ways, so that it becomes both an integrated, salient feature of San worldview something of a philosophical postulate and integral to and constitutive of experience. The latter includes the practice of hunting, the focus of this paper. Also examined are the reasons why in San studies the supererogatory aspect can be, and has been, overlooked by anthropologists and archaeologists.

TI  - Turbulence Measurements from Five-Beam Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two new five-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers-the Nortek Signature1000 AD2CP and the Teledyne RDI Sentinel V50-are demonstrated to measure turbulence at two energetic tidal channels within Puget Sound, Washington. The quality of the raw data is tested by analyzing the turbulent kinetic energy frequency spectra, the turbulence spatial structure function, the shear in the profiles, and the covariance Reynolds stresses. The five-beam configuration allows for a direct estimation of the Reynolds stresses from along-beam velocity fluctuations. The Nortek's low Doppler noise and high sampling frequency allow for the observation of the turbulent inertial subrange in both the frequency spectra and the turbulence structure function. The turbulence parameters obtained from the five-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers are validated with turbulence data from simultaneous measurements with acoustic Doppler velocimeters. These combined results are then used to assess a turbulent kinetic energy budget in which depth profiles of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and production rates are compared. The associated codes are publicly available on the MATLAB File Exchange website.

Here it has been applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection-5 and collection-6 cloud products, resulting in a value-added dataset that contains adjusted distributions of cloud liquid water path for more than 10 years for marine liquid cloud for both Aqua and Terra. This method adjusts horizontal distributions of cloud optical properties to be more consistent with observed visible reflectance and is especially useful in areas where cloud optical retrievals fail or are considered to be of low quality. Potential uses of this dataset include validation of climate and radiative transfer models and facilitation of studies that intercompare satellite records. Results show that the fit method is able to reduce bias between observed visible reflectance and that derived from optical retrievals by up to an average improvement of 3%. The level of improvement is dependent on several factors, including seasonality, viewing geometry, cloud fraction, and cloud heterogeneity. Applications of this dataset are explored through a satellite intercomparison with PATMOS-x and Global Change Observation Mission-First Water (GCOM-W1; "SHIZUKU'') AMSR-2 and use of a Monte Carlo radiative transfer model. From the 3D Monte Carlo model simulations, albedo biases are found when the method is applied, with seasonal averages that range over 0.02-0.06.

TI  - Satellite Monitoring the Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of Desertification in Response to Climate Change and Human Activities across the Ordos Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ordos Plateau, a typical semi-arid area in northern China, has experienced severe wind erosion events that have stripped the agriculturally important finer fraction of the topsoil and caused dust events that often impact the air quality in northern China and the surrounding regions. Both climate change and human activities have been considered key factors in the desertification process. This study used multi-spectral Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing data collected in 2000, 2006, 2010 and 2015 to generate a temporal series of the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), bare soil index (BSI) and albedo products in the Ordos Plateau. Based on these satellite products and the decision tree method, we quantitatively assessed the desertification status over the past 15 years since 2000. Furthermore, a quantitative method was used to assess the roles of driving forces in desertification dynamics using net primary productivity (NPP) as a commensurable indicator. The results showed that the area of non-desertification land increased from 6647 km(2) in 2000 to 15,961 km(2) in 2015, while the area of severe desertification land decreased from 16,161 km(2) in 2000 to 8,331 km(2) in 2015. During the period 2006-2015, the effect of human activities, especially the ecological recovery projects implemented in northern China, was the main cause of desertification reversion in this region. Therefore, ecological recovery projects are still required to promote harmonious development between nature and human society in ecologically fragile regions like the Ordos Plateau.

TI  - In-Orbit Spectral Response Function Correction and Its Impact on Operational Calibration for the Long-Wave Split-Window Infrared Band (12.0 μm) of FY-2G Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the early stage of the G satellite of the Fengyun-2 series (FY-2G), severe cold biases up to similar to 2.3 K occur in its measurements in the 12.0 mu m (IR2) band, which demonstrate time-and scene-dependent characteristics. Similar cold biases in water vapor and carbon dioxide absorption bands of other satellites are considered to be caused by either ice contamination (physical method) or spectral response function (SRF) shift (empirical method). Simulations indicate that this cold bias of FY-2G indeed suffers from equivalent SRF shift as a whole towards the longer wavelength direction. To overcome it, a novel approach combining both physical and empirical methods is proposed. With the possible ice thicknesses tested before launch, the ice contamination effect is alleviated, while the shape of the SRF can be modified in a physical way. The remaining unknown factors for cold bias are removed by shifting the convolved SRF with an ice transmittance spectrum. Two parameters, i.e., the ice thickness (5 mu m) and the shifted value (+0.15 mu m), are estimated by inter-calibration with reference instruments, and the modification coefficient is also calculated (0.9885) for the onboard blackbody calibration. Meanwhile, the updated SRF was released online on 23 March 2016. For the period between July 2015 and December 2016, the monthly biases of the FY-2G IR2 band remain oscillating around zero, the majorities (similar to 89%) of which are within +/- 1.0 K, while its mean monthly absolute bias is around 0.6 K. Nevertheless, the cold bias phenomenon of the IR2 band no longer exists. The combination method can be referred by other corrections for cold biases.

TI  - Comparison and Evaluation of Annual NDVI Time Series in China Derived from the NOAA AVHRR LTDR and Terra MODIS MOD13C1 Products
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from multiple satellite sensors are crucial data to study vegetation dynamics. The Land Long Term Data Record Version 4 (LTDR V4) NDVI dataset was recently released at a 0.05 x 0.05 degrees spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution. In this study, annual NDVI time series that are composited by the LTDR V4 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI datasets (MOD13C1) are compared and evaluated for the period from 2001 to 2014 in China. The spatial patterns of the NDVI generally match between the LTDR V4 and MOD13C1 datasets. The transitional zone between high and low NDVI values generally matches the boundary of semi-arid and sub-humid regions. A significant and high coefficient of determination is found between the two datasets according to a pixel-based correlation analysis. The spatially averaged NDVI of LTDR V4 is characterized by a much weaker positive regression slope relative to that of the spatially averaged NDVI of the MOD13C1 dataset because of changes in NOAA AVHRR sensors between 2005 and 2006. The measured NDVI values of LTDR V4 were always higher than that of MOD13C1 in western China due to the relatively lower atmospheric water vapor content in western China, and opposite observation appeared in eastern China. In total, 18.54% of the LTDR V4 NDVI pixels exhibit significant trends, whereas 35.79% of the MOD13C1 NDVI pixels show significant trends. Good agreement is observed between the significant trends of the two datasets in the Northeast Plain, Bohai Economic Rim, Loess Plateau, and Yangtze River Delta. By contrast, the datasets contrasted in northwestern desert regions and southern China. A trend analysis of the regression slope values according to the vegetation type shows good agreement between the LTDR V4 and MOD13C1 datasets. This study demonstrates the spatial and temporal consistencies and discrepancies between the AVHRR LTDR and MODIS MOD13C1 NDVI products in China, which could provide useful information for the choice of NDVI products in subsequent studies of vegetation dynamics.

TI  - River recharge sources and the partitioning of catchment evapotranspiration fluxes as revealed by stable isotope signals in a typical high-elevation arid catchment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Catchment-scale hydrological cycles are expected to suffer more extremes under a background of climate change. Quantifying hydrological changes in high and remote areas is practically challenging. However, stable isotopes in river water can be seen to vary, dependent upon the combined influence exerted by recharge sources and local climatic conditions; the study of river water stable isotopes can therefore provide a meaningful method for delineating catchment-scale hydrological studies. In this study, we present high-resolution time series of river delta C-18 and d-excess values; additionally, we identify the seasonal dynamics of river recharge sources and major components of the catchment-scale water balance, together with precipitation and groundwater isotopes, and concurrent meteorological data recorded in Magazangbu catchment on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau (TP). Using isotopic analysis, and within a proportional framework, we partitioned the isotopic fractionation (El) or non-fractionation (E2) from soil evaporation fluxes (E-soil) apparent in different processes, using NDVI (Normal Differential Vegetation Index) data collected by MODIS satellites to calculate the vegetation fractional coverage (VFC), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) records to determine evapotranspiration data (ET). Finally, the contributions made by each ET component (E-soil and plant transpiration) to total catchment ET were computed for the high and remote northwestern TP. Our results show that: (1) river 8180 values were high in summer and low in winter, while d-excess values displayed a contrary seasonal cycle; (2) for the monsoon period, precipitation contributed 60.6% to Magazangbu catchment runoff. Deeper groundwater was the main water source for the winter low base flow, and shallow groundwater or high elevation snowmelt was the principal component of the spring thaw and autumn freezing periods; and (3) a substantial proportion of E-soil (96.4% annually; 92.2% during monsoon) was consumed without isotopic fractionation (E2); plant transpiration (T) constituted less than half of total ET (41% annually, 29% during monsoon) in Magazangbu catchment. This calculation of river recharge sources and partitioning of catchment ET components using isotopic signals and MODIS NDVI data or GLDAS ET data provide new methods for hydrological studies in high and remote areas. These results provide important catchment-scale water-balance information which is very useful to climate models conducted in a high-elevation arid environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Extraction and accuracy assessment of high-resolution DEM and derived orthoimages from ALOS-PRISM data over Sahel-Doukkala (Morocco)
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Sahel-Doukkala, which is characterized by lands of a relatively low relief, global DEMs and DEMs generated from digitizing topographic maps, have been the primary source of several multidisciplinary researches. Although these products present a great value of the conducted research, the level of the given accuracy is not sufficient enough for detailed geospatial analysis. These requirements led us to generate a high-resolution DEM as an alternative of available global DEMs or/and DEMs generated from digitizing topographic maps. In this study, we present a workflow to extract high-resolution DEM at 5 m resolution and derived orthoimages from ALOS-PRISM data over Sahel-Doukkala, through photogrammetric techniques, using a variation of GCPs obtained from topographic maps at scale 1:25,000. The accuracy of the generated products is reported according to NSSDA standards. Using ten GCPs, a PRISM-DEM with 3.88 m vertical accuracy and 11.60 m horizontal accuracy, both at 95% confidence level is obtained. This DEM will serve as base dataset for further detailed geospatial analysis and mapping applications in order to identify the relationship between surface parameters and groundwater, and also to assess and understand all factors influencing the development of karst landscapes and consequently subsurface stability in the investigated area.

TI  - Using Space-Time Features to Improve Detection of Forest Disturbances from Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current research on forest change monitoring using medium spatial resolution Landsat satellite data aims for accurate and timely detection of forest disturbances. However, producing forest disturbance maps that have both high spatial and temporal accuracy is still challenging because of the trade-off between spatial and temporal accuracy. Timely detection of forest disturbance is often accompanied by many false detections, and existing approaches for reducing false detections either compromise the temporal accuracy or amplify the omission error for forest disturbances. Here, we propose to use a set of space-time features to reduce false detections. We first detect potential forest disturbances in the Landsat time series based on two consecutive negative anomalies, and subsequently use space-time features to confirm forest disturbances. A probability threshold is used to discriminate false detections from forest disturbances. We demonstrated this approach in the UNESCO Kafa Biosphere Reserve located in the southwest of Ethiopia by detecting forest disturbances between 2014 and 2016. Our results show that false detections are reduced significantly without compromising temporal accuracy. The user's accuracy was at least 26% higher than the user's accuracies obtained when using only temporal information (e.g., two consecutive negative anomalies) to confirm forest disturbances. We found the space-time features related to change in spatio-temporal variability, and spatio-temporal association with non-forest areas, to be the main predictors for forest disturbance. The magnitude of change and two consecutive negative anomalies, which are widely used to distinguish real changes from false detections, were not the main predictors for forest disturbance. Overall, our findings indicate that using a set of space-time features to confirm forest disturbances increases the capacity to reject many false detections, without compromising the temporal accuracy.

TI  - IMPROVING RETRIEVAL ACCURACY FOR AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH BY FUSION OF MODIS AND CALIOP DATA
T2  - TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS and CALIOP are two independent observation instruments in the A-train satellite constellation. They both provide aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals and scan the same points on the Earth's surface within a two-minute interval. With different design principles, MODIS and CALIOP instruments obtain varying AOD retrieval accuracies under different conditions. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fusion approach, including an analysis stage and an integration stage, to improve AOD retrieval accuracy. In the analysis stage, we systematically analyse conditions where MODIS retrieves well while CALIOP does not, and vice-versa. In the integration stage, we combine AOD retrievals from both instruments together by drawing on the other's strong points to make up one's weak points. We test the fusion approach on the two-year collocated data from MODIS, CALIOP and AERONET. The fusion result is significantly more accurate than AOD retrievals from any single observation facility.

TI  - Generalized Aggregation of Sparse Coded Multi-Spectra for Satellite Scene Classification
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite scene classification is challenging because of the high variability inherent in satellite data. Although rapid progress in remote sensing techniques has been witnessed in recent years, the resolution of the available satellite images remains limited compared with the general images acquired using a common camera. On the other hand, a satellite image usually has a greater number of spectral bands than a general image, thereby permitting the multi-spectral analysis of different land materials and promoting low-resolution satellite scene recognition. This study advocates multi-spectral analysis and explores the middle-level statistics of spectral information for satellite scene representation instead of using spatial analysis. This approach is widely utilized in general image and natural scene classification and achieved promising recognition performance for different applications. The proposed multi-spectral analysis firstly learns the multi-spectral prototypes (codebook) for representing any pixel-wise spectral data, and then, based on the learned codebook, a sparse coded spectral vector can be obtained with machine learning techniques. Furthermore, in order to combine the set of coded spectral vectors in a satellite scene image, we propose a hybrid aggregation (pooling) approach, instead of conventional averaging and max pooling, which includes the benefits of the two existing methods, but avoids extremely noisy coded values. Experiments on three satellite datasets validated that the performance of our proposed approach is very impressive compared with the state-of-the-art methods for satellite scene classification.

TI  - Mapping Plastic-Mulched Farmland with Multi-Temporal Landsat-8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using plastic mulching for farmland is booming around the world. Despite its benefit of protecting crops from unfavorable conditions and increasing crop yield, the massive use of the plastic-mulching technique causes many environmental problems. Therefore, timely and effective mapping of plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) is of great interest to policy-makers to leverage the trade-off between economic profit and adverse environmental impacts. However, it is still challenging to implement remote-sensing-based PMF mapping due to its changing spectral characteristics with the growing seasons of crops and geographic regions. In this study, we examined the potential of multi-temporal Landsat-8 imagery for mapping PMF. To this end, we gathered the information of spectra, textures, indices, and thermal features into random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms in order to select the common characteristics for distinguishing PMF from other land cover types. The experiment was conducted in Jizhou, Hebei Province. The results demonstrated that the spectral features and indices features of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), GI (greenness index), and textural features of mean are more important than the other features for mapping PMF in Jizhou. With that, the optimal period for mapping PMF is in April, followed by May. A combination of these two times (April and May) is better than later in the season. The highest overall, producer's, and user's accuracies achieved were 97.01%, 92.48%, and 96.40% in Jizhou, respectively.

TI  - Global Analysis of the Differences Between the MODIS Vegetation Index Compositing Date and the Actual Acquisition Date
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image compositing enables the generation of continuous and equidistant time series of vegetation indices (VIs) as a requisite for deriving phenological metrics. This is achieved by selecting a representative choice from available observations within a compositing period. Commonly, phenological processors associate the VI value with a reference date rather than the actual acquisition date. This letter focuses on a global assessment of the resulting temporal discrepancy between the assumed reference date and the actual acquisition date using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-VI day of composite (DOC) information from 2000 to 2015. It is shown that the long-term global mean DOC coincides with the midday of a compositing period (day 8.44 +/- 0.44). The global summarized 2-D frequency distributions of succeeding compositing periods revealed that only 16.93% of all occurrences indicate a 16-day difference. The commonly used assumptions that the DOC coincides with the first, mid, or last day of the compositing period on average only hold true for 7.02%, 6.07%, and 6.03% of temporal succeeding compositing periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of 2-D frequency distributions occur as a result of climatic regions and seasonality. A MODIS tile is on average composed of more than 50% DOC combinations, indicating deviations (1-31 days) from the 16-day difference. Since information about the actual acquisition date is available, and methods for the incorporation of irregular data into phenological analysis do exist, it is recommended to incorporate this information into the phenology research based on VI time series to avoid unnecessary uncertainty.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Past studies showed that integumentectomy and incontinuity could be effective procedures in the surgical management of melanoma patients. The present study reports on the historical background of these procedures. In addition, we analyze the ICG assisted integumentectomy and incontinuity techniques and algorithms that we had created when performing this procedure.Method In accordance with our algorithm, we performed ICG assisted integumentectomy/incontinuity procedures on 17 patients with stage III melanomas between 2008 and 2016. We also investigated the locoregional recurrence rate in a control group comprising 60 patients at stage III without using the algorithm.Results The former group exhibited a tendency of locoregional recurrence rate suppression. Melanoma cells in the dissected intervening tissue were microscopically identified in 2 out of 17 cases.Conclusions Our ICG assisted integumentectomy or incontinuity procedures could be effective in controlling locoregional recurrence rates in melanoma cases. Moreover, our method can be generally applied because the dissection is only performed within the lymphatic pathway region identified using indocyanine green.

TI  - A remote sensing-based agricultural drought indicator and its implementation over a semi-arid region, Jordan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the study was to develop a remote sensing (i.e., Landsat-8 and MODIS)-based agricultural drought indicator (ADI) at 30-m spatial resolution and 8-day temporal resolution and also to evaluate its performance over a heterogeneous agriculture dominant semi-arid region in Jordan. Firstly, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate the correlations among six commonly used remote sensing-derived agricultural drought related variables. The variables included normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), visible and shortwave drought index (VSDI), normalized multiband drought index (NMDI), moisture stress index (MSI), and land surface temperature (LST). Secondly, we integrated the relatively less correlated variables (that were found to be NDWI, VSDI, and LST) to generate four agricultural drought categories/conditions (i.e., wet, mild drought, moderate drought, and severe drought). Finally, we evaluated the ADI maps against a set of 8-day ground-based standardized precipitation index values (i.e., SPI-1, SPI-2, ..., SPI-8) by use of confusion matrices and observed the best results for SPI-4 (i.e., overall accuracy and Kappa-values were 83% and 76%, respectively) and SPI-5 (i.e., overall accuracy and Kappa-values were 85% and 78%, respectively). The results demonstrated that the method would be valuable for monitoring agricultural drought conditions in semi-arid regions at both a reasonably high spatial resolution (i.e., 30-m) and a short time period (i.e., 8-day).

TI  - Dry and Wet Snow Cover Mapping in Mountain Areas Using SAR and Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover in mountain areas is a key factor controlling regional energy balances, hydrological cycle, and water utilization. Optical remote sensing data offer an effective means of mapping snow cover, although their application is limited by solar illumination conditions, conversely, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers the ability to measure snow wetness changes in all weather. In this study, a novel method, which can be approached in two steps by using SAR and optical data, has been developed for dry and wet snow cover recognition in mountain areas. First, two ground-based synchronous observations were implemented, respectively, for snow-accumulation period and snow-melt period. Then, the RADARSAT-2 interferometric coherence images and the backscattering coefficient images of the two periods are analyzed, adopting snow-covered and snow-free areas obtained from GF-1 satellite observations as the "ground truth." A dynamic thresholding algorithm was proposed to identify snow cover by taking the polarization mode, local incidence angle, and underlying surface type into consideration. Finally, 36 polarimetric parameters obtained from Pauli, H/A/alpha, Freeman, and Yamaguchi decomposition were analyzed; the results indicate that P-vol from Pauli, lambda(3) from H/A/alpha, and Y-vol from Yamaguchi are more applicable to discriminate dry and wet snow. These three factors, combined with training samples from Nagler algorithm and in situ data, were used to build a support vector machine to classify the extracted snow cover to dry and wet snow. The classification results demonstrate that the dry and wet snow cover extraction can achieve an accuracy of 90.3% compared with in situ measurements.

TI  - THE PROBLEM OF "GOD" IN PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION: LONERGAN'S "COMMON SENSE" (RELIGION) VERSUS "THEORY" (THEOLOGY)
T2  - ZYGON
M3  - Article
AB  - The emphasis on God in American psychology of religion generates the problem of explaining divine-versus-natural causality in "spiritual experiences." Especially "theistic psychology" champions divine involvement. However, its argument exposes a methodological error: to pit popular religious opinions against technical scientific conclusions. Countering such homogenizing "postmodern agnosticism," Bernard Lonergan explained these two as different modes of thinking: "common sense" and "theory"-which resolves the problem: When theoretical science is matched with theoretical theology, "the God-hypothesis" explains the existence of things whereas science explains their natures; and, barring miracles, God is irrelevant to natural science. A review of the field shows that the problem is pervasive; attention to "miracles"-popularly so-named versus technically-focuses the claims of divine-versus-natural causality; and specifications of the meaning of spiritual, spirituality, science, worldview, and meaning itself (suffering that same ambiguity: personal import versus cognitive content) offer further clarity. The problem is not naturalism versus theism, but commonsensical versus theoretical thinking. This solution demands "hard" social science.

TI  - Characterizing degradation of palm swamp peatlands from space and on the ground: An exploratory study in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peru has the fourth largest area of peatlands in the Tropics. Its most representative land cover on peat is a Mauritia flexuosa dominated palm swamp (thereafter called dense PS), which has been under human pressure over decades due to the high demand for the M. flexuosa fruit often collected by cutting down the entire palm. Degradation of these carbon dense forests can substantially affect emissions of greenhouse gases and contribute to climate change. The first objective of this research was to assess the impact of dense PS degradation on forest structure and biomass carbon stocks. The second one was to explore the potential of mapping the distribution of dense PS with different degradation levels using remote sensing data and methods. Biomass stocks were measured in 0.25 ha plots established in areas of dense PS with low (n = 2 plots), medium (n = 2) and high degradation (n = 4). We combined field and remote sensing data from the satellites Landsat TM and ALOS/PALSAR to discriminate between areas typifying dense PS with low, medium and high degradation and terra firme, restinga and mixed PS (not M. flexuosa dominated) forests. For this we used a Random Forest machine learning classification algorithm. Results suggest a shift in forest composition from palm to woody tree dominated forest following degradation. We also found that human intervention in dense PS translates into significant reductions in tree carbon stocks with initial (above and below-ground) biomass stocks (135.4 +/- 4.8 Mg C ha(-1)) decreased by 11 and 17% following medium and high degradation. The remote sensing analysis indicates a high separability between dense PS with low degradation from all other categories. Dense PS with medium and high degradation were highly separable from most categories except for restinga forests and mixed PS. Results also showed that data from both active and passive remote sensing sensors are important for the mapping of dense PS degradation. Overall land cover classification accuracy was high (91%). Results from this pilot analysis are encouraging to further explore the use of remote sensing data and methods for monitoring dense PS degradation at broader scales in the Peruvian Amazon. Providing precise estimates on the spatial extent of dense PS degradation and on biomass and peat derived emissions is required for assessing national emissions from forest degradation in Peru and is essential for supporting initiatives aiming at reducing degradation activities.

TI  - Human migration, climate variability, and land degradation: hotspots of socio-ecological pressure in Ethiopia
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ethiopia, human migration is known to be influenced by environmental change-and vice versa. Thus, degradation of environmental conditions can contribute to out-migration, and in-migration can cause environmental changes at the immigrants' destination. The aim of our study was to systematically identify regions in which socio-ecological pressures can arise from high population densities, migration, land degradation, and/or rainfall variability. We combined population census data at the district level with high-resolution remote sensing data regarding rainfall variability, land degradation, and land cover. We identified districts in which high population density is coupled with both a steep decline in net primary production (NPP) and large precipitation variability. The affected regions are mainly cropping regions located in the northern highlands and in the central part of the Great Rift Valley. We consider these regions to be particularly prone to environmental changes; moreover, high population density places additional stress on local natural resources. Next, we identified districts in which high in-migration is coupled with both a strong decline in NPP and low rainfall variability, proposing that land degradation in these regions is likely to have resulted from human activity rather than climatic factors. The affected regions include parts of the Awash Valley, regions surrounding Lake Tana, and the mountainous regions between Addis Ababa, Bedele, and Jima. We found these hotspots of in-migration and land degradation are dominantly grasslands regions, which have been characterized by significant cropland expansion during the period studied. Whereas exploring causal relationships between migration, environmental change, and land cover change is beyond the scope of our study, we have pinpointed regions where these processes coincide. Our findings suggest that at the regional scale, deteriorating environmental conditions can be both the cause and the effect of migration.

TI  - Understanding Non-Adherence From the Inside: Hypertensive Patients' Motivations for Adhering and Not Adhering
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients' low adherence to medical treatment in chronic illnesses is one of the biggest public health problems. Numerous studies attend to the diverse factors associated with patient adherence. However, little research has been done to explore patients' reasons for non-compliance from their own point of view. In this article, we aim to understand patient non-adherence using dialogical self-theory and qualitative research methods. We interviewed 51 hypertensive patients to explore their anti- and pro-adherence motivations. Results show that most patients adhere and non-adhere to different aspects of treatment programs (medication, exercise, diet) according to the way they construct meaning to those activities. Also, our findings support the notion that patients' non-adherent behavior aims to preserve important values such as self-esteem, autonomy, affiliation, well-being, freedom, and health (or that more adherence is not worth the extra effort). We discuss the therapeutic relevance of empathically understanding patients' worldview and implicit beliefs.

TI  - A Study of the Earth-Affecting CMEs of Solar Cycle 24
T2  - SOLAR PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using in situ observations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), we have identified 70 Earth-affecting interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) in Solar Cycle 24. Because of the unprecedented extent of heliospheric observations in Cycle 24 that has been achieved thanks to the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) instruments onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), we observe these events throughout the heliosphere from the Sun to the Earth, and we can relate these in situ signatures to remote sensing data. This allows us to completely track the event back to the source of the eruption in the low corona. We present a summary of the Earth-affecting CMEs in Solar Cycle 24 and a statistical study of the properties of these events including the source region. We examine the characteristics of CMEs that are more likely to be strongly geoeffective and examine the effect of the flare strength on in situ properties. We find that Earth-affecting CMEs in the first half of Cycle 24 are more likely to come from the northern hemisphere, but after April 2012, this reverses, and these events are more likely to originate in the southern hemisphere, following the observed magnetic asymmetry in the two hemispheres. We also find that as in past solar cycles, CMEs from the western hemisphere are more likely to reach Earth. We find that Cycle 24 lacks in events driving extreme geomagnetic storms compared to past solar cycles.

TI  - Vegetation chlorophyll estimates in the Amazon from multi-angle MODIS observations and canopy reflectance model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As a preparatory study for future hyperspectral missions that can measure canopy chemistry, we introduce a novel approach to investigate whether multi-angle Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data can be used to generate a preliminary database with long-term estimates of chlorophyll. MODIS monthly chlorophyll estimates between 2000 and 2015, derived from a fully coupled canopy reflectance model (ProSAIL), were inspected for consistency with eddy covariance fluxes, tower based hyperspectral images and chlorophyll measurements. MODIS chlorophyll estimates from the inverse model showed strong seasonal variations across two flux-tower sites in central and eastern Amazon. Marked increases in chlorophyll concentrations were observed during the early dry season. Remotely sensed chlorophyll concentrations were correlated to field measurements (r(2) = 0.73 and r(2) = 0.98) but the data deviated from the 1:1 line with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.355 g cm(-2) (Tapajos tower) to 0.470 g cm(-2) (Manaus tower). The chlorophyll estimates were consistent with flux tower measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP). We also applied ProSAIL to mono-angle hyperspectral observations from a camera installed on a tower to scale modeled chlorophyll pigments to MODIS observations (r(2) = 0.73). Chlorophyll pigment concentrations (Chl(A+B)) were correlated to changes in the amount of young and mature leaf area per month (0.59 <= r(2) <= 0.64). Increases in MODIS observed Chl(A+B) were preceded by increased PAR during the dry season (0.61 <r(2) < 0.62) and followed by changes in net carbon uptake. We conclude that, at these two sites, changes in LAI, coupled with changes in leaf chlorophyll, are comparable with seasonality of plant productivity. Our results allowed the preliminary development of a 15-year time series of chlorophyll estimates over the Amazon to support canopy chemistry studies using future hyperspectral sensors.

AB  - Unpiloted Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or "drones" as they are often called, are revolutionizing archaeology in terms of the scale and precision of landscape mapping (Verhoeven 2009; Smith et al. 2014; Hill 2014). Combined with advances in computer vision software (Verhoeven et al. 2012), drones can record the world at significantly higher levels of detail than was previously possible from terrestrial, aerial, or satellite mapping. Drone-based survey can be particularly fruitful in the mapping of prehistoric structures that tend to be small and difficult to identify from satellite data. As part of the larger Eastern Badia Archaeological Project, a large-scale aerial survey of Wadi al-Qattafi, Jordan was undertaken to map the large number of Neolithic and later structures that are present on the landscape but largely undocumented. Although analysis of the data is ongoing, this approach to landscape data collection is allowing us rapidly to record the landscape and document the myriad features, including large-scale hunting traps known as "kites," that currently exist on the surface, but are in danger of disappearing due to anthropogenic and environmental pressures.

TI  - Phytoplankton blooms in Lake Erie impacted by both long-term and springtime phosphorus loading
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie have been increasing in severity over the past two decades, prompting new phosphorus loading target recommendations. We explore long-term drivers of phytoplankton blooms by leveraging new estimates of historical bloom extent from Landsat 5 covering 1984-2001 together with existing data covering 2002-2015. We find that a linear combination of springtime and long-term cumulative dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loading explains a high proportion of interannual variability in maximum summertime bloom extent for 1984-2015 (R-2 = 0.75). This finding suggests that the impacts of internal loading are potentially greater than previously understood, and that the hypothesized recent increased susceptibility to blooms may be attributable to high decadal-scale cumulative loading. Based on this combined loading model, achieving mild bloom conditions in Lake Erie (defined in recent studies as bloom areas below 600 km(2) nine years out of ten) would require DRP loads to be reduced by 58% relative to the 2001-2015 average (equivalent to annual DRP loading of 240 MT and April to July DRP loading of 78 MT). Reaping the full benefits of load reductions may therefore take up to a decade due to the effects of historical loading. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Decreasing cloud cover drives the recent mass loss on the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has been losing mass at an accelerating rate since the mid-1990s. This has been due to both increased ice discharge into the ocean and melting at the surface, with the latter being the dominant contribution. This change in state has been attributed to rising temperatures and a decrease in surface albedo. We show, using satellite data and climate model output, that the abrupt reduction in surface mass balance since about 1995 can be attributed largely to a coincident trend of decreasing summer cloud cover enhancing the melt-albedo feedback. Satellite observations show that, from 1995 to 2009, summer cloud cover decreased by 0.9 +/- 0.3% per year. Model output indicates that the GrIS summer melt increases by 27 +/- 13 gigatons (Gt) per percent reduction in summer cloud cover, principally because of the impact of increased shortwave radiation over the low albedo ablation zone. The observed reduction in cloud cover is strongly correlated with a state shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation promoting anticyclonic conditions in summer and suggests that the enhanced surface mass loss from the GrIS is driven by synoptic-scale changes in Arctic-wide atmospheric circulation.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between religious fundamentalism, humor, and psychological well-being was examined with a sample of individuals (n = 109) being treated for drug abuse in a court-mandated AA outpatient program. Three separate factors of religious fundamentalism were found through exploratory factor analysis of the Revised Religious Fundamentalism Scale, and these were named Righteous-Evil Worldview, True Religion, and Scriptural Literalism. Psychological well-being of individuals in court-mandated outpatient substance abuse treatment was found to be correlated with high levels of humor but not religious fundamentalism. Psychological well-being and humor were found to be related to satisfaction with services; no relationship was found between religious fundamentalism and satisfaction with services. One factor of religious fundamentalism, Scriptural Literalism, was found to be associated with high levels of depression and paranoia/hostility. Implications of these relationships for treatment and understanding of religious fundamentalism and psychological well-being are discussed.

TI  - Modification of river meandering by tropical deforestation
T2  - GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are the only forest biome to have experienced increased rates of forest loss during the past decade because of global demands for food and biofuels. The implications of such extensive forest clearing on the dynamics of tropical river systems remain relatively unknown, despite significant progress in our understanding of the role of trees in riverbank stability. Here, we document rates of deforestation and corresponding average annual rates of riverbank erosion along the freely meandering Kinabatangan River in Sabah, Malaysia, from Landsat satellite imagery spanning A.D. 1989-2014. We estimate that deforestation removed over half of the river's floodplain forest and up to 30% of its riparian cover, which increased rates of riverbank erosion by > 23% within our study reaches. Further, the correlation between the magnitude of planform curvature and rates of riverbank erosion only became strongly positive and significant following deforestation, suggesting an important role of forests in the evolution of meandering rivers, even when riverbank heights exceed the depth of root penetration.

TI  - Using multi-polarization C- and L-band synthetic aperture radar to estimate biomass and soil moisture of wheat fields
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass and soil moisture are two important parameters for agricultural crop monitoring and yield estimation. In this study, the Water Cloud Model (WCM) was coupled with the Ulaby soil moisture model to estimate both biomass and soil moisture for spring wheat fields in a test site in western Canada. This study exploited both C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (UAVSAR) Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) for this purpose. The WCM-Ulaby model was calibrated for three polarizations (HH, VV and HV). Subsequently two of these three polarizations were used as inputs to an inversion procedure, to retrieve either soil moisture or biomass without the need for any ancillary data. The model was calibrated for total canopy biomass, the biomass of only the wheat heads, as well as for different wheat growth stages. This resulted in a calibrated WCM-Ulaby model for each sensor-polarization-phenology-biomass combination. Validation of model retrievals led to promising results. RADARSAT-2 (HH-HV) estimated total wheat biomass with root mean square (RMSE) and mean average (MAE) errors of 78.834 g/m(2) and 58.438 g/m(2); soil moisture with errors of 0.078 m(3)/m(3) (RMSE) and 0.065 m(3)/m(3) (MAE) are reported. During the period of crop ripening, L-band estimates of soil moisture had accuracies of 0.064 m(3)/m(3) (RMSE) and 0.057 m(3)/m(3) (MAE). RADARSAT-2 (W-HV) produced interesting results for retrieval of the biomass of the wheat heads. In this particular case, the biomass of the heads was estimated with accuracies of 38.757 g/m(2) (RSME) and 33.152 g/m(2) (MAE). For wider implementation this model will require additional data to strengthen the model accuracy and confirm estimation performance. Nevertheless this study encourages further research given the importance of wheat as a global commodity, the challenge of cloud cover in optical monitoring and the potential of direct estimation of the weight of heads where wheat production lies.

TI  - Impacts of dust aerosol and adjacency effects on the accuracy of Landsat 8 and RapidEye surface reflectances
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric correction of satellite data is challenging over desert agricultural systems, due to the relatively high aerosol optical thicknesses (T-550), bright soils, and a heterogeneous surface reflectance field. Indeed, the contribution of reflected radiation from adjacent pixels scattered into the field of view of a target pixel is considerable and can significantly affect the fidelity of retrieved reflectances. In this study, uncertainties and quantitative errors associated with the atmospheric correction of multi-spectral Landsat 8 and RapidEye data were characterized over a desert agricultural landscape in Saudi Arabia. Surface reflectances were retrieved using an implementation of the 6SV atmospheric correction code, and validated against field collected spectroradiometer measurements over desert, cultivated soil, and vegetated surface targets. A combination of satellite and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data were used to parameterize aerosol properties and atmospheric state parameters. With optimal specification of T550 and aerosol optical properties and correction for adjacency effects, the relative Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for all bands combined was 5.4% for RapidEye and 6.8% for Landsat 8. However uncertainties associated with satellite-based T-550 retrievals were shown to introduce significant error into the reflectance estimates. With respect to deriving common vegetation indices from corrected reflectance data, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was associated with the smallest errors (3-8% MAD). Surface reflectance errors were highest for bands in the visible part of the spectrum, particularly the blue band (5-16%), while there was more consistency within the red-edge (similar to 5%) and near-infrared (5-7%). Results were generally better constrained when a T-550-dependent aerosol model for desert dust particles, parameterized on the basis of nearby AERONET site data, was used in place of a generic rural or background desert model. This adaptation was particularly pertinent for the Landsat bands in the shortwave infrared. Failure to correct for adjacency effects increased the overall surface reflectance MAD to around 18%. The impact was especially significant for the visible bands over vegetated surface targets, as evidenced by relative MADs increasing to >200%. In comparison, a relatively minor adjacency effect was observed within the near-infrared and over the more reflective bare soil and desert sites. Overall, the impact of adjacency effects was substantial (20-25% MAD) for all of the studied vegetation indices. This investigation fills a research gap in the quantification of uncertainties and evaluation of achievable accuracy levels in high spatial resolution surface reflectance imagery over desert agriculture and highlights the need for accurate and regionally representative atmospheric correction techniques.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation in Particulate Organic Carbon Based on Long-Term MODIS Observations in Taihu Lake, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ measured values of particulate organic carbon (POC) in Taihu Lake and remote sensing reflectance observed by three satellite courses from 2014 to 2015 were used to develop an near infrared-red (NIR-Red) empirical algorithm of POC for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua) satellite image. The performance of the POC algorithm is highly consistent with the in situ measured POC, with root mean square error percentage (RMSPs) of 38.9% and 31.5% for two independent validations, respectively. The MODIS-derived POC also shows an acceptable result, with RMSPs of 53.6% and 61.0% for two periods of match-up data. POC from 2005 to 2007 is much higher than it is from 2002 to 2004 and 2008 to 2013, due to a large area of algal bloom. Riverine flux is an important source of POC in Taihu Lake, especially in the lake's bank and bays. The influence of a terrigenous source of POC can reach the center lake during periods of heavy precipitation. Sediment resuspension is also a source of POC in the lake due to the area's high dynamic ratio (25.4) and wind speed. The source of POC in an inland shallow lake is particularly complex, and additional research on POC is needed to more clearly reveal its variation in inland water.

TI  - Evaluation of Atmospheric Effects on Land-Surface Directional Reflectance With the Coupled RAPID and VLIDORT Models
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assess atmospheric effects on the directional reflectance of land surface, we have developed a new approach coupling the 3-D radiosity-based land-surface model [radiosity applicable to porous individual objects (RAPID)] with the atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) model [vector linearized discrete ordinate RT (VLIDORT)]. RAPID is used to generate a lookup table of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) elements required by VLIDORT for the surface boundary condition. To test the RAPID-VLIDORT model, we used five natural 3-D scenes along with five aerosol optical depths (AODs). Results for top-of-atmosphere radiances show semiempirical analytical BRDF models are insufficiently accurate to represent bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) in hotspot regions and over wide angular variations. The large impact of AOD on BRF hotspot also underlines the importance of precise atmospheric corrections for multiangular remote sensing of the earth's surface.

TI  - Displacement monitoring and modelling of a high-speed railway bridge using C-band Sentinel-1 data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bridge displacement monitoring is one of the key components of bridge structural health monitoring. Traditional methods, usually based on limited sets of sensors mounted on a given bridge, collect point like deformation information and have the disadvantage of providing incomplete displacement information. In this paper, a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) approach is used to monitor the displacements of the Nanjing Dashengguan Yangtze River high-speed railway bridge. Twenty-nine (29) European Space Agency Sentinel-1A images, acquired from April 25, 2015 to August 5, 2016, were used in the PSI analysis. A total of 1828 measurement points were selected on the bridge. The results show a maximum longitudinal displacement of about 150 mm on each side of the bridge. The measured displacements showed a strong correlation with the environmental temperature at the time the images used were acquired, indicating that they were due to thermal expansion of the bridge. At each pier, a regression model based on the PSI-measured displacements was compared with a model based on in-situ measurements. The good agreement of these models demonstrates the capability of the PSI technique to monitor long-span railway bridge displacements. By comparing the modelled displacements and dozens of PSI measurements, we show how the performance of movable bearings can be evaluated. The high density of the PSI measurement points is advantageous for the health monitoring of the entire bridge. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - Heterogeneous impact transport on the Moon
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact cratering is the dominant process for transporting material on the Moon's surface. An impact transports both proximal material (continuous ejecta) locally and distal ejecta (crater rays) to much larger distances. Quantifying the relative importance of locally derived material versus distal material requires understandings of lunar regolith evolution and the mixing of materials across the lunar surface. The Moon has distinctive albedo units of darker mare basalt and brighter highland materials, and the contacts between these units are ideal settings to examine this question. Information on the amount of material transported across these contacts comes from both the sample collection and remote sensing data, though earlier interpretations of these observations are contradictory. The relatively narrow (similar to 4-5 km wide) mixing zone at mare/highland contacts had been interpreted as consistent with most material having been locally derived from underneath mare plains. However, even far from these contacts where the mare is thick, highland material is abundant in some soil samples (>20%), requiring transport of highland material over great distances. Any model of impact transport on the Moon needs to be consistent with both the observed width of mare/highland contacts and the commonality of nonmare material in mare soil samples far from any contact. In this study, using a three-dimensional regolith transport model, we match these constraints and demonstrate that both local and distal material transports are important at the lunar surface. Furthermore, the nature of the distal material transport mechanism in discrete crater rays can result in substantial heterogeneity of surface materials.

TI  - Satellite-Based Sea Ice Navigation for Prydz Bay, East Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice adversely impacts nautical, logistical and scientific missions in polar regions. Ship navigation benefits from up-to-date sea ice analyses at both regional and local scales. This study presents a satellite-based sea ice navigation system (SatSINS) that integrates observations and scientific output from remote sensing and meteorological data to develop optimum marine navigational routes in sea ice-covered waters, especially in areas where operational ice information is usually scarce. The system and its applications are presented in the context of a decision-making process to optimize the routing of the RV Xuelong during her passage through Prydz Bay, East Antarctica during three trips in the austral spring of 2011-2013. The study assesses scientifically-generated remote sensing ice parameters for their operational use in marine navigation. Evaluation criteria involve identification of priority parameters, their spatio-temporal requirements in relation to navigational needs, and their level of accuracy in conjunction with the severity of ice conditions. Coarse-resolution ice concentration maps are sufficient to delineate ice edge and develop a safe route when ice concentration is less than 70%, provided that ice dynamics, estimated from examining the cyclonic pattern, is not severe. Otherwise, fine-resolution radar data should be used to identify and avoid deformed ice. Satellite data lagging one day behind the actual location of the ship was sufficient in most cases although the proposed route may have to be adjusted. To evaluate the utility of SatSINS, deviation of the actual route from the proposed route was calculated and found to range between 165 m to about 16.0 km with standard deviations of 2.8-6.1 km. Growth of land-fast ice has proven to be an essential component of the system as it was estimated using a thermodynamic model with input from a meteorological station.

TI  - Down the Rathole? Public Support for US Foreign Aid
T2  - INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Americans think the US foreign aid budget is far too generous. Can information change those views? We identified ten prominent arguments about aid in public discussion, five positive and five negative. In a survey experiment, we exposed respondents to one of those arguments with five associated facts. Most of the arguments in favor of aid made respondents more supportive, while most of the arguments against aid made them less supportive. Arguments that focused either positively or negatively on economic development in recipient countries or advancing US interests made little difference. In contrast, arguments about the domestic costs of foreign aid or those that invoked moral considerations like recipient need or corruption had fairly large effects on attitudes. The most successful argument, on the low cost of aid, reduced aid opposition from 67 to 28 percent. When respondents saw both pro and con arguments together, however, arguments generally lost their efficacy. The only exception was the argument about the low cost of aid, which altered opinions in some ways-even when countered with anti-aid arguments. Our results are somewhat surprising given the conventional wisdom that people are motivated reasoners who reject new information that does not conform to their worldview.

TI  - The Potential Return on Public Investment in Detecting Adverse Drug Effects
T2  - MEDICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Many countries lack fully functional pharmacovigilance programs, and public budgets allocated to pharmacovigilance in industrialized countries remain low due to resource constraints and competing priorities.Objective:Using 3 case examples, we sought to estimate the public health and economic benefits resulting from public investment in active pharmacovigilance programs to detect adverse drug effects.Research Design:We assessed 3 examples in which early signals of safety hazards were not adequately recognized, resulting in continued exposure of a large number of patients to these drugs when safer and effective alternative treatments were available. The drug examples studied were rofecoxib, cerivastatin, and troglitazone. Using an individual patient simulation model and the health care system perspective, we estimated the potential costs that could have been averted by early systematic detection of safety hazards through the implementation of active surveillance programs.Results:We found that earlier drug withdrawal made possible by active safety surveillance would most likely have resulted in savings in direct medical costs of $773-$884 million for rofecoxib, $3-$10 million for cerivastatin, and $38-$63 million for troglitazone in the United States through the prevention of adverse events. By contrast, the yearly public investment in Food and Drug Administration initiated population-based pharmacovigilance activities in the United States is about $42.5 million at present.Conclusion:These examples illustrate a critical and economically justifiable role for active adverse effect surveillance in protecting the health of the public.

TI  - Detection of Hydromorphologic Characteristics of Indus River Estuary, Pakistan, Using Satellite and Field Data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic factors directly determine the hydromorphologic and ecologic equilibrium of riverine environment. The present study was designed to detect the hydromorphologic characteristics of Indus River Estuary (IRE) using medium and high spatial resolution multispectral satellite imagery along with field data. Qualitative (visual) and quantitative (analytical) analysis was undertaken, and accuracy of each method as well as remotely sensed data was assessed. Single-band density slicing method was used for water bodies, while multiband supervised and unsupervised classification methods were adopted for the identification of hydromorphologic habitat along with key ecologic features of the IRE. The analysis of satellite imagery showed that the shortwave infrared-2 (band 7) of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor performed better than its visible bands for delineating water bodies. The overall classification accuracy was 89%. Supervised classification with the maximum likelihood algorithm performed better for OLI imagery (30 m) than high spatial resolution RapidEye (5 m) imagery. However, unsupervised classification method was not suitable due to the significant overlapping of inter- and intra-class pixels. Overall, due to its adequate spectral range Landsat OLI imagery was utilized for monitoring of terrestrial water bodies and their morphologic features. Thus, we recommend that selecting the spatial resolution of the imagery should be based on the size of the objects to be recognized.

TI  - A Case of Matrix-Producing Carcinoma of the Breast
T2  - Journal of UOEH
M3  - Article
AB  - A 61-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of a right breast mass. A 19 nun hard mass was palpable in the A area of the right breast. A contrast-enhanced MRI showed rim enhancement at the peripheral region of the tumor, which was thought to represent the carcinoma component mainly at the periphery and the matrix component inside the tumor. A low density mass with rim enhancement at the peripheral region was observed in a contrast-enhanced CT, the same as in the MRI. Neither axillaiy lymph node metastasis nor distant metastasis was observed. A core needle biopsy of the tumor lead to a diagnosis of matrix-producing carcinoma (MPC). A breast-conserving mastectomy with sentinel lymph nodes biopsy was performed on the right breast MPC (T1c, N0, M0 Stage I). Histopathologically, the tumor demonstrated overt carcinoma with direct transition to a cartilaginous or osseous matrix and lacked an intervening spindle cell component. Immunohistochemistry showed estrogen receptor (ER) (-), progesterone receptor (PgR) (-), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (-), and Ki67 index of 50%, so-called triple negative breast cancer. The tumor was also positive for SRY-rclated HMG box-9 (SOX9), which is a useful marker of chondroid differentiation in normal and neoplastic tissues. The patient lived free from recurrence for 5 years, even though her adjuvant therapy was only radiation therapy without adjuvant chemotherapy. MPC is an uncommon and relatively rare variant of metaplastic carcinoma, and the prognosis for patients with MPC is poorer than that for patients with ordinary breast cancer. Here we report a case of MPC of the breast with characteristic rim enhancement in contrast-enhanced MM and CT. The intrinsic subtype and prognosis of MPC is controversial, and then we may need more experience with MPC cases.

TI  - TM-Based SOC Models Augmented by Auxiliary Data for Carbon Crediting Programs in Semi-Arid Environments
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at testing the hypothesis that augmenting Landsat TM-based models for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) with auxiliary data about variables that might affect the spatial distribution of SOC might improve the predictability of these models in the Zarqa Basin in Jordan (a typical semi-arid watershed) and enable them to be used for implementing carbon crediting programs in semi-arid environments. Six modeling procedures, namely stepwise regression, partial least squares, recursive partitioning analysis, screening regression analysis, artificial neural networks, and combined models, were calibrated and validated for the basin and for the land cover types that exist in the basin. Although none of the developed models was powerful for predicting SOC, artificial neural networks models were more applicable specifically in agricultural lands. However, the margins of error associated with the best models were high, and hence hindered the applicability of these models in carbon crediting programs in semi-arid environments.

TI  - An Automated Approach to Map Winter Cropped Area of Smallholder Farms across Large Scales Using MODIS Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale agricultural statistics are an important tool for understanding trends in food production and their associated drivers, yet these data are rarely collected in smallholder systems. These statistics are particularly important for smallholder systems given the large amount of fine-scale heterogeneity in production that occurs in these regions. To overcome the lack of ground data, satellite data are often used to map fine-scale agricultural statistics. However, doing so is challenging for smallholder systems because of (1) complex sub-pixel heterogeneity; (2) little to no available calibration data; and (3) high amounts of cloud cover as most smallholder systems occur in the tropics. We develop an automated method termed the MODIS Scaling Approach (MSA) to map smallholder cropped area across large spatial and temporal scales using MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) satellite data. We use this method to map winter cropped area, a key measure of cropping intensity, across the Indian subcontinent annually from 2000-2001 to 2015-2016. The MSA defines a pixel as cropped based on winter growing season phenology and scales the percent of cropped area within a single MODIS pixel based on observed EVI values at peak phenology. We validated the result with eleven high-resolution scenes (spatial scale of 5 x 5 m(2) or finer) that we classified into cropped versus non-cropped maps using training data collected by visual inspection of the high-resolution imagery. The MSA had moderate to high accuracies when validated using these eleven scenes across India (R-2 ranging between 0.19 and 0.89 with an overall R-2 of 0.71 across all sites). This method requires no calibration data, making it easy to implement across large spatial and temporal scales, with 100% spatial coverage due to the compositing of EVI to generate cloud-free data sets. The accuracies found in this study are similar to those of other studies that map crop production using automated methods and use no calibration data. To aid research on agricultural production at fine spatial scales in India, we make our annual winter crop maps from 2000-2001 to 2015-2016 at 1 x 1 km(2) produced in this study publically available through the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) hosted by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University. We also make our R script available since it is likely that this method can be used to map smallholder agriculture in other regions across the globe given that our method performed well in disparate agro-ecologies across India.

TI  - Relationships Among Powered Flight, Metabolic Rate, Body Mass, Genome Size, and the Retrotransposon Complement of Volant Birds
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Avian genomes are of interest because the rapid metabolic rate associated with powered flight requires small cells which constrain genome size. Consequently, flying birds tend to have small genomes relative to other vertebrates such as mammals. It thus stands to reason that flying birds should have smaller genomes than ground-dwelling birds with lower metabolic rates. Small genomes could be condensed but uncompromised in a number of ways, including smaller intergenic intervals, shorter introns, and/or a reduced transposable element (TE) complement. We evaluated genome size in light of the orthologous TE complement among 41 flying (FY) and seven ground-dwelling (GD) bird species to determine if a preponderance of deletions in orthologous TEs might explain the compact genomes of flying birds with high metabolic rates. We measured, across multiple loci in all 48 species, the lengths of 50 contemporary orthologous chicken repeat 1 (CR1, a non-LTR retrotransposon) copies relative to inferred ancestral CR1 sequences. We found genome sizes in GD birds were not different than those in FY birds, but the mean lengths of orthologous CR1 loci were significantly shorter in FY birds than in GD birds. Moreover, we observed a negative correlation between basal metabolic rate and length of orthologous CR1 loci. Finally, we observed positive correlations between body mass and both genome sizes as well as length of orthologous CR1 loci, which we expected given that body mass correlates negatively with metabolic rates. Our results support the contention that metabolism helps shape the avian TE complement and thus indirectly contributes to the compact genomes of birds.

TI  - Intercalibration of IRAS/FY-3B Infrared Channels With IASI/Metop-A 1C Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the intercalibration of the infrared channels 1-19 of Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (IRAS) on FengYun 3B (FY-3B) against the hyperspectral channels of the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI) aboard Metop-A. Matching measurements were collected over the Arctic area (60 degrees N-90 degrees N) and Antarctic area (60 degrees S-90 degrees S) with collocation, absolute observation time difference of less than 20 min (|Delta time| < 20 min), and | cos theta(1)/cos theta(2) - 1| < 0.02, where theta(1) and theta 2 are, respectively, the viewing zenith angles of IRAS/FY3B and IASI/Metop-A measurements. The results show that the measurements in channels 1-12, 14, and 15 are linearly related to the convolved IASI/Metop-A measurements, and no obvious impact of direct solar illumination on these channels is observed. Although the measurements in channels 13, and 16-18 are also linearly related to the convolved IASI/Metop-A measurements, they are strongly influenced by direct solar illumination: The measurements with satellites illuminated by the Sun and with satellites in the Earth shadow are distributed on different lines. The measurements in channels 18 and 19 present certain nonlinear characteristics. Against the convolved IASI/Metop-A measurements, the measurements in IRAS/FY-3B channels 1-12, 14-17, and 19 were averagely 1.0-2.0 K underestimated, whereas the measurements in IRAS/FY-3B channels 13 and 18 were 2.0-4.0 K overestimated. Linear/nonlinear regressions were conducted on the matching measurements and intercalibration coefficients were obtained. Corrections of the measurements in IRAS/FY-3B channels 1-19 with the intercalibration indicate that the calibration of IASI/Metop-A hyperspectral channels was successfully transferred to IRAS/FY-3B channels 1-19.

TI  - Application of Multitemporal InSAR Covariance and Information Fusion to Robust Road Extraction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic road extraction from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has been studied with success in the past two decades. However, a method that combines full interferometric SAR (InSAR) information is as yet missing. In this paper, we present an algorithm toward robust road extraction by fully exploring the multitemporal InSAR covariance matrix. To improve the detection performance and reduce false alarm ratio, intensity and coherence are first accurately estimated without loss of image resolution by homogeneous pixel selection and robust estimators. After the identification of road candidates from each quantity using multiscale line detectors, novel information fusion rules are applied to integrate the extracted results and generate the final road network. The method is tested and quantitatively evaluated on TerraSAR-X data sets depicting two scenes where complex road features make it hard for standard SAR-based methods. The experimental results show that the new method can achieve satisfactory detection performances.

TI  - Global climate forcing from albedo change caused by large-scale deforestation and reforestation: quantification and attribution of geographic variation
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale deforestation and reforestation have contributed substantially to historical and contemporary global climate change in part through albedo-induced radiative forcing, with meaningful implications for forest management aiming to mitigate climate change. Associated warming or cooling varies widely across the globe due to a range of factors including forest type, snow cover, and insolation, but resulting geographic variation remains poorly described and has been largely based on model assessments. This study provides an observation-based approach to quantify local and global radiative forcings from large-scale deforestation and reforestation and further examines mechanisms that result in the spatial heterogeneity of radiative forcing. We incorporate a new spatially and temporally explicit land cover-specific albedo product derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer with a historical land use data set (Land Use Harmonization product). Spatial variation in radiative forcing was attributed to four mechanisms, including the change in snow-covered albedo, change in snow-free albedo, snow cover fraction, and incoming solar radiation. We find an albedo-only radiative forcing (RF) of -0.819 W m(-2) if year 2000 forests were completely deforested and converted to croplands. Albedo RF from global reforestation of present-day croplands to recover year 1700 forests is estimated to be 0.161 W m(-2). Snow-cover fraction is identified as the primary factor in determining the spatial variation of radiative forcing in winter, while the magnitude of the change in snow-free albedo is the primary factor determining variations in summertime RF. Findings reinforce the notion that, for conifers at the snowier high latitudes, albedo RF diminishes the warming from forest loss and the cooling from forest gain more so than for other forest types, latitudes, and climate settings.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground forest biomass in Galicia (NW Spain) by the combined use of LiDAR, LANDSAT ETM plus and National Forest Inventory data
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing biomass is critical for accounting bioenergy potentials and monitoring forest ecosystem responses to global change and disturbances. Remote sensing, especially Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data combined with field data, is being increasingly used for forest inventory purposes. We evaluated the feasibility of the combined use of freely available data, both remote sensing (LiDAR data provided by the Spanish National Plan for Aerial Ortophotography - PNOA - and Landsat vegetation spectral indices) and field data (from the National Forest Inventory) to estimate stand dendrometric and above-ground biomass variables of the most productive tree species in a pilot area in Galicia (northwestern Spain). The results suggest that the models can accurately predict dendrometric and biomass variables at plot level with an R-2 ranging from 0.49 to 0.65 for basal area, from 0.65 to 0.95 for dominant height, from 0.48 to 0.68 for crown biomass and from 0.55 to 0.82 for stem biomass. Our results support the use of this approach to reduce the cost of forest inventories and provide a useful tool for stakeholders to map forest stand variables and biomass stocks.

M3  - Article
AB  - Vascularized lymph node transfers have multiple donor sites with risk of iatrogenic lymphedema. We sought to describe in detail a surgical technique that is safe, reproducible, and efficient in harvesting gastroepiploic vascularized lymph nodes using real-time indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent imaging. Photographs and video were acquired from a case to depict a step-by-step approach. ICG was endoscopically injected into the submucosa of the greater curvature of the stomach at the outset of the procedure. A laparoscopic harvest of the gastroepiploic vascular pedicle and lymph nodes ensued with the assistance of fluorescent imaging. Laparoscopic gastroepiploic lymph node harvesting aided by real-time ICG fluorescent mapping technique is safe, feasible, and effective at gathering vascularized lymphatic tissue for successful lymph node transfer in patients with severe lymphedema.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of near-shore bathymetry information retrieved from Landsat-8 imagery
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The improvement in the capabilities of Landsat-8 imagery to retrieve bathymetric information in shallow coastal waters was examined. Landsat-8 images have an additional band named coastal/aerosol, Band 1: 435-451 nm in comparison with former generation of Landsat imagery. The selected Landsat-8 operational land image (OLI) was of Chabahar Bay, located in the southern part of Iran (acquired on February 22, 2014 in calm weather and relatively low turbidity). Accurate and high resolution bathymetric data from the study area, produced by field surveys using a single beam echo-sounder, were selected for calibrating the models and validating the results. Three methods, including traditional linear and ratio transform techniques, as well as a novel proposed integrated method, were used to determine depth values. All possible combinations of the three bands [coastal/aerosol (CB), blue (B), and green (G)] have been considered (11 options) using the traditional linear and ratio transform techniques, together with five model options for the integrated method. The accuracy of each model was assessed by comparing the determined bathymetric information with field measured values. The standard error of the estimates, correlation coefficients (R (2) ) for both calibration and validation points, and root mean square errors (RMSE) were calculated for all cases. When compared with the ratio transform method, the method employing linear transformation with a combination of CB, B, and G bands yielded more accurate results (standard error = 1.712 m, R (2) (calibration) = 0.594, R (2) (validation) = 0.551, and RMSE =1.80 m). Adding the CB band to the ratio transform methodology also dramatically increased the accuracy of the estimated depths, whereas this increment was not statistically significant when using the linear transform methodology. The integrated transform method in form of Depth = b (0) + b (1) X (CB) + b (2) X (B) + b (5) ln(R (CB) )/ln(R (G) ) + b (6) ln(R (B) )/ln(R (G) ) yielded the highest accuracy (standard error = 1.634 m, R (2) (calibration) = 0.634, R (2) (validation) = 0.595, and RMSE = 1.71 m), where R (i) (i = CB, B, or G) refers to atmospherically corrected reflectance values in the i (th) band [X (i) = ln(R (i) -R (deep water))].

TI  - Influence of Plot Size on Efficiency of Biomass Estimates in Inventories of Dry Tropical Forests Assisted by Photogrammetric Data from an Unmanned Aircraft System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) to assist in forest inventories have provided promising results in biomass estimation for different forest types. Recent studies demonstrating use of different types of remotely sensed data to assist in biomass estimation have shown that accuracy and precision of estimates are influenced by the size of field sample plots used to obtain reference values for biomass. The objective of this case study was to assess the influence of sample plot size on efficiency of UAS-assisted biomass estimates in the dry tropical miombo woodlands of Malawi. The results of a design-based field sample inventory assisted by three-dimensional point clouds obtained from aerial imagery acquired with a UAS showed that the root mean square errors as well as the standard error estimates of mean biomass decreased as sample plot sizes increased. Furthermore, relative efficiency values over different sample plot sizes were above 1.0 in a design-based and model-assisted inferential framework, indicating that UAS-assisted inventories were more efficient than purely field-based inventories. The results on relative costs for UAS-assisted and pure field-based sample plot inventories revealed that there is a trade-off between inventory costs and required precision. For example, in our study if a standard error of less than approximately 3 Mg ha(-1) was targeted, then a UAS-assisted forest inventory should be applied to ensure more cost effective and precise estimates. Future studies should therefore focus on finding optimum plot sizes for particular applications, like for example in projects under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, plus forest conservation, sustainable management of forest and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) mechanism with different geographical scales.

TI  - Land Cover, Land Use, and Climate Change Impacts on Endemic Cichlid Habitats in Northern Tanzania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened on Earth, facing environmental and anthropogenic pressures often surpassing their terrestrial counterparts. Land use and land cover change (LUCC) such as degradation and fragmentation of the terrestrial landscape negatively impacts aquatic ecosystems. Satellite imagery allows for an impartial assessment of the past to determine habitat alterations. It can also be used as a forecasting tool in the development of species conservation strategies through models based on ecological factors extracted from imagery. In this study, we analyze Landsat time sequences (1984-2015) to quantify LUCC around three freshwater ecosystems with endemic cichlids in Tanzania. In addition, we examine population growth, agricultural expansion, and climate change as stressors that impact the habitats. We found that the natural vegetation cover surrounding Lake Chala decreased from 15.5% (1984) to 3.5% (2015). At Chemka Springs, we observed a decrease from 7.4% to 3.5% over the same period. While Lake Natron had minimal LUCC, severe climate change impacts have been forecasted for the region. Subsurface water data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations further show a decrease in water resources for the study areas, which could be exacerbated by increased need from a growing population and an increase in agricultural land use.

TI  - Multiple criteria decision-making process to derive consensus desired genetic gains for a dairy cattle breeding objective for diverse production systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dairy cattle industries contribute to food and nutrition security and are a source of income for numerous households in many developing countries. Selective breeding can enhance efficiency in these industries. Developing dairy industries are characterized by diverse production and marketing systems. In this paper, we use weighted goal aggregating procedure to derive consensus trait preferences for different producer categories and processors. We based the study on the dairy industry in Kenya. The analytic hierarchy process was used to derive individual preferences for milk yield (MY), calving interval (CIN), production lifetime (PLT), mature body weight (MBW), and fat yield (FY). Results show that classical classification of production systems into large-scale and smallholder systems does not capture all differences in trait preferences. These differences became apparent when classification was based on productivity at the individual animal level, with high and low intensity producers and processors as the most important groups. High intensity producers had highest preferences for PLT and MY, whereas low intensity producers had highest preference for CIN and PLT; processors preferred MY and FY the most. The highest disagreements between the groups were observed for FY, PLT, and MY. Individual and group preferences were aggregated into consensus preferences using weighted goal programming. Desired gains were obtained as a product of consensus preferences and percentage genetic gains (G%). These were 2.42, 0.22, 2.51, 0.15, and 0.87 for MY, CIN, PLT, MBW, and FY, respectively. Consensus preferences can be used to derive a single compromise breeding objective for situations where the same genetic resources are used in diverse production and marketing circumstances.

TI  - Impact of AVHRR Channel 3b Noise on Climate Data Records: Filtering Method Applied to the CM SAF CLARA-A2 Data Record
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for reducing the impact of noise in the 3.7 micron spectral channel in climate data records derived from coarse resolution (4 km) global measurements from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data is presented. A dynamic size-varying median filter is applied to measurements guided by measured noise levels and scene temperatures for individual AVHRR sensors on historic National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar orbiting satellites in the period 1982-2001. The method was used in the preparation of the CM SAF cLoud, Albedo and surface RAdiation dataset from AVHRR dataSecond Edition (CLARA-A2), a cloud climate data record produced by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility for Climate Monitoring (CM SAF), as well as in the preparation of the corresponding AVHRR-based datasets produced by the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project ESA-CLOUD-CCI. The impact of the noise filter was equivalent to removing an artificial decreasing trend in global cloud cover of 1-2% per decade in the studied period, mainly explained by the very high noise levels experienced in data from the first satellites in the series (NOAA-7 and NOAA-9).

TI  - Deforestation and timber production in Congo after implementation of sustainable management policy: A reaction to the article by JS Brandt, C. Nolte and A. Agrawal (Land Use Policy 52:15-22)
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This viewpoint paper presents a reaction to the article by Brandt et al. (2016). It highlights the complexities inherent to the attribution of deforestation impacts to policy interventions when using remote-sensing data. This critique argues that in the context of the Congo a suite of factors (i.e., population density in particular) other than those considered by Brandt et al. (e.g., type of forest, distance from roads and markets) play essential roles in determining the fates of forests. It also contends that care is needed when making decisions regarding which units will be included in the comparison group so that contextual factors and on-the-ground information are properly considered (e.g., when logging operations are inactive or when a concession is used for 'conservation' purposes). Finally, it proposes that a focus on an analysis of deforestation rates for a given level of timber production might be a metric that more accurately represents one aspect of the consequences of forest management, which should also consider the appraisal of trade-offs associated with a larger set of social, financial and ecological objectives.

T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Russia's Eurasian view of the world brings together anti-Western and state-centric elements. Placed at the center of its own geo-political sphere of influence and civilizational milieu, Russia's worldview is self-contained and insular. What Russian policy slights is the global context in which its primacy over a heterogeneous Eurasia is embedded and which, when disregarded, can impose serious costs. This paper traces the broad contours of Russia's geopolitical and civilizational Eurasianism, linking it to earlier scholarship on regions and civilization. We also explore selected aspects of Russia's foreign security (Crimea and Ukraine) and economic (energy) policies as well as the constraints they encounter in an increasingly global world that envelops Russia and Eurasia in a larger context.

TI  - Adult mortality in a low-density tree population using high-resolution remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a statistical framework to quantify mortality rates in canopy trees observed using time series from high-resolution remote sensing. By timing the acquisition of remote sensing data with synchronous annual flowering in the canopy tree species Handroanthus guayacan, we made 2,596 unique detections of 1,006 individual adult trees within 18,883 observation attempts on Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI) during an 11-yr period. There were 1,057 observation attempts that resulted in missing data due to cloud cover or incomplete spatial coverage. Using the fraction of 123 individuals from an independent field sample that were detected by satellite data (109 individuals, 88.6%), we estimate that the adult population for this species on BCI was 1,135 individuals. We used a Bayesian state-space model that explicitly accounted for the probability of tree detection and missing observations to compute an annual adult mortality rate of 0.2%.yr(-1) (SE = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.06-0.45). An independent estimate of the adult mortality rate from 260 field-checked trees closely matched the landscape-scale estimate (0.33%.yr(-1), SE = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.12-0.74). Our proof-of-concept study shows that one can remotely estimate adult mortality rates for canopy tree species precisely in the presence of variable detection and missing observations.

TI  - Industry-Wide Surveillance of Marek's Disease Virus on Commercial Poultry Farms
T2  - AVIAN DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Marek's disease virus is a herpesvirus of chickens that costs the worldwide poultry industry more than US$1 billion annually. Two generations of Marek's disease vaccines have shown reduced efficacy over the last half century due to evolution of the virus. Understanding where the virus is present may give insight into whether continued reductions in efficacy are likely. We conducted a 3-yr surveillance study to assess the prevalence of Marek's disease virus on commercial poultry farms, determine the effect of various factors on virus prevalence, and document virus dynamics in broiler chicken houses over short (weeks) and long (years) timescales. We extracted DNA from dust samples collected from commercial chicken and egg production facilities in Pennsylvania, USA. Quantitative PCR was used to assess wild-type virus detectability and concentration. Using data from 1018 dust samples with Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects models, we determined the factors that correlated with virus prevalence across farms. Maximum likelihood and autocorrelation function estimation on 3727 additional dust samples were used to document and characterize virus concentrations within houses over time. Overall, wild-type virus was detectable at least once on 36 of 104 farms at rates that varied substantially between farms. Virus was detected in one of three broiler-breeder operations (companies), four of five broiler operations, and three of five egg layer operations. Marek's disease virus detectability differed by production type, bird age, day of the year, operation (company), farm, house, flock, and sample. Operation (company) was the most important factor, accounting for between 12% and 63.4% of the variation in virus detectability. Within individual houses, virus concentration often dropped below detectable levels and reemerged later. These data characterize Marek's disease virus dynamics, which are potentially important to the evolution of the virus.

TI  - Assessment of Satellite-Derived Surface Reflectances by NASA's CAR Airborne Radiometer over Railroad Valley Playa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - CAR (Cloud Absorption Radiometer) is a multi-angular and multi-spectral airborne radiometer instrument, whose radiometric and geometric characteristics are well calibrated and adjusted before and after each flight campaign. CAR was built by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) in 1984. On 16 May 2008, a CAR flight campaign took place over the well-known calibration and validation site of Railroad Valley in Nevada, USA (38.504 degrees N, 115.692 degrees W). The campaign coincided with the overpasses of several key EO (Earth Observation) satellites such as Landsat-7, Envisat and Terra. Thus, there are nearly simultaneous measurements from these satellites and the CAR airborne sensor over the same calibration site. The CAR spectral bands are close to those of most EO satellites. CAR has the ability to cover the whole range of azimuth view angles and a variety of zenith angles depending on altitude and, as a consequence, the biases seen between satellite and CAR measurements due to both unmatched spectral bands and unmatched angles can be significantly reduced. A comparison is presented here between CAR's land surface reflectance (BRF or Bidirectional Reflectance Factor) with those derived from Terra/MODIS (MOD09 and MAIAC), Terra/MISR, Envisat/MERIS and Landsat-7. In this study, we utilized CAR data from low altitude flights (approx. 180 m above the surface) in order to minimize the effects of the atmosphere on these measurements and then obtain a valuable ground-truth data set of surface reflectance. Furthermore, this study shows that differences between measurements caused by surface heterogeneity can be tolerated, thanks to the high homogeneity of the study site on the one hand, and on the other hand, to the spatial sampling and the large number of CAR samples. These results demonstrate that satellite BRF measurements over this site are in good agreement with CAR with variable biases across different spectral bands. This is most likely due to residual aerosol effects in the EO derived reflectances.

TI  - Development of high-resolution dynamic dust source function - A case study with a strong dust storm in a regional model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A high-resolution dynamic dust source has been developed in the NASA Unified-Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) model to improve the existing coarse static dust source. In the new dust source map, topographic depression is in 1-km resolution and surface bareness is derived using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The new dust source better resolves the complex topographic distribution over the Western United States where its magnitude is higher than the existing, coarser resolution static source. A case study is conducted with an extreme dust storm that occurred in Phoenix, Arizona in 02-03 UTC July 6, 2011. The NU-WRF model with the new high-resolution dynamic dust source is able to successfully capture the dust storm, which was not achieved with the old source identification. However the case study also reveals several challenges in reproducing the time evolution of the short-lived, extreme dust storm events. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Observation of Wind Direction Change on the Sea Surface Temperature Front Using High-Resolution Full Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we derive high-resolution wind speeds and directions from full-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Previous wind retrieval result from conventional single-polarization SAR data has a limitation to resolve small-scale structures in the surface wind because external wind direction data with coarser spatial resolution than those of SARs have been commonly used as an input. Using fully polarimetric SAR data, however, both wind speed and direction can be derived with high resolution from the image itself without any ancillary data. We derive wind field off the southern coast of Korea from the Radarsat-2 quad-polarization data and investigate the spatial variation. The retrieved wind field from the Radarsat-2 image presents a detailed structure including small-scale variations which is unobtainable from conventional wind observations. Comparison of the derived wind directions with in-situ buoy wind measurements shows a small difference of 8 degrees which is regarded as sufficient to analyze small-scale wind vector changes. The retrieved wind field off the southern coast of Korea demonstrates the distinct patterns of direction changes. While blowing over the sea surface temperature (SST) frontal zone, the veering angles of wind vectors decrease and then are restored. The analysis of SAR-derived wind vectors with coinciding temperature distributions confirms that the variation in SAR-derived wind vectors on the SST fronts is mainly induced by the stability effect. This study also addresses the important role of precise wind direction retrieval on the accuracy of retrieved wind speed.

TI  - Local resection of the stomach for gastric cancer
T2  - SURGERY TODAY
M3  - Review
AB  - The local resection of the stomach is an ideal method for preventing postoperative symptoms. There are various procedures for performing local resection, such as the laparoscopic lesion lifting method, non-touch lesion lifting method, endoscopic full-thickness resection, and laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery. After the invention and widespread use of endoscopic submucosal dissection, local resection has become outdated as a curative surgical technique for gastric cancer. Nevertheless, local resection of the stomach in the treatment of gastric cancer in now expected to make a comeback with the clinical use of sentinel node navigation surgery. However, there are many issues associated with local resection for gastric cancer, other than the normal indications. These include gastric deformation, functional impairment, ensuring a safe surgical margin, the possibility of inducing peritoneal dissemination, and the associated increase in the risk of metachronous gastric cancer. In view of these issues, there is a tendency to regard local resection as an investigative treatment, to be applied only in carefully selected cases. The ideal model for local resection of the stomach for gastric cancer would be a combination of endoscopic full-thickness resection of the stomach using an ESD device and hand sutured closure using a laparoscope or a surgical robot, for achieving both oncological safety and preserved functions.

TI  - A national evaluation using standardised patient actors to assess STI services in public sector clinical sentinel surveillance facilities in South Africa
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Quality concerns in STI service delivery and missed opportunities for integration with HIV testing and prevention services in South Africa have been well documented. This national evaluation aimed to evaluate current utilisation and adherence to national STI guidelines, including partner notification and integration with HIV services, for diagnosis and management of STIs.Methods Facility surveys assessed infrastructure and resource availability, and standardised patient (SP) assessments evaluated quality of STI care in 50 public clinics in nine provinces in South Africa. The primary outcome was the proportion of SPs receiving essential STI care, defined as: offered an HIV test, condoms, partner notification counselling and correct syndromic treatment. Weighted proportions were generated, and SP findings were compared by gender using chi(2) tests with Rao-Scott correction.Results More than 80% of facilities reported medications in stock, with the exceptions of oral cefixime (48.3%), oral erythromycin (75.1%) and paediatric syrups. Among 195 SP encounters, 18.7% (95% CI 10.7% to 30.5%) received all hypothesised essential STI services: offered HIV test (67.1%), offered condoms (31.4%), partner notification counselling (70.2%) and recommended syndromic treatment (60.7%). Men were more likely than women to be offered all services (25.1% vs 12.3%, p=0.023), recommended treatment (70.7% vs 50.9%, p=0.013) and partner notification counselling (79.9% vs 60.6%, p=0.020). Only 6.3% of providers discussed male circumcision with male SPs, and 26.3% discussed family planning with female SPs.Conclusions This evaluation of STI services across South Africa found gaps in the availability of medications, adherence to STI guidelines, condom provision and prevention messaging. Limited integration with HIV services for this high-risk population was a missed opportunity. Quality of STI care should continue to be monitored, and interventions to improve quality should be prioritised as part of national strategic HIV and primary healthcare agendas.

TI  - The rheological evolution of the 2014/2015 eruption at Holuhraun, central Iceland
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the period from August 29, 2014, to February 27, 2015, the largest basaltic eruption of the last 200 years in Iceland occurred within the tectonic fissure swarm between the Baroabunga-Vcioivotn and the Askja volcanic systems. The eruption took place in the Holuhraun lava field, 45 km northeast of the Baroabunga volcano and 20 km south of the Askja volcano. It emplaced over 1.2 km(3) dense rock equivalent (DRE) of lava in an area of very low topographic relief. In light of the minimal topographic forcing, lava flow emplacement can be viewed as having been effectively controlled by the lava's temperature-dependent rheology. Here we combine field and remote sensing data collected during the week of the 17th to 22nd of November 2014 to constrain the lava's flow path, its velocity, deformation rate and thermal evolution during emplacement. We combine these with measurements of the pure liquid viscosity and the sub-liquidus rheological evolution of the lava during crystallization. Sub-liquidus experiments were performed at a range of constant cooling and shear rates, to mimic the conditions experienced by the lava during emplacement. These data can also be used to infer flow conditions of partly degassed magma within dike-swarms during transport towards the surface. The data show that the effective viscosity of the lava drastically increases until reaching a specific sub-liquidus temperature, the rheological cutoff temperature" (T-cutoff). This departure to high viscosity is a consequence of the onset of crystallization and is found to be primarily controlled by the imposed cooling rate. Our data indicate that shear rate exerts a second-order effect on this rheological departure and Tcutoff. We discuss the experimental dataset in the context of the reconstructions of the natural emplacement conditions and describe the implications for the 2014-2015 lava flow field at Holuhraun as well as lava flow modelling in general.

TI  - Habitat conservation redlines for the giant pandas in China
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the impossibility to cover the entire population of an endangered species in protected areas, a new approach (species conservation redlines) was recently been proposed in China. It constitutes the baseline space for species conservation but mapping and managing a species redline is not clear. In this study, a procedure on how to map habitat conservation redlines for the endangered giant panda was proposed. Panda habitat was first modeled based on field survey and remotely sensed data. Redline area was proposed after comparing three different scenarios, covering different proportions of panda habitat and populations. Results showed that the proposed redline area covered 9358 km(2). This area can protect more than 80% of the populations in all mountain regions in the study area, while keeping the connectivity of the habitat. The current nature reserves cover 60% of the redline area. Suggestions on how to manage redline areas inside and outside reserves are proposed, to limit human development activities in panda habitat. Our study provided a new approach for managing panda habitat, and would have implications for conservation of other endangered species in China and the world. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evaluating simplified methods for liquefaction assessment for loss estimation
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, some catastrophe models used by the insurance industry account for liquefaction by applying a simple factor to shaking-induced losses. The factor is based only on local liquefaction susceptibility and this highlights the need for a more sophisticated approach to incorporating the effects of liquefaction in loss models. This study compares 11 unique models, each based on one of three principal simplified liquefaction assessment methods: liquefaction potential index (LPI) calculated from shear-wave velocity, the HAZUS software method and a method created specifically to make use of USGS remote sensing data. Data from the September 2010 Darfield and February 2011 Christchurch earthquakes in New Zealand are used to compare observed liquefaction occurrences to forecasts from these models using binary classification performance measures. The analysis shows that the best-performing model is the LPI calculated using known shear-wave velocity profiles, which correctly forecasts 78% of sites where liquefaction occurred and 80% of sites where liquefaction did not occur, when the threshold is set at 7. However, these data may not always be available to insurers. The next best model is also based on LPI but uses shear-wave velocity profiles simulated from the combination of USGS V-S30 data and empirical functions that relate V-S30 to average shear-wave velocities at shallower depths. This model correctly forecasts 58% of sites where liquefaction occurred and 84% of sites where liquefaction did not occur, when the threshold is set at 4. These scores increase to 78 and 86 %, respectively, when forecasts are based on liquefaction probabilities that are empirically related to the same values of LPI. This model is potentially more useful for insurance since the input data are publicly available. HAZUS models, which are commonly used in studies where no local model is available, perform poorly and incorrectly forecast 87% of sites where liquefaction occurred, even at optimal thresholds. This paper also considers two models (HAZUS and EPOLLS) for estimation of the scale of liquefaction in terms of permanent ground deformation but finds that both models perform poorly, with correlations between observations and forecasts lower than 0.4 in all cases. Therefore these models potentially provide negligible additional value to loss estimation analysis outside of the regions for which they have been developed.

TI  - Rise and fall of Ross Sea emperor penguin colony populations: 2000 to 2012
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There are seven emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colonies distributed throughout the traditional boundaries of the Ross Sea from Cape Roget to Cape Colbeck. This coastline is c. 10% of the entire coast of Antarctica. From 2000 to 2012, there has been a nearly continuous record of population size of most, and sometimes all, of these colonies. Data were obtained by analysing aerial photographs. We found large annual variations in populations of individual colonies, and conclude that a trend from a single emperor penguin colony may not be a good environmental sentinel. There are at least four possibilities for census count fluctuations: i) this species is not bound to a nesting site like other penguins, and birds move within the colony and possibly to other colonies, ii) harsh environmental conditions cause a die-off of chicks in the colony or of adults elsewhere, iii) the adults skip a year of breeding if pre-breeding foraging is inadequate and iv) if sea ice conditions are unsatisfactory at autumn arrival of the adults, they skip breeding or go elsewhere. Such variability indicates that birds at all Ross Sea colonies should be counted annually if there is to be any possibility of understanding the causes of population changes.

TI  - Analysis of Urban Green Spaces Based on Sentinel-2A: Case Studies from Slovakia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion and its ecological footprint increases globally at an unprecedented scale and consequently, the importance of urban greenery assessment grows. The diversity and quality of urban green spaces (UGS) and human well-being are tightly linked, and UGS provide a wide range of ecosystem services (e.g., urban heat mitigation, stormwater infiltration, food security, physical recreation). Analyses and inter-city comparison of UGS patterns and their functions requires not only detailed information on their relative quantity but also a closer examination of UGS in terms of quality and land use, which can be derived from the land cover composition and spatial structure. In this study, we present an approach to UGS extraction from newly available Sentinel-2A satellite imagery, provided in the frame of the European Copernicus program. We investigate and map the spatial distribution of UGS in three cities in Slovakia: Bratislava, Zilina and Trnava. Supervised maximum likelihood classification was used to identify UGS polygons. Based on their function and physiognomy, each UGS polygon was assigned to one of the fifteen classes, and each class was further described by the proportion of tree canopy and its ecosystem services. Our results document that the substantial part of UGS is covered by the class Urban greenery in family housing areas (mainly including privately-owned gardens) with the class abundance between 17.7% and 42.2% of the total UGS area. The presented case studies showed the possibilities of semi-automatic extraction of UGS classes from Sentinel-2A data that may improve the transfer of scientific knowledge to local urban environmental monitoring and management.

TI  - Feasibility of Axillary Reverse Mapping and Clinicopathological Features Predicting ARM Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer-a Pilot Study.
T2  - Indian journal of surgical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The axillary reverse mapping (ARM) technique has been described as an attempt to map and preserve the upper extremity lymphatic drainage during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and/or SLNB. This technique is based on the hypothesis that the lymphatic pathway from the upper extremity is not involved by metastasis from primary breast cancer. The ARM node/s however, has been found, in various studies, to be involved with metastatic foci in patients with extensive axillary lymph node metastases. Therefore, the oncological safety of this procedure has not yet been determined. In this pilot study, we assessed the ARM node intraoperatively for various parameters and compared it to final HPR, to try and determine the oncologic safety of preserving the ARM node. Seventy-two breast cancer patients were screened for this prospective pilot study which was planned to recruit 20 patients. The study was initiated on May 2014, 20 patients were recruited till July 2015. Eligibility criterion was as follows: patients requiring primary axillary lymph node dissection based on a clinically positive axilla. Forty-five patients were ineligible because they had either received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or underwent previous axillary surgery or axillary radiation (exclusion criteria). Seven patients refused to give consent. ARM node identification rate was 75%. The most common location of the ARM node was lateral to the latissimus dorsi pedicle (42.10%), none of them being malignant. None of the oval or firm nodes were malignant. Tumor deposits were identified in 13%. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) had 100% specificity, 94.4% negative predictive value, 100% positive predictive value, and 50% sensitivity. ARM is feasible using blue dye alone, with an acceptable identification rate. Location, consistency, and intraoperative FNAC of the ARM node, put together, may be reliable parameters to predict involvement of the ARM node with metastasis.

TI  - Monitoring Horizontal and Vertical Cropping Pattern and Dynamics in Bihar over a Decade (2001-2012) Based on Time-Series Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing population and natural disasters like drought, flood, cyclone etc., has impacted global agriculture area and hence continuously modifying cropping pattern and associated statistics. The present study analysed agriculture dynamics over one of the densely populated and disaster prone state (Bihar) in India and derived vital statistics (single, double and triple cropping area, and monthly, seasonal, annual and long term status at the state and district level) for the years 2001-2012. The study used time-series MODIS vegetation index (EVI; MOD13A2, 1 km, 16 day, 2001-2012), MODIS annual Land Cover product (MCD12Q1, 500 m, 2001-2012) and Global Land Cover map (Scasia_V4, 1 km, 2000; Globcover_V2.2, 300 m, 2005/2006 and V2.3, 2009, 300 m), and extracted horizontal (i.e., area change) and vertical (i.e., cropping intensification) agriculture change pattern. The results were inter-compared, and validated using government reports as well as with high spatial resolution data (IRS-LISS III 23.5 m). From 2001-2006 to 2007-2012, the net horizontal and vertical change in agriculture area is +145.24 and +907.82 km(2), respectively, and net change in seasonal crop area (winter, summer and monsoon) is +959.21, +1009.84 and -1061.64 km(2), respectively. The districts which are located along the eastern part of Ganges experienced maximum positive changes and the districts along Gandak river in the north-western part of the study area experienced maximum negative changes. Overall, the study has quantified and revealed interesting space-time agriculture change patterns over 12 years including impacts caused by droughts and floods in the study area.

TI  - ALOS PALSAR and Hyperion Data Fusion for Land Use Land Cover Feature Extraction
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed and enhanced land use land cover (LULC) feature extraction is possible by merging the information extracted from two different sensors of different capability. In this study different pixel level image fusion algorithms (PCA, Brovey, Multiplicative, Wavelet and combination of PCA & IHS) are used for integrating the derived information like texture, roughness, polarization from microwave data and high spectral information from hyperspectral data. Span image which is total intensity image generated from Advanced Land observing Satellite-Phase array L-band SAR (ALOS-PALSAR) quad polarization data and EO-1 Hyperion data (242 spectral bands) were used for fusion. Overall PCA fused images had shown better result than other fusion techniques used in this study. However, Brovey fusion method was found good for differentiating urban features. Classification using support vector machines was conducted for classifying Hyperion, ALOS PALSAR and fused images. It was observed that overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient with PCA fused images was relatively better than other fusion techniques as it was able to discriminate various LULC features more clearly.

TI  - A Wireless Sensor Network Using GNSS Receivers for a Short-Term Assessment of the Modal Properties of the Neckartal Bridge
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present a novel structural health monitoring system based on a wireless sensor network for GNSS (global navigation satellite system) receivers. The GNSS network presented here consists of three GNSS rover stations and one base station that are deployed at the Neckartal bridge on the Autobahn A81 in southwest Germany. The newly-developed GNSS sensor nodes support satellite data logging up to a sampling rate of 20 Hz. Due to the ultra-low-power consumption achieved by the wake-up receiver during inactive periods, the nodes offer a lifetime from 20 to almost 200 days, without energy harvesting and depending on the satellite data logging period. By performing differential post-processing, precise positioning information in the millimeter range could be achieved. Using the GNSS sensors, we determined resonant frequencies at 0.33 Hz and 1.31 Hz, mainly in the lateral direction of the bridge. To verify the GNSS results, we placed an accelerometer on the bridge. The frequencies detected by the acceleration sensor correspond well to the frequencies found by the GNSS sensors, although the accelerometer measured further higher frequencies as it is probably more sensitive to small amplitudes.

TI  - Vector bionomics and malaria transmission along the Thailand-Myanmar border: a baseline entomological survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Baseline entomological surveys were conducted in four sentinel sites along the Thailand-Myanmar border to address vector bionomics and malaria transmission in the context of a study on malaria elimination. Adult Anopheles mosquitoes were collected using human-landing catch and cow-bait collection in four villages during the rainy season from May-June, 2013. Mosquitoes were identified to species level by morphological characters and by AS-PCR. Sporozoite indexes were determined on head/thoraces of primary and secondary malaria vectors using real-time PCR. A total of 4,301 anopheles belonging to 12 anopheline taxa were identified. Anopheles minimus represented >98% of the Minimus Complex members (n=1,683), whereas the An. maculatus group was composed of two dominant species, An. sawadwongporni and An. maculatus. Overall, 25 Plasmodium-positive mosquitoes (of 2,323) were found, representing a sporozoite index of 1.1% [95%CI 0.66-1.50]. The transmission intensity as measured by the EIR strongly varied according to the village (ANOVA, F=17.67, df= 3, P<0.0001). Our findings highlight the diversity and complexity of the biting pattern of malaria vectors along the Thailand-Myanmar border that represent a formidable challenge for malaria control and elimination.

TI  - An Improved Aerosol Optical Depth Map Based on Machine-Learning and MODIS Data: Development and Application in South America
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In zones where aerosol properties have been poorly characterized, satellite-based (MODIS) and ground-based (AERONET) aerosol optical depth (AOD) values typically differ. In this work, we use machine-learning based methods (artificial neural networks and support vector machines) to obtain corrected AOD values taken from MODIS in regions that are positioned far from AERONET stations. The method has been validated using several approaches. The area suitable for improvement covers 62% of the South American continent, and the degree of improvement compared to MODIS values, expressed in terms of the fraction of data within the MODIS error, was found to be 38% and 86% for the Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. The results show absolute monthly average differences between the MODIS and the proposed method of up to +/- 0.6 AOD units. The MODIS AOD distribution for the analyzed period shows a mode of -0.04, while that for the method presented here is 0.08.

TI  - Validation of GlobSnow-2 snow water equivalent over Eastern Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Quebec, Eastern Canada, snowmelt runoff contributes more than 30% of the annual energy reserve for hydroelectricity production, and uncertainties in annual maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) over the region are one of the main constraints for improved hydrological forecasting. Current satellite-based methods for mapping SWE over Quebec's main hydropower basins do not meet Hydro-Quebec operational requirements for SWE accuracies with less than 15% error. This paper assesses the accuracy of the GlobSnow-2 (GS-2) SWE product, which combines microwave satellite data and in situ measurements, for hydrological applications in Quebec. GS-2 SWE values for a 30-year period (1980 to 2009) were compared with space- and time-matched values from a comprehensive dataset of in situ SWE measurements (a total of 38,990 observations in Eastern Canada). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the GS-2 SWE product is 94.1 +/- 20.3 mm, corresponding to an overall relative percentage error (RPE) of 35.9%. The main sources of uncertainty are wet and deep snow conditions (when SWE is higher than 150 mm), and forest cover type. However, compared to a typical stand-alone brightness temperature channel difference algorithm, the assimilation of surface information in the GS-2 algorithm clearly improves SWE accuracy by reducing the RPE by about 30%. Comparison of trends in annual mean and maximum SWE between surface observations and GS-2 over 1980-2009 showed agreement for increasing trends over southern Quebec, but less agreement on the sign and magnitude of trends over northern Quebec. Extended at a continental scale, the GS-2 SWE trends highlight a strong regional variability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping exposure to particulate pollution during severe haze episode using improved MODIS AOT-PM<sub>10</sub> regression model with synoptic meteorology classification
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe smoke haze from biomass burning is frequently observed in Northern Thailand during dry months of February-April. Sparsely located monitoring stations operated in this vast mountainous region could not provide sufficient particulate matter (PM) data for exposure risk assessment. Satellite aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data could be used, but their reliable relationship with ground-based PM data should be first established. This study aimed to improve the regression model between PM10 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AOT with consideration of synoptic patterns to better assess the exposure risk in the area. Among four synoptic patterns, each representing the totality of meteorology governing Northern Thailand on a given day, most severe haze days belonged to pattern 2 that featured conditions of clear sky, stagnant air, and high PM10 levels. AOT-24h PM10 regression model for pattern 2 had coefficient of determination improved to 0.51 from 0.39 of combined case. Daily exposure maps to PM10 in most severe haze period of February-April 2007 were produced for Chiangmai, the largest and most populated province in Northern Thailand. Regression model for pattern 2 was used to convert 24h PM10 ranges of modified risk scale to corresponding AOT ranges, and the mapping was done using spatially continuous AOT values. The highest exposure risk to PM10 was shown in urban populated areas. Larger numbers of forest fire hot spots and more calm winds were observed on the days of higher exposure risk. Early warning and adequate health care plan are necessary to reduce exposure risk to future haze episodes in the area.

TI  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - ONKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for 20% of nonmelanoma skin cancer and is one of the most frequent cancer types. Diagnosis is based on clinical features and histopathology. Histologically controlled complete surgical excision is the gold standard in the treatment of primary SCC. Sentinel node biopsy can be considered in tumors > 6 mm thickness, but its relevance is not clear yet. Radiotherapy is discussed in inoperable primary tumors or can be used as an adjuvant therapy. In SCC with distant metastases, various chemotherapeutic agents are used; however, there is no standard regimen. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors or immune checkpoint blocker can be discussed as treatment options-preferentially in clinical trials due to limited evidence. A risk-adapted follow-up is recommended including primarily dermatologic examinations and in case of high risk of metastatic spread also ultrasound.

TI  - Contemporary management of patients with penile cancer and lymph node metastasis
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Penile cancer is a rare disease that causes considerable physical and psychological patient morbidity, especially at advanced stages. Patients with low-stage nodal metastasis can achieve durable survival with surgery alone, but those with extensive locoregional metastasis have overall low survival. Contemporary management strategies for lymph node involvement in penile cancer aim to minimize the morbidity associated with traditional radical inguinal lymphadenectomy through appropriate risk stratification while optimizing oncological outcomes. Modified (or superficial) inguinal lymph node dissection and dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy are diagnostic modalities that have been recommended in patients with high-risk primary penile tumours and nonpalpable inguinal lymph nodes. In addition, advances in minimally invasive and robot-assisted lymphadenectomy techniques are being investigated in patients with penile cancer and might further decrease lymphadenectomy-related adverse effects. The management of patients with advanced disease has evolved to include multimodal treatment with systemic chemotherapy before surgical intervention and can include adjuvant chemotherapy after pelvic lymphadenectomy. The role of radiotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting remains largely unclear, owing to a lack of high-level evidence of possible benefits. New targeted therapies have shown efficacy in squamous cell carcinomas of other sites and might also prove effective in patients with penile cancer.

TI  - Aerodynamic Roughness Length Estimation with Lidar and Imaging Spectroscopy in a Shrub-Dominated Dryland
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerodynamic roughness length (Z(0m)) serves an important role in the flux exchange between the land surface and atmosphere. In this study, airborne lidar (ALS), terrestrial lidar (TLS), and imaging spectroscopy data were integrated to develop and test two approaches to estimate Z(0m) over a shrub dominated dryland study area in south-central Idaho, USA. Sensitivity of the two parameterization methods to estimate Z(0m) was analyzed. The comparison of eddy covariancederived Z(0m) and remote sensing-derived Z(0m) showed that the accuracy of the estimated Z(0m) heavily depends on the estimation model and the representation of shrub (e. g., Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis) height in the models. The geometrical method (RA1994) led to 9 percent (similar to 0.5 cm) and 25% (similar to 1.1 cm) errors at site 1 and site 2, respectively, which performed better than the height variability-based method (MR1994) with bias error of 20 percent and 48 percent at site 1 and site 2, respectively. The RA1994 model resulted in a larger range of Z(0m) than the MR1994 method. We also found that the mean, median and 75th percentiles of heights (H75) from ALS provides the best Z(0m) estimates in the MR1994 model, while the mean, median, and MAD (Median Absolute Deviation from Median Height), as well as AAD (Mean Absolute Deviation from Mean Height) heights from ALS provides the best Z(0m) estimates in the RA1994 model. In addition, the fractional cover of shrub and grass, distinguished with ALS and imaging spectroscopy data, provided the opportunity to estimate the frontal area index at the pixel-level to assess the influence of grass and shrub on Z(0m) estimates in the RA1994 method. Results indicate that grass had little effect on Z(0m) in the RA1994 method. The Z(0m) estimations were tightly coupled with vegetation height and its local variance for the shrubs. Overall, the results demonstrate that the use of height and fractional cover from remote sensing data are promising for estimating Z(0m), and thus refining land surface models at regional scales in semiarid shrublands.

TI  - Diurnal Variation of Summer Precipitation across the Central Tian Shan Mountains
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatic features of the diurnally varying summer precipitation over and around the central Tian Shan Mountains are investigated. Both the hourly rainfall data observed at eight stations along a transect across the mountains and the convective index derived from the satellite data show that there are three distinct regimes: the early morning peak at stations to the south of the mountains, the late afternoon peak at stations on the mountains, and the night peak at stations to the north of the mountains. The relation between regimes of diurnal variation is analyzed. By defining the regional rainfall event (RRE), the initial stations of each RRE are recorded. The early morning rainfall in the southern periphery of the mountains is triggered locally in the southern basin. Both the late afternoon peak over the mountains and the night peak in the northern periphery are influenced by mountain-originated rainfall events. These rainfall events appear over the mountains in the afternoon, and some of them move northward and lead to the nocturnal rainfall in the northern basin. The triggering of convection in the afternoon over the mountains and that in the early morning in the southern basin is related to the diurnally varying wind and thermodynamic conditions over and around the mountains. Low-level convergence with thermodynamic instability appears at noon (night) over the mountains (in the southern basin) just before the start of the convection.

TI  - Quantifying the Spatiotemporal Trends of Canopy Layer Heat Island (CLHI) and Its Driving Factors over Wuhan, China with Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy layer heat islands (CLHIs) in urban areas are a growing problem. In recent decades, the key issues have been how to monitor CLHIs at a large scale, and how to optimize the urban landscape to mitigate CLHIs. Taking the city of Wuhan as a case study, we examine the spatiotemporal trends of the CLHI along urban-rural gradients, including the intensity and footprint, based on satellite observations and ground weather station data. The results show that CLHI intensity (CLHII) decays exponentially and significantly along the urban-rural gradients, and the CLHI footprint varies substantially and especially in winter. We then quantify the driving factors of the CLHI by establishing multiple linear regression (MLR) models with the assistance of ZY-3 satellite data (with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m), and obtain five main findings: (1) built-up area had a significant positive effect on daily mean CLHII in summer and a negative effect in winter; (2) vegetation had significant inhibiting effects on daily mean CLHII in both summer and winter; (3) absolute humidity has a significant inhibiting effect on daily mean CLHII in summer and a positive effect in winter; (4) anthropogenic heat emissions exacerbated the daily mean CLHII by about 0.19 degrees C (90% confidence interval -0.06-0.44 degrees C) on 17 September 2013 and by about 0.06 degrees C (0.06-0.19 degrees C) on 23 January 2014; and (5) if most of the urban area is transformed into roads (i.e., an extreme case), we estimate that the daily mean CLHII would reach 1.41 degrees C (0.38-2.44 degrees C) on 17 September 2013 and 0.14 degrees C (0.08-0.2 degrees C) on 23 January 2014 in Wuhan metropolitan area. Overall, the results provide new insights into quantifying the CLHI and its driving factors, to enhance our understanding of urban heat islands.

TI  - Evaluating the Use of DMSP/OLS Nighttime Light Imagery in Predicting PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in the Northeastern United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Degraded air quality by PM2.5 can cause various health problems. Satellite observations provide abundant data for monitoring PM2.5 pollution. While satellite-derived products, such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been widely used in estimating PM2.5 concentration, little research was focused on the use of remotely sensed nighttime light (NTL) imagery. This study evaluated the merits of using NTL satellite images in predicting ground-level PM2.5 at a regional scale. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to estimate the PM2.5 concentration and analyze its relationships with AOD, meteorological variables, and NTL data across the New England region. Observed data in 2013 were used to test the constructed GWR models for PM2.5 prediction. The Vegetation Adjusted NTL Urban Index (VANUI), which incorporates Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI into NTL to overcome the defects of NTL data, was used as a predictor variable for final PM2.5 prediction. Results showed that Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) NTL imagery could be an important dataset for more accurately estimating PM2.5 exposure, especially in urbanized and densely populated areas. VANUI data could obviously improve the performance of GWR for the warm season (GWR model with VANUI performed 17% better than GWR model without NDVI and NTL data and 7.26% better than GWR model without NTL data in terms of RMSE), while its improvements were less obvious for the cold season (GWR model with VANUI performed 3.6% better than the GWR model without NDVI and NTL data and 1.83% better than the GWR model without NTL data in terms of RMSE). Moreover, the spatial distribution of the estimated PM2.5 levels clearly revealed patterns consistent with those densely populated areas and high traffic areas, implying a close and positive correlation between VANUI and PM2.5 concentration. In general, the DMSP/OLS NTL satellite imagery is promising for providing additional information for PM2.5 monitoring and prediction.

TI  - Remote Sensing Studies of Suspended Sediment Concentration Variations in a Coastal Bay During the Passages of Atmospheric Cold Fronts
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mississippi River, the largest river in North America, carries a significant amount of sediment into the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal waters. In this region, recurring wind events associated with atmospheric cold fronts between fall and the following spring dominate resuspension and transport of the sediment. In this paper, based on a time series of the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellite images with a moderate spatial resolution of 250 m during the passages of three atmospheric cold fronts in March 2013, considering the entire process of cold fronts, the distribution and variation of total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration and underlying hydrodynamic mechanism were analyzed. The TSS concentration distribution and sediment transport in the Atchafalaya Bay within the Mississippi River estuary were found to be positively correlated with the magnitude of local winds and waves, and negatively correlated with bathymetry. During the prefrontal stage, concentrations in the offshore water always decreased as a result of the wind-induced landward sediment transport. In the shallower water, the variations of TSS concentration are dominated by the intensity of wind stress. In the postfrontal period, the variations of TSS were controlled by wind-driven currents, resuspension, and vertical mixing. Although there were some exceptional situations due to the variations of the characteristics of wind and wind-induce wave, in general, the TSS concentration decreased in the entire region.

TI  - Remote sensing analysis of the changes in the ecotone of mangrove forests and <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> saltmarshes
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests and saltmarshes are the most important types of coastal wetlands in the world. In southeastern coastal areas of China, the competition between Spartina alterniflora saltmarshes and mangrove forests has become an important problem. In order to investigate the rules of spatial competition between Spartina alterniflora saltmarshes and mangrove forests, this paper selected Yunxiao National Nature Reserve of Mangroves which locates in Zhangjiang Estuary, Fujian Province, as the study area. We used the Landsat and Google Earth imageries covering this area from 1988 to 2014. Maximum likelihood classification was used to obtain the change of the total area of the mangrove forest and the Spartina alterniflora saltmarsh over nearly 30 years. The results showed that : 1) the expanding rate of the mangrove forest was fast in 1990's, but it slowed down after 2004; 2) Spartina alterniflora firstly appeared in the image of 2002 and it spreaded towards the elevated area at a low rate, but the expanding rate was accelerated after 2010; 3) The boundary between the mangrove forest and Spartinaalterniflora mainly remained stable, with an expansion of the mangrove forest in some areas; 4) The distribution of tidal creeks and the closure of mangrove canopy may influence the spatial pattern of the junction region of mangrove forests and Spartina alterniflora saltmarshes.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS and Landsat multiband vegetation indices used for wheat yield estimation in irrigated Indus Basin
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation has significant importance for policy makers to make timely dicisions on import/export of particular crop. Traditionally, in Pakistan crop yield estimation is being carried out by Village Master Sampling (VMS) that is laborious and time-consuming. Satellite imagery is also being used as an alternative to estimate vegetation health and yield. Various vegetation indices are being used for the purpose however, their efficiency to estimate yield has not been tested. In this study, a comparison was performed among various satellite-based vegetation indices e.g. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), to evaluate most appropriate index that performs better in cropping area of irrigated Indus Basin (a complex basin with spatially heterogeneous land use). A stepwise regression based model was developed for remotely sensed crop (i.e. Wheat) using multi-band MODIS and Landsat 8 products based on Land use and Land cover map developed by Semi-Supervised Classification. The results revealed that SAVI showed a fairly acceptable association with reported yield data as compared to other indices. The correlation coefficient (R-2) was estimated at 0.60. Yield estimated by SAVI obtained from Landsat 8 showed good results with R-2 and Pearson correlation (r), estimated at 0.74 and 0.88 as compared to SAVI obtained from MODIS with 0.63 and 0.79 respectively. The results support that SAVI vegetation indices is reliable for quick and efficient wheat area mapping under Pakistani's farm conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Evil Animal: A Terror Management Theory Perspective on the Human Tendency to Kill Animals
T2  - PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This research tested whether support for the killing of animals serves a terror management function. In five studies, death primes caused participants to support the killing of animals more than control primes, unless the participants' self-esteem had been elevated (Study 4). This effect was not moderated by gender, preexisting attitudes toward killing animals or animal rights, perceived human-animal similarity, religiosity, political orientation, or by the degree to which the killing was justified. Support for killing animals after subliminal death primes was also associated with an increased sense of power and invulnerability (Study 5). Implications and future directions are discussed.

TI  - Assessment of Chlorophyll-a Remote Sensing Algorithms in a Productive Tropical Estuarine-Lagoon System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote estimation of chlorophyll-a in turbid and productive estuaries is difficult due to the optical complexity of Case 2 waters. Although recent advances have been obtained with the use of empirical approaches for estimating chlorophyll-a in these environments, the understanding of the relationship between spectral reflectance and chlorophyll-a is based mainly on temperate and subtropical estuarine systems. The potential to apply standard NIR-Red models to productive tropical estuaries remains underexplored. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of several approaches based on multispectral data to estimate chlorophyll-a in a productive tropical estuarine-lagoon system, using in situ measurements of remote sensing reflectance, Rrs. The possibility of applying algorithms using simulated satellite bands of modern and recent launched sensors was also evaluated. More accurate retrievals of chlorophyll-a (r(2) > 0.80) based on field datasets were found using NIR-Red three-band models. In addition, enhanced chlorophyll-a retrievals were found using the two-band algorithm based on bands of recently launched satellites such as Sentinel-2/MSI and Sentinel-3/OLCI, indicating a promising application of these sensors to remotely estimate chlorophyll-a for coming decades in turbid inland waters. Our findings suggest that empirical models based on optical properties involving water constituents have strong potential to estimate chlorophyll-a using multispectral data from satellite, airborne or handheld sensors in productive tropical estuaries.

TI  - An improved physical split-window algorithm for precipitable water vapor retrieval exploiting the water vapor channel observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new atmospheric precipitable water vapor (PWV) retrieval method based on three thermal infrared band observations from geostationary satellites. The proposed method is similar to the traditional physical split-window (PSW) retrieval technique, but a water vapor channel observation near 6.7 mu m was included. Sensitivity analyses and simulation retrievals were carried out respectively according to the instrument characteristics of the Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer onboard FengYun-2G (SVISSR/FY-2G) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard Terra (MODIS/Terra). The results indicate that the proposed 3-band algorithm can significantly reduce PWV retrieval errors caused by surface emissivity uncertainty and observation errors, especially in dry atmospheric conditions (i.e., PWV < 2 cm). The proposed algorithm was validated using SVISSR/FY-2G and MODIS/Terra observations, and was compared with radiosonde and GPS PWV. The determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and bias between the SVISSR retrieved PWV and the radiosonde PWV are 0.87, 0.43 cm and 0.14 cm, respectively. The R-2, RMSE and bias of the MODIS retrieved PWV are 0.89, 0.10 cm and - 0.042 cm, respectively, which are slightly better than the MODIS L2 thermal infrared and near-infrared PWV products.

TI  - An Object-based Approach for Two-level Gully Feature Mapping Using High-resolution DEM and Imagery: A Case Study on Hilly Loess Plateau Region, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully feature mapping is an indispensable prerequisite for the motioning and control of gully erosion which is a widespread natural hazard. The increasing availability of high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and remote sensing imagery, combined with developed object-based methods enables automatic gully feature mapping. But still few studies have specifically focused on gully feature mapping on different scales. In this study, an object-based approach to two-level gully feature mapping, including gully-affected areas and bank gullies, was developed and tested on 1-m DEM and Worldview-3 imagery of a catchment in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The methodology includes a sequence of data preparation, image segmentation, metric calculation, and random forest based classification. The results of the two-level mapping were based on a random forest model after investigating the effects of feature selection and class-imbalance problem. Results show that the segmentation strategy adopted in this paper which considers the topographic information and optimal parameter combination can improve the segmentation results. The distribution of the gully-affected area is closely related to topographic information, however, the spectral features are more dominant for bank gully mapping. The highest overall accuracy of the gully-affected area mapping was 93.06% with four topographic features. The highest overall accuracy of bank gully mapping is 78.5% when all features are adopted. The proposed approach is a creditable option for hierarchical mapping of gully feature information, which is suitable for the application in hily Loess Plateau region.

TI  - Real-time and short-term predictions of spring phenology in North America from VIIRS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time prediction of vegetation phenology is critical for assisting crop monitoring, natural resource management, and land modeling in weather prediction systems. However, due to the lack of timely available satellite datasets and the inherent noise in time series, little attention has been paid to real-time and short-term predictions of vegetation phenology. The successful launch of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument onboard operational Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite makes this research possible because it can provide land surface observations in a timely fashion. This study introduces an operational system that provides real-time and short-term predictions of vegetation phenology. Specifically, the system integrates timely available VIIRS observations and the climatology (expectation and standard deviation) of vegetation phenology from long-term MODIS data to simulate a set of potential temporal trajectories of greenness development at a given time for each pixel. These potential trajectories are then applied to identify spring green leaf development in real time, predict the occurrence of greenup onset, mid-greenup phase and maturity onset, and analyze the uncertainty of the prediction across a variety of ecosystems in North America. The accuracy of real-time and short-term predictions was evaluated by comparing with standard VIIRS detections and near-surface PhenoCam observations in both 2014 and 2015 across North America. The results showed that the real-time prediction of spring phenological metrics from VIIRS were all significantly correlated with those derived from PhenoCam datasets (R-2> 0.96, P< 0.01) and closely comparable to the standard VIIRS detections with a mean absolute difference of <10 days, 5 days and 5 days in greenup onset, mid-greenup phase and maturity onset, respectively. The mean absolute difference in the northern region for all three events was relatively smaller than that in the southern region. These findings demonstrate the capability of VIIRS observations to effectively predict temporal dynamics of vegetation phenology in real time at a continental scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Monitoring the Invasion of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> Using Multi-source High-resolution Imagery in the Zhangjiang Estuary, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) is one of the most harmful invasive plants in China. Google Earth (GE), as a free software, hosts high-resolution imagery for many areas of the world. To explore the use of GE imagery for monitoring S. alterniflora invasion and developing an understanding of the invasion process of S. alterniflora in the Zhangjiang Estuary, the object-oriented method and visual interpretation were applied to GE, SPOT-5, and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) images. In addition, landscape metrics of S. alterniflora patches adjacent to mangrove forests were calculated and mangrove gaps were recorded by checking whether S. alterniflora exists. The results showed that from 2003-2015, the areal extent of S. alterniflora in the Zhangjiang Estuary increased from 57.94 ha to 116.11 ha, which was mainly converted from mudflats and moved seaward significantly. Analyses of the S. alterniflora expansion patterns in the six subzones indicated that the expansion trends varied with different environmental circumstances and human activities. Land reclamation, mangrove replantation, and mudflat aquaculture caused significant losses of S. alterniflora. The number of invaded gaps increased and S. alterniflora patches adjacent to mangrove forests became much larger and more aggregated during 2003-2015 (the class area increased from 12.13 ha to 49.76 ha and the aggregation index increased from 91.15 to 94.65). We thus concluded that S. alterniflora invasion in the Zhangjiang Estuary had seriously increased and that measures should be taken considering the characteristics shown in different subzones. This study provides an example of applying GE imagery to monitor invasive plants and illustrates that this approach can aid in the development of governmental policies employed to control S. alterniflora invasion.

TI  - Seasonal Timing for Estimating Carbon Mitigation in Revegetation of Abandoned Agricultural Land with High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland salinity is a major land management issue globally, and results in the abandonment of farmland. Revegetation with halophytic shrub species such as Atriplex nummularia for carbon mitigation may be a viable option but to generate carbon credits ongoing monitoring and verification is required. This study investigated the utility of high-resolution airborne images (Digital Multi Spectral Imagery (DMSI)) obtained in two seasons to estimate carbon stocks at the plant- and stand-scale. Pixel-scale vegetation indices, sub-pixel fractional green vegetation cover for individual plants, and estimates of the fractional coverage of the grazing plants within entire plots, were extracted from the high-resolution images. Carbon stocks were correlated with both canopy coverage (R-2: 0.76-0.89) and spectral-based vegetation indices (R-2: 0.77-0.89) with or without the use of the near-infrared spectral band. Indices derived from the dry season image showed a stronger correlation with field measurements of carbon than those derived from the green season image. These results show that in semi-arid environments it is better to estimate saltbush biomass with remote sensing data in the dry season to exclude the effect of pasture, even without the refinement provided by a vegetation classification. The approach of using canopy cover to refine estimates of carbon yield has broader application in shrublands and woodlands.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In this paper, the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of NPP and related factors in the Heihe River basin were analyzed using the meteorological data of the Heihe River basin, SPOT/NDVI data, and other modified mathematical statistical methods. The results show that during the 1999-2010 period the total NPP in the Heihe River basin exhibited a fluctuating increasing trend, reaching 0.3x10(12) gC/a. The multiyear variation value of NPP was 0.19 similar to 601.09 gC/m(2)/a in the whole basin, 3.5 gC/m(2)/a in the upper reaches, 2.06 gC/m(2)/a in the middle reaches, and 0.31 g/m(2)/a in the lower reaches. The NPP of vegetation in the Heihe River basin during January and February tended to slightly decrease, and on average varied between -0.01 and -0.02 gC/m(2)/a, while in June, July, August, and September greatly increased. The NPP of 10 vegetation types exhibited an increasing trend in 2010 compared to 1999, on average increased by 21.02 gC/m(2)/a. Among various vegetation types the increase in the NPP value of swamp vegetation was the largest, reaching 46.24 gC/m(2)/a followed by planted vegetation, steppe types, and meadow types; there values were 39.22 gC/m(2)/a, 32.49 gC/m(2)/a, and 27.63 gC/m(2)/a, respectively. The accumulated NPP in grassland ecosystem in the Heihe River basin was the largest, which is of important significance to the eco-environment of the basin. As viewed for the whole Heihe River basin, the yearly mean cumulative value of NPP of vegetation was negatively related to annual mean temperature and annual total solar radiation but positively related to annual total precipitation, suggesting that water is a limiting factor to the NPP in the Heihe River basin.

TI  - Surgical management of breast cancer in China: the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center experience
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Chinese women, and early-stage patients are significantly increasing. Surgery is the main treatment for early-stage breast cancer with the "minimally invasive procedures" concept. The modality of breast cancer surgery has changed greatly in recent years in China, especially in our cancer center, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC). Firstly, presurgery biopsy is a routine procedure, which is mainly assisted by imaging instruments. Secondly, the number of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and simple mastectomy procedures with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy (SM +/- SLNB) is increasing gradually; radical mastectomy (RM) and modified radical mastectomy (MRM) are decreasing annually. Thirdly, SLNB has become a routine procedure in our center; it is safe and effective for replacing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Finally, reconstruction surgery has progressively advanced, although the operation cases are limited. This review article looks back at the development of breast cancer surgery, highlights the hallmarks of surgical management in our center as well as in China and discusses the future necessary efforts to improve the outcome and life quality for Chinese patients.

TI  - Flood Inundation Mapping from Optical Satellite Images Using Spatiotemporal Context Learning and Modest AdaBoost
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its capacity for temporal and spatial coverage, remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for mapping inundation. Many methods have been applied effectively in remote sensing flood analysis. Generally, supervised methods can achieve better precision than unsupervised. However, human intervention makes its results subjective and difficult to obtain automatically, which is important for disaster response. In this work, we propose a novel procedure combining spatiotemporal context learning method and Modest AdaBoost classifier, which aims to extract inundation in an automatic and accurate way. First, the context model was built with images to calculate the confidence value of each pixel, which represents the probability of the pixel remaining unchanged. Then, the pixels with the highest probabilities, which we define as permanent pixels', were used as samples to train the Modest AdaBoost classifier. By applying the strong classifier to the target scene, an inundation map can be obtained. The proposed procedure is validated using two flood cases with different sensors, HJ-1A CCD and GF-4 PMS. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation results showed that the proposed procedure can achieve accurate and robust mapping results.

TI  - Essence or experience? A new direction for African psychology
T2  - THEORY & PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the attempts of psychologists in South Africa to Africanize the discipline. Beginning with a brief history of psychology on the continent, it contextualizes the call for an African psychology by outlining the state of the broader discipline in post-apartheid South Africa as well as the emergence of Afrocentric psychology in the United States. The article interrogates further the notion of an African worldview and suggests that Afrocentric psychologists remain beholden to Eurocentric audiencesthe result of their continued marginalization by a Eurocentric discipline. Drawing on Fanon's image of a Manichean psychology, the paper argues that African psychologyinstead of organizing itself around cultural questionsmust commit itself to a psychological analysis of the violence that exemplifies life in South Africa.

TI  - Species classification using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-acquired high spatial resolution imagery in a heterogeneous grassland
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating spatio-temporal variations of species composition in grassland is an essential step in evaluating grassland health conditions, understanding the evolutionary processes of the local ecosystem, and developing grassland management strategies. Space-borne remote sensing images (e.g., MODIS, Landsat, and Quickbird) with spatial resolutions varying from less than 1 m to 500 m have been widely applied for vegetation species classification at spatial scales from community to regional levels. However, the spatial resolutions of these images are not fine enough to investigate grassland species composition, since grass species are generally small in size and highly mixed, and vegetation cover is greatly heterogeneous. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as an emerging remote sensing platform offers a unique ability to acquire imagery at very high spatial resolution (centimetres). Compared to satellites or airplanes, UAVs can be deployed quickly and repeatedly, and are less limited by weather conditions, facilitating advantageous temporal studies. In this study, we utilize an octocopter, on which we mounted a modified digital camera (with near-infrared (NIR), green, and blue bands), to investigate species composition in a tall grassland in Ontario, Canada. Seven flight missions were conducted during the growing season (April to December) in 2015 to detect seasonal variations, and four of them were selected in this study to investigate the spatio-temporal variations of species composition. To quantitatively compare images acquired at different times, we establish a processing flow of UAV-acquired imagery, focusing on imagery quality evaluation and radiometric correction. The corrected imagery is then applied to an object-based species classification. Maps of species distribution are subsequently used for a spatio-temporal change analysis. Results indicate that UAV-acquired imagery is an incomparable data source for studying fine-scale grassland species composition, owing to its high spatial resolution. The overall accuracy is around 85% for images acquired at different times. Species composition is spatially attributed by topographical features and soil moisture conditions. Spatio-temporal variation of species composition implies the growing process and succession of different species, which is critical for understanding the evolutionary features of grassland ecosystems. Strengths and challenges of applying UAV-acquired imagery for vegetation studies are summarized at the end. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - Sentinel node necrosis is a negative prognostic factor in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a magnetic resonance imaging study of 252 patients
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We explored the patterns of sentinel node metastasis and investigated the prognostic value of sentinel node necrosis (SNN) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Methods This retrospective study enrolled 252 patients at our institution who had metastatic lymph nodes from biopsy-confirmed NPC and who were treated with definitive radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy. All participants underwent MRI before treatment, and the resulting images were reviewed to evaluate lymph node status. The patients were divided into SNN and non-SNN groups. Overall survival (OS), tumour-free survival (TFS), regional relapse-free survival (RRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were compared using the log-rank test. Factors predictive of outcome were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis.Results Of the 252 patients, 189 (75%) had retropharyngeal lymph node metastasis, and 189 (75%) had level IIA or IIB lymph node necrosis. The incidence of SNN was 43.4% (91 of 210 patients with lymph node metastasis or necrosis, or both). After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year rates of OS, TFS, RRFS, and DMFS in the SNN and non-SNN groups were, respectively, 79.4% and 95.3%, 73.5% and 93.3%, 80.4% and 96.6%, and 75.5% and 95.3% (all p < 0.01). Age greater than 40 years, SNN, T stage, and N stage were significant independent negative prognostic factors for OS, TFS, RRFS, and DMFS.Conclusions Metastatic retropharyngeal lymph nodes and necrotic level II nodes both seem to act as sentinels. Sentinel node necrosis is an negative prognostic factor in patients with NPC. Patients with SNN have a worse prognosis.

TI  - Evaluation Criteria on the Design for Assimilating Remote Sensing Data Using Variational Approaches
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing, as a powerful tool for monitoring atmospheric phenomena, has been playing an increasingly important role in inverse modeling. Remote sensing instruments measure quantities that often combine several state variables as one. This creates very strong correlations between the state variables that share the same observation variable. This may cause numerical problems resulting in a low convergence rate or inaccurate estimates in gradient-based variational assimilation if improper error statistics are used. In this paper, two criteria or scoring rules are proposed to quantify the numerical robustness of assimilating a specific set of remote sensing observations and to quantify the reliability of the estimates of the parameters. The criteria are derived by analyzing how the correlations are created via shared observation data and how they may influence the process of variational data assimilation. Experimental tests are conducted and show a good level of agreement with theory. The results illustrate the capability of the criteria to indicate the reliability of the assimilation process. Both criteria can be used with observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) and in combination with other verification scores.

TI  - Retrieving aboveground biomass of wetland <i>Phragmites australis</i> (common reed) using a combination of airborne discrete-return LiDAR and hyperspectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland biomass is essential for monitoring the stability and productivity of wetland ecosystems. Conventional field methods to measure or estimate wetland biomass are accurate and reliable, but expensive, time consuming and labor intensive. This research explored the potential for estimating Wetland reed biomass using a combination of airborne discrete-return Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral data. To derive the optimal predictor variables of reed biomass, a range of LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics at different spatial scales were regressed against the field-observed biomasses. The results showed that the LiDAR-derived H_p99 (99th percentile of the LiDAR height) and hyperspectral-calculated modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) were the best metrics for estimating reed biomass using the single regression model. Although the LiDAR data yielded a higher estimation accuracy compared to the hyperspectral data, the combination of LiDAR and hyperspectral data produced a more accurate prediction model for reed biomass (R-2 = 0.648, RMSE = 167.546 g/m(2), RMSEr =20.71%) than LiDAR data alone. Thus, combining LiDAR data with hyperspectral data has a great potential for improving the accuracy of aboveground biomass estimation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-Feature Joint Sparse Model for the Classification of Mangrove Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are valuable contributors to coastal ecosystems, and remote sensing is an indispensable way to obtain knowledge of the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems. Due to the similar spectral features between mangroves and other land cover types, challenges are posed since the accuracy is sometimes unsatisfactory in distinguishing mangroves from other land cover types with traditional classification methods. In this paper, we propose a classification method named the multi-feature joint sparse algorithm (MF-SRU), in which spectral, topographic, and textural features are integrated as the decision-making features, and sparse representation of both center pixels and their eight neighborhood pixels is proposed to represent the spatial correlation of neighboring pixels, which can make good use of the spatial correlation of adjacent pixels. Experiments are performed on Landsat Thematic Mapper multispectral remote sensing imagery in the Zhangjiang estuary in Southeastern China, and the results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the extraction accuracy of mangroves.

TI  - Uncertainty Quantification of Soil Moisture Estimations Based on a Bayesian Probabilistic Inversion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) inversions based on active microwave remote sensing have shown promising progress but do not easily meet expected application requirements because a number of inversion algorithms can only produce point estimates of SM and cannot quantify the uncertainty of SM inversions. Although previous studies have reported Bayesian maximum posterior estimations that are capable of retrieving SM within a probabilistic framework, they have primarily focused on the optimal estimators of SM and have typically ignored the uncertainty of SM inversions. This paper presents an SM probabilistic inversion (PI) algorithm based on Bayes' theorem and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique and capable of revealing the uncertainty of SM inversions and obtaining highly accurate SM estimates via maximum likelihood estimations (MLEs). The algorithm is implemented based on the advanced integral equation model, water cloud model simulations, and dual-polarized TerraSAR-X observations. The ground SM and vegetation water content (VWC) measurements from the Heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research experiments are applied for validation. The results show that: 1) uncertainties in SM inversions, defined with respect to the measures of dispersion of SM posterior probability distribution, are approximately 0.1-0.12 m(3)/m(3) and 2) an acceptable inversion accuracy is obtained via MLEs, which present an SM Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.045 and 0.047 m(3)/m(3) for bare and vegetated soils, respectively, and a VWC RMSE of 0.45 kg/m(2). The presented PI can quantify the uncertainty in SM inversions; therefore, it should be useful for improving active microwave remote sensing estimations of SM.

TI  - Simultaneous inversion of multiple land surface parameters from MODIS optical-thermal observations
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface parameters from remote sensing observations are critical in monitoring and modeling of global climate change and biogeochemical cycles. Current methods for estimating land surface variables usually focus on individual parameters separately even from the same satellite observations, resulting in inconsistent products. Moreover, no efforts have been made to generate global products from integrated observations from the optical to Thermal InfraRed (TIR) spectrum. Particularly, Middle InfraRed (MIR) observations have received little attention due to the complexity of the radiometric signal, which contains both reflected and emitted radiation.In this paper, we propose a unified algorithm for simultaneously retrieving six land surface parameters - Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), land surface albedo, Land Surface Emissivity (LSE), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Upwelling Longwave radiation (LWUP) by exploiting MODIS visible-to-TIR observations. We incorporate a unified physical radiative transfer model into a data assimilation framework. The MODIS visible-to-TIR time series datasets include the daily surface reflectance product and MIR-to-TIR surface radiance, which are atmospherically corrected from the MODIS data using the Moderate Resolution Transmittance program (MODTRAN, ver. 5.0). LAI was first estimated using a data assimilation method that combines MODIS daily reflectance data and a LAI phenology model, and then the LAI was input to the unified radiative transfer model to simulate spectral surface reflectance and surface emissivity for calculating surface broadband albedo and emissivity, and FAPAR. LST was estimated from the MIR-TIR surface radiance data and the simulated emissivity, using an iterative optimization procedure. Lastly, LWUP was estimated using the LST and surface emissivity. The retrieved six parameters were extensively validated across six representative sites with different biome types, and compared with MODIS, GLASS, and GlobAlbedo land surface products. The results demonstrate that the unified inversion algorithm can retrieve temporally complete and physically consistent land surface parameters, and provides more accurate estimates of surface albedo, LST, and LWUP than existing products, with R-2 values of 0.93 and 0.62, RMSE of 0.029 and 0.037, and BIAS values of 0.016 and 0.012 for the retrieved and MODIS albedo products, respectively, compared with field albedo measurements; R-2 values of 0.95 and 0.93, RMSE of 2.7 and 4.2 K, and BIAS values of -0.6 and -2.7 K for the retrieved and MODIS LST products, respectively, compared with field LST measurements; and R2 values of 0.93 and 0.94, RMSE of 18.2 and 22.8 W/m(2), and BIAS values of -2.7 and -14.6 W/m(2) for the retrieved and MODIS LWUP products, respectively, compared with field LWUP measurements.

TI  - Long Temporal Analysis of 3-km MODIS Aerosol Product Over East China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 3-km resolution MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol product has advantages for local-scale aerosol monitoring over land. This study assessed the accuracy and feasibility of the product over East China and investigated the potential for aerosol climatology studies. The long-temporal aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the product from 2002 to 2015 was collected and analyzed. Validation results show good overall accuracy. The correlation coefficient between MODIS AOD and ground measurements of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) is 0.79, and 63.1% data points arewithin the expected error range. However, in some areas, the MODIS AODs are highly overestimated because of bias and noise. Seasonal average AOD maps indicate the spatio-temporal distributions of aerosol. In general, seasonal AOD values follow the sequence summer > spring >fall> winter. Higher AODs (> 1.0) usually occur over urban areas and cropland whereas lower values coincide with forest, shrub, and grassland. A simple moving average technique was applied to remove noise. Trend slopes were calculated and the significances were tested. Most areas show remarkable increases in AOD values prior to 2010, followed by significant downward trends. Differences in MODIS AOD were calculated between 2002 and 2009 and 2010 and 2015. Despite significant downward trends after 2010, the AODs are still higher than before 2010. The study demonstrates potential application of the 3 km product in aerosol climatology but confirms that it is crucial to first remove noise.

TI  - Duration of indwelling drain following instrumented posterolateral fusion of the lumbar spine does not predict surgical site infection requiring reoperation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and predictors of reoperation for surgical site infections (SSI) among patients whose lumbar, closed wound suction drains were removed in the inpatient setting prior to hospital discharge (pre-discharge cohort) versus after inpatient discharge during the first follow up visit (post-discharge cohort). All patients who were admitted for first-time, posterolateral decompression and fusion for degenerative lumbar spine disease were retrospectively reviewed at a single institution. In order to eliminate biases, neither the pre-discharge nor post-discharge cohorts experienced any intra-/postoperative sentinel events other than the primary outcome measure: reoperation for SSI. Of 209 patients in the pre-discharge (n =130) and post-discharge (n = 79) cohorts, 15 patients required reoperation for SSI. Although time to drain discontinuation was significantly longer in the post-discharge (8.28 days) than the pre-discharge (4.65 days) cohorts (p < 0.001), the incidences of reoperation for SSI did not significantly differ (6.33 vs 7.69%, respectively, p = 0.711). In a multivariable regression, only smoking (OR = 5.75, p = 0.007) and depression (OR = 4.11, p = 0.040) predicted reoperation for SSI. Neither time to drain removal nor setting of drain removal was a predictor of reoperation for SSI. Although time to drain discontinuation was expectedly longer in the post-discharge versus pre-discharge cohorts, the incidences of reoperation for SSI did not significantly differ. Neither time to drain removal nor setting of drain removal predicted reoperation for SSI. These results suggest that patients may be safely discharged from the hospital with the surgical drain in place. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global Analysis of Bioclimatic Controls on Ecosystem Productivity Using Satellite Observations of Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem productivity models rely on regional climatic information to estimate temperature and moisture constraints influencing plant growth. However, the productivity response to these environmental factors is uncertain at the global scale and has largely been defined using limited observations from sparse monitoring sites, including carbon flux towers. Recent studies have shown that satellite observations of Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) are highly correlated with ecosystem Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). Here, we use a relatively long-term global SIF observational record from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) sensors to investigate the relationships between SIF, used as a proxy for GPP, and selected bio-climatic factors constraining plant growth at the global scale. We compared the satellite SIF retrievals with collocated GPP observations from a global network of tower carbon flux monitoring sites and surface meteorological data from model reanalysis, including soil moisture, Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), and minimum daily air temperature (Tmin). We found strong correspondence (R-2 > 80%) between SIF and GPP monthly climatologies for tower sites characterized by mixed, deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needleleaf forests, and croplands. For other land cover types including savanna, shrubland, and evergreen broadleaf forest, SIF showed significant but higher variability in correlations between sites. In order to analyze temperature and moisture related effects on ecosystem productivity, we divided SIF by photosynthetically active radiation (SIFp) and examined partial correlations between SIFp and the climatic factors across a global range of flux tower sites, and over broader regional and global extents. We found that productivity in arid ecosystems is more strongly controlled by soil water content to an extent that soil moisture explains a higher proportion of the seasonal cycle in productivity than VPD. At the global scale, ecosystem productivity is affected by joint climatic constraint factors so that VPD, Tmin, and soil moisture were significant (p < 0.05) controls over 60, 59, and 35 percent of the global domain, respectively. Our study identifies and confirms dominant climate control factors influencing productivity at the global scale indicated from satellite SIF observations. The results are generally consistent with climate response characteristics indicated from sparse global tower observations, while providing more extensive coverage for verifying and refining global carbon and climate model assumptions and predictions.

TI  - Multi-phenology WorldView-2 imagery improves remote sensing of savannah tree species
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity mapping in African savannah is important for monitoring changes and ensuring sustainable use of ecosystem resources. Biodiversity mapping can benefit from multi-spectral instruments such as WorldView-2 with very high spatial resolution and a spectral configuration encompassing important spectral regions not previously available for vegetation mapping. This study investigated i) the benefits of the eight-band WorldView-2 (WV-2) spectral configuration for discriminating tree species in Southern African savannah and ii) if multiple-images acquired at key points of the typical phenological development of savannahs (peak productivity, transition to senescence) improve on tree species classifications. We first assessed the discriminatory power of WV-2 bands using interspecies-Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) via Band Add-On procedure and tested the spectral capability of WorldView-2 against simulated IKONOS for tree species classification. The results from interspecies-SAM procedure identified the yellow and red bands as the most statistically significant bands (p = 0.000251 and p = 0.000039 respectively) in the discriminatory power of WV-2 during the transition from wet to dry season (April). Using Random Forest classifier, the classification scenarios investigated showed that i) the 8-bands of the WV-2 sensor achieved higher classification accuracy for the April date (transition from wet to dry season, senescence) compared to the March date (peak productivity season) ii) the WV-2 spectral configuration systematically outperformed the IKONOS sensor spectral configuration and iii) the multi-temporal approach (March and April combined) improved the discrimination of tress species and produced the highest overall accuracy results at 80.4%. Consistent with the interspecies-SAM procedure, the yellow (605 nm) band also showed a statistically significant contribution in the improved classification accuracy from WV-2. These results highlight the mapping opportunities presented by WV-2 data for monitoring the distribution status of e.g. species often harvested by local communities (e.g. Sclerocharya birrea), encroaching species, or species-specific tree losses induced by elephants.

TI  - Characterizing urban expansion of Korla City and its spatial-temporal patterns using remote sensing and GIS methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities provide spatial contexts for populations and economic activities. Determining the spatial-temporal patterns of urban expansion is of particular significance for regional sustainable development. To achieve a better understanding of the spatial-temporal patterns of urban expansion of Korla City, we explore the urban expansion characteristics of Korla City over the period 1995-2015 by employing Landsat TM/ETM+ images of 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Urban land use types were classified using the supervised classification method in ENVI 4.5. Urban expansion indices, such as expansion area, expansion proportion, expansion speed, expansion intensity, compactness, and fractal dimension, were calculated. The spatial-temporal patterns and evolution process of the urban expansion (e.g., urban gravity center and its direction of movement) were then quantitatively analyzed. The results indicated that, over the past 25 years, the area and proportion of urban land increased substantially with an average annual growth rate of 15.18%. Farmland and unused land were lost greatly due to the urban expansion. This result might be attributable to the rapid population growth and the dramatic economic development in this area. The city extended to the southeast, and the urban gravity center shifted to the southeast as well by about 2118 m. The degree of urban compactness tended to decrease and the fractal dimension index tended to increase, indicating that the spatial pattern of Korla City was becoming loose, complex, and unstable. This study could provide a scientific reference for the studies on urban expansion of oasis cities in arid land.

TI  - Topside ionospheric effects of the annular solar eclipse of 15th January 2010 as observed by DEMETER satellite
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present effects of the annular solar eclipse of 15th January 2010 on the topside ionosphere using the DEMETER satellite data. Measurements of the electron-ion density and electron temperature by the ISL (Instrument Sonde de Langmuir) and LAP (Instrument Analyseur de Plasma) instruments on board the DEMETER satellite during the eclipse time over the low latitude (+/- 40) Indian ocean area are presented. We found the peak decrease in electron density to be about 35% and the peak decrease in ion density to be about 40% from the reference orbits at the altitude of the satellite (similar to 660 km). Electron and ion temperatures were found to have decreased by 200-300 K at the same altitude. Instead of simple decrease as in ion density, electron temperature showed a complex wave-like oscillation as the solar eclipse progressed. Electron density decreased to a minimum value before the maximum obscuration and starts to increase before passing through another minimum at the time of maximum obscuration. Both the minima are located at the +/- 10 degrees geomagnetic latitude. Variations of electron and ion densities were found to follow the average solar illumination experienced by the satellite and its conjugate points at satellite altitude, while the electron temperature showed no such correlation.

TI  - Validation and Inter-Comparison of Spaceborne Derived Global and Continental Land Cover Products for the Mediterranean Region: The Case of Thessaly
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Space agencies, international and national organisations and institutions recognize the importance of regularly updated and homogenized land cover information, in the context of both nomenclature and spatial resolution. Moreover, ensuring credibility to the users through validated products with transparent procedures is similarly of great importance. To this end, this study contributes with a systematic accuracy performance evaluation of continental and global land cover layers. Confidence levels during validation and a weighted accuracy assessment were designed and applied. Google Earth imagery were employed to assess the accuracy of three land cover products for the years 2010 and 2012. Results indicate high weighted overall accuracy rates of 89, 90, and 86% for CORINE Land Cover 2012, GIO High Resolution Layers, and Globeland30 datasets, respectively. Moreover, their inter-comparison highlights notable differences especially for classes Artificial Surfaces and Water. The deviation of specific classes from the general producer's and user's accuracy trends were identified. It is concluded that the different aspects of the employed land cover products can be highlighted more transparently and objectively by integrating confidence levels during the reference data annotation, by employing a stratified sampling based on the several Corine Level-3 subclasses and by applying a weighted overall accuracy procedure.

TI  - Condition-dependent virulence of slow bee paralysis virus in <i>Bombus terrestris</i>: are the impacts of honeybee viruses in wild pollinators underestimated?
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV)-previously considered an obligate honeybee disease-is now known to be prevalent in bumblebee species. SBPV is highly virulent in honeybees in association with Varroa mites, but has been considered relatively benign otherwise. However, condition-dependent pathogens can appear asymptomatic under good, resource abundant conditions, and negative impacts on host fitness may only become apparent when under stressful or resource-limited conditions. We tested whether SBPV expresses condition-dependent virulence in its bumblebee host, Bombus terrestris, by orally inoculating bees with SBPV and recording longevity under satiated and starvation conditions. SBPV infection resulted in significant virulence under starvation conditions, with infected bees 1.6 times more likely to die at any given time point (a median of 2.3 h earlier than uninfected bees), whereas there was no effect under satiated conditions. This demonstrates clear condition-dependent virulence for SBPV in B. terrestris. Infections that appear asymptomatic in non-stressful laboratory assays may nevertheless have significant impacts under natural conditions in the wild. For multi-host pathogens such as SBPV, the use of sentinel host species in laboratory assays may further lead to the underestimation of pathogen impacts on other species in nature. In this case the impact of 'honeybee viruses' on wild pollinators may be underestimated, with detrimental effects on conservation and food security. Our results highlight the importance of multiple assays and multiple host species when testing for virulence, in order for laboratory studies to accurately inform conservation policy and mitigate disease impacts in wild pollinators.

TI  - Shelled pteropods in peril: Assessing vulnerability in a high CO<sub>2</sub> ocean
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems is a vital concern facing marine scientists and managers of ocean resources. Euthecosomatous pteropods (holoplanktonic gastropods) represent an excellent sentinel for indicating exposure to anthropogenic OA because of the sensitivity of their aragonite shells to the OA conditions less favorable for calcification. However, an integration of observations, experiments and modelling efforts is needed to make accurate predictions of how these organisms will respond to future changes to their environment. Our understanding of the underlying organismal biology and life history is far from complete and must be improved if we are to comprehend fully the responses of these organisms to the multitude of stressors in their environment beyond OA. This review considers the present state of research and understanding of euthecosomatous pteropod biology and ecology of these organisms and considers promising new laboratory methods, advances in instrumentation (such as molecular, trace elements, stable isotopes, palaeobiology alongside autonomous sampling platforms, CT scanning and high-quality video recording) and novel field-based approaches (i.e. studies of upwelling and CO2 vent regions) that may allow us to improve our predictive capacity of their vulnerability and/or resilience. In addition to playing a critical ecological and biogeochemical role, pteropods can offer a significant value as an early-indicator of anthropogenic OA. This role as a sentinel species should be developed further to consolidate their potential use within marine environmental management policy making.

TI  - An Enhanced Satellite-Based Algorithm for Detecting and Tracking Dust Outbreaks by Means of SEVIRI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust outbreaks are meteorological phenomena of great interest for scientists and authorities (because of their impact on the climate, environment, and human activities), which may be detected, monitored, and characterized from space using different methods and procedures. Among the recent dust detection algorithms, the RSTDUST multi-temporal technique has provided good results in different geographic areas (e.g., Mediterranean basin; Arabian Peninsula), exhibiting a better performance than traditional split window methods, in spite of some limitations. In this study, we present an optimized configuration of this technique, which better exploits data provided by Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) aboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites to address those issues (e.g., sensitivity reduction over arid and semi-arid regions; dependence on some meteorological clouds). Three massive dust events affecting Europe and the Mediterranean basin in May 2008/2010 are analysed in this work, using information provided by some independent and well-established aerosol products to assess the achieved results. The study shows that the proposed algorithm, christened eRST(DUST) (i.e., enhanced RSTDUST), which provides qualitative information about dust outbreaks, is capable of increasing the trade-off between reliability and sensitivity. The results encourage further experimentations of this method in other periods of the year, also exploiting data provided by different satellite sensors, for better evaluating the advantages arising from the use of this dust detection technique in operational scenarios.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Oil Spill Disasters Along Gulf of Mexico Using RADARSAT-2 SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the genetic algorithm is utilised for automatic detection of oil spills under wind speed conditions larger than 20 ms(-1). The procedure is implemented using sequences of RADARSAT-2 SAR ScanSAR Narrow single beam data acquired in the Gulf of Mexico. The study demonstrates that implementing crossover allows for generation of accurate oil spills pattern. This conclusion is confirmed by the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve indicates that the existence of oil slick footprints can be identified with the area under the ROC curve and the no-discrimination line of 85 %, which is greater than that of other surrounding environmental features. In conclusion, the genetic algorithm can be used as a tool for the automatic detection of oil spills and the ScanSAR Narrow single beam mode serves as an excellent sensor for oil spill detection and surveying under wind speed larger than 20 ms(-1).

TI  - Unsupervised Data Driven Feature Extraction by Means of Mutual Information Maximization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Earth observations technical literature, several methods have been proposed and implemented to efficiently extract a proper set of features for classification and segmentation purposes. However, these architectures show drawbacks when the considered datasets are characterized by complex interactions among the samples, especially when they rely on strong assumptions on noise and label domains. In this paper, a new unsupervised approach for feature extraction, based on data driven discovery, is introduced for accurate classification of remotely sensed data. Specifically, the proposed architecture exploits mutual information maximization in order to retrieve the most relevant features with respect to information measures. Experimental results on real datasets showthat the proposed approach represents a valid framework for feature extraction from remote sensing images.

TI  - Geochemical characterization of fluoride in water, table salt, active sediment, rock and soil samples, and its possible relationship with the prevalence of enamel fluorosis in children in four municipalities of the department of Huila (Colombia)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluoride is an element that affects teeth and bone formation in animals and humans. Though the use of systemic fluoride is an evidence-based caries preventive measure, excessive ingestion can impair tooth development, mainly the mineralization of tooth enamel, leading to a condition known as enamel fluorosis. In this study, we investigated the geochemical characterization of fluoride in water, table salt, active sediment, rock and soil samples in four endemic enamel fluorosis sentinel municipalities of the department of Huila, Colombia (Pitalito, Altamira, El Agrado and Rivera), and its possible relationship with the prevalence of enamel fluorosis in children. The concentration of fluoride in drinking water, table salt, active sediment, rock, and soil was evaluated by means of an ion selective electrode and the geochemical analyses were performed using X-ray fluorescence. Geochemical analysis revealed fluoride concentrations under 15 mg/kg in active sediment, rock and soil samples, not indicative of a significant delivery to the watersheds studied. The concentration of fluoride in table salt was found to be under the inferior limit ( less than 180 mu g/g) established by the Colombian regulations. Likewise, exposure doses for fluoride water intake did not exceed the recommended total dose for all ages from 6 months. Although the evidence does not point out at rocks, soils, fluoride-bearing minerals, fluoridated salt and water, the hypothesis of these elements as responsible of the current prevalence of enamel fluorosis cannot be discarded since, aqueducts might have undergone significant changes overtime.

TI  - Satellite-Based Method for Estimating the Spatial Distribution of Crop Evapotranspiration: Sensitivity to the Priestley-Taylor Coefficient
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work discusses an operational method for actual evapotranspiration (ET) retrieval from remote sensing, considering a minimum quantity of ancillary data. The method consists in a graphical approach based on the Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation, where the dry soil and non-limiting water conditions are defined by land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation index (VI) space, both retrieved from remote sensing. Using ET tower flux measurements and Landsat 5 TM images of an irrigation scheme in southeast Spain, a sensitivity analysis of ET spatial distribution was performed for the period 2009-2011 with respect to: (i) the shape (trapezoidal or rectangular) of the LST-VI space; and (ii) the value of the PT coefficient, . The results from ground truth validation were satisfactory, both shapes providing similar performances in estimating ET, with root mean square error -30 W/m(2) and relative difference similar to 10% with respect to tower-based measurements. Importantly, the best fit with ground data was found for close to 1, a somewhat different value from the commonly used value of 1.27, indicating that substantial error might arise when using the latter value. Overall, our study underlines the importance of a more precise knowledge of the actual value of coefficient when using ET retrieval methods based on the LST-VI space.

TI  - Synoptic Analysis and Hindcast of an Intense Bow Echo in Western Europe: The 9 June 2014 Storm
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - On Pentecost Monday, 9 June 2014, a severe linearly organized mesoscale convective system (MCS) hit Belgium and western Germany. This storm was one of the most severe thunderstorms in Germany in decades. The synoptic-scale and mesoscale characteristics of this storm are analyzed based on remote sensing data and in situ measurements. Moreover, the forecast potential of the storm is evaluated using sensitivity experiments with a regional climate model. The key ingredients for the development of the Pentecost storm were the concurrent presence of low-level moisture, atmospheric conditional instability, and wind shear. The synoptic and mesoscale analysis shows that the outflow of a decaying MCS above northern France triggered the storm, which exhibited the typical features of a bow echo like a bookend vortex and a rear-inflow jet. This resulted in hurricane-force wind gusts (reaching 40 m s(-1)) along a narrow swath in the Rhine-Ruhr region leading to substantial damage. Operational numerical weather prediction models mostly failed to forecast the storm, but high-resolution regional model hindcasts enable a realistic simulation of the storm. The model experiments reveal that the development of the bow echo is particularly sensitive to the initial wind field and the lower-tropospheric moisture content. Adequate initial and boundary conditions are therefore essential for realistic numerical forecasts of such a bow echo event. It is concluded that the Pentecost storm exhibited a comparable structure and a similar intensity to observed bow echo systems in the United States.

TI  - Expanding Perspectives on Evangelicalism: How Non-evangelical Students Appreciate Evangelical Christianity
T2  - REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Evangelical students pose a distinctive set of challenges to higher education professionals. These students, though advantaged to some degree because of their Christian identity, commonly report feeling marginalized and silenced on college campuses. In light of these tensions, the purpose of this study was to examine how non-evangelical students come to an appreciative understanding of evangelical Christianity. Specifically, the research focused on the specific campus conditions and experiences that influence non-evangelical students' appreciative attitudes toward evangelicals. Findings reveal distinct demographic, institution type, and academic major differences in those students' perspectives toward their evangelical peers. Additionally, the results suggest that appreciative attitudes toward evangelicals are associated with non-evangelical students' interfaith experiences, albeit to differing degrees based on self-identified worldview. Recognizing that the work of helping non-evangelical students develop an appreciative understanding of evangelicals is as complicated as it is challenging, especially in the collegiate context, the authors conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.

TI  - Using Landscape Characteristics to Predict Distribution of Temperate-Breeding Canada Geese
T2  - SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of species' distributions are needed to ensure that conservation-planning efforts are directed at appropriate areas. Since the early 1980s, temperate-breeding populations of Branta canadensis (Canada Goose) have increased, yet reliable estimates of the species' distribution are lacking in many regions. Our objective was to identify the landcover features that best predicted Canada Goose distribution. In April 2015, we surveyed 300 one-km(2) plots across North Carolina and observed 449 Canada Geese. We quantified percent coverage of 7 continuous landcover variables at 5 different spatial extents for each of the 300 plots. We fit logistic regression models using presence and absence at the 300 plots as the dependent variable and percent-cover covariates as independent variables. The best model for predicting Canada Goose presence included percent pasture within the 9 km(2) surrounding the survey plot and percent open water within the 1-km(2) survey plot. The probability of Canada Goose presence increased with increasing percent open water and percent pasture, albeit at different spatial extents, which provided important cover and food resources, respectively. Our approach using remote-sensing data to accurately predict Canada Goose presence across a large spatial extent can be employed to determine distributions for other easily surveyed, widely distributed species.

TI  - Vulvar carcinoma in Norway: A 50-year perspective on trends in incidence, treatment and survival
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To explore trends in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) incidence, age and stage at diagnosis, treatment and survival in Norway from 1961 to 2010.Methods. From 1961 to 2010, 2233 cases of vulvar SCC were extracted from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Data on age at diagnosis, tumor morphology, stage of the disease and treatment were analyzed. Age standardized incidence rates, adjusted to the Norwegian standard population, were computed. Relative survival was calculated as a ratio of the observed survival in the study population over the expected survival in the background population. Multivariate Cox model was fitted to estimate hazard ratios.Results. The overall incidence of vulvar SCC increased >2.5 fold (from 1.70 to 4.66 per 100,000 women/year; P < 0.01). Age-specific incidence rates increased among women aged <= 60 years (by 150% in age group 0-39 years, 175% in age group 40-49 years and 68% in age group 50-59 years). From 1971 to 2010, the percentage of patients receiving surgery as only treatment decreased from 81% to 61%, whereas the use of radiation and combination therapy (surgery and radiation) increased from 3% to 11% and 6% to 20%, respectively. 5-year relative survival increased significantly among women :580 years (from 72% to 83% among women aged :560 years and from 60% to 65% among women aged 61-80 years).Conclusions. The incidence of vulvar SCC has increased since the sixties, particularly among women younger than 60 years. Despite less aggressive surgical treatment, survival has improved. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Seasonal and interannual variability of the Douro turbid river plume, northwestern Iberian Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Douro River represents the major freshwater input into the coastal ocean of the northwestern Iberian Peninsula. The seasonal and interannual variability of its turbid plume is investigated using ocean color composites from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites (2000-2014) and long-term records of river discharge, wind and precipitation rate. Regional climate indices, namely the Eastern Atlantic (EA) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), were analyzed to identify the influence of atmospheric variability on the generation of anomalous turbid river plume patterns. The connection between the monthly time series of normalized water leaving radiance at 555 nm (nLw(555)) and river discharge is high (r = 0.81), which indicates a strong link between river outflow and turbidity levels in the river plume. The equivalent result is found between precipitation and nLw(555) time series, but the peak correlation was found with a 1-month lag, revealing the importance of the river dams on the outflow regulation (r = 0.65). Lag correlations between nLw(555) and EA index show a peak at 1-month lag (r = 0.51). The relation between NAO index and Douro river discharge is considerable (-0.50), for a time lag of 1-month as well. However, the correlation coefficient between nLw(555) and NAO index presents a maximum peak for a longer period (r = -0.42 at 3-month). Anomalous turbid plume patterns, not related with estuarine outflow, are found during autumn 2004. Acoccolithophore bloom is proposed as a plausible explanation for these unexpected turbid patches.

TI  - Microwave Thermal Emission at Tycho Area and Its Geological Significance
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tycho crater is the most prominent crater of Copernican era, the study on whose microwave thermal emission (MTE) can help us better understand the internal structures of the Moon surface. In this paper, the spatial and temporal features of the MTE at Tycho area are studied using the microwave sounder [Chang'E Lunar Microwave Sounder (CELMS)] data combined with TiO2 abundance, surface slope and roughness, and rock abundance data of the lunar regolith. The results indicate that Tycho crater is not only a hot spot at the southern crater wall, but also a cold spot at the northern crater floor. Moreover, the surface slope and its orientation is the dominant factor influencing the thermal anomalies at Tycho crater, whereas the surface roughness, rock abundance, and TiO2 abundance have a lesser effect. Furthermore, the brightness temperature difference data indicate variations between the surface and substrate structure, demonstrating the potential applications of the CELMS data for geological studies of the Moon surface.

TI  - Exploiting Deep Matching and SAR Data for the Geo-Localization Accuracy Improvement of Optical Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the geo-localization of optical satellite images is an important pre-processing step for many remote sensing tasks like monitoring by image time series or scene analysis after sudden events. These tasks require geo-referenced and precisely co-registered multi-sensor data. Images captured by the high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite TerraSAR-X exhibit an absolute geo-location accuracy within a few decimeters. These images represent therefore a reliable source to improve the geo-location accuracy of optical images, which is in the order of tens of meters. In this paper, a deep learning-based approach for the geo-localization accuracy improvement of optical satellite images through SAR reference data is investigated. Image registration between SAR and optical images requires few, but accurate and reliable matching points. These are derived from a Siamese neural network. The network is trained using TerraSAR-X and PRISM image pairs covering greater urban areas spread over Europe, in order to learn the two-dimensional spatial shifts between optical and SAR image patches. Results confirm that accurate and reliable matching points can be generated with higher matching accuracy and precision with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy for oral cancer: A prospective multicenter Phase II trial
T2  - AURIS NASUS LARYNX
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: A recent study identified a survival benefit with prophylactic neck dissection (ND) at the time of primary surgery as compared with watchful waiting followed by therapeutic neck dissection for nodal relapse, in patients with cN0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Alternative management of cN0 neck cancer is recommended to minimize the adverse effects of ND, indicating the need for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and limited neck dissection. We conducted a multicenter Phase II study to examine the feasibility of SNB for clinically N0 OSCC.Methods: Previously untreated N0 OSCC patients (n = 57) with clinical late-T2 or T3 tumors were enrolled across 10 institutions. SNB navigated with multislice frozen section analysis of sentinel nodes (SNs) and SNB supported sentinel node lymphatic basin dissection (SN basin dissection) were performed in a one-stage procedure. The endpoint was to investigate the rate of false-negative metastases after SN basin dissection and SNB alone.Results: Most tumors were late-T2 lesions (n = 50; 87.7%). SNs were identified in all patients. A total of 196 SNs were detected. Among these SNs, 35 (17.8%) were positive for metastasis (9 in level I, 12 in level II, 12 in level III, 1 in level V and 2 in the contralateral region of the neck). The false-negative rate of SNB supported by SN basin dissection and SNB alone was 4.5% and 9.1%, respectively. The concordance of the SN status in intraoperative frozen sections with the permanent histopathology was 97.4% (191/196). The sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative pathological evaluation were 85.7% (30/35) and 100% (30/30), respectively. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival was 89.5% and 82.5%, respectively. The OS of SN-negative patients was significantly longer than that of SN-positive patients (P = 0.047).Conclusion: The current study verified that SN basin dissection was a useful back-up procedure for SNB performed as a one-stage procedure, showing a low false-negative rate. SNB, alone is an appropriate staging method for patients with clinical N0 staging, and a reliable procedure to determine the appropriate levels for neck dissection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Post-Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Monitoring of Louisiana Salt Marshes Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the second largest marine oil spill in history, contaminated over a thousand kilometers of coastline in the Louisiana salt marshes and seriously threatened this valuable ecosystem. Measuring the impacts of the oil spill over the large and complex coast calls for the application of remote sensing techniques. This study develops a method for post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill monitoring of the damaged marsh vegetation using Landsat imagery. This study utilizes 10 years of Landsat data, from 2005 to 2014, to examine the longevity of the oil spill's impacts on the marsh vegetation. AVIRIS data collected between 2010 and 2012 are used to validate the Landsat results. Landsat imagery documents the significant effect of oiling on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the marsh vegetation in 2010 and 2011 (p < 0.01 in both cases). These results are corroborated by the AVIRIS data, which recorded the most severe impact in May 2011 followed by progressive recovery in October 2011 and October 2012. The Landsat imagery, combined with relevant environmental information and appropriate statistical tools, provides a robust and low-cost method for long-term post-oil spill monitoring of the marshes, revealing that the major aboveground impacts (at 30 m scale) of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on Louisiana salt marshes lasted for two years. The method presented is applicable for other hazardous events whenever pre-event referencing and long-term post-event monitoring are desired, thereby offering an effective and economical tool for disaster management.

TI  - Development of Geospatial and Temporal Characteristics for Hispaniola's Lake Azuei and Enriquillo Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we used Landsat imagery for water body identification to create a novel 36-year surface area extent time series for lakes Azuei (Haiti) and Enriquillo (Dominican Republic) aimed at illuminating the dramatic temporal changes of these two lakes not just at yearly but at monthly or even sub-monthly scales. We used the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to extract water features and we also used spatial differentiation and thresholding techniques to remove clouds and associated shadows from the scene that were then passed through gap filling algorithms to complete and extract the lake extent polygons. We also explored the challenges that arrive from trying to combine RS-based Digital Elevation Model data with locally collected bathymetric data to yield a seamless representation of the topographic features of the rift valley that contains the two lakes. This "bathtub" model was then meshed with the lake extent polygons to compute lake volumes, maximum depths, and geospatially referenced lake levels rating curves. We used this data to examine the lakes and their geospatial characteristics in the context of the lakes' growth/shrinking patterns. While we did not carry out a full hydrologic analysis we attempted to illuminate how specific lake levels cause what type of flooding and especially answered the questions if (a) Lake Azuei would ever spill into Lake Enriquillo, and (b) what the maximum lake levels need to be before spilling into neighboring watersheds.

TI  - Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation Changes in Multitemporal SAR Images for Event Landslides Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides cause damages and affect victims worldwide, but landslide information is lacking. Even large events may not leave records when they happen in remote areas or simply do not impact with vulnerable elements. This paper proposes a procedure to measure spatial autocorrelation changes induced by event landslides in a multi-temporal series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity Sentinel-1 images. The procedure first measures pixel-based changes between consecutive couples of SAR intensity images using the Log-Ratio index, then it follows the temporal evolution of the spatial autocorrelation inside the Log-Ratio layers using the Moran's I index and the semivariance. When an event occurs, the Moran's I index and the semivariance increase compared to the values measured before and after the event. The spatial autocorrelation growth is due to the local homogenization of the soil response caused by the event landslide. The emerging clusters of autocorrelated pixels generated by the event are localized by a process of optimal segmentation of the log-ratio layers. The procedure was used to intercept an event that occurred in August 2015 in Myanmar, Tozang area, when strong rainfall precipitations triggered a number of landslides. A prognostic use of the method promises to increase the availability of information about the number of events at the regional scale, and to facilitate the production of inventory maps, yielding useful results to study the phenomenon for model tuning, landslide forecast model validation, and the relationship between triggering factors and number of occurred events.

TI  - The application of Lean Six Sigma methodology to reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections in surgery departments
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale Nowadays, the monitoring and prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is a priority for the healthcare sector.Aims and objectives In this article, we report on the application of the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology to reduce the number of patients affected by sentinel bacterial infections who are at risk of HAI.Methods The LSS methodology was applied in the general surgery department by using a multidisciplinary team of both physicians and academics. Data on more than 20 000 patients who underwent a wide range of surgical procedures between January 2011 and December 2014 were collected to conduct the study using the departmental information system. The most prevalent sentinel bacteria were determined among the infected patients. The preintervention (January 2011 to December 2012) and postintervention (January 2013 to December 2014) phases were compared to analyze the effects of the methodology implemented. The methodology allowed the identification of variables that influenced the risk of HAIs and the implementation of corrective actions to improve the care process, thereby reducing the percentage of infected patients.Results The improved process resulted in a 20% reduction in the average number of hospitalization days between preintervention and control phases, and a decrease in the mean (SD) number of days of hospitalization amounted to 36 (15.68), with a data distribution around 3 sigma. The LSS is a helpful strategy that ensures a significant decrease in the number of HAIs in patients undergoing surgical interventions. The implementation of this intervention in the general surgery departments resulted in a significant reduction in both the number of hospitalization days and the number of patients affected by HAIs.Conclusions This approach, together with other tools for reducing the risk of infection (surveillance, epidemiological guidelines, and training of healthcare personnel), could be applied to redesign and improve a wide range of healthcare processes.

T2  - LIGHTING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While the use of satellite weather files is a possibility in regions without terrestrial stations, it is necessary to consider their impact on daylight simulations. This paper aims to verify the variability of dynamic daylight simulation results according to the weather file used. This study compares the results of daylight simulations in learning spaces using different weather files (land-based station data and satellite data). This work is divided into three main stages: comparative analysis of climatic databases; comparative analysis of annual outside horizontal illuminance; analysis of dynamic daylight performance metrics. Annual calculated dynamic daylight metric indicates variations of up to 13% under the different weather files analysed. This is a relevant topic since the accurate prediction of daylight levels for indoor environments guides daylighting design.

TI  - Hyperspectral remote sensing detection of petroleum hydrocarbons in mixtures with mineral substrates: Implications for onshore exploration and monitoring
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote detection and mapping of hydrocarbons (PHCs) in situ in continental areas is still an operational challenge due to the small scale of the occurrences and the mix of spectral signatures of PHCs and mineral substrates in imagery pixels. Despite the increasing development of new technologies, the use of hyperspectral remote sensing data as a complementary tool for both oil exploration and environmental monitoring is not standard in the oil industry, despite its potential. The high spectral resolution of hyperspectral images allows the direct identification of PHCs on the surface and provides valuable information regarding the location and spread of oil spills that can assist in containment and cleanup operations. Combining the spectral information with statistical techniques also offers the potential to improve exploration programs focused on the discovery of new exploration fields through the qualitative and quantitative characterization of oil occurrences in onshore areas. In this scenario, the aim of this work was to develop methods that can assist the detection of continental areas affected by natural oil seeps or leaks (crude oils and fuels). A field experiment was designed by impregnating several mineral substrates with crude oils and fuels in varying concentrations. Simultaneous measurements of soil-PHC combinations were taken using both a hand-held spectrometer and an airborne hyperspectral imager. Classification algorithms were used to directly map the PHCs on the surface. Spectral information was submitted to a PIS (partial least square regression) to create a prediction model for the estimation of the concentrations of PHCs in soils. The developed model was able to detect three impregnation levels (low, intermediate, high), predicting values close to the concentrations used in the experiment. Given the quality of the results in controlled experiments, the methods developed in this research show the potential to support the oil industry in the discovery of new oil plays and reservoirs and to define the contamination stage and spread of oil/fuel in areas affected by accidental leaks, improving both exploration and environmental monitoring.

T2  - GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-European gridded datasets derived from a single methodology to inform researchers, policy makers and conservationists on the state of forest structures would improve our ability to study forests independent of political boundaries and along various gradients. Although National Forest Inventory (NFI) data provide information on the characteristics of forests, including carbon content, volume, height, and age, such spatial data is not available across Europe. Before this study, remotely sensed data covering all of Europe had not been utilized to produce multiple European-focused forest structure datasets over the entire continent that are methodologically consistent and comparable. We used existing European data to develop a pan-European dataset covering tons of live tree carbon and volume per hectare, mean tree height and mean tree age by integrating remotely sensed and harmonized NFI data from 13 different European countries. We produced a pan-European map for each of the four key variables on a 0.133 degrees grid representing the time period 2000-2010.

TI  - Preclinical study of transcervical upper mediastinal dissection for esophageal malignancy by robot-assisted surgery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER ASSISTED SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRobotic surgical systems are potentially applicable to transcervical mediastinal lymph dissection for esophageal malignancy.MethodsRobot-assisted surgery was performed on a male fresh-frozen human cadaver. Devices for single-port laparoscopic surgery were deployed via one small incision in the left clavicular area. The task for the robot-assisted surgery was the upper mediastinal dissection to the level of the left main bronchus and en bloc harvest of the lymph nodes adherent to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.ResultsAn up-angled 30 degrees scope in the 6 o'clock port and two robotic arms from the 3 and 9 o'clock ports worked effectively together. No collisions of the devices inside the cadaveric body or unexpected traumatic events occurred.ConclusionThe robotic surgical system can be used safely for the upper mediastinal dissection.

TI  - Optimization of a Deep Convective Cloud Technique in Evaluating the Long-Term Radiometric Stability of MODIS Reflective Solar Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS reflective solar bands are calibrated on-orbit using a solar diffuser and near-monthly lunar observations. To monitor the performance and effectiveness of the on-orbit calibrations, pseudo-invariant targets such as deep convective clouds (DCCs), Libya-4, and Dome-C are used to track the long-term stability of MODIS Level 1B product. However, the current MODIS operational DCC technique (DCCT) simply uses the criteria set for the 0.65-mu m band. We optimize several critical DCCT parameters including the 11-mu m IR-band Brightness Temperature (BT11) threshold for DCC identification, DCC core size and uniformity to help locate DCCs at convection centers, data collection time interval, and probability distribution function (PDF) bin increment for each channel. The mode reflectances corresponding to the PDF peaks are utilized as the DCC reflectances. Results show that the BT11 threshold and time interval are most critical for the Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands. The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function model is most effective in reducing the DCC anisotropy for the visible channels. The uniformity filters and PDF bin size have minimal impacts on the visible channels and a larger impact on the SWIR bands. The newly optimized DCCT will be used for future evaluation of MODIS on-orbit calibration by MODIS Characterization Support Team.

TI  - Data on spatiotemporal land use land cover changes in peri-urban Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Empirical evidences from Koye-Feche and Qilinto peri-urban areas
T2  - Data in Brief
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Urban expansion is one of the key problems in Ethiopia resulting in displacement of the rural people inhabiting areas bordering the cities/towns. It is also resulting in land use land cover (LULC) changes affecting the livelihoods of the people and the ecosystems [ 1,2]. The data presented in this article, therefore, shows the spatiotemporal LULC changes of peri-urban expansion areas known as Koye-Feche and Qilinto, around Addis Ababa City (the capital of Ethiopia). The data were generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images (with path/row numbers 168/054) by using ERDAS EMAGINE 2014 software. The precision of the images was verified by geolocation data collected from ground control points by using Geographic Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The data indicate that the built-up areas have increased by 1017.85 ha (10.178 km(2)) with 89.1%, 58.4%, 47% and 13% decline of plantation (mostly eucalyptus woodlots), grasslands, riverine vegetation (forestland) and cropland, respectively, between 1986 and 2016.

TI  - An integrated object-based image analysis and CA-Markov model approach for modeling land use/land cover trends in the Sarab plain
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper is an attempt to integrate a semiautomated object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification framework and a cellular automata-Markov model to study land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Land use maps for the Sarab plain in Iran for the years 2000, 2006, and 2014 were created from Landsat satellite data, by applying an OBIA classification using the normalized difference vegetation index, salinity index, moisture stress index, soil-adjusted vegetation index, and elevation and slope indicators. The classifications yielded overall accuracies of 91, 93, and 94% for 2000, 2006, and 2014, respectively. Finally, using the transition matrix, the spatial distribution of land use was simulated for 2020. The results of the study revealed that the number of orchards with irrigated agriculture and dry-farm agriculture in the Sarab plain is increasing, while the amount of bare land is decreasing. The results of this research are of great importance for regional authorities and decision makers in strategic land use planning.

TI  - Estimation of mango growing areas using remote sensing
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - An attempt was made to estimate acreage and to depict the spatial distribution of mango growing areas using linear imaging self-scanning image of remote sensing data for Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. The image was processed using ENVI software. Unsupervised, supervised and decision tree classification were used for the acreage estimation. The study has clearly demonstrated the usefulness of remote sensing image for identifying and acreage estimation of mango orchards. The results also indicated that mango acreage estimation was more accurate in decision tree approach (92.92%) as compared to other two methods (81.73 and 80.43%, respectively). The overall result revealed that the finer resolution the time series data, better the accuracy of area estimation. The above study proves that the remote sensing data could be effectively used for other perennial horticultural crops with finer resolution time series data.

TI  - Efficacy of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Detecting Axillary Metastasis in Breast Cancer Using Methylene Blue.
T2  - Indian journal of surgical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Breast cancer is the leading malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Axillary lymph node status is a very important prognostic factor in breast cancer patients; nodal evaluation is therefore a critical part of breast cancer management. Axillary lymph node dissection results in significant morbidity. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is being used in many centers to stage the axilla in planning axillary dissection management of patients and hence plays an important part in reducing morbidity among patients with carcinoma breast. The objectives of this paper is to study the (1) efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in detecting axillary metastasis, (2) location of sentinel lymph node in the axilla, (3) rate of involvement of sentinel lymph nodes, and (4) incidence of skip metastasis. Thirty-five patients with breast cancer with clinically node-negative axilla were selected for the study. Methylene blue dye was injected intralesional and perilesional 20min prior to surgery. All patients underwent modified radical mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary dissection and after pathological examination diagnostic statics, namely sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were computed. Sentinel lymph node was identified in all of these patients. Sixty percent patients had pathologically positive lymph nodes in the axilla. 90.48% patients of these had sentinel lymph nodes positive for malignant cells. Incidence of skip metastasis is 9.52%. 88.57% patients had sentinel lymph node mapped to level I lymph nodes. Sensitivity of SLNB is 90.48%, specificity is 85.71%, PPV of is 90.48%, NPV is 85.71%, and accuracy is 88.57%. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an effective method of staging the axilla and deciding on axillary clearance in patients of carcinoma breast. Unnecessary axillary dissection and associated complications can be prevented in most of patients due to sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Seasonal drainage of supraglacial lakes on debris-covered glaciers in the Tien Shan Mountains, Central Asia
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using field surveys in 2013, 2014, and 2016 plus satellite data from the 1999-2015 period, we analyze the seasonal drainage cycle of supraglacial lakes on seven debris-covered glaciers in the central Tien Shan. We characterize this cycle by the number of lakes and their water levels. The cycle of the Southern Inylchek Glacier starts to increase in the beginning of April, reaches a maximum in May-June, and decreases sharply in June-July. The increase in April to June comes from an inflow of meltwater from snow and ice, and the subsequent decrease arises from a greater connectivity to the englacial drainage network. For the Southern Inylchek Glacier, 94% of the supraglacial lakes that exist and appear during 2013-2015 drain during all three years, indicating that most lakes could connect to the englacial drainage network for three years. Concerning the water level, lakes in close proximity and with the same base-level tend to synchronize their seasonal water levels through the englacial channels. Although the maximum water level of the three-year, field-measured lake is about the same from 2014 through 2016, the date of maximum water level varies between mid-May and mid-June. During this period, the lifetime and size of the supraglacial lakes are controlled by the timing of their connectivity to the englacial drainage network. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of forest fire on Madeira Island using Sentinel-2A MSI imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A forest fire started on August 8th, 2016 in several places on Madeira Island causing damage and casualties. As of August 10th the local media had reported the death of three people, over 200 people injured, over 950 habitants evacuated, and 50 houses damaged. This study presents the preliminary results of the assessment of several spectral indices to evaluate the burn severity of Madeira fires during August 2016. These spectral indices were calculated using the new European satellite Sentinel-2A launched in June 2015. The study confirmed the advantages of several spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIreXn) using red-edge spectral bands to assess the post-fire conditions. Results showed high correlation between NDVI, GNDVI, NBR and NDVIreln spectral indices and the analysis performed by Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMSR175), considered as the reference truth. Regarding the red-edge spectral indices, the NDVIreln (using band B5, 705 nm) presented better results compared with B6 (740 nm) and B7 (783 nm) bands. These preliminary results allow us to assume that Sentinel-2 will be a valuable tool for post-fire monitoring. In the future, the two twin Sentinel-2 satellites will offer global coverage of the Madeira Archipelago every five days, therefore allowing the simultaneous study of the evolution of the burnt area and reforestation information with high spatial (up to 10 m) and temporal resolution (5 days).

TI  - The Performance and Potentials of the CryoSat-2 SAR and SARIn Modes for Lake Level Estimation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few decades, satellite altimetry has proven to be valuable for monitoring lake levels. With the new generation of altimetry missions, CryoSat- 2 and Sentinel- 3, which operate in Synthetic Aperture Radar ( SAR) and SAR Interferometric ( SARIn) modes, the footprint size is reduced to approximately 300 m in the along- track direction. Here, the performance of these new modes is investigated in terms of uncertainty of the estimated water level from CryoSat- 2 data and the agreement with in situ data. The data quality is compared to conventional low resolution mode ( LRM) altimetry products from Envisat, and the performance as a function of the lake area is tested. Based on a sample of 145 lakes with areas ranging from a few to several thousand km2, the CryoSat- 2 results show an overall superior performance. For lakes with an area below 100 km2, the uncertainty of the lake levels is only half of that of the Envisat results. Generally, the CryoSat- 2 lake levels also show a better agreement with the in situ data. The lower uncertainty of the CryoSat- 2 results entails a more detailed description of water level variations.

TI  - Satellite-Based Inversion and Field Validation of Autotrophic and Heterotrophic Respiration in an Alpine Meadow on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine meadow ecosystem is among the highest soil carbon density and the most sensitive ecosystem to climate change. Partitioning autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic components (Rm) of ecosystem respiration (Re) is critical to evaluating climate change effects on ecosystem carbon cycling. Here we introduce a satellite-based method, combining MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, eddy covariance (EC) and chamber-based Re components measurements, for estimating carbon dynamics and partitioning of Re from 2009 to 2011 in a typical alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. Six satellite-based gross primary production (GPP) models were employed and compared with GPP_EC, all of which appeared to well explain the temporal GPP_EC trends. However, MODIS versions 6 GPP product (GPP_MOD) and GPP estimation from vegetation photosynthesis model (GPP_VPM) provided the most reliable GPP estimation magnitudes with less than 10% of relative predictive error (RPE) compared to GPP_EC. Thus, they together with MODIS products and GPP_EC were used to estimate Re using the satellite-based method. All satellite-based Re estimations generated an alternative estimation of Re_EC with negligible root mean square errors (RMSEs, g C m(-2) day(-1)) either in the growing season (0.12) or not (0.08). Moreover, chamber-based Re measurements showed that autotrophic contributions to Re (Ra/Re) could be effectively reflected by all these three satellite-based Re partitions. Results showed that the Ra contribution of Re were 27% (10-48%), 43% (22-59%) and 56% (33-76%) from 2009 to 2011, respectively, of which inter-annual variation is mainly attributed to soil water dynamics. This study showed annual temperature sensitivity of Ra (Q(10,Ra)) with an average of 5.20 was significantly higher than that of Q(10,Rm) (1.50), and also the inter-annual variation of Q(10,Ra) (4.14-7.31) was larger than Q(10,Rm) (1.42-1.60). Therefore, our results suggest that the response of Ra to temperature change is stronger than that of Rm in this alpine meadow.

TI  - A Weekly Indicator of Surface Moisture Status from Satellite Data for Operational Monitoring of Crop Conditions
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The triangle method has been applied to derive a weekly indicator of evaporative fraction on vegetated areas in a temperate region in Northern Italy. Daily MODIS Aqua Land Surface Temperature (MYD11A1) data has been combined with air temperature maps and 8-day composite MODIS NDVI (MOD13Q1/MYD13Q1) data to estimate the Evaporative Fraction (EF) at 1 km resolution, on a daily basis. Measurements at two eddy covariance towers located within the study area have been exploited to assess the reliability of satellite based EF estimations as well as the robustness of input data. Weekly syntheses of the daily EF indicator (EFw) were then derived at regional scale for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 as a proxy of overall surface moisture condition. EFw showed a temporal behavior consistent with growing cycles and agro-practices of the main crops cultivated in the study area (rice, forages and corn). Comparison with official regional corn yield data showed that variations in EFw cumulated over summer are related with crop production shortages induced by water scarcity. These results suggest that weekly-averaged EF estimated from MODIS data is sensible to water stress conditions and can be used as an indicator of crops' moisture conditions at agronomical district level. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach to provide information useful to issue operational near real time bulletins on crop conditions at regional scale are discussed.

TI  - Penile Cancer: Contemporary Lymph Node Management
T2  - JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: In penile cancer, the optimal diagnostics and management of metastatic lymph nodes are not clear. Advances in minimally invasive staging, including dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy, have widened the diagnostic repertoire of the urologist. We aimed to provide an objective update of the recent trends in the management of penile squamous cell carcinoma, and inguinal and pelvic lymph node metastases.Materials and Methods: We systematically reviewed several medical databases, including the Web of Science (R) (with MEDLINE (R)), Embase (R) and Cochrane databases, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search terms used were penile cancer, lymph node, sentinel node, minimally invasive, surgery and outcomes, alone and in combination. Articles pertaining to the management of lymph nodes in penile cancer were reviewed, including original research, reviews and clinical guidelines published between 1980 and 2016.Results: Accurate and minimally invasive lymph node staging is of the utmost importance in the surgical management of penile squamous cell carcinoma. In patients with clinically node negative disease, a growing body of evidence supports the use of sentinel lymph node biopsies. Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy exposes the patient to minimal risk, and results in superior sensitivity and specificity profiles compared to alternate nodal staging techniques. In the presence of locoregional disease, improvements in inguinal or pelvic lymphadenectomy have reduced morbidity and improved oncologic outcomes. A multi-modal approach of chemotherapy and surgery has demonstrated a survival benefit for patients with advanced disease.Conclusions: Recent developments in lymph node management have occurred in penile cancer, such as minimally invasive lymph node diagnosis and intervention strategies. These advances have been met with a degree of controversy in the contemporary literature. Current data suggest that dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy provides excellent sensitivity and specificity for detecting lymph node metastases. More robust long-term data on multicenter patient cohorts are required to determine the optimal management of lymph nodes in penile cancer.

AB  - Background: We analysed all female breast cancer (BC) cases in Tyrol/Austria regarding the shift in cancer characteristics, especially the shift in advanced BC, for the group exposed to screening as compared to the group unexposed to screening.Methods: The analysis was based on all BC cases diagnosed in women aged 40-69 years, resident in Tyrol, and diagnosed between 2009 and 2013. The data were linked to the Tyrolean mammography screening programme database to classify BC cases as "exposed to screening" or "unexposed to screening". Age-adjusted relative risks (RR) were estimated by relating the exposed to the unexposed group.Results: In a total of about 145,000 women aged 40-69 years living in Tyrol during the study period, 1475 invasive BC cases were registered. We estimated an age-adjusted relative risk (RR) for tumour size >= 21 mm of 0.72 (95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.60 to 0.86), for metastatic BC of 0.27 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.46) and for advanced BC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.96), each comparing those exposed to those unexposed to screening, respectively.Conclusion: In our population-based registry analysis we observed that participation in the mammography screening programme in Tyrol is associated with a 28% decrease in risk for BC cases with tumour size >= 21 mm and a 17% decrease in risk for advanced BC. We therefore expect the Tyrolean mammography programme to show a reduction in BC mortality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Variability of the fauna within drifting sea ice floes in the seasonal ice zone of the Southern Ocean during the austral summer
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice covering the seasonal ice zone in the Southern Ocean contains micro-organisms (sea ice biota). Studies of sea ice biota have mostly been conducted on the land-fast ice and large ice floes, despite most sea ice in the Southern Ocean being seasonal and drifting ice types. We sampled 17 drifting sea ice floes in the marginal ice zone off Adelie Land, East Antarctica, in January 2013 and 2014. We found high densities of copepods such as Harpacticoida species (18,787 +/- 50,647 inds.m(-3)), Paralabidocera antarctica (1773 +/- 6370) and their nauplii (69,943 +/- 149,607), as well as foraminiferans (193,869 +/- 408,721) within ice. Variability in the animal assemblages among the different ice floes was observed. Cluster analysis of samples based on the assemblage of sea ice fauna revealed two major groups, which were divided by the year of the sampling, and were dominated by harpacticoid nauplii and foraminiferans, respectively. Sea ice trajectory and drifting duration estimated from satellite data were different for both years, although the origin of the sea ice was in the same bay. This study suggests that the variability of fauna among sea ice floes may reflect the continuance period of ice formation and the trajectory from where they originated.

TI  - An operational method for the disaggregation of land surface temperature to estimate actual evapotranspiration in the arid region of Chile
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring evapotranspiration in arid and semi-arid environments plays a key role in water irrigation scheduling for water use efficiency. This work presents an operational method for evapotranspiration retrievals based on disaggregated Land Surface Temperature (LST). The retrieved LSTs from Landsat-8 and MODIS data were merged in order to provide an 8-day composite LST product at 100 x 100 m resolution. The method was tested in the arid region of Copiapo, Chile using data from years 2013-2014 and validated using data from years 2015-2016. In-situ measurements from agrometeorological stations such as air temperature and potential evapotranspiration (ETU) estimated at the location were used in the ET estimation method. The disaggregation method was developed by taking into account (1) the spatial relationship between Landsat-8 and MODIS LST, (2) the spatial relationship between LST and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at high spatial resolution (Landsat-8), and (3) the temporal variations along the year of both relationships aforementioned. The comparison between disaggregated LST at 100 m resolution and in situ LST measurements presents a coefficient of determination (r(2)), in average, equal to 0.70 and a RMSE equal to 3.6 K. The disaggregated LST was used in an operational model to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa). The ETa shows good results in terms of seasonal variations and in comparison to the evapotranspiration estimated by using crop coefficients (kc). The comparison between remotely sensed and in situ ETa presents an overall r(2) close to 0.67 and a RMSE equal to 0.6 mm day(-1) for both crops. These results are important for further improvements in water use sustain ability in the Copiapo valley, which is currently affected by high water demand.

TI  - The amoralist challenge to gaming and the gamer's moral obligation
T2  - ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the amoralist, computer games cannot be subject to moral evaluation because morality applies to reality only, and games are not real but "just games". This challenges our everyday moralist intuition that some games are to be met with moral criticism. I discuss and reject the two most common answers to the amoralist challenge and argue that the amoralist is right in claiming that there is nothing intrinsically wrong in simply playing a game. I go on to argue for the so-called "endorsement view" according to which there is nevertheless a sense in which games themselves can be morally problematic, viz. when they do not only represent immoral actions but endorse a morally problematic worldview. Based on the endorsement view, I argue against full blown amoralism by claiming that gamers do have a moral obligation when playing certain games even if their moral obligation is not categorically different from that of readers and moviegoers.

TI  - Call for Surgical Nodal Staging in Women with ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO High-Intermediate Risk Endometrial Cancer: A Multicentre Cohort Analysis from the FRANCOGYN Study Group
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO)/European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO)/European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) classification for endometrial cancer (EC) now includes a high-intermediate risk (HIR) group of recurrence due to the adverse prognostic role of lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI) and grade 3 for women at intermediate risk. However, optimal surgical staging, and especially the place of lymphadenectomy, remains to be elucidated. We aimed to establish whether systematic nodal staging should be part of surgical staging for women with HIR EC.We abstracted from a prospectively maintained multicentre database the data of 181 women with HIR EC based on uterine factors (endometrioid type 1, grade 1-2 tumors with deep (ae<yen>50%) myometrial invasion and unequivocally positive LVSI, and those with grade 3 tumors with < 50% myometrial invasion regardless of LVSI status), who received primary surgical treatment between January 2001 and December 2013. We recorded frequency of lymph node (LN) metastases in those who underwent nodal staging. The secondary outcomes were overall survival and recurrence patterns.Overall, 145 (80.1%) women underwent nodal staging consisting of at least pelvic lymphadenectomy. Of these, 62 (42.7%) had LN disease (9.7% with micrometastases). The respective 5-year overall survival rates according to LN status were 85.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.5-91.4), 71.8% (95% CI 61.9-80.4) and 36.0% (95% CI 26.6-46.2) for women with negative LN, positive LN, and unstaged (p = 0.047). Unstaged women were more likely to experience nodal recurrence than surgically staged/LN negative women (p = 0.05).Systematic nodal staging should be part of surgical staging for women with apparent ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO HIR EC. Sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) could be an option in this specific setting that may possibly substitute comprehensive staging, for the identification of patients with lymphatic dissemination.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Relationships between Optical Information and Carbon Fluxes in a Mediterranean Tree-Grass Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Spatio-temporal mismatches between Remote Sensing (RS) and Eddy Covariance (EC) data as well as spatial heterogeneity jeopardize terrestrial Gross Primary Production (GPP) modeling. This article combines: (a) high spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery; (b) EC footprint climatology estimates; and (c) semi-empirical models of increasing complexity to analyze the impact of these factors on GPP estimation. Analyses are carried out in a Mediterranean Tree-Grass Ecosystem (TGE) that combines vegetation with very different physiologies and structure. Half-hourly GPP (GPP(hh)) were predicted with relative errors -36%. Results suggest that, at EC footprint scale, the ecosystem signals are quite homogeneous, despite tree and grass mixture. Models fit using EC and RS data with high degree of spatial and temporal match did not significantly improved models performance; in fact, errors were explained by meteorological variables instead. In addition, the performance of the different models was quite similar. This suggests that none of the models accurately represented light use efficiency or the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. This is partly due to model formulation; however, results also suggest that the mixture of the different vegetation types might contribute to hamper such modeling, and should be accounted for GPP models in TGE and other heterogeneous ecosystems.

TI  - Validation of the remotely sensed nighttime sea surface temperature in the shallow waters at the Dongsha Atoll
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine scale temperature structures, which are commonly found in the top few meters of shallow water columns, may result in deviations of the remotely sensed night-time sea surface temperatures (SST) by the MODIS-Aqua sensor (SSTsat) from the bulk sea surface temperatures (SSTbulk) that they purport to represent. The discrepancies between SSTsat and SSTbulk recorded by temperature loggers at eight stations with bottom depths of 2 - 20 m around the Dongsha Atoll (DSA) between June 2013 and May 2015 were examined. The SSTsat had an average cool bias error of - 0.43 +/- 0.59 degrees C. The bias error was larger in the warmer (> 26 degrees C) waters which were presumably more strongly stratified. The root mean square error (RMSE) between SSTsat and SSTbulk, +/- 0.73 degrees C, was 25% larger than that reported in the open northern South China Sea. An operational calibration algorithm was developed to increase the accuracy in the estimation of SSTbulk from SSTsat. In addition to removing the cool bias error, this algorithm also reduced the RMSE to virtually the same level as that found in the open northern South China Sea. With the application of the algorithm, in June 2015, the average SST in the lagoon of the DSA was raised by about 0.5 degrees C to 31.1 +/- 0.4 degrees C, and the area of lagoon with SSTbulk above 31 degrees C, the median value of the physiological temperature threshold of reef organisms, was increased by 69% to about three quarters of the lagoon.

TI  - Estimation of Evapotranspiration Using a Nonparametric Approach Under All Sky: Accuracy Evaluation and Error Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of regional evapotranspiration (ET) or latent heat flux (latent energy, LE) remains a challenge. On the basis of a nonparametric approach, this study proposed an all-sky algorithm based onmoderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and datasets of China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS). Eddy covariance observations from three nonvegetated sites (desert, Gobi, and village) and three vegetated sites (orchard, vegetable, and wetland) over an arid/semiarid region were used as references to validate the new algorithm. Results showed that the spatial and temporal patterns of LE coincided with desert-oasis ecosystems. Comparison of the retrieved and reference values yielded the following results: R-2 = 0.19-0.63, bias = -129-56 W/m(2), relative error (RE) = 5%-29%, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 95-150 W/m(2). Remote-sensing-retrieved LE (RSLE) exhibited relatively good accuracy and poor agreement with ground observations at the nonvegetated sites (RE: 5%-23%, R-2: 0.19-0.40), whereas contradicting scenario occurred at the vegetated sites (RE: 24%-29%, R-2: 0.46-0.63). In the arid nonvegetated region, the ET error might have been caused by net radiation, soil heat flux, land surface temperature, and air temperature. In the vegetated region, the errors of MODIS and CLDAS products were not the dominant error sources of RSLE. The validation supported the applicability of the proposed algorithm in the arid/semiarid region.

TI  - Temporal transition analysis of coal mine fire of Jharia coalfield, India, using Landsat satellite imageries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal is dominant energy source of world at large and India in particular for several decades and expected to being continued for foreseeable future. However, fire in this fossils fuel is still a global catastrophe for the major coal-producing countries. There are several direct and cascading distress of coal mine fire has been encountered by environment, economy, safety and society. Without knowledge of actual status and extent of coal mine fire, any scope for its better managements may be futile. In India, the coal mine fire of well-known Jharia coalfield (JCF) has been continued since last ten decades and still spreading towards newer areas. The aim of this paper is to highlight the chronological net lateral spatial changes in coal mine fire areas of JCF using Landsat satellite thermal imageries. The mapping of coal mine fire area of JCF during 1988-2013 has been carried out with consecutive 5-year intervals. The lateral changes in surface and subsurface fire areas along with propagation towards new area have been studied. The study also included to evaluate changes of status and extent fire during this time span and effect of its management efforts. On the basis of aforementioned analysis, the study concludes a slow reducing trend in coal mine fire area during last 25 years.

TI  - Platelet toll-like receptors in thromboinflammation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK
M3  - Article
AB  - Besides their undiscussed role in hemostasis and thrombosis, platelets are also key effector cells capable of assisting and modulating inflammatory reactions and immune responses. Platelets play a sentinel role in immune surveillance by recognizing danger signals from pathogens and cell damage through the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) on its surface and internal compartments. Platelets express all 10 TLRs transcripts and its signalosome, including adaptor proteins and transcription factors. The activation of these receptors in platelets triggers hemostatic and inflammatory responses which participate in the host's response to bacterial and viral infections, linking thrombosis with infection and immunity. Among the responses elicited by the activation of platelet TLRs are platelet adhesion and aggregation, formation of mixed platelet-leukocyte aggregates, expression and secretion of cytokines and quemokines, and thrombin generation. TLRs also are expressed in megakaryocytes, and their activation regulates not only platelet biogenesis, but also proinflammatory and antiviral responses. This review will focus on work that has shown the role of platelet TLRs, mainly in thromboinflammatory responses elicited by platelets and megakaryocytes.

TI  - Comparison of GOME-2 UVA Satellite Data to Ground-Based Spectroradiometer Measurements at a Subtropical Site
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ultraviolet A (UVA) (315-400 nm) daily exposures and maximum daily irradiances from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME)-2 satellite have been compared over three years to the corresponding data from a ground-based spectroradiometer for a subtropical Southern Hemisphere site. This is one of the first such comparisons for the GOME-2 UVA waveband in the Southern Hemisphere. For the UVA daily exposures and the maximum daily irradiances, the comparisons were undertaken for all sky conditions and for cloud-free conditions. Under cloud-free conditions the R-2 of the fit regression line for the comparisons was 0.93 for the exposures and the irradiances. The influence of cloud reduced the R-2 values to 0.86 and 0.70 for the daily exposures and maximum irradiances, respectively. The relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE), mean absolute bias error (MABE), and mean bias error (MBE) for the maximum daily UVA irradiances on the cloud-free days were 0.08, 6.59 +/- 7.32%, and -1.04 +/- 9.83%, respectively. Similarly, for the daily UVA exposures on the cloud-free days, the rRMSE, MABE, and MBE were 0.10, 5.19 +/- 6.42%, and -0.79 +/- 8.24%, respectively. For the all-sky conditions, the corresponding values were 0.20, 15.23 +/- 14.90%, and -0.79 +/- 8.24% for the maximum daily irradiances and 0.19, 14.17 +/- 14.56%, and -4.63 +/- 20.60% for the daily exposures. In all studies of the influence of UVA on human health, this can complement ground-based measurements that provide the higher temporal and spatial resolution available only at a limited number of surface monitoring sites.

TI  - Axillary reverse mapping in N0 patients requiring sentinel lymph node biopsy - A systematic review of the literature and necessity of a randomised study
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) is a technique to map and preserve arm lymphatics which may be damaged during surgery, resulting in lymphoedema. This work systematically reviews the incidence of lymphoedema following sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) + ARM, compared to SLNB alone, for clinically node negative disease, as well as recurrence rate, other morbidity and the feasibility and difficulties of ARM.Materials and Methods: The following databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library. Abstracts submitted to recognised societies dedicated to research in oncology were included. Studies were eligible if performed within the last 10 years; ARM was used in any form; ARM performed during SLNB +/- axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Studies were analysed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.Results: No studies were found meeting the initial inclusion criteria. Therefore, studies reporting use of SLNB + ARM (i.e. no comparison to SLNB) were reviewed. A second search was performed to identify studies reporting outcome following SLNB alone. Twelve studies reported data on patients undergoing SLNB + ARM and 23 studies on patients undergoing SLNB. Incidence of lymphoedema following SLNB + ARM was quoted between 0-4% and 0-63.4% following SLNB. Few studies commented on recurrence rate. Studies included were of mainly low level of evidence.Conclusion: Evidence is beginning to emerge for the use of ARM in order to reduce lymphoedema following axillary surgery. However, data regarding oncological safety of ARM is not clear and randomised controlled trials, with adequate follow-up, need to be performed to determine this. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Role of total tumour load of sentinel lymph node on survival in early breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary staging (pN) is considered one of the most important prognostic factors in breast cancer patients. However, the Z0011 study data drastically reduced the number of surgical axillary dissections in a selected group of patients, limiting the prognostic information relating to axillary involvement to the sentinel lymph node (SLN). It is known that there is a relationship between SLN total tumour load (TTL) and axillary involvement. The objective of this study is to analyse the relationship between the TTL and outcomes in patients with early stage breast cancer.Patients and methods: clinicopathological and follow-up data were collected from 950 patients with breast cancer between 2009 and 2010 on whom SLN analysis was conducted by molecular methods (One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification, Sysmex, Kobe, Japan).Results: TTL (defined as the total number of CK19 mRNA copies in all positive SLN) correlates with disease free survival (HR, 1.08; p = 0.000004), with local recurrence disease free survival (HR = 1.07; p = 0.0014) and overall survival (HR: 1.08, p = 0.0032), clearly defining a low-risk group (TTL <2.5 x 10(4) CK19 mRNA copies/A) versus a high-risk group (>2.5 x 10(4) CK 19 mRNA copies/mu L).Conclusions: SLN TTL permits the differentiation between two patient groups in terms of DFS and OS, independently of axillary staging (pN), age and tumour characteristics (size, grade, lymphovascular invasion). This new data confirms the clinical value of low axillary involvement and could partially replace the information that staging of the entire axilla provides in patients on whom no axillary lymph node dissection is performed.

TI  - Examining fault architecture and strain distribution using geospatial and geomechanical modelling: An example from the Qaidam basin, NE Tibet
T2  - MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of complex geological setting is still dominated by traditional geo-data collection and analytical techniques, e.g., stratigraphic logging, dip data measurements, structural ground mapping, seismic interpretation, balance section restoration, forward modelling, etc. Despite the advantages of improving our understanding in structural geometry and fault architecture, the geospatial modelling, applying computer-aided three-dimensional geometric design, visualization and interpretation, has rarely been applied to such complex geological setting. This study used the Lenghu fold-and-thrust belt (in Qaidam basin, NE Tibetan Plateau) to demonstrate that the application of geospatial and geomechanical modelling could improve our understanding and provide an effective technique for investigating the fault architecture and strain distribution. The three-dimensional configuration of the Lenghu fold-and-thrust belt was initially derived from traditional analysis techniques, such as regional strati graphic logging, cross section construction, meso-scale ground mapping and landsat image interpretation. The high-resolution field data and landsat image were integrated to construct the geospatial model, which was subsequently used to quantitatively investigate the fault throw changes along the Lenghu thrust fault zone and to understand its control on the lateral structural variation. The geospatial model was then restored in three dimensions to reveal the kinematic evolution of the Lenghu fold-and-thrust belt. Geomechanical modelling, using a Mass-Spring algorithm, provided an effective three-dimensional tool for structural strain analysis, which was used to predict the strain distribution throughout the overall structure, e.g., normal faults with throws ranging from meters to tens of meters in the hanging wall. The strain distribution predicted by geomechanical modelling was then validated by the natural normal faults in the hanging-wall. The high accordance between the strain prediction and statistics of natural normal faults demonstrates good applicability of geospatial and geomechanical modelling in the complex geological setting of the Lenghu fold-and-thrust belt. The geospatial models and geomechanical models, therefore, can provide a robust technique for analyzing and interpreting multi-source data within a three-dimensional environment. We anticipate that the application of three-dimensional geospatial modelling and geomechanical modelling, integrating both multi-source geologic data and three-dimensional analytical techniques, can provide an effective workflow for investigating the fault architecture and strain distribution at different scales (e.g., ranging from regional-to meso-scale).

TI  - Using spectrotemporal indices to improve the fruit-tree crop classification accuracy
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the potential of spectrotemporal indices derived from satellite image time series (SITS) to improve the classification accuracy of fruit-tree crops. Six major fruit-tree crop types in the Aconcagua Valley, Chile, were classified by applying various linear discriminant analysis (LDA) techniques on a Landsat-8 time series of nine images corresponding to the 2014-15. growing season. As features we not only used the complete spectral resolution of the SITS, but also all possible normalized difference indices (NDIs) that can be constructed from any two bands of the time series, a novel approach to derive features from SITS. Due to the high dimensionality of this "enhanced" feature set we used the lasso and ridge penalized variants of LDA (PLDA). Although classification accuracies yielded by the standard LDA applied on the full-band SITS were good (misclassification error rate, MER = 0.13), they were further improved by 23% (MER = 0.10) with ridge PLDA using the enhanced feature set. The most important bands to discriminate the crops of interest were mainly concentrated on the first two image dates of the time series, corresponding to the crops' greenup stage. Despite the high predictor weights provided by the red and near infrared bands, typically used to construct greenness spectral indices, other spectral regions were also found important for the discrimination, such as the shortwave infrared band at 2.11-2.19 pm, sensitive to foliar water changes. These findings support the usefulness of spectrotemporal indices in the context of SITS-based crop type classifications, which until now have been mainly constructed by the arithmetic combination of two bands of the same image date in order to derive greenness temporal profiles like those from the normalized difference vegetation index.

TI  - Spring green-up phenology products derived from MODIS NDVI and EVI: Intercomparison, interpretation and validation using National Phenology Network and AmeriFlux observations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in the timing of spring green-up date are a typical response of vegetation global change. Longterm observations of plant phenology have been used to track vegetation response to climate change. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) have been the most commonly used indicators in reconstructing spring green-up dates from remote sensing over the past several decades. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based phenology time series from NDVI and EVI with an enhanced TIMESAT algorithm are the two operational phenology products developed recently with sun-sensor geometry corrected reflectance. However, a comprehensive intercomparison and evaluation of these two spring green-up datasets using intensive ground observations have not been conducted, limiting their applications in regional interpretation of land surface phenology. Therefore, we used 455 ground observations from USA National Phenology Network (NPN) and 106 observations from 21 AmeriFlux sites to assess and validate the spring green-up dates for United States for 2000-2013. Our results indicate that the spring green-up dates from NDVI and EVI showed a good agreement in eastern United States, while substantial differences (70 days) were found in western and southern areas. Ground observations generally had a significant correlation (p < 0.01) with the two MODIS spring green-up dates, especially for deciduous broadleaf forests with root mean square error (RMSE) of 12 days and 16 days when compared with USA-NPN and AmeriFlux observations, respectively. Spring green-up dates from EVI overall showed a better relationship and a lower RMSE in reference to both USA-NPN and AmeriFlux observations than NDVI-based spring green-up dates. Our results highlight the importance of a rigorous validation of remote sensing products to better understand their limitations in operational applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A review of spatial downscaling of satellite remotely sensed soil moisture
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used to estimate surface soil moisture. Numerous efforts have been devoted to develop global soil moisture products. However, these global soil moisture products, normally retrieved from microwave remote sensing data, are typically not suitable for regional hydrological and agricultural applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions, due to their coarse spatial resolution. Therefore, various downscaling methods have been proposed to improve the coarse resolution soil moisture products. The purpose of this paper is to review existing methods for downscaling satellite remotely sensed soil moisture. These methods are assessed and compared in terms of their advantages and limitations. This review also provides the accuracy level of these methods based on published validation studies. In the final part, problems and future trends associated with these methods are analyzed.

TI  - Impact of Number of Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Doses on Genital Warts Diagnoses Among a National Cohort of US Adolescents
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The impact of fewer than 3 doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on genital warts is uncertain.Methods Using the Truven Health Analytics Marketscan administrative database, we compared rates of genital warts among women receiving 0, 1, 2, or 3 doses of HPV vaccine. Females aged 9 to 18 years on January 1, 2007, who were continuously enrolled in the database through December 31, 2013, were included. Patients were assigned an HPV dose state (0, 1, 2, or 3) based on the last recorded dose. The exposure period began on January 1, 2007, or the date of the final HPV dose, and lasted until the first diagnosis of genital warts or December 31, 2013. Multivariable Poisson regression was performed to determine the risk of genital warts associated with vaccine doses.Results Among 387,906 subjects, mean age and exposure period were 14.73 and 5.64 years, respectively. The proportions of doses received were: 52.1%, 7.8%, 9.4%, and 30.7% for 0, 1, 2, and 3 doses, respectively. The rate of genital warts was 1.97/1000 person-years. Receipt of 0 or 1 dose was associated with more genital warts than 3 doses. The effectiveness of 2 doses following current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines was similar to 3 doses. The risk of genital warts rose with age.Conclusions Prevention of genital warts is higher with completion of 3 vaccine doses than with 1 dose, though 2-dose recommendations appear to provide similar protection. Prospective effectiveness studies of recommended 2-dose schedules against clinical endpoints including persistent infection, genital warts, and cervical dysplasia are necessary to ensure long-term protection of vaccinated cohorts.

TI  - A Conceptual Model for Development of Intense Pyrocumulonimbus in Western North America
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The first observationally based conceptual model for intense pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) development is described by applying reanalyzed meteorological model output to an inventory of 26 intense pyroCb events from June to August 2013 and a control inventory of intense fire activity without pyroCb. Results are based on 88 intense wildfires observed within the western United States and Canada. While surface-based fire weather indices are a useful indicator of intense fire activity, they are not a skillful predictor of intense pyroCb. Development occurs when a layer of increased moisture content and instability is advected over a dry, deep, and unstable mixed layer, typically along the leading edge of an approaching disturbance or under the influence of a monsoonal anticyclone. Upper-tropospheric dynamics are conducive to rising motion and vertical convective development. Mid-and upper-tropospheric conditions therefore resemble those that produce traditional dry thunderstorms. The specific quantity of midlevel moisture and instability required is shown to be strongly dependent on the surface elevation of the contributing fire. Increased thermal buoyancy from large and intense wildfires can serve as a potential trigger, implying that pyroCb occasionally develop in the absence of traditional meteorological triggering mechanisms. This conceptual model suggests that meteorological conditions favorable for pyroCb are observed regularly in western North America. PyroCb and ensuing stratospheric smoke injection are therefore likely to be significant and endemic features of summer climate. Results from this study provide a major step toward improved detection, monitoring, and prediction of pyroCb, which will ultimately enable improved understanding of the role of this phenomenon in the climate system.

TI  - Historical Analysis of Riparian Vegetation Change in Response to Shifting Management Objectives on the Middle Rio Grande
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian ecosystems are valuable to the ecological and human communities that depend on them. Over the past century, they have been subject to shifting management practices to maximize human use and ecosystem services, creating a complex relationship between water policy, management, and the natural ecosystem. This has necessitated research on the spatial and temporal dynamics of riparian vegetation change. The San Acacia Reach of the Middle Rio Grande has experienced multiple management and river flow fluctuations, resulting in threats to its riparian and aquatic ecosystems. This research uses remote sensing data, GIS, a review of management decisions, and an assessment of climate to both quantify how riparian vegetation has been altered over time and provide interpretations of the relationships between riparian change and shifting climate and management objectives. This research focused on four management phases from 1935 to 2014, each highlighting different management practices and climate-driven river patterns, providing unique opportunities to observe a direct relationship between river management, climate, and riparian response. Overall, we believe that management practices coupled with reduced surface river-flows with limited overbank flooding influenced the compositional and spatial patterns of vegetation, including possibly increasing non-native vegetation coverage. However, recent restoration efforts have begun to reduce non-native vegetation coverage.

TI  - Interannual and Decadal Variability in Tropical Pacific Sea Level
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A notable feature in the first 20-year satellite altimetry records is an anomalously fast sea level rise (SLR) in the western Pacific impacting island nations in this region. This observed trend is due to a combination of internal variability and external forcing. The dominant mode of dynamic sea level (DSL) variability in the tropical Pacific presents as an east-west see-saw pattern. To assess model skill in simulating this variability mode, we compare 38 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models with 23-year satellite data, 55-year reanalysis products, and 60-year sea level reconstruction. We find that models underestimate variance in the Pacific sea level see-saw, especially at decadal, and longer, time scales. The interannual underestimation is likely due to a relatively low variability in the tropical zonal wind stress. Decadal sea level variability may be influenced by additional factors, such as wind stress at higher latitudes, subtropical gyre position and strength, and eddy heat transport. The interannual variability of the Nino 3.4 index is better represented in CMIP5 models despite low tropical Pacific wind stress variability. However, as with sea level, variability in the Nino 3.4 index is underestimated on decadal time scales. Our results show that DSL should be considered, in addition to sea surface temperature (SST), when evaluating model performance in capturing Pacific variability, as it is directly related to heat content in the ocean column.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for ocular adnexal melanoma
T2  - ACTA OPHTHALMOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWe sought to update our prior report of findings on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and predictors of a positive SLN in patients with conjunctival or eyelid melanoma.MethodsWe reviewed the records of all patients with ocular adnexal melanoma who underwent SLNB at one institution during 2000-2015. We determined rates of positive and false-negative findings on SLNB, primary tumour features correlated with positive findings and rate of nodal recurrence (false-negative event) after negative findings.ResultsThe study included 51 patients, 31 with conjunctival and 20 with eyelid melanoma. These patients include 30 patients who underwent SLNB during 2000-2008, described in our previous report, and 21 additional patients who underwent SLNB during 2008-2015. There were 30 women and 21 men with median age at SLNB of 62years (range, 24-83). The nodal basins most commonly sampled were intraparotid (27 patients) and level II (14 patients). Ten patients had positive SLNB findings. Compared to tumours with negativefindings, tumours with positive findings had greater median thickness (3.5mmversus2.2mm, p=0.04), greater median number of mitotic figures (6 versus 2, p=0.03) and greater incidence of ulceration (80% versus 26%, p=0.003). Perineural and vascular invasion were not significantly associated with positive findings. There were three false-negative events. Three patients (6%) had temporary marginal mandibular weakness which resolved spontaneously.ConclusionSLNB in patients with ocular adnexal melanoma is safe and identifies nodal micrometastasis in approximately 20% of cases. Histologic features associated with a positive SLN included greater tumour thickness, greater number of mitotic figures and ulceration.

TI  - Monitoring mangrove biomass change in Vietnam using SPOT images and an object-based approach combined with machine learning algorithms
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are well-known for their provision of ecosystem services and capacity to reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Mapping and quantifying mangrove biomass is useful for the effective management of these forests and maximizing their ecosystem service performance. The objectives of this research were to model, map, and analyse the biomass change between 2000 and 2011 of mangrove forests in the Cangio region in Vietnam. SPOT 4 and 5 images were used in conjunction with object-based image analysis and machine learning algorithms. The study area included natural and planted mangroves of diverse species. After image preparation, three different mangrove associations were identified using two levels of image segmentation followed by a Support Vector Machine classifier and a range of spectral, texture and GIS information for classification. The overall classification accuracy for the 2000 and 2011 images were 77.1% and 82.9%, respectively. Random Forest regression algorithms were then used for modelling and mapping biomass. The model that integrated spectral, vegetation association type, texture, and vegetation indices obtained the highest accuracy (R-adj(2) = 0.73). Among the different variables, vegetation association type was the most important variable identified by the Random Forest model. Based on the biomass maps generated from the Random Forest, total biomass in the Cangio mangrove forest increased by 820,136 tons over this period, although this change varied between the three different mangrove associations.

TI  - Forest Cover Changes in Lao Tropical Forests: Physical and Socio-Economic Factors are the Most Important Drivers
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) has been experiencing significant forest depletion since the 1980s, but there is little evidence to demonstrate the major causes and underlying drivers for the forest cover changes. In this study, we investigated the relationship between forest cover decrease and increase in the south of Lao PDR between 2006 and 2012 and selected physical and socio-economic factors. We used a map of forest cover changes derived from analysis of Landsat ETM+ imagery in 2006 and 2012, together with socio-economic and physical environmental data from the national authorities. The study area has experienced noticeable forest cover changes: both forest decreases and increases were unevenly distributed throughout the region. Logistic regression models were used to test relationships between forest cover decrease or increase and selected physical and socio-economic factors. Forest clearance was associated strongly with elevation, distance to main roads and shifting cultivation practices. Meanwhile, forest cover increase was more likely to correlate with rubber plantations. Native forest and shifting cultivation lands were vulnerable to being converted into rubber plantations. This research provides much-needed information on which to base forestry policy and decision making to minimize and prevent current deforestation, as well as manage potential risks in the future.

TI  - Sonoran Desert rodent abundance response to surface temperature derived from remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nocturnal rodents play a key role in the Sonoran Desert ecosystem as consumers, prey and reservoirs of disease-yet rodent distribution remains poorly mapped. We use surface temperature extracted from the Landsat Thematic Mapper thermal infrared band to model rodent abundance obtained from trapping data at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in southwest Arizona. We produce response curves that describe the effects of surface temperature on species abundance. Daytime surface temperature derived from images collected in June across thirty rodent trapping grids ranged from 318 K (45.0 degrees C) to 332 K (59.2 degrees C). Results show peak seasonal surface temperature splits high species abundances into two groups: Merriam's kangaroo rat, Arizona pocket mouse, desert pocket mouse and southern grasshopper mouse species prefer habitat characterized by higher surface temperatures; and white-throated wood rat, cactus mouse, rock pocket mouse and Bailey's pocket mouse species prefer habitat characterized by lower temperatures. Abundances for the high and low temperature habitat groupings correlate linearly with surface temperature (r = +0.66 and -0.75, respectively, p < 0.001). Surface temperature integrates multiple landscape characteristics (e.g. topography, vegetation cover and soil properties) that define the dominant habitats of ORPI rodents. These results prove that simple models can inform complex ecological processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intrinsic values in nature: Objective good or simply half of an unhelpful dichotomy?
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Two generations of conservationists and philosophers have built a strong case for intrinsic values in nature; they are the basis of the normative postulates of conservation biology. I argue that the recognition of intrinsic natural value is a fundamental and non-negotiable aspect of an eco-evolutionary worldview. Recently, relational values, "preferences, principles, and virtues associated with relationships", have been proposed as a third category of values in nature, which may help to resolve the debate between instrumental and intrinsic valuation. By depicting intrinsic values as part of an unhelpful dichotomy between anthropocentric and ecocentric values, the current assessment of relational values fails to adequately account for the modern philosophical view of intrinsic natural value. The recognition of intrinsic natural value is not merely an academic exercise, but rather a vital aspect of conservation of the biosphere; recognition of value entails the obligation to do what is right, i.e., protect the good. Any attempt to reframe the discussion about values and environmental protection through more formal recognition of relational values will need to more clearly address how relational and intrinsic values coexist and how they can jointly form the basis for nature conservation.

TI  - Mapping Flooded Vegetation Using COSMO-SkyMed: Comparison With Polarimetric and Optical Data Over Rice Fields
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) radar to remotely sense standing water beneath vegetation using an automatic algorithm working on a single image is investigated. The objective is to contribute to tackle the problem of missed detection of inundated vegetation by near real-time flood mapping algorithms using SAR data. The focus is on CSK because its four-satellite constellation is very suitable for rapid mapping. A set of CSK observations of an area in Northern Italy where many rice fields are present and recurrent artificial inundations occur were analyzed. Considering that double-bounce is the key process to detect floodwater under vegetation and that polarimetry is potentially able to discriminate double-bounce among different scattering mechanisms, single polarization CSK observations were compared with ALOS-2 and RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric data. Such a multifrequency and multiangle dataset helped understanding the multitemporal signature of CSK data. A set of Landsat-8 images collected under cloud free conditions were also used as reference. Satellite acquisitions were gathered in order to ensure both spatial overlap among the images of the various sensors and temporal overlap along most of the rice growing season. The comparison between CSK and polarimetric data showed that at least for a slender leaf plant like rice, CSK can be able to detect the enhancement of double-bounce backscattering involving water and vertical plant stems. For some selected fields, it was found a good agreement between CSK-derived floodwater maps and those produced using the normalized-difference water index derived from Landsat-8 images, as well as double-bounce detection from polarimetric data.

TI  - Decline of a giant salamander assessed with historical records, environmental DNA and multi-scale habitat data
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater species are declining rapidly but more complete data are needed for determining the extent and cause(s) of population declines and extirpations. Integrating newer survey techniques, freely available data, and traditional field work may allow for more effective assessment of population decline. We used detailed historical species records and environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods to identify changes in population distribution of a long-lived, imperiled stream salamander, the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis: Cryptobranchidae). We used logistic regression with Bayesian inference to test whether selected environmental variables may be good predictors of hellbender population persistence and extirpation. Hellbenders persisted in only 42% of the 24 historical record sites. The best fit model indicated electrical conductivity (EC) was the strongest predictor of hellbender population persistence (EC<278S/cm) and extirpation. Conductivity was strongly negatively correlated with canopy cover within the total watershed (r=-0.83, n=21, p<0.001) and riparian buffer of the watershed (r=-0.77, n=21, p<0.001). Electrical conductivity tends to increase following deforestation, and may inhibit sperm motility and thus limit recruitment of hellbenders and other aquatic vertebrate species with external fertilisation. By integrating historical data, eDNA, field data, and freely available high resolution remote sensing data, our study design allowed for rapid assessment of predictors of and changes in hellbender distribution over a relatively broad geographic area. This cost- and time-effective approach may be used for evaluating other rare aquatic species.

TI  - Simple Vaginal Trachelectomy <i>A Valuable Fertility</i>-<i>Preserving Option in Early</i>-<i>Stage Cervical Cancer</i>
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Radical trachelectomy is a valid alternative for the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer in young women who wish to preserve fertility potential. Recent data indicate that even less radical surgery could be performed in low-risk cases. The objective of our study was to evaluate the safety of simple vaginal trachelectomy and node assessment in patients with low-risk, early-stage cervical cancer (<2 cm).Methods: From May 2007 to July 2016, 35 women underwent a simple vaginal trachelectomy with laparoscopic sentinel lymph node mapping + pelvic node dissection. Data were collected prospectively in a computerized database. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier estimate were used for analysis.Results: Patients' median age was 29 years, and 24 (69%) were nulliparous. Eight had stage IA1 with lymphovascular space invasion, 9 a stage IA2, and 18 a stage IB1. Nineteen (54%) had squamous histology, 13 (37%) had adenocarcinoma, and 3 had other histologic findings. The median operating room time was 148 minutes (90-240 minutes), and median blood loss was 50 mL (25-200 mL). On final pathology, lymph nodes were negative in all patients, except 2 cases with isolated tumor cells. Twenty-two patients (63%) had either no residual disease in the trachelectomy specimen (n = 15) or residual dysplasia only (n = 7). With a median follow-up of 42 months (1-100 months), 1 local recurrence occurred treated initially with chemoradiation and then a pelvic exenteration. The recurrence-free survival at 48 months is 96.7%. There were 25 pregnancies: 5 (20%) ended in the first trimester, 2 delivered prematurely at 34.4 and at 35 weeks, and all the others (18 [72%]) delivered at more than 36 weeks.Conclusions: Based on our experience, simple trachelectomy and nodes appear to be a safe fertility-preserving surgery in well-selected patients with small-volume cervical cancer. Obstetric outcome appears favorable.

TI  - 3D mapping of soil texture in Scotland
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable spatially explicit information about soil is important for global environmental challenges. Soil texture is one of the soil most important characteristics as it drives several physical, chemical, biological, and hydrological properties and processes. Despite the importance, there is scarcity of information on soil texture, especially at the resolution required for environmental modelling. Many recent efforts modelled soil texture with different approaches focussing on the spatial relationships with environmental covariates. This study aimed at i) modelling and map soil particle classes for Scotland at medium resolution (250 m), for topsoil and the whole profile, using an operational DSM approach following specifications from the GlobalSoilMap project; ii) assessing the spatial uncertainty of the modelling approach, and iii) evaluating the impact of spatial and modelling uncertainty on soil texture classification of the topsoil. An extension of the scorpan-kriging approach, i.e. hybrid geostatistical Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), combining GAM with Gaussian simulations was used on Additive-Log-Transformed soil particle classes. The R-2 calculated with the validation dataset was between 0.55 and 0.60 and the RMSE values were below 13%. The set of covariates used in this study explained about 40% of the variance of the data. The significant covariates included morphological features, vegetation index and information about the phenological season. The results also showed a large percentage of the variability to be spatially structured. The assessment of the uncertainty on the soil texture classification showed variability and class shift. The resulting datasets can be used as input for further modelling in a number of areas, and they are also important for soil functions modelling in the context of provision of Ecosystem services. The accompanying uncertainty can be used to provide supporting information for land management choices. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fluorescent Versus Radioguided Lymph Node Mapping in Bladder Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL GENITOURINARY CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to compare radioactive and fluorescent sentinel lymph node biopsy in bladder cancer. The study was conducted on 50 patients. We found that the sentinel lymph node biopsy technique is feasible and useful for the evaluation of lymph nodes in bladder cancer. The fluorescent technique may provide similar results to the radiocolloid method, although both have advantages and disadvantages.Introduction: The aim of the study was to compare 2 methods of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure in bladder cancer: we applied technetium radiocolloid (RadCol) detected by a gamma ray detection probe, and indocyanine green (ICG) detected by a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) camera. Material and Methods: The SLNB was performed on 50 patients using the RadCol and the ICG, followed by a lymphadenectomy and a pathologic examination. Results: In the analyzed group of 47 patients (3 patients were excluded owing to the lack of lymphatic drainage from the tumor), the SLNB was performed using the 2 methods. The ICG with a NIRF-guided camera detected all sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in 46 cases, whereas RadCol detected them in 45 cases. In 12 (25.6%) of 47 patients, the ICGfluorescent method revealed more SLNs than the RadCol method. In 8 (17%) patients, the SLNs revealed in the ICG fluorescence were metastatic. In 3 (6.4%) patients, we found SLNs outside the standard lymphadenectomy template, but a histopathologic examination showed they were negative for cancer. In 3 (6.4%) patients, the SLNs detected by both methods were negative for cancer, but other resected lymph nodes revealed metastases. Conclusion: Our study shows that SLNB procedure with the RadCol or the ICG method is useful for the evaluation of lymph nodes in bladder cancer. The new ICG fluorescent technique with a NIRF camera system is safe, enables live view of the results of the procedure, and does not create additional costs. However, it highlights more lymph nodes than the radioactive method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - FIELD EVALUATION OF INDOOR THERMAL FOG AND ULTRA-LOW VOLUME APPLICATIONS CONTROL OF <i>AEDES AEGYPTI</i> IN THAILAND
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficacies of a handheld thermal fogger (Patriote) and a backpack ultra-low volume (ULV) sprayer (Twistere) with combinations of 2 different adulticides (pyrethrin, deltamethrin) and an insect growth regulator (pyriproxyfen) were field-tested and compared for their impact on reducing indoor Aedes aegypti populations in Thailand. The effectiveness of the indoor space sprays was evaluated by sampling the natural Ae. aegypti population in houses and determining their physiological status, by monitoring mortality of sentinel caged mosquitoes (AFRIMS strain) and by assessing larval mortality in laboratory bioassays using water exposed to the spray. A total of 14,742 Ae. aegypti were collected from Biogents Sentinel traps in this study. The combination of ULD (R) BP-300 (3% pyrethrin) and NyGuard (R) (10% pyriproxyfen) sprayed either by the Patriot or Twister significantly reduced some Ae. aegypti populations up to 20 days postspray relative to the control clusters. The addition of pyriproxyfen to the adulticide extended how long household mosquito populations were suppressed. In 2 of the 4 products being compared, the Twister resulted in higher mortality of caged mosquitoes compared with the Patriot. However, neither machine was able to achieve high mortality among Ae. aegypti placed in hidden (protected) cages. The larval bioassay results demonstrated that the Twister ULV provided better adult emergence inhibition than the Patriot (thermal fogger), likely due to larger droplet size.

TI  - Fire-climate history and landscape patterns of high burn severity areas on the California southern and central coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is mounting evidence that fire size and severity have been growing on the central and southern California coastal landscape over the past several decades. Landsat satellite data was analyzed for the 20 largest fires on the Central California coast since 1984 to determine the relationships between climate/weather conditions at the time of ignition and the size of high burn severity (HBS) areas. The study also examined the relationship between area burned and landscape patterns of HBS coverage, including patch size, edge complexity, perimeter-to-area ratio, and aggregation metrics. Results showed that climate conditions at the time of ignitions have been significant controllers of the total area of HBS and the complexity of HBS patches on the fire landscape. As maximum air temperatures for the month of ignition approached 40(o) C, the percentage of HBS to total area burned frequently exceeded 20%. The percentage of HBS to total area burned also exceed 20% when the precipitation total recorded during the previous 12 months was less than 25% of the annual average precipitation. Landscape analysis results showed that, as the total area burned in fires on the Central California coast grows, the edge lengths and areas of HBS patches also grows at a rapid rate. At the same time, the perimeter-to-area ratio of HBS patches decreases gradually and the HBS patches become more aggregated as total burned area grows.

TI  - Does inherent flammability of grass and litter fuels contribute to continental patterns of landscape fire activity?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsTo (1) identify the trade-offs among flammability attributes within grass and litter fuel types; (2) determine how flammability attributes of grass and litter fuels vary across macro-ecological gradients; and (3) test our hypothesis that inherent flammability attributes of grass and litter fuels scale to satellite-derived proxies for fire frequency and intensity.LocationContinent of Australia.MethodsSamples of litter and grass fuels collected from 133 sites across Australia were oven dried, then burnt under controlled conditions. Measurements of ignitability, combustibility and sustainability were made. Estimates of fire frequency and fire radiative power (a proxy for intensity) were derived from satellite imagery. Multivariate analyses were used to identify inter-relationships among variables and trends across macro-ecological gradients.ResultsFlammability was best described by two axes: high rate of combustion versus long duration of burning, and fast rate of spread versus high maximum temperature. As expected, our study confirmed that grass and litter fuel types have inherently differently flammability attributes whereby grass samples burn more quickly, with a higher rate of spread, than litter samples. However, there were also smaller differences in flammability attributes within fuel types, which scaled to rainfall, temperature and soil phosphorus concentrations. In keeping with our hypothesis, we found correlations between inherent fuel flammability attributes and landscape fire activity across the Australian continent. Fire frequency and rate of combustion of grass fuels were both highest in the tropics, and fire intensity and maximum temperature during combustion of litter fuels were highest in temperate areas.Main conclusionsAt a continental scale, we found landscape fire activity was correlated with inherent flammability of grass and litter fuels. This inherent flammability contributes to observed pyrogeographical patterns that are shaped by climate through its known effects on plant productivity, the abundance of cured grass biomass and fire weather.

TI  - Critical Geopolitics and the Framing of the Arab Spring Through Late-Night Humor
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The role of popular culture, particularly humor, is of increasing importance in critical geopolitics and international relations scholarship. This article examines how humor is used to frame the events described as the Arab Spring and U.S. government response. Methods. Sifting through the jokes for references to places, events, and significant actors, the selected jokes were interpreted through critical discourse analysis to identify the themes invoked by the comedians. Results. The Arab Spring countries most mentioned were Libya, Egypt, and Syria. The majority of the jokes about these can best be understood through the lens of incongruity theory and the exploitation of extant caricatures of leaders. Additionally, the jokes reflected concerns over U.S. actions in the region and, simultaneously, U.S. leadership's seeming inability to craft a coherent plan to address the events. Conclusions. We establish the link to humor and geopolitical imagination noting that the themes of American policy, American leadership, regional corruption, and caricatures of leaders composed many of the jokes, reflecting a particular worldview of the region as intractable.

TI  - VIIRS captures phytoplankton vertical migration in the NE Gulf of Mexico
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - In summer 2014, a toxic Karenia brevis bloom (red tide) occurred in the NE Gulf of Mexico, during which vertical migration of K. brevis has been observed from glider measurements. The current study shows that satellite observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) can capture changes in surface reflectance and chlorophyll concentration occurring within 2 h, which may be attributed this K. brevis vertical migration. The argument is supported by earlier glider measurements in the same bloom, by the dramatic changes in the VIIRS-derived surface chlorophyll, and by the consistency between the short-term reflectance changes and those reported earlier from field-measured K. brevis vertical migration. Estimates using the quasi-analytical algorithm also indicate significant increases in both total absorption coefficient and backscattering coefficient in two hours. The two observations in a day from a single polar-orbiting satellite sensor are thus shown to be able to infer phytoplankton vertical movement within a short timeframe, a phenomenon difficult to capture with other sensors as each sensor can provide at most one observation per day, and cross-sensor inconsistency may make interpretation of merged-sensor data difficult. These findings strongly support geostationary satellite missions to study short-term bloom dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Structural Health and Stability Assessment of High-Speed Railways via Thermal Dilation Mapping With Time-Series InSAR Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal dilation is a vital component of deformation along the extensive railway network infrastructure. To monitor subtle deformation, the synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technique has been adopted as a space-borne geodetic tool. However, InSAR applications in railway stability surveillance have been largely limited by the sparseness of detectable point-like targets (PTs). Moreover, only one-dimensional linear displacements in radar line-of-sight direction can be measured by a single data stack. To address these issues, we developed an improved persistent scatterers InSAR approach that can retrieve thermal dilation effects with an increased number of PTs along the railways. This proposed strategy effectively combines SAR amplitude, interferometric phase, and the spatial information of railway structures to maximize the number of PTs. A least square fitting of the residual phase obtained by iterative spatial-temporal filtering with respect to temperature difference is used to estimate the thermal dilation of metal and concrete-asphalt materials. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, case studies using ENVISAT ASAR (ASAR) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) datasets were carried out on the railways of Beijing-Tianjin, Beijing-Shanghai, and Shanghai-Hangzhou. Subsidence velocity, gradient, and thermal dilation were used to identify hazardous grades along each railway. Furthermore, linear deformation rates in two dimensions, i.e., vertical and west-east directions, along Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway were inverted from ascending ASAR and descending TSX observations to reveal track conditions at a high level of detail.

TI  - Vegetation phenology changes along an urban-rural gradient in Northeast China based on remote sensing
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes of vegetation phenology along the urban-rural gradients can reflect how urbanization regulates local water and heat conditions. Remote sensing can provide vegetation phenology at large scales (e.g. regional or global), making it a great alternative to traditional observation method. Taking three provincial capital cities (Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin) in Northeast China as examples, this study examined two critical phenology parameters (start of growing season, and end of growing season) in the buffer zones within 20 km from these urban areas, which were calculated from time series MODIS NDVI images using Savitzky-Golay filtering and segmented Gaussian method. Changes of multi-year mean parameters along the urban-rural gradients in relation to land surface temperature and forest coverage were analyzed. The results show that areas closer to urban sites tend to have earlier start of growing season, later end of growing season, and greater variability. Along the urban-rural gradients, 1 degrees C increase of land surface temperature in spring and last winter leads to an advance in start of growing season by 6-31 days, while 1 degrees C increase of land surface temperature in summer and autumn leads to a delay in end of growing season by 0.9-7.6 days. In some buffer zones, increase of forest coverage also contributes similar advances in start of growing season and delays in end of growing season.

AB  - Pan-sharpening is the process of fusing higher spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) with lower spatial resolution multispectral (MS) imagery to create higher spatial resolution MS images. Here, our overall objective was to pan-sharpen Landsat-8 images and calculate vegetation greenness (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), canopy structure (i.e., enhanced vegetation index (EVI)), and canopy water content (i.e., normalized difference water index (NDWI))-related variables. Our proposed methods consisted of: (i) evaluating the relationships between PAN band (0.503-0.676 mu m) with a spatial resolution of 15 m and individual MS bands of Landsat-8 from blue (i.e., acquiring in the range 0.452-0.512 mu m), green (i.e., 0.533-0.590 mu m), red (i.e., 0.636-0.673 mu m), near infrared (NIR: 0.851-0.879 mu m), shortwave infrared-I (SWIR-I: 1.566-1.651 mu m), and SWIR-II (2.107-2.294 mu m) bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m; (ii) determining the suitable individual MS bands to be enhanced into the spatial resolution of the PAN band; and (iii) calculating several vegetation greenness and canopy moisture indices (i.e., NDVI, EVI, NDWI-I, and NDWI-II) at 15 m spatial resolution and subsequent validation using their equivalent-values at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Our analysis revealed that strong linear relationships existed between the PAN and most of the MS individual bands of interest except NIR. For example, r(2) values were 0.86-0.89 for blue band; 0.89-0.95 for green band; 0.84-0.96 for red band; 0.71-0.79 for SWIR-I band; and 0.71-0.83 for SWIR-II band. As a result, we performed smoothing filter-based intensity modulation method of pan-sharpening to enhance the spatial resolution of 30 m to 15 m. In calculating the vegetation indices, we used the enhanced MS images and resampled the NIR to 15 m. Finally, we evaluated these indices with their equivalents at 30 m spatial resolution and observed strong relationships (i.e., r(2) values in the range 0.98-0.99 for NDVI, 0.95-0.98 for EVI, 0.98-1.00 for NDWI).

TI  - Modeling Future Land Cover Changes and Their Effects on the Land Surface Temperatures in the Saudi Arabian Eastern Coastal City of Dammam
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past several decades, Saudi cities have experienced rapid urban developments and land use and land cover (LULC) changes. These developments will have numerous short-and long-term consequences including increasing the land surface temperature (LST) of these cities. This study investigated the effects of LULC changes on the LST for the eastern coastal city of Dammam. Using Landsat imagery, the study first detected the LULC using the maximum likelihood classification method and derived the LSTs for the years 1990, 2002, and 2014. Using the classified results, it then modeled the future LULC for 2026 using the Cellular Automata Markov (CAM) model. Finally, using three thematic indices and linear regression analysis, it then modeled the LST for 2026 as well. The built-up area in Dammam increased by 28.9% between 1990 and 2014. During this period, the average LSTs for the LULC classes increased as well, with bare soil and built-up area having the highest LST. By 2026, the urban area is expected to encompass 55% of the city and 98% of the land cover is envisioned to have average LSTs over 41 degrees C. Such high temperatures will make it difficult for the residents to live in the area.

T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The lymphatic vasculature provides a route for cancer metastases, and its dysfunction after cancer treatment can result in lymphedema. However, changes in the lymphatics before, during, and after surgery and radiation remain unclear.Methods. Near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging was performed before and after lymph node dissection and fractionated radiotherapy to assess changes in external lymphatic function.Results. Patients who underwent both lymph node dissection and radiotherapy developed lymphatic dermal backflow on treated sides ranging from days after the start of radiotherapy to weeks after its completion, whereas contralateral regions that were not associated with lymph node dissection but also treated with radiotherapy experienced no such changes in external lymphatic anatomies.Conclusion. The external lymphatics undergo transient changes during and weeks after lymph node dissection and radiotherapy. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - A Review on Remote Sensing of Urban Heat and Cool Islands
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - The variation between land surface temperature (LST) within a city and its surrounding area is a result of variations in surface cover, thermal capacity and three-dimensional geometry. The objective of this research is to review the state of knowledge and current research to quantify surface urban heat islands (SUHI) and surface urban cool islands (SUCI). In order to identify open issues and gaps remaining in this field, we review research on SUHI/SUCI, the models for simulating UHIs/UCIs and techniques used in this field were appraised. The appraisal has revealed some great progress made in surface UHI mapping of cities located in humid and vegetated (temperate) regions, whilst few studies have investigated the spatiotemporal variation of surface SUHI/SUCI and the effect of land use/land cover (LULC) change on LST in arid and semi-arid climates. While some progress has been made, models for simulating UHI/UCI have been advancing only slowly. We conclude and suggest that SUHI/SUCI in arid and semi-arid areas requires more in-depth study.

AB  - Increased water demand and climate change impacts have recently enhanced the need to improve water resources management, even in those areas which traditionally have an abundant supply of water, such as the Po Valley in northern Italy. The highest consumption of water is devoted to irrigation for agricultural production, and so it is in this area that efforts have to be focused to study possible interventions. Meeting and optimizing the consumption of water for irrigation also means making more resources available for drinking water and industrial use, and maintaining an optimal state of the environment. In this study we show the effectiveness of the combined use of numerical weather predictions and hydrological modelling to forecast soil moisture and crop water requirement in order to optimize irrigation scheduling. This system combines state of the art mathematical models and new technologies for environmental monitoring, merging ground observed data with Earth observations from space and unconventional information from the cyberspace through crowdsourcing.

TI  - Quantification of wheat crop evapotranspiration and mapping: A case study from Bhiwani District of Haryana, India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study an attempt has been made to estimate the actual wheat crop evapotranspiration (ET,) by Surface Energy Balance Algorithm (SEBAL) and standardized FAO-Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) method. Improved knowledge of evapotranspiration (ET) helps in understanding the water balance of any region. The results obtained through measured lysimeter, SEBAL and PM method were evaluated through statistical performance measure tests. ETc estimated from SEBAL was found to correlate significantly as R-2 (0.91) with the measured ET, of lysimeter. ETc estimated by SEBAL was also compared with PM ET, with the help of crop coefficient and was found to correlate significantly as R-2 (0.85). The other statistical parameters (RMSE = 0.56, nRMSE = 0.09, MAE = 0.26, NRMSE = 0.20, R-RMSE= 0.27, NSE= 1, d = 0.87 (approximate to 1)) were also showing a good agreement between SEBAL ETc and PM ETc. The findings of work have suggested that SEBAL model shows a good potential to estimate spatial ETc for the region. Additionally the validation of models results were performed with the analysis of correlation between models ET, and district level wheat production and area under crop of five years. The results of this analysis outline that water availability and good amount of rainfall gives higher wheat yield and resulted into more ETc. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation and Inter-Comparison of Satellite Soil Moisture Products Using In Situ Observations over Texas, US
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this study was to evaluate four major remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products over the state of Texas. These remote sensing products are: (i) the Advanced Microwave Scanning RadiometerEarth Observing System (AMSR-E) (2002-September 2011); (ii) the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity system (SMOS, 2010-present); (iii) AMSR2 (2012-present); and (iv) the Soil Moisture Active Passive system (SMAP, 2015-present). The quality of the generated SM data is influenced by the accuracy and precision of the sensors and the retrieval algorithms used in processing raw data. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the quality of these satellite SM products using in situ measurements and/or by inter-comparing their data during overlapping periods. In this study, these two approaches were used where we compared each satellite SM product to in situ soil moisture measurements and we also conducted an inter-comparison of the four satellite SM products at 15 different locations in Texas over six major land cover types (cropland, shrub, grassland, forest, pasture and developed) and eight climate zones along with in situ SM data from 15 Mesonet, USCRN and USDA-NRCS Scan stations. Results show that SM data from SMAP had the best correlation coefficients range from 0.37 to 0.92 with in situ measurements among the four tested satellite surface SM products. On the other hand, SM data from SMOS, AMSR2 and AMSR-E had moderate to low correlation coefficients ranges with in situ data, respectively, from 0.24-0.78, 0.07-0.62 and 0.05-0.52. During the overlapping periods, average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the correlations between in situ and each satellite data were 0.13 (AMSR-E) and 0.13 (SMOS) cm(3)/cm(3) (2010-2011), 0.16 (AMSR2) and 0.14 (SMOS) cm(3)/cm(3) (2012-2016) and 0.13, 0.16, 0.14 (SMAP, AMSR2, SMOS) cm(3)/cm(3) (2015-2016), respectively. Despite the coarser spatial resolution of all four satellite products (25-36 km), their SM measurements are considered reasonable and can be effectively used for different applications, e.g., flood forecasting, and drought prediction; however, further evaluation of each satellite product is recommended prior to its use in practical applications.

TI  - Rapid assessment of a flood-affected population through a spatial data model
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During humanitarian emergencies, well-timed information on affected populations is central in planning humanitarian responses and the optimum allocation of available resources. However, this is usually only available following an on-ground assessment which, in most of the cases, comes too late to contribute to the initial decision-making process that informs the first wave of humanitarian response. To address this problem, a spatial model was developed for the assessment of the flood-affected population in a near real-time scenario. A flood extent vector, extracted from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer daily images, was superimposed on a LandScan population grid to estimate the population count living in the flooded area, aggregated by their respective administrative level. The methodology was found to be both time-and cost-efficient for riverine floods. The model was tested for its accuracy using an on-ground initial vulnerability assessment and the figures matched to within 80-90%. This model can be used with a confidence level of +/- 10% for riverine floods.

TI  - Derivation of Sea Surface Tidal Current From Spaceborne SAR Constellation Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate an application of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation data to derive sea surface tidal current at high spatial resolution. The maximum cross correlation (MCC) method, which has been widely applied to optical remote sensing data to derive sea surface velocities, is applied to X-band SAR data from TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X (TDX), which were operating in pursuit monostatic mode. Because of the short temporal interval of TSX and TDX's pursuit acquisitions, temporal decorrelation is minimized to derive tidal current fields that exhibit significant temporal and spatial variations. In addition, we combined data from TDX and another X-band SAR, COSMO-SkyMed, to obtain a virtual SAR constellation data pair, which was also analyzed using the MCC method to derive the tidal current field. Case studies of Hangzhou Bay in the East China Sea and Amrum Island in the North Sea are presented. The SAR-derived tidal current fields were compared to the results of numerical model simulations, high-frequency (HF) radar measurements and in situ measurements. MCC coefficients that are greater than 0.8 are an appropriate threshold for the further derivation of tidal currents. Comparisons to finite volume community ocean model, HF radar and general estuarine transport model results yield root-mean-square errors of 0.13, 0.06, and 0.05 m/s, respectively. Measurements from three field stations were also compared to the MCC SAR retrievals, yielding differences of 0.3, 0.07, and -0.09 m/s.

TI  - Increasing Morbidity with Extent of Lymphadenectomy for Primary Malignant Melanoma
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: According to current guidelines, complete lymphadenectomy (LAD) is indicated in melanoma patients with a positive sentinel lymph node. Whereas there is little evidence from randomized trials for a survival benefit of this procedure, its morbidity is not trivial. We aimed to assess clinical associations between risk factors and complications of LAD to guide decision making about this aspect of melanoma management.Methods and Results: A cohort of 174 patients who had undergone LAD for primary melanoma was retrospectively analyzed, and multivariable logistic regression models were used to correlate patient risk factors, tumor characteristics, number of excised lymph nodes, and procedural details with the incidence of complications. The overall rate of LAD-associated complications was 41.4%, 33.9% being lymphatic complications. The number of excised lymph nodes was independently associated with development of lymphatic complications (odds ratio 3.90/12.78 if more than 10/20 lymph nodes had been removed, p = 0.01/<0.001, respectively). However, the number of excised lymph nodes had no influence on overall survival using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.Conclusions: In this retrospective cohort study, an important association was found between the extent of LAD and lymphatic complications. Further studies should evaluate the necessity and extent of aggressive LAD to balance survival benefit with morbidity of LAD procedures.

TI  - Lymph nodes' capsular naevi are associated with high naevus count in melanoma patients: a case-control study
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Capsular naevi (CNs) in lymph nodes (LNs) are relatively common, occurring in 3-22% of patients who undergo LN surgery for melanoma. Naevus count is one of the principal risk factors for melanoma, as well as a prognostic factor in melanoma patients. However, little is known about the occurrence of CN in melanoma patients on the basis of their naevus count. A case-control study was performed, to look at the naevus count differences between CN-positive and CN-negative melanoma patients. Cases (CN positive) were matched for age, sex and Breslow thickness with controls (CN negative). Total naevus count was recorded at diagnosis and compared between the two groups. This study was conducted in a tertiary referral academic centre for skin cancer. Twenty-two positive CN patients were matched with 22 negative CN patients. The mean Breslow thickness was 2.66 mm (range: 0.6-9). Positive CN patients were significantly associated with an increasing naevus count on their skin (P=0.02). Patients with more than 100 naevi reported an odds ratio of 7.78 on having a CN compared with patients with fewer than 50 naevi on their skin (P=0.02). An increased melanocytic migration to LNs might be the reason for the association between CNs and a high number of melanocitic naevi on the skin. This could shed some light on the physiology of melanocytes and could be an easy way to predict patients at greater risk of having CNs. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Growth and the Nepal Earthquake 2015 for Sustainability of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The exodus of people from rural areas to cities brings many detrimental environmental, social and cultural consequences. Monitoring spatiotemporal change by referencing the historical timeline or incidence has become an important way to analyze urbanization. This study has attempted to attain the cross-sectional analysis of Kathmandu valley that has been plagued by rampant urbanization over the last three decades. The research utilizes Landsat images of Kathmandu valley from 1976 to 2015 for the transition analysis of land use, land cover and urban sprawl for the last four decades. Results showed that the urban coverage of Kathmandu valley has tremendously increased from 20.19 km(2) in 1976 to 39.47 km(2) in 1989 to 78.96 km(2) in 2002 to 139.57 km(2) in 2015, at the cost of cultivated lands, with an average annual urban growth rate of 7.34%, 7.70% and 5.90% in each temporal interval, respectively. In addition, the urban expansion orientation analysis concludes the significant urban concentration in the eastern part, moderately medium in the southwest and relatively less in the western and northwest part of the valley. Urbanization was solely accountable for the exploitation of extant forests, fertile and arable lands and indigenous and cultural landscapes. Unattended fallow lands in suburban areas have compounded the problem by welcoming invasive alien species. Overlaying the highly affected geological formations within the major city centers displays that unless the trend of rapid, unplanned urbanization is discontinued, the future of Kathmandu is at the high risk. Since land use management is a fundamental part of development, we advocate for the appropriate land use planning and policies for sustainable and secure future development.

TI  - Is the non-sentinel lymph node compartment the next site for melanoma progression from the sentinel lymph node compartment in the regional nodal basin?
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma patients with additional positive lymph nodes in the completion lymph node dissection (CLND) following a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy would have a poorer prognosis than patients with no additional positive lymph nodes. We hypothesize that the progression of disease from the SLN to the non-SLN compartment is orderly and is associated with the worsening of the disease status. Thus, the SLN and non-SLN compartments are biologically different in that cancer cells, in general, arrive in the SLN compartment before spreading to the non-SLN compartment. To validate this concept, we used a large cohort of melanoma patients from our prospective SLN database in an academic tertiary medical center. Adult cutaneous melanoma patients (n = 291) undergoing CLND after a positive SLN biopsy from 1994 to 2009 were analyzed. Comparison of 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival between positive (n = 66) and negative (n = 225) CLND groups was made. The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 55% (95% CI 49-62%) for patients with no additional LN on CLND versus 14% (95% CI 8-26%) in patients with positive LN on CLND (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The median disease-free survival time was 7.4 years with negative CLND (95% CI 4.4-15+ years) and 1.2 years with positive CLND (95% CI 1.0-1.8 years). The 5-year overall survival rates were 67% (95% CI 61-74%) for negative CLND versus 38% (95% CI 28-52%) for positive CLND (p < 0.0001, log-rank test). The median overall survival time was 12.1 years for negative CLND (95% CI 9.3-15+ years) and 2.5 years for positive CLND (95% CI 2.2-5.7 years). This study shows that CLND status is a significant prognostic factor for patients with positive SLNs undergoing CLND. Also, it suggests an orderly progression of metastasis from the SLN to the non-SLN compartment. Thus, the SLN in the regional nodal basin draining the primary melanoma may serve as an important gateway for metastasis to the non-SLN compartment and beyond to the systemic sites.

TI  - Sentinel node detection in muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer is feasible after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in all pT stages, a prospective multicenter report
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine whether sentinel node detection (SNd) in muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer (MIBC) can be performed in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and determine whether SNd is feasible in all pT stages, including pT0.Previous published series of SNd in MIBC have not included patients undergoing NAC, and systematic reports of pT0 patients w/wo NAC were absent. Translational immunological tumor research on MIBC focusing on SNd, in the era of NAC, requires technical feasibility. Additionally, SNd in MIBC requests further evaluations as a method for nodal staging.Ninety-nine patients with suspected urothelial MIBC were prospectively selected from six urological centers. After TUR-B and primary staging, 65 MIBC patients qualified for radical cystectomy. Precystectomy staging was cT2a-T4aN0M0, including 47 NAC patients and 18 chemo-na < ve patients. All 65 patients underwent intraoperative SNd by peritumoral injection of 80 Mbq Technetium and Geiger probe detection. Postcystectomy staging was pT0-T4aN0-N2M0. SNs were defined by two calculations, SNdef1 and SNdef2.Totally 1063 lymph nodes were removed (total SNs; 222-227). NAC patients with pT0 (n = 24) displayed a true positive detection in 91.7 % by either SNdef, with a median of 3.0 SNs. NACpT > 0 patients had a true positive detection in 87 % (SNdef1) and 91.3 % (SNdef2). In a univariate analysis, patient group neither NAC nor tumor downstaging influenced detection rates, regardless of SN definition. In total eight patients, 4/22 metastatic nodes were SNs while 18/22 were non-SNs.Sentinel node detection in MIBC is feasible also in NAC patients, regardless of pT stage. SNd played no role in nodal staging.

TI  - Linking Spaceborne and Ground Observations of Autumn Foliage Senescence in Southern Quebec, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Autumn senescence progresses over several weeks during which leaves change their colors. The onset of leaf coloring and its progression have environmental and economic consequences, however, very few efforts have been devoted to monitoring regional foliage color change in autumn using remote sensing imagery. This study aimed to monitor the progression of autumn phenology using satellite remote sensing across a region in Southern Quebec, Canada, where phenological observations are frequently performed in autumn across a large number of sites, and to evaluate the satellite retrievals against these in-situ observations. We used a temporally-normalized time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery to monitor the different phases of autumn foliage during 2011-2015, and compared the results with ground observations from 38 locations. Since the NDVI time-series is separately normalized per pixel, the outcome is a time-series of foliage coloration status that is independent of the land cover. The results show a significant correlation between the timing of peak autumn coloration to elevation and latitude, but not to longitude, and suggest that temperature is likely a main driver of variation in autumn foliage progression. The interannual coloration phase differences for MODIS retrievals are larger than for ground observations, but most ground site observations correlate significantly with MODIS retrievals. The mean absolute error for the timing of all foliage phases is smaller than the frequency of both ground observation reports and the frequency of the MODIS NDVI time-series, and therefore considered acceptable. Despite this, the observations at four of the ground sites did not correspond well with the MODIS retrievals, and therefore we conclude that further methodological refinements to improve the quality of the time series are required for MODIS spatial monitoring of autumn phenology over Quebec to be operationally employed in a reliable manner.

TI  - A Probabilistic Analysis of Positional Errors on Satellite Remote Sensing Data Using Scattered Interpolation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the recent development of CubeSats, several ultracompact, low cost, and rapidly deployable satellites have been developed for earth observation missions. Because of the geometry of the acquisition process, measurements are irregularly sampled, whereas in meteorological applications, data are preferred on a regular grid. This problem is further complicated by the fact that, due to CubeSats' compact sizes and constraints, such as limited power, errors occur in geolocation calibration, resulting in positional errors. In this letter, we analyze how the commonly used triangulation-based linear data interpolation scheme behaves under probabilistic models for the positional errors. The derived distribution of interpolation error caused by positional error is intractable even under a Gaussian distribution for positional errors. To address this problem, we developed an analytical closed-form solution to the first two moments of the interpolation error. Using models for positional errors motivated by our prior work, experimental results show that, compared with the first-order linear model, the second-order one provides a better approximation in terms of the mean and variance, which is very close to that is obtained using more computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations. This model also allows for the closed-form calculation of mean squared interpolation error, which can be of use in the context of system design where the impact of positional errors on remote sensing products must be considered.

TI  - Remote identification of research and educational activities using spectral properties of nighttime light
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research and educational activities (R&EAs) are major forces behind modern economic growth. However, data on geographic location of such activities are often poorly reported. According to our research hypothesis, intensities and spectral properties of artificial light-at-night (ALAN) can be used for remote identification of R&EAs, due to their unique ALAN signatures. In order to develop activity identification models, we carried out a series of in situ measurements of ALAN intensities and spectral properties in a major metropolitan area in Israel. For this task, we used an illuminance CL-500A spectrophotometer that measures the total intensity and spectral irradiance of ALAN, incremented by a 1-nm pitch, from 360 to 780 nm. As our analysis shows, logistic regressions, incorporating ALAN intensities at the peak or near-peak wavelengths, and geographical attributes of the measurement sites as controls, succeeded to predict correctly up to 98.6% of the actual locations of R&EAs. A digital camera satellite image, obtained from the Astronaut Photography Database, was used for the model's validation. According to the validation results, the actual locations of R&EAs coincided well with the estimated high probability areas, as confirmed by the values of Cohen's Kappa index of up to 64%, which indicate a reasonable level of agreement.

TI  - Road network extraction for interpreting large scale forest exploitation
T2  - Bulletin of the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to examine the method to extract road network which is an important key for interpreting large scale forest exploitation from satellite data. Study site was selected in the forested area which extends over Kompong Thom and Preah Vihear provinces, Cambodia. Landsat-8 OLI data was used in this study. Edge preservation smoothing filter were apply to NDVI image. Road networks which ran east-west and north-south direction in large scale forest exploitation area were extracted by edge detection and filtering procedures. Road networks in young rubber forest were extracted in large scale forest exploitation area. However, the road networks in bare soil which is immediately after exploitation and in mature rubber forest were not detected by this procedure. The extracted road networks by this study would be used for automatic forest change detection procedure combined with other spectral information such as NDVI difference in further study.

TI  - Adaptive Speckle Filtering for Time Series of Polarimetric SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal evolution of the polarimetric SAR data provides an extremely valuable information source for the various applications of this data. In this paper, the evolution of the agriculture crops in the time dimension is employed for multitemporal multidimensional speckle filtering. The proposed filtering method is based on a temporal statistical criterion dependent on all elements of the covariance matrix. Also, this method adaptively uses the pixels with the same scattering characteristics in the spatial and temporal space. The experimental results on time series of Radarsat-2 images show that the proposed filter preserves the polarimetric information and also has a better performance compared to the other used filters, based on different criteria such as the equivalent number of looks and edge-preservation parameter.

TI  - Multi-Algorithm Indices and Look-Up Table for Chlorophyll-a Retrieval in Highly Turbid Water Bodies Using Multispectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many approaches have been proposed for monitoring the eutrophication of Case 2 waters using remote sensing data. Semi-analytical algorithms and spectrum matching are two major approaches for chlorophyll-a (Chla) retrieval. Semi-analytical algorithms provide indices correlated with phytoplankton characteristics, (e.g., maximum and minimum absorption peaks). Algorithms' indices are correlated with measured Chla through the regression process. The main drawback of the semi-analytical algorithms is that the derived relation is location and data limited. Spectrum matching and the look-up table approach rely on matching the measured reflectance with a large library of simulated references corresponding to wide ranges of water properties. The spectral matching approach taking hyperspectral measured reflectance as an input, leading to difficulties in incorporating data from multispectral satellites. Consequently, multi-algorithm indices and the look-up table (MAIN-LUT) technique is proposed to combine the merits of semi-analytical algorithms and look-up table, which can be applied to multispectral data. Eight combinations of four algorithms (i.e., 2-band, 3-band, maximum chlorophyll index, and normalized difference chlorophyll index) are investigated for the MAIN-LUT technique. In situ measurements and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor data are used to validate MAIN-LUT. In general, the MAIN-LUT provide a comparable retrieval accuracy with locally tuned algorithms. The most accurate of the locally tuned algorithms varied among datasets, revealing the limitation of these algorithms to be applied universally. In contrast, the MAIN-LUT provided relatively high retrieval accuracy for Tokyo Bay (R-2 = 0.692, root mean square error (RMSE) = 21.4 mg m(-3)), Lake Kasumigaura (R-2 = 0.866, RMSE = 11.3 mg m(-3)), and MERIS data over Lake Kasumigaura (R-2 = 0.57, RMSE = 36.5 mg m(-3)). The simulated reflectance library of MAIN-LUT was generated based on inherent optical properties of Tokyo Bay; however, the MAIN-LUT also provided high retrieval accuracy for Lake Kasumigaura. MAIN-LUT could capture the spatial and temporal distribution of Chla concentration for Lake Kasumigaura.

TI  - Quantifying water stress effect on daily light use efficiency in Mediterranean ecosystems using satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The capacity of six water stress factors (epsilon(i)) to track daily light use efficiency (epsilon) of water-limited ecosystems was evaluated. These factors are computed with remote sensing operational products and a limited amount of ground data: epsilon(1) uses ground precipitation and air temperature, and satellite incoming global solar radiation; epsilon(2) uses ground air temperature, and satellite actual evapotranspiration and incoming global solar radiation; epsilon(3) uses satellite actual and potential evapotranspiration; epsilon(4) uses satellite soil moisture; epsilon(5) uses satellite-derived photochemical reflectance index; and epsilon(6) uses ground vapor pressure deficit. These factors were implemented in a production efficiency model based on Monteith's approach in order to assess their performance for modeling gross primary production (GPP). Estimated GPP was compared to reference GPP from eddy covariance (EC) measurements (GPP(EC)) in three sites placed in the Iberian Peninsula (two open shrublands and one savanna). epsilon(i) were correlated to epsilon, which was calculated by dividing GPP(EC) by ground measured photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and satellite-derived fraction of absorbed PAR. Best results were achieved by epsilon(1), epsilon(2), epsilon(3) and epsilon(4) explaining around 40% and 50% of epsilon variance in open shurblands and savanna, respectively. In terms of GPP, R-2 approximate to 0.70 were obtained in these cases.

TI  - Downward shortwave radiation estimation and spatial assessment on sites over complex terrain applying integrative approach of MTCLIM-XL, interpolation, RS and GIS
T2  - Environment Systems & Decisions
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is a highly variable solar source on spatiotemporal basis and essential for energy and agriculture systems, while its calculations are helpful in the environment-related studies, climatology, and monitoring fire risk. Statistical methods developed to extrapolate values of climatic variables and radiation could fail to generate reliable findings of DSR over a complex terrain without considering local topographic factors. In the present study, we proposed an integrative approach of MTCLIM-XL extrapolation with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) to estimate real-time DSR and its spatial potential over surfaces of contrasting elevated sites on a mountainous terrain of Quetta (Pakistan).Based on methodological approach, remote sensing data product of high-resolution DEM (SRTM 30m) was processed to extract topographic data, and meteorological data were obtained from a base site, Subsequently, MTCLIM-XL executed the simulation to calculate the daily-based DSR (W/m(2)).Spatial distribution of DSR was generated by applying deterministic interpolation with complementing quantification of Hillshade analysis for spatially obstructive surfaces, and resultant spatial hotspot-based potential was assessed on basis of specified threshold level (above 250 W/m(2) = 2 kW h/m(2)) over the specified area. We observed usable potential of DSR at target sites and its spatial distribution during the study period of 2015 to April 2016. Using EUMETSAT CMSAF data as a standard, the validation demonstrates agreeable results of low RMSE and high correlation coefficient values for selected sites, except some sites with relatively high elevations and irregular gradients. Analysis of solar zenith angle to evaluate its inverse relation with increment in DSR values shows agreeable high inverse relation, while the negative trend for only some sites features relatively high rugged topography. In conclusion, MTCLIM-XL with RS and GIS integration manifests as a reliable approach for estimation and spatial potential assessment-based exploration of DSR over complex terrain having no ground data, while prospectively it will complement to the environment-related studies on local to mesoscale.

TI  - Analysing land cover and land use change in the Matobo National Park and surroundings in Zimbabwe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - National parks are established to reduce human influence on nature and contribute to species conservation, biodiversity and ecological services. Other states of protection like the UNESCO world heritage sites, for example, are created for maintaining culturally important places or lifestyles. In the Matobo Hills (Zimbabwe) both states of protection are present, a national park and a world heritage site. In addition, the land outside the National Park belongs to two different systems of ownership, namely "common" (i.e. community-owned) and "not-common" (privately or governmentally owned) land.In this paper, we investigated how the state of protection and the ownership affected the land use and land cover. We derived maps using Landsat images from 1989, 1998 and 2014 by supervised classification with Random Forests. To compensate for the lack of ground data we inferred past land use and land cover from recent observations combining photographs, Google Earth images and change detection. We could identify four classes, namely shrub land, forest, patchy vegetation and agricultural area.The Matobo National Park showed a stable composition of land cover during the study period and the main changes were observable in the surroundings. Outside the national park, forest increased by about 7%. The common lands have changed substantially and their agricultural area decreased. We attribute this development to the Fast Track Land Reform, which took place in the early 2000s. Our approach shows that combining information on recent land cover with change detection allows to study the, temporal development of protected areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Feasibility of magnetic marker localisation for non-palpable breast cancer
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Accurate tumour localisation is essential for breast-conserving surgery of non-palpable tumours. Current localisation technologies are associated with disadvantages such as logistical challenges and migration issues (wire guided localisation) or legislative complexities and high administrative burden (radioactive localisation). We present MAgnetic MArker LOCalisation (MaMaLoc), a novel technology that aims to overcome these disadvantages using a magnetic marker and a magnetic detection probe. This feasibility study reports on the first experience with this new technology for breast cancer localisation.Materials and methods: Fifteen patients with unifocal, non-palpable breast cancer were recruited. They received concurrent placement of the magnetic marker in addition to a radioactive iodine seed, which is standard of care in our clinic. In a subset of five patients, migration of the magnetic marker was studied. During surgery, a magnetic probe and gammaprobe were alternately used to localise the markers and guide surgery. The primary outcome parameter was successful transcutaneous identification of the magnetic marker. Additionally, data on radiologist and surgeon satisfaction were collected.Results: Magnetic marker placement was successful in all cases. Radiologists could easily adapt to the technology in the clinical workflow. Migration of the magnetic marker was negligible. The primary endpoint of the study was met with an identification rate of 100%. Both radiologists and surgeons reflected that the technology was intuitive to use and that it was comparable to radioactive iodine seed localisation.Conclusion: Magnetic marker localisation for non-palpable breast cancer is feasible and safe, and may be a viable non-radioactive alternative to current localisation technologies.

TI  - Sentinel-1A/B Combined Product Geolocation Accuracy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1A and -1B are twin spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors developed and operated by the European Space Agency under the auspices of the Copernicus Earth observation programme. Launched in April 2014 and April 2016, Sentinel-1A and -1B are currently operating in tandem, in a common orbital configuration to provide an increased revisit frequency. In-orbit commissioning was completed for each unit within months of their respective launches, and level-1 SAR products generated by the operational SAR processor have been geometrically calibrated. In order to compare and monitor the geometric characteristics of the level-1 products from both units, as well as to investigate potential improvements, products from both satellites have been monitored since their respective commissioning phases. In this study, we present geolocation accuracy estimates for both Sentinel-1 units based on the time series of level-1 products collected thus far. While both units were demonstrated to be performing consistently, and providing SAR data products according to the nominal product specifications, a subtle beam- and mode-dependent azimuth bias common to the data from both units was identified. A method for removing the bias is proposed, and the corresponding improvement to the geometric accuracies is demonstrated and quantified.

TI  - Mapping the Twilight Zone-What We Are Missing between Clouds and Aerosols
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions can profit from an analysis of the transition regions between pure aerosol and pure clouds as detected in satellite data. This study identifies and evaluates pixels in this region by analysing the residual areas of aerosol and cloud products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Radiometer ( MODIS) satellite sensor. These pixels are expected to represent the "twilight zone" or transition zone between aerosols and clouds. In the analysis period ( February and August, 2007- 2011), about 20% of all pixels are discarded by both MODIS aerosol and cloud retrievals ("Lost Pixels"). The reflective properties and spatial distribution of Lost Pixels are predominantly in between pure aerosol and cloud. The high amount of discarded pixels underlines the relevance of analyzing the transition zone as a relevant part of the Earth's radiation budget and the importance of considering them in research on aerosol-cloud interactions.

TI  - Independent System Calibration of Sentinel-1B
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1B is the second of two C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites of the Sentinel-1 mission, launched in April 2016-two years after the launch of the first satellite, Sentinel-1A. In addition to the commissioning of Sentinel-1B executed by the European Space Agency (ESA), an independent system calibration was performed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) on behalf of ESA. Based on an efficient calibration strategy and the different calibration procedures already developed and applied for Sentinel-1A, extensive measurement campaigns were executed by initializing and aligning DLR's reference targets deployed on the ground. This paper describes the different activities performed by DLR during the Sentinel-1B commissioning phase and presents the results derived from the analysis and the evaluation of a multitude of data takes and measurements.

TI  - Considerations about the use of the Moon in X-band antenna G/T measurements
T2  - INFORMACIJE MIDEM-JOURNAL OF MICROELECTRONICS ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The most common G/T quality factor measurement methods applicable for operational X-band (8 GHz - 12 GHz) parabolic antennas with a reflector aperture diameter between 7 and 13m are reviewed. Analyses have shown that the most adequate astronomical source for the G/T measurement of the antennas with the size of interest is the Moon.Since the Moon's angular diameter is wider than the antenna's Half Power Beam Width (HPBW), a thorough analysis of the extended source size correction factor is performed. As a result, an efficient correction factor approximation method which is more accurate in case of efficiency losses is identified, and a best-fit estimation method for the HPBW verification is introduced.The proposed G/T quality factor measurement procedure is verified on an operational X-band 11 meter Cassegrain antenna, used for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite data acquisition. The results obtained with the proposed method, have provided accurate G/T factor estimations that are consistent and in line with the expectations. As further confirmation, the validity of the measurement method results is also verified against a G/T measurement done with the Cassiopeia A radio star as an RF source.

TI  - A Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating spatial and temporal variation in vegetation phenology from Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is a key indicator of vegetation response to global change. Satellite observations from coarse resolution sensors (i.e., MODIS and AVHRR) have been widely used to study impacts of climate anomalies on vegetation phenology. The advantage of coarse resolution sensors are daily observations across the entire globe, but the coarse spatial resolution, as well as the relatively short time span covered by MODIS, are significant drawbacks in analyzing landscape-scale trends in phenology. Time series data from the medium resolution sensor Landsat may overcome these issues. However, because of Landsat's lower observation frequency, phenological methods developed with coarse resolution data are not directly transferable. Here, we demonstrate a new Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for estimating inter-annual variation in vegetation phonology from Landsat time series while controlling for spatial variation. The method pools all available observations to estimate the spatial variation in phonological parameters, while specifically modeling inter-annual variation as random effect terms. The advantage of a Bayesian approach is the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from other phenology and climate observations to reduce variability in the estimates, as well as a more robust estimation of uncertainty. We demonstrate and evaluate the modeling framework with a case study of changing spring phenology in broad-leaved trees in the Bavarian Forest National Park in southern Germany. Results show that the model estimated the spatial and temporal variation in phonological parameters precisely. Temporal variation in start of season showed overall strong agreement with ground-based measures of bud-break variability (r = 0.82 [0.80-0.841). Our proposed modeling framework will help to better monitor and understand changes in vegetation phonology at scales yet unexplored by the phonological community. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Axial pattern flaps, using the deep circumflex iliac artery, superficial brachial and cranial superficial epigastric direct cutaneous arteries in the dog
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Three dogs (Boxer, Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd) between the age of 7-10 years were presented with the history of tumour masses on right caudo-lateral thigh, right cranial forearm and left cranial and caudal thoracic mammary gland region, respectively. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the tumour masses and the sentinel regional lymph nodes were done. Plain radiography was done to rule out distant metastasis. In all the three cases the tumour masses were large in size, firmly adherent to the tissues underneath and sufficient loose skin was not available to close the skin defect following surgery. Hence axial pattern flaps were chosen to close the skin defect, following wide margin excision of tumour masses, leaving 3 cm from all the dimensions including healthy tissue. Deep circumflex iliac axial pattern flap, superficial brachial axial pattern flap and cranial superficial epigastric axial pattern flap were chosen to close the skin defect in case 1, case 2 and case 3, respectively. Post-operatively the dogs were admitted in in-patient unit for 5 days to restrict movement of the dog for immobilization of the flap and for wound dressing. All the cases recovered uneventfully with few complications.

AB  - The component substitution (CS) scheme is one of the most efficient models used by different image fusion algorithms when merging multispectral and panchromatic images, acquired with different spatial and spectral resolutions. In this letter, a new CS-based image fusion method is proposed to reduce color distortion. First, multispectral images are clustered into several classes using spectral and spatial features, and then linear regression with non-negative coefficients is used to calculate summation weights for each class of pixels. To consider mixed pixels not belonging to any distinct class, the proposed method employs the fuzzy c-means algorithm. Qualitative and quantitative results are reported for two data sets, namely, Landsat-7 Enhanded Thematic Mapper Plus and QuickBird. Visual and statistical assessments show the validity of the proposed method.

TI  - Intercomparison of MODIS and VIIRS Fire Products in Khanty-Mansiysk Russia: Implications for Characterizing Gas Flaring from Space
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gas flaring is commonly used by industrial plants for processing oil and natural gases in the atmosphere, and hence is an important anthropogenic source for various pollutants including CO2, CO, and aerosols. This study evaluates the feasibility of using satellite data to characterize gas flaring from space by focusing on the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug in Russia, a region that is well known for its dominant gas flaring activities. Multiple satellite-based thermal anomaly data products at night are intercompared and analyzed, including MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra level 2 Thermal Anomalies product (MOD14), MODIS Aqua level 2 Thermal Anomalies product (MYD14), VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) Active Fires Applications Related Product (VAFP), and VIIRS level 2 Nightfire product (VNF). The analysis compares and contrasts the efficacy of these sensor products in detecting small, hot sources like flares on the ground in extremely cold environments such as Russia. We found that the VNF algorithm recently launched by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in characterizing gas flares in the region owing primarily to the use of Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands. Reconciliation of VNF's differences and similarities with other nighttime fire products is also conducted, indicating that MOD14/MYD14 and VAFP data are only effective in detecting those gas flaring pixels that are among the hottest in the region; incorporation of shortwave infrared (1.6 mu m) band used in VNF may improve the detection of relatively cooler gas flares. The gas flaring locations from the VNF product are validated using Google Earth images. It is shown that VNF's estimates of the area of gas flaring agree well with the Google image counterparts with a linear correlation of 0.91, highlighting its potential use for routinely monitoring emissions of gas flaring from space.

TI  - Monitoring selective logging with Landsat satellite imagery reveals that protected forests in Western Siberia experience greater harvest than non-protected forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - When timber harvesting is an important source of local income and forest resources are declining, even forests that are designated as protected areas may become vulnerable. Therefore, regular monitoring of forest disturbance is necessary to enforce the protection of forest ecosystems. However, mapping forest disturbance with satellite imagery can be complicated if the majority of the harvesting is selective logging and not clearcuts. Our goal was to map both selective logging and clearcuts within and outside of protected areas in Western Siberia, a region with a highly developed timber industry. Combining summer and winter imagery allowed us to accurately estimate not only clearcuts, but also selective logging. Winter Landsat images substantially improved our classification and resulted in a highly accurate forest disturbance map (97.5% overall accuracy and 86% user accuracy for the rarest class, clearcuts). Selective logging and stripcuts were the dominant disturbance types, accounting for 96.3% of all forest disturbances, versus 3.7% for clearcuts. The total annual forest disturbance rate (i.e. disturbance rate for clearcuts, stripcuts and selective logging together) was 0.53%, but total forest disturbance within protected areas was greater than in non-protected forest (0.66% versus 0.50%, respectively), and so was the annual rate of selective logging (i.e. without clearcuts, 0.37% versus 0.25%, respectively). Our results highlight that monitoring only clearcuts without assessing selective logging might result in significant underestimation of forest disturbance. Also, when timber harvesting is important for the local economy and when protected areas have valuable timber resources that have already been depleted elsewhere, then additional protection may be necessary in order to maintain natural forests within protected areas. We suggest that this is the situation in our study area in Western Siberia right now and is likely the situation in many other parts of the globe as well.

TI  - Monitoring wind farms occupying grasslands based on remote-sensing data from China's GF-2 HD satellite-A case study of Jiuquan city, Gansu province, China
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind power is a clean and renewable resource, and it is rapidly becoming an important component of sustainable development and resource transfer. However, the construction of wind farms impacts the environment and has been the subject of considerable research. In this study, we verified whether China's GF-2 HD satellite (GF-2) could be used to monitor the 10 million kilowatt wind power grassland construction area in Jiuquan City, Gansu Province. Monitoring was performed by comparing the imaging results from the Landsat 8 OLI and China's GF-1 HD satellite (GF-1). We performed an interactive interpretation of the remote sensing images and verified the accuracy of these interpretations using measured field data. We evaluated 354 pieces of wind turbine equipment with an average construction density of 0.31 km(2) per device. The construction of a single wind turbine was found to damage nearly 3000 m(2) of grassland. The average area of grassland damaged by 3 MW and 1.5 MW turbines was 5757 m(2) and 2496 m(2), respectively. Approximately 2.44 km(2) of farmland was occupied by wind power construction and accounted for approximately 2.2% of the study area. Roads covered 60.6% of the farmland occupied by wind power construction. The average difference between the measured and calculated GF-2 image data was 0.09, and the overall interpretation accuracy was approximately 84%. Therefore, the use of comprehensive imaging analyses and GF-2 image data are feasible for monitoring grasslands under construction for wind power. In addition, the impacts of wind farm construction on vegetation destruction and soil erosion are discussed. In this study, grassland wind farms are explored using remote sensing tools to guide decision making with regards to the rational use of grassland resources and their sustainable development.

TI  - Can a Machine Generate Humanlike Language Descriptions for a Remote Sensing Image?
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates an intriguing question in the remote sensing field: "can a machine generate humanlike language descriptions for a remote sensing image?" The automatic description of a remote sensing image (namely, remote sensing image captioning) is an important but rarely studied task for artificial intelligence. It is more challenging as the description must not only capture the ground elements of different scales, but also express their attributes as well as how these elements interact with each other. Despite the difficulties, we have proposed a remote sensing image captioning framework by leveraging the techniques of the recent fast development of deep learning and fully convolutional networks. The experimental results on a set of high-resolution optical images including Google Earth images and GaoFen-2 satellite images demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate robust and comprehensive sentence description with desirable speed performance.

TI  - Attribution of Disturbance Agents to Forest Change Using a Landsat Time Series in Tropical Seasonal Forests in the Bago Mountains, Myanmar
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016, in response to forest loss, the Myanmar government banned logging operations for 1 year throughout the entire country and for 10 years in specific regions. However, it is unclear whether this measure will effectively reduce forest loss, because disturbance agents other than logging may have substantial effects on forest loss. In this study, we investigated an approach to attribute disturbance agents to forest loss, and we characterized the attribution of disturbance agents, as well as the areas affected by these agents, in tropical seasonal forests in the Bago Mountains, Myanmar. A trajectory-based analysis using a Landsat time series was performed to detect change pixels. After the aggregation process that grouped adjacent change pixels in the same year as patches, a change attribution was implemented using the spectral, geometric, and topographic information of each patch via random forest modeling. The attributed agents of change include "logging", "plantation", "shifting cultivation", "urban expansion", "water invasion", "recovery", "other change", and "no change". The overall accuracy of the attribution model at the patch and area levels was 84.7% and 96.0%, respectively. The estimated disturbance area from the attribution model accounted for 10.0% of the study area. The largest disturbance agent was found to be logging (59.8%), followed by water invasion (14.6%). This approach quantifies disturbance agents at both spatial and temporal scales in tropical seasonal forests, where limited information is available for forest management, thereby providing crucial information for assessing forest conditions in such environments.

TI  - Mega Donors' Perspectives on Philanthropy and Government Relations in Israel
T2  - SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Philanthropists' involvement in the development and implementation of social policies is a growing yet understudied phenomena. Captured in the model of alternative politics, in which self-provision of public services emerges when citizens face the failure of private and public mechanisms, not only in terms of obtaining sufficiently high-quality services, but also in terms of utilizing political channels to influence public policy, and poses major challenges to the political system. This dynamic of welfare states in recent decades is contested, since while it provides new streams of funding and innovative and professional capacities, it also has potential negative repercussions to democratic processes, equity and universalism of social policies. In-depth interviews with fourteen Israeli mega donors are used to show how mega donors promote relations between philanthropy and government in Israel that are based on voluntary cooptation in which the government regulates the philanthropic activity in Israel. By voluntarily granting the government a mandate to regulate philanthropic activity, the mega donors lead philanthropy into a situation in which philanthropy's autonomy may be jeopardized and its agendas may be subordinated to the priorities, preferences and business-minded worldview of the ruling elite - the political elite (government) and the business elites (mega donors).

T2  - IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Letter
AB  - Because estimating the amount of disaster waste will affect all subsequent restoration processing, it is necessary to quickly estimate the quantity and extent of disaster waste. This estimation can be accomplished using remote sensing data with the development of a method for extracting detailed information buried in a one-pixel mixed class ('mixel'). In a previous study, the use of RapidEye data observed during, before and after an earthquake, we proposed methods to extract detailed information buried in the mixel and classify land cover information. Moreover, we proposed methods of estimating disaster building domain and disaster building numbers. However, the amount of disaster waste has not yet been estimated. In this paper, we propose such a method using the results of estimating disaster building numbers. (C) 2017 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI  - Image Enhancement for Surveillance Video of Coal Mining Face Based on Single-Scale Retinex Algorithm Combined with Bilateral Filtering
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance videos of coal mining faces have close relation to the safety of coal miners and mining efficiency. However, surveillance videos are always disturbed by some severe conditions such as atomization, low illumination, glare, and so on. Therefore, this paper proposed a hybrid algorithm (SSR-BF) based on the integration of single-scale Retinex (SSR) and bilateral filtering (BF) to enhance the image quality of surveillance videos. BF was coupled with SSR to reduce the noises and perfect the edge information in the image. The schematic diagram and pseudocode of SSR-BF was designed, and the parameters were set rationally to ensure the enhancement effects through some simulations. Finally, some comparisons with other methods were carried out, and the simulation results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm was superior to others and could be applied to image enhancement for poormonochrome images, especially the surveillance video of a coal mining face.

In this study, we combine area-average measurements from a laser scintillometer above the forest with optical satellite data at high spatial resolution to obtain area-wide evapotranspiration data. The processing of field data includes the calculation of energy storage in forest biomass and the partitioning of evapotranspiration into transpiration and evaporation. Satellite-based estimates are calibrated by using tower flux measurements and meteorological data within periods of humid and less-humid atmosphere. The annual evapotranspiration was 1316 mm, of which 1086 mm per year corresponds to the forest transpiration at the study site. Average values of 4.7 and 4.1 mm d(-1) per tree crown are observed under humid and less-humid atmospheric conditions, respectively, when applying high-resolution area-wide evapotranspiration in individual crown analysis. Approximately 24% of the observed crowns show a positive monthly change in ET, and 51% of the crowns show a significant change in the daily ET, which can be considered sensitive individuals concerning water relationships. The limitations in the area-wide evapotranspiration at the crown level can be explained by considering the spectral responses of the crown individuals. The presented method can be robustly deployed in the ecological monitoring of mountain forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - From Words to Worldview: Framing Narrative Genres
T2  - POETICS TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article draws together overlapping cognitive analyses of political thought, emotion, and language and shows how they can be supplemented with literary analyses of genre to illuminate the workings of the French Revolution debate of 1790s Britain. It focuses on enriching George Lakoff's theory of the multiple levels of framing in discourse, concentrating on the interplay of argument and narrative frames. Studies of emotion and mood in narrative genres are adapted to refine Lakoff's account of narrative, making it more complex, systematic, and sensitive to historical context. Applying the revised theory, the essay characterizes contrasts between Edmund Burke's and Thomas Paine's thought at all levels of framing. It shows how their lexical frames for "revolution" diverge as their main arguments craft opposing issue-defming frames for the central moral issue of revolution versus reform. Those arguments highlight different key figures and events yet draw on similar narrative genres to frame them. Importantly, high genres of heroic romance inspire elevation toward one's own side by celebrating victories and lamenting tragedies, and low genres of satire inspire contempt toward opponents by ridiculing deserved failures and absurd successes. Thus narrative genre ties surface-frame phrases like "rights of man" and "swinish multitude" to deep-frame assumptions about more fundamental concepts (human nature, society, government).

TI  - Necrotizing Enterocolitis and Growth in Preterm Infants Fed Predominantly Maternal Milk, Pasteurized Donor Milk, or Preterm Formula: A Retrospective Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the association between necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), growth, and feeding.Methods This is a retrospective study of 551 infants (birth weight <= 1,500 g, <= 32 weeks' gestation). NEC, Bell's stage >= 2, was confirmed by independent review of sentinel radiographs. Feeding type was defined as >= 50% maternal milk (MM), pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM), or preterm formula (PF). Demographic and clinical characteristics including growth were compared between the three groups. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to control variables that differed in bivariate analysis.Results PDHM and PFmothers were more likely to be African-American, be enrolled in Medicaid, and have chorioamnionitis. PF mothers received antenatal steroids less frequently. NEC rates were different by feeding group (MM: 5.3%; PHDM: 4.3%; PF: 11.4%; p = 0.04). Adjusting for group differences, lower gestational age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.97; p = 0.02], and PF (aOR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.15-5.53; p = 0.02] were associated with NEC. There were no differences in other health outcomes or growth at hospital discharge.Conclusion MM and PDHM feedings, given until 34 weeks postmenstrual age, were associated with lower rates of NEC in very low birth weight infants without interfering with growth.

TI  - Woodland expansion in South African grassy biomes based on satellite observations (1990-2013): general patterns and potential drivers
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increases in woody plant cover in savanna grassland environments have been reported on globally for over 50 years and are generally perceived as a threat to rangeland productivity and biodiversity. Despite this, few attempts have been made to estimate the extent of woodland increase at a national scale, principally due to technical constraints such as availability of appropriate remote sensing products. In this study, we aimed to measure the extent to which woodlands have replaced grasslands in South Africa's grassy biomes. We use multiseason Landsat data in conjunction with satellite L-band radar backscatter data to estimate the extent of woodlands and grasslands in 1990 and 2013. The method employed allows for a unique, nationwide measurement of transitions between grassland and woodland classes in recent decades. We estimate that during the 23-year study period, woodlands have replaced grasslands over similar to 57 000 km(2) and conversely that grasslands have replaced woodlands over similar to 30 000 km(2), a net increase in the extent of woodland of similar to 27 000 km(2) and an annual increase of 0.22%. The changes varied markedly across the country; areas receiving over 500 mm mean annual precipitation showed higher rates of woodland expansion than regions receiving <500 mm (0.31% yr(-1) and 0.11% yr(-1), respectively). Protected areas with elephants showed clear loss of woodlands (-0.43% yr(-1)), while commercial rangelands and traditional rangelands showed increases in woodland extent (>0.19% yr(-1)). The woodland change map presented here provides a unique opportunity to test the numerous models of woody plant encroachment at a national/regional scale.

TI  - Ship Detection in Polarimetric SAR Images via Variational Bayesian Inference
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel ship detection approach in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images via variational Bayesian inference. First, we express the polarimetric SAR image as a tensor, and decompose the SAR image as the sum of a sparse component associated with ships and a sea clutter component. These components are denoted by some latent variables. Then, we introduce hierarchical priors of the latent variables to establish the probabilistic model of ship detection. By using variational Bayesian inference, we estimate the posterior distributions of the latent variables. Finally, the ship detection result is obtained in the iterative Bayesian inference process. By virtue of the tensor representation of polarimetric SAR image, the proposed approach explicitly uses all the polarization channels of the SAR image, and avoids the possible information loss in scalar polarimetric feature representation. Moreover, the proposed approach needs no sliding windows. The variational Bayesian inference process actually uses all the pixels instead of the limited pixels in sliding windows. Thus, the proposed approach has good ship detection performance and shape preserving ability, which is especially suitable for congested sea areas. Experimental results accomplished over C-band RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR images demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art ship detection performance.

TI  - Estimating fractional vegetation cover and the vegetation index of bare soil and highly dense vegetation with a physically based method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of highly dense vegetation (NDVIv) and bare soil (NDVIs), identified as the key parameters for Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) estimation, are usually obtained with empirical statistical methods However, it is often difficult to obtain reasonable values of NDVIv and NDVIs at a coarse resolution (e.g., 1 km), or in arid, semiarid, and evergreen areas. The uncertainty of estimated NDVIs and NDVIv can cause substantial errors in FVC estimations when a simple linear mixture model is used. To address this problem, this paper proposes a physically based method. The leaf area index (LAI) and directional NDVI are introduced in a gap fraction model and a linear mixture model for FVC estimation to calculate NDVIV and NDVIs. The model incorporates the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model parameters product (MCD43B1) and LAI product, which are convenient to acquire. Two types of evaluation experiments are designed 1) with data simulated by a canopy radiative transfer model and 2) with satellite observations. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for simulated data is less than 0.117, depending on the type of noise added on the data. In the real data experiment, the RMSD for cropland is 0.127, for grassland is 0.075, and for forest is 0.107. The experimental areas respectively lack fully vegetated and non-vegetated pixels at 1 km resolution. Consequently, a relatively large uncertainty is found while using the statistical methods and the RMSD ranges from 0.110 to 0.363 based on the real data. The proposed method is convenient to produce NDVIv and NDVIs maps for FVC estimation on regional and global scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 59th Annual Meeting of the Southeastern-Society-of-Plastic-and-Reconstructive-Surgeons
CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - The Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventing Healing Approach (LYMPHA) procedure entails performing a lymphovenous bypass (LVB) at the time of axillary lymph node dissection to reduce lymphedema risk. The two most common fluorophores utilized in LVB are blue dye and indocyanine green. We developed a novel application of fluorescein isothiocyanate for intraoperative lymphatic mapping. Our goal is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of fluorescein isothiocyanate for this application. We reviewed a prospectively collected database on breast cancer patients who underwent LYMPHA from March to September 2015. Fluorescein isothiocyanate was used to identify arm lymphatic channels after axillary lymph node dissection to perform an LVB between disrupted lymphatics and axillary vein tributaries. Data on preoperative and intraoperative variables were analyzed. Thirteen patients underwent LYMPHA with intraoperative fluorescein isothiocyanate lymphatic mapping from March to September 2015. Average patient age was 50 years with a mean body mass index of 28. On average, 3.4 lacerated lymphatic channels were identified at an average distance of 2.72 cm (range, 0.25-5 cm) caudal to the axillary vein. On average, 1.7 channels were bypassed per patient. Eleven anastomoses were performed to the accessory branch of the axillary vein and 1 to a lateral branch. In 1 patient, a bypass was not performed due to poor lymphatic caliber and inadequate length of the harvested vein tributary. No intraoperative adverse events were noted. Fluorescein isothiocyanate is a safe and effective method for intra-operative lymphatic mapping. Fluorescein isothiocyanate imaging allows for simultaneous dissection and lymphatic visualization, making it an ideal agent for lymphatic mapping and dissection in open surgical fields, such as in the LYMPHA procedure.

TI  - Serum HE4 is correlated to prognostic factors and survival in patients with endometrial cancer
T2  - VIRCHOWS ARCHIV
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent of surgery and the decision for adjuvant treatment in patients with endometrial cancer (EC) depend on the presence of risk factors for lymph node metastases and disease recurrence. Postoperative markers such as myometrial infiltration and specific mutations can select patients for adjuvant treatment but will not influence surgical planning. A biomarker stratifying patients into low-risk and high-risk groups before surgery could identify patients who benefit from more extensive surgery. Therefore, we evaluated the correlation of serum biomarker HE4 with clinical and recently identified prognostic pathological variables and survival. Patients treated for endometrial cancer between 1994 and 2014 were included. Serum HE4 concentration was measured in preoperatively obtained samples. A total of 88 patients were eligible for analysis. The majority (64%) was diagnosed with endometrioid-type adenocarcinoma. Serum HE4 concentration is significantly associated with stage of disease (p = 0.001), deep myometrial invasion (p < 0.001), exact depth of myometrial invasion (>= 4 mm) (p = 0.01), tumour-free distance to serosa (<= 7 mm) (p < 0.001), extensive lymph vascular space invasion (p = 0.04) and cervical involvement (p = 0.001). HE4 concentration and nodal involvement were correlated, although not significant (p = 0.17). Serum HE4 is an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (HR 5.12 per 10-fold increase in HE4, 95% CI 1.54-17.1) and overall survival (HR 7.48 per 10-fold increase in HE4, 95% CI 1.76-31.7). HE4 is a prognostic marker in endometrial cancer and is helpful in addition to other variables for the preoperative risk stratification of patients with endometrial cancer.

T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an efficient paddy field mapping method using object-based image analysis and a bitemporal data set acquired by Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager. In the proposed approach, image segmentation is the first step and its quality has a serious impact on the accuracy of paddy field classification. In order to improve segmentation quality, a new segmentation algorithm based on a frequently used method, fractal net evolution approach, is developed, with improvement mainly in merging criteria. In order to automate the process of scale parameter determination, an unsupervised scale selection method is utilized to determine the optimal scale parameter for the proposed image segmentation approach. After segmentation, four types of object-based features including geometric, spectral, textural, and contextual information are extracted and input into the subsequent classification procedure. By using a random forest classifier, paddy fields and nonpaddy fields are separated. The proposed image segmentation method and the final classification result are both quantitatively evaluated. Our segmentation method outperformed two popular algorithms according to three supervised evaluation criteria. The classification result with overall accuracy of 91.00% and kappa statistic of 0.82 validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further analysis on feature importance indicated that spectral features made the most contribution as compared to the other three types of object-based features.

TI  - A study of a matching pixel by pixel (MPP) algorithm to establish an empirical model of water quality mapping, as based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Linear regression models are a popular choice for the relationships between water quality parameters and bands (or band ratios) of remote sensing data. However, this research regards the phenomena of mixed pixels, specular reflection, and water fluidity as the challenges to establish a robust regression infidel. Based on the data of measurements in situ and remote sensing data, this study presents an enumeration based algorithm, called matching pixel by pixel (MPP), and tests its performance in an empirical model of water quality mapping. Four small reservoirs, which cover a mere several hundred-thousand m(2), in Kinmen, Taiwan, are selected as the study sites. The multispectral sensors, carried on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), are adopted to acquire remote sensing data regarding water quality parameters, including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Secchi disk depth (SDD), and turbidity in the reservoirs. The experimental results indicate that, while MPP can reduce the influence of specular reflection on regression model establishment, specular reflection does hamper the correction of thematic map production. Due to Water fluidity, sampling in situ should be followed by UAV imaging as soon as possible. Excluding turbidity, the obtained estimation accuracy can satisfy the national standard.

M3  - Article
AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) solar irradiance measurements performed in the central Andes, Huancayo, Peru (12.0 degrees S, 75.3 degrees W, 3313 m asl) at 1 min intervals between January 2003 and December 2006 were used to analyse daily, monthly, and annual cycles of UV solar irradiance. The measurements were performed using a GUV-511 multi-channel filter radiometer at four wavelengths: 305, 320, 340, and 380 nm. UV irradiance data under clear sky and all sky conditions were separated using a procedure based on calculation of normalized irradiance. In February, the highest hourly mean value at noon for the UV Index reached 18.8 for clear sky conditions and 15.5 for all sky conditions, with outlier peaks close to UVI = 28. In addition, the highest mean value for the daily erythemal dose was found also in February, reaching 7.5 kJ m(-2) d(-1) with a maximum outlier value close to 10.1 kJ m(-2) d(-1). Comparisons between the clear sky GUV measurements and TUV model estimations were evaluated with statistical quantities showing values of R-2 close to 0.98. The total ozone column and trace gases were obtained from OMI. The aerosol parameters were obtained from MODIS. The enhancements due to clouds of spectral irradiance at 340 nm as compared to a cloudless sky reach maxima of 20%. These results indicate that tropical central Andes has among the highest incident ultraviolet solar radiation in the world.

TI  - Assessment of NUCAPS S-NPP CrIS/ATMS Sounding Products Using Reference and Conventional Radiosonde Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The NOAA unique combined atmospheric processing system (NUCAPS) sounding products derived from Suomi national polar-orbiting partnership (S-NPP) cross track infrared sounder/advanced technology microwave sounder (CrIS/ATMS) are assessed. This is done using collocated radiosondes from reference sites (i.e., global reference upper air network and satellite synchronized launch sites) and conventional upper air observing sites as the target data. Analysis of satellite retrieval bias and root-meansquare (rms) error, conducted on a global scale and at individual sites with representative climate regimes, indicates the NUCAPS temperature and water vapor retrieval performance meets the operational uncertainty requirements. Caution, however, is needed in this type of approach. In our empirical analyses, we find that the satellite retrieval rms error is sensitive to 1) the time mismatch in radiosonde launch and satellite overpass, particularly near the surface and tropopause for temperature and around the midtroposphere for water vapor, 2) vertical resolution differences between the satellite retrieval and radiosonde that become manifested as a larger rms error in the vicinity of the planetary boundary layer and tropopause, and 3) the accuracy of radiosonde water vapor measurements particularly in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere where dry bias are prevalent. Examples highlighting these issues in the context of satellite data calibration and validation are provided.

TI  - Evaluation of the global MODIS 30 arc-second spatially and temporally complete snow-free land surface albedo and reflectance anisotropy dataset
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo is an essential variable for surface energy and climate modeling as it describes the proportion of incident solar radiant flux that is reflected from the Earth's surface. To capture the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of the land surface, satellite remote sensing must be used to monitor albedo accurately at a global scale. However, large data gaps caused by cloud or ephemeral snow have slowed the adoption of satellite albedo products by the climate modeling community. To address the needs of this community, we used a number of temporal and spatial gap-filling strategies to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of the global land surface MODIS BRDF, albedo and NBAR products. A rigorous evaluation of the gap-filled values shows good agreement with original high quality data (RMSE =0.027 for the NIR band albedo, 0.020 for the red band albedo). This global snow-free and cloud free MODIS BRDF and albedo dataset (established from 2001 to 2015) offers unique opportunities to monitor and assess the impact of the changes on the Earth's land surface.

TI  - Estimating Population Density Using DMSP-OLS Night-Time Imagery and Land Cover Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Population density is an essential indicator of human society. Night-time light (NTL) data provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) has been widely used in estimating population distribution, due to its capability of indicating human activity. The overglow effect of the DMSP-OLS NTL image caused by reflection of light from adjacent areas and the different population distribution patterns between urban and rural areas have limited its application in estimating population density. Therefore, a method was proposed to reduce the overglow effect and to model urban and rural population densities separately. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product was applied to reduce the overglow effect and to separate urban and rural areas. In urban area, the extracted urban DMSP-OLS NTL image was used to model population density. In rural area, a slope adjusted human settlement index (SAHSI), based on digital elevation model, MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the DMSP-OLS NTL data, was proposed to estimate rural population density. Guangdong Province of China was taken as the study area for it has diverse population densities. The estimation in urban area was compared with population densities derived from normalized difference vegetation index adjusted NTL urban index (VANUI) and EVI adjusted NTL urban index (VANUI-EVI). Population density in the rural area was compared with results from EVI adjusted human settlement index (HSI-EVI) and the NTL data. The mean relative error of the proposed method was 55.14% in urban areas, which was better than VANUI (60.10%) and VANUI-EVI (60.16%), and was 71% in rural areas, which was 6% lower than HSI-EVI and 3% lower than NTL data. The result indicates that the proposed method has the ability to reduce the overglow effect of DMSP-OLS NTL image and to correct the impact of terrain on rural population density estimation.

TI  - Inter-comparison of remote sensing sensing-based shoreline mapping techniques at different coastal stretches of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many techniques are available for detection of shorelines from multispectral satellite imagery, but the choice of a certain technique for a particular study area can be tough. Hence, for the first time in literature, an inter-comparison of the most widely used shoreline mapping techniques such as Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Improved Band Ratio (IBR) Method, and Automatic Water Extraction Index (AWEI) has been done along four different coastal stretches of India using multitemporal Landsat data. The obtained results have been validated with the high-resolution images of Cartosat-2 (panchromatic) and multispectral images from Google Earth. Performance of the above indices has been analyzed based on the statistics, such as overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and the average deviation from the reference line. It is observed that the performance of NDWI and IBR techniques are dependent on the physical characteristics of the sites, and therefore, it varies from one site to another. Results indicate that unlike these two indices, the AWEI algorithm performs consistently well followed by MNDWI irrespective of the land cover types.

TI  - Trends in Greenness and Snow Cover in Alaska's Arctic National Parks, 2000-2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In cold-limited arctic environments, the duration and timing of the snow cover and the vegetation green season have major ecological implications. I monitored the phenology of snow cover and greenness using MODIS Terra satellite data for the years 2000 to 2016 in the 5 National Parks of northern Alaska, USA. Mann-Kendall trend tests showed that the end of the continuous snow season and midpoint of spring green-up became significantly earlier in parts of the study area over the 16-year period. Using the observed relationship between thaw degree-days at Kotzebue, Alaska and dates of snow-off and half green-up in nearby lowland tundra for the 16 years of MODIS data, I reconstructed the dates of snow-off and half green-up from long-term Kotzebue weather records back to 1937. The average snow-off and green-up dates probably became earlier by about 6 days over this 80-year time interval. Remote sensing of fall vegetation senescence and establishment of the snow cover were less reliable than the spring events due to cloudiness and low sun angles. The annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) generally did not increase significantly from 2001 to 2016, except in places where vegetation was recovering from forest fires.

TI  - First Report of Mating Disruption With an Aggregation Pheromone: A Case Study With <i>Tetropium fuscum</i> (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tetropium fuscum (F.), native to Europe and established in Nova Scotia, Canada, since at least 1990, is considered a low-to-moderate threat to spruce (Picea spp.) forests in North America and regulated as a quarantine pest by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. We tested broadcast applications of the aggregation pheromone racemic (5E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-ol (fuscumol), formulated at 10% concentration in Hercon BioFlakes (Hercon International, Emigsville, PA), for efficacy in disrupting T. fuscum mating and suppressing populations. Two applications of 2.5-2.75 kg Bio-Flakes (250-275 g a.i.) per ha per season significantly reduced trap catches and mating success (2009, 2010, 2012): about 30% of females trapped in treated plots had mated compared with 60% of females trapped in untreated plots. Similar reductions in mating success were observed in 2011 with one or two 4.5 kg/ha applications of Bio-Flakes. Mean densities of T. fuscum colonizing sentinel bait logs or girdled trees were 36% lower in pheromone-treated plots than in untreated plots, but the difference was not statistically significant. Lack of population suppression may have been because mated females immigrated into treated plots or because populations were so high that despite a 50% reduction in mating success, absolute numbers of mated females were sufficient to infest our bait logs or trees. This is the first demonstration of insect mating disruption via broadcast application of an aggregation pheromone. Pheromone-mediated mating disruption has potential to slow the spread of invasive cerambycids by targeting low-density outlier populations near or beyond the leading edge of an infestation.

TI  - Land use and land cover changes and Soil erosion in Yezat Watershed, North Western Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion affects land qualities and water resources. This problem is severe in Ethiopia due to its topographic features. The present research was aimed to estimate spatiotemporal changes in land-use/ land-cover pattern and soil erosion in the Yezat watershed in Ethiopia. This study was carried out by using landsat imageries of 2001, 2010 and 2015. Images were classified into categories using supervised classification by maximum likelihood algorithm. They were also classified into different biomass levels by using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis. Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation modeling was applied in a GIS environment to quantify the potential soil erosion risk. The area under grassland, woodland and homesteads have increased by 610.69 (4%), 101.69 (0.67%) and 126.6 ha (0.83%) during 2001-2015. The extent of cultivated land and shrub/bushland was reduced by 323.43(0.02%) and 515.44 ha (3.41%), respectively, during the same period. The vegetation cover in the watershed decreased by 91% during 2001-2010, and increased by 88% during 2010-2015. Increase of NDVI values indicates better ground cover due to implementation of integrated watershed development program in the region. The estimated annual soil losses were 7.2 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2001, 7.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2010 and 4.8 t ha-1 yr kin 2015. Management interventions are necessary to improve the status and utilization of watershed resources in response to sustainable land management practices for sustainable livelihood of the local people.

TI  - Optical Cloud Pixel Recovery via Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a widely used index to monitor vegetation and land use change. NDVI can be retrieved from publicly available data repositories of optical sensors such as Landsat, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) and several commercial satellites. Studies that are heavily dependent on optical sensors are subject to data loss due to cloud coverage. Specifically, cloud contamination is a hindrance to long-term environmental assessment when using information from satellite imagery retrieved from visible and infrared spectral ranges. Landsat has an ongoing high-resolution NDVI record starting from 1984. Unfortunately, this long time series NDVI data suffers from the cloud contamination issue. Though both simple and complex computational methods for data interpolation have been applied to recover cloudy data, all the techniques have limitations. In this paper, a novel Optical Cloud Pixel Recovery (OCPR) method is proposed to repair cloudy pixels from the time-space-spectrum continuum using a Random Forest (RF) trained and tested with multi-parameter hydrologic data. The RF-based OCPR model is compared with a linear regression model to demonstrate the capability of OCPR. A case study in Apalachicola Bay is presented to evaluate the performance of OCPR to repair cloudy NDVI reflectance. The RF-based OCPR method achieves a root mean squared error of 0.016 between predicted and observed NDVI reflectance values. The linear regression model achieves a root mean squared error of 0.126. Our findings suggest that the RF-based OCPR method is effective to repair cloudy pixels and provides continuous and quantitatively reliable imagery for long-term environmental analysis.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present our experience of managing penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in a tertiary hospital in Singapore and to evaluate the prognostic value of the inflammatory markers neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR).PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed our prospectively maintained Institutional Review Board-approved urological cancer database to identify men treated for penile SCC at our centre between January 2007 and December 2015. For all the patients identified, we collected epidemiological and clinical data.RESULTS: In all, 39 patients were identified who were treated for penile SCC in our centre. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] follow-up was 34 (16.5-66)months. Although very few (23%) of our patients with high-risk clinical node-negative underwent prophylactic inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND), they still had excellent 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS; 90%) and cancer-specific survival (CSS; 90%). At multivariate analysis, higher N stage was significantly associated with worse RFS and CSS. Patients with a high NLR (≥2.8) had significantly higher T-stage (P=0.006) and worse CSS (P<0.001) than those with a low NLR. Patients with a low LMR (<3.3) had significantly higher T-stage (P=0.013) and worse RFS (P=0.009) and CSS (P<0.022) than those with a high LMR.CONCLUSIONS: Although very few of our patients with intermediate- and high-risk clinical node-negative SCC underwent prophylactic ILND, they still had excellent 5-year RFS and CSS. However, survival was poor in patients with node-positive disease. The pre-treatment NLR and LMR could serve as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of patients with penile cancer.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Temperature From MODIS Data for the Atmosphere With Air Temperature Inversion Profile
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature inversion (ATI), which usually occurs at the near surface boundary layer in the atmosphere, influences the thermal path atmospheric upwelling and downwelling radiances. Because it is difficult to determine the occurrence of temperature inversion from satellite data, the influence of ATI on the retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) was not considered in the development of LST retrieval algorithm. This paper aims to analyze and reduce the influence of ATI on LST retrieval in the generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm. The GSW coefficients are reparameterized by using the ATI profiles from the thermodynamic initial guess retrieval cloud-free database. Comparison of the root-mean-square errors calculated before and after using the reparameterized coefficients in the GSW algorithm from the numerical simulations showed that the LST retrieval accuracy could be improved by 0.71 K for viewing zenith angle equivalent to 60 degrees. Intercomparisons using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products MOD11_L2/MYD11_L2 and in situ LST measured at the Hailar field site in northeastern Inner Mongolia, China, showed that the LST retrieval accuracy could be improved by 0.4 K using the reparamerization coefficients in the GSW algorithm when the atmosphere is occurred by ATI.

TI  - Global Performance of a Fast Parameterization Scheme for Estimating Surface Solar Radiation From MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A fast parameterization scheme named SUNFLUX is first used in this paper to estimate instantaneous surface solar radiation (SSR) based on products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard both Terra and Aqua platforms. The scheme mainly takes into account the absorption and scattering processes due to clouds, aerosols, and gas in the atmosphere. The estimated instantaneous SSR is evaluated against surface observations obtained from seven stations of the surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD), four stations in the North China Plain (NCP) and 40 stations of the baseline surface radiation network (BSRN). The statistical results for evaluation against these three data sets show that the relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of SUNFLUX are less than 15%, 16%, and 17%, respectively. Daily SSR is derived through temporal upscaling from the MODIS-based instantaneous SSR estimates, and is validated against surface observations. The relative RMSE values for daily SSR estimates are about 16% at the seven SURFRAD stations, four NCP stations, 40 BSRN stations, and 90 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) radiation stations. The accuracy of the scheme is generally higher than those of previous algorithms, and thus can be potentially applied on geostationary satellites for mapping high-resolution SSR data in the future.

TI  - An efficient algorithm for calculating photosynthetically active radiation with MODIS products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is the critical forcing data in ecological and agricultural fields. Remote sensing can be utilized to derive spatiotemporally continuous PAR. Empirical algorithms can be used to quickly retrieve surface PAR data sets, but their accuracy cannot be guaranteed in regions without local calibration. Physical algorithms generally incorporate all relevant physical processes and can be used globally, but their computational efficiency is often low. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is developed to calculate surface PAR by combining a clear-sky PAR model and the parameterizations for cloud transmittances. In the algorithm, the transmittances for water vapor, ozone, Rayleigh, aerosol, and cloud are each handled across the whole PAR band (400700 nm). In addition, the contribution of the multiple reflections between surface ground and the atmosphere are also expressly considered. The new algorithm is applied to estimate instantaneous PAR with inputs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products onboard both Terra and Aqua platforms. The daily PAR is estimated from these two instantaneous values by an upscaling method. The instantaneous and daily PAR estimates were validated with in situ data collected in the USA and China. The results indicate that the new algorithm, based on MODIS products, can effectively retrieve PAR with root mean square errors (RMSE) of about 40 W m(-2) and 15 W m(-2) at instantaneous and daily-mean time scales, respectively. These performances are generally better than those of previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Remotely Monitoring Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency of Grassland and Cropland in China's Arid and Semi-Arid Regions with MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scarce water resources are available in the arid and semi-arid areas of Northwest China, where significant water-related challenges will be faced in the coming decades. Quantitative evaluations of the spatio-temporal dynamics in ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE), as well as the underlying environmental controls, are crucial for predicting future climate change impacts on ecosystem carbon-water interactions and agricultural production. However, these questions remain poorly understood in this typical region. By means of continuous eddy covariance (EC) measurements and time-series MODIS data, this study revealed the distinct seasonal cycles in gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and WUE for both grassland and cropland ecosystems, and the dominant climate factors performed jointly by temperature and precipitation. The MODIS WUE estimates from GPP and ET products can capture the broad trend in WUE variability of grassland, but with large biases for maize cropland, which was mainly ascribed to large uncertainties resulting from both GPP and ET algorithms. Given the excellent biophysical performance of the MODIS-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI), a new greenness model (GR) was proposed to track the eight-day changes in ecosystem WUE. Seasonal variations and the scatterplots between EC-based WUE and the estimates from time-series EVI data (WUEGR) also certified its prediction accuracy with R-2 and RMSE of both grassland and cropland ecosystems over 0.90 and less than 0.30 g kg(-1), respectively. The application of the GR model to regional scales in the near future will provide accurate WUE information to support water resource management in dry regions around the world.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Forest in the Transnational Area of Changbai Mountain from 1977 to 2015: A Comparative Analysis of the Chinese and DPRK Sub-Regions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The transnational area of Changbai Mountain (TACM) is crucial to sustainable development in Northeast Asia owing to its abundant forest, which helps in maintaining biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services. However, the spatiotemporal patterns of forest in the TACM have been poorly understood across the whole region. The objectives of this study were to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of forest in the TACM from 1977 to 2015, investigate the causes of forest dynamics, and assess the impacts of forest dynamics on habitat quality. To do this, we first extracted the forest in the TACM from Landsat images acquired in 1977, 1988, 1999, 2007, and 2015 using visual interpretation. Then, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of forest in the TACM from 1977 to 2015 using landscape metrics and compared the dynamics of forest between the area in China and the area in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). After that, we investigated the driving forces of forest dynamics and the impacts of forest dynamics on habitat quality. We found that the TACM experienced a noticeable forest decrease-from 1.57 million ha in 1977 to 1.48 million ha in 2015, a decline of 5.78%-and underwent a forest fragmentation process. In particular, the sub-region in the DPRK had a much larger decrease (17.75%) than the sub-region in China (2.86%). We found that timber harvesting, urban expansion, agricultural reclamation, and typhoon disasters were the main driving forces behind forest decreases in the TACM. Specifically, agricultural reclamation was the most important factor in the DPRK sub-region, while urban expansion was the dominant factor in the Chinese sub-region. Furthermore, such forest loss and fragmentation has resulted in declines in habitat quality across both sides of the TACM. Thus, we suggest that more effective forest management with cooperation between China and DPRK is needed to maintain and improve forest coverage in the TACM.

TI  - Moving Targets Detection Capacities Improvement in Multichannel SAR Framework
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When using multichannel synthetic aperture radar (MSAR) to perform moving target detection, the coherence between the received signals is closely linked to the detection capacities of the system. In airborne MSAR context, because of the platform movement, the antenna patterns, as well as the phase shifts between the channels, evolve in different ways during the integration time. In this paper, these dissimilarities are shown to cause a degradation of coherence, and hence of detection capacities. A method to enhance the coherence is then developed. This method is based on the estimation of the steering vector. It is applied on two sets of real data, and the obtained results validate the method.

TI  - Application of persistent scatterers interferometry for surface displacements monitoring in N5E open pit iron mine using TerraSAR-X data, in Carajas Province, Amazon region
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carajas Mineral Province, Amazon region, is the most important one in Brazil. Vale S.A. Company has the right to operate in the area of the N5E mine. The work is conducted on rock alteration products of low geomechanical quality related to sandstones, siltstones, and a lateritic cover. In order to monitor ground deformation, 33 TerraSAR-X images covering the period of March 2012-April 2013 were used in the investigation. An interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) approach based on permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) using an interferometric point target analysis algorithm was applied. Results demonstrated that most of the area was considered stable during the time span of the image acquisition. However, persistent scatterers (PSs) with high deformation rates were mapped over a landfill probably related to settlements. To validate the PSI data, graphs were generated with the displaced information based on topographic measurements in the field. The graphs showed that the surface deformations during TSX-1 runway coverage are within the miner's safety threshold and do not present a risk of major problems. The PSI data provided a synoptic and detailed view of the deformation process that affects the mining complex without the need of field campaign or instrumentation.

TI  - The Effect of Religiosity on Life Satisfaction in a Secularized Context: Assessing the Relevance of Believing and Belonging
T2  - REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The positive relationship between religiosity and life satisfaction is well-established. This relationship is, however, likely to vary across cultural contexts and different religious affiliations. Furthermore, research is needed to uncover why religion is relevant for life satisfaction. Addressing these issues, we investigate what dimensions of being religious play a role in the life satisfaction of individuals with different religious affiliations, including the understudied Muslim category, in the highly secularized Dutch context. We examine 'believing', which captures how religion provides meaning and a coherent worldview, and 'belonging', which comprises both cultural benefits of being embedded in a congregation with a shared framework of meaning and structural benefits due to more social ties. Analyses of the NEtherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (n = 5312) first indicate that Muslims display significantly lower life satisfaction than the non-religious, which appears to be due to their underprivileged social position rather than intra-religious factors of believing and belonging. Second, we find that Catholics experience significant life satisfaction benefits compared to those who are not religious, and that only belonging plays a role in this association. Next to the beneficial effect of the structural aspect of belonging, which revolves around social ties, a cultural aspect of religious belonging appears to be salient, suggesting that an important life satisfaction advantage of religious communities lies in their ability to foster a sense of solidarity and commitment through a shared framework of meaning. We make several recommendations for further research based on these findings.

TI  - Estimation of Snow Cover Area, Snow Physical Properties and Glacier Classification in Parts of Western Himalayas Using C-Band SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow physical properties, snow cover and glacier facies are important parameters which are used to quantify snowpack characteristics, glacier mass balance and seasonal snow and glacier melt. This study has been done using C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of Indian radar imaging satellite, radar imaging satellite-1 (RISAT)-1, to estimate the seasonal snow cover and retrieve snow physical properties (snow wetness and snow density), and glacier radar zones or facies classification in parts of North West Himalaya (NWH), India. Additional SAR data used are of Radarsat-2 (RS-2) satellite, which was used for glacier facies classification of Smudra Tapu glacier in Himachal Pradesh. RISAT-1 based snow cover area (SCA) mapping, snow wetness and snow density retrieval and glacier facies classification have been done for the first time in NWH region. SAR-based inversion models were used for finding out wet and dry snow dielectric constant, dry and wet SCA, snow wetness and snow density. RISAT-1 medium resolution scan-SAR mode (MRS) in HV polarization was used for first time in NWH for deriving time series of SCA maps in Beas and Bhagirathi river basins for years 2013-2014. The SAR-based inversion models were implemented separately for RISAT-1 quad pol. FRS2, for wet snow and dry snow permittivity retrieval. Masks for layover and shadow were considered in estimating final snow parameters. The overall accuracy in terms of R-2 value comes out to be 0.74 for snow wetness and 0.72 for snow density based on the limited ground truth data for subset area of Manali sub-basin of Beas River up to Manali for winter of 2014. Accuracy for SCA was estimated to be 95 % when compared with optical remote sensing based SCA maps with error of +/- 10 %. The time series data of RISAT-1 MRS and hybrid data in RH/RV mode based decompositions were also used for glacier radar zones classification for Gangotri and Samudra Tapu glaciers. The various glaciers radar zones or facies such as debris covered glacier ice, clean or bare glacier ice radar zone, percolation/refreeze radar zone and wet snow, ice wall etc., were identified. The accuracy of classified maps was estimated using ground truth data collected during 2013 and 2014 glacier field work to Samudra Tapu and Gangotri glaciers and overall accuracy was found to be in range of 82-90 %. This information of various glacier radar zones can be utilized in marking firn line of glaciers, which can be helpful for glacier mass balance studies.

TI  - mSOAR: an effective bedside stroke prognosis tool
T2  - CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The modified-SOAR (mSOAR) score is composed of the stroke subtype, Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification, age, pre-stroke modified Rankin score (mRS) and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. It has previously been shown to be a reliable predictor of mortality and length of hospital stay. This study sought to identify whether the mSOAR can also be used to predict patient disability on discharge. A post-hoc calculation of mSOAR using Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) data and electronic discharge summaries was performed on all stroke admissions to Bridgend Hospital over an 11-month period. This study included 230 patients, of which 88% had suffered infarcts and 23% had experienced a previous cerebrovascular episode or transient ischaemic attack; 52% were female. The mortality rate was 13% and 57% had slight disability or less (mRS <= 2) on discharge. Each increase in mSOAR score was associated with significantly worse discharge disability (p<0.05). We conclude that the mSOAR score is an excellent tool for predicting both discharge disability and mortality. As such, it's useful for admission prognosis discussions with patients, their relatives and the multidisciplinary team and for early supported discharge decision making.

TI  - Detection of Sinkhole Precursors Through SAR Interferometry: Radar and Geological Considerations
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinkholes are an unpredictable geohazard that endanger life and property in dolomitic terrains. Sinkholes are a significant threat in Gauteng, South Africa's most populated and urbanized province. Small-scale surface subsidence is frequently present prior to the collapse of a sinkhole. Therefore, the presence of precursory surface deformation can be exploited to develop early warning systems. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) differential interferometry (DInSAR) is able to monitor small-scale surface deformation over large areas and can be used to detect and measure precursors to sinkhole development. This letter investigates the use of repeat-pass DInSAR to detect sinkhole precursors in the Gauteng province. Twenty stripmap acquisitions from TerraSAR-X were acquired over a full year. DInSAR results revealed the presence of three previously unknown deformation features, one of which could be confirmed by subsequent field investigations. Furthermore, a water supply pipeline ruptured six months after the initial observation. The detection of the deformation, therefore, provided a viable early warning to landowners who were unaware of the subsidence. Detected deformation features were between 40 and 100 m in diameter. The maximum displacement measured was 50 mm over 55 days. Despite the successful detection, seven sinkhole events occurred in the observation period, for which no deformation could be detected. The results indicate that high-resolution X-band interferometry is able to monitor dolomite-induced instability in an urban environment. However, considerations related to SAR interferometry and physical sinkhole properties need to be addressed before DInSAR can be used in an operational early warning system.

T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The four-month mission of a Wave Glider in the Southern Ocean has demonstrated the capability for an autonomous surface vehicle to make sustained measurements of air-sea interactions in remote regions. Several new sensor payloads were integrated for this mission, including a three-axis sonic anemometer for turbulent wind stress estimation and a high-resolution atmospheric pressure gage. The mission focused on Drake Passage, where strong gradients are common along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) fronts. Using satellite data products, pilots ashore were able to remotely navigate the Wave Glider across the ACC Polar Front and measure changes in air-sea coupling. The resulting data set combines the persistence of a mooring with the adaptability of a ship-based survey.

TI  - Dynamic Monitoring of the Largest Freshwater Lake in China Using a New Water Index Derived from High Spatiotemporal Resolution Sentinel-1A Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and is well known for its ecological function and economic importance. However, due to the influence of clouds, it is difficult to dynamically monitor the changes in water surface areas using optical remote sensing. To address this problem, we propose a novel method to monitor these changes using Sentinel-1A data. First, the Sentinel-1A water index (SWI) was built using a linear model and a stepwise multiple regression analysis method with Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 imagery acquired on the same day. Second, water surface areas of Poyang Lake from 24 May 2015 to 14 November 2016 were extracted by the threshold method utilizing time-series SWI data with an interval of 12 days. The results showed that the SWI threshold classification method could be applied to different regions during different periods with high quantity accuracy (approximately 99%). The water surface areas ranged between 1726.73 km(2) and 3729.19 km(2) during the study periods, indicating an extreme variability in the short term. The maximum and average values of the changed areas were 875.57 km(2) (with a change rate of 35%) and 197.58 km(2) (with a change rate of 8.2%), respectively, after 12 days. The changes in the mid-western region of Poyang Lake were more dramatic. These results provide baseline data for high-frequency monitoring of the ecological environment and wetland management in Poyang Lake.

T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study tested the use of machine learning techniques for the estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) of Sonneratia caseolaris in a coastal area of Hai Phong city, Vietnam. We employed a GIS database and multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN) to build and verify an AGB model, drawing upon data from a survey of 1508 mangrove trees in 18 sampling plots and ALOS-2 PALSAR imagery. We assessed the model's performance using root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-2), and leave-one-out cross-validation. We also compared the model's usability with four machine learning techniques: support vector regression, radial basis function neural networks, Gaussian process, and random forest. The MLPNN model performed well and outperformed the machine learning techniques. The MLPNN model-estimated AGB ranged between 2.78 and 298.95Mgha(-1) (average=55.8Mgha(-1)); below-ground biomass ranged between 4.06 and 436.47Mgha(-1) (average=81.47Mgha(-1)), and total carbon stock ranged between 3.22 and 345.65Mg C ha(-1) (average=64.52Mg C ha(-1)). We conclude that ALOS-2 PALSAR data can be accurately used with MLPNN models for estimating mangrove forest biomass in tropical areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Variation in vegetation cover in Inner Mongolia has been previously studied by the remote sensing data spanning only one decade. However, spatial and temporal variations in vegetation cover based on the newly released GIMMS NDVI3g data spanning nearly thirty years have yet to be analyzed. In this study, we applied the methods of the maximum value composite (MVC) and Pearson's correlation coefficient to analyze the variations of vegetation cover in Inner Mongolia based on GIMMS NDVI3g data spanning from 1982 to 2013. Our results indicate that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increased at a rate of 0.0003/a during the growing seasons despite of the drier and hotter climate in Inner Mongolia during the past three decades. We also found that vegetation cover in the southern agro-pastoral zone significantly increased, while it significantly decreased in the central Alxa. The variations in vegetation cover were not significant in the eastern and central regions. NDVI is positively correlated with precipitation (r=0.617, P=0.000) and also with air temperature (r=0.425, P=0.015), but the precipitation had a greater effect than the air temperature on the vegetation variations in Inner Mongolia.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes and fragmentation of mangroves and its effects on fish diversity in Ca Mau Province (Vietnam)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are important economically and ecologically, however mangrove cover has declined dramatically leading to habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss. Information on mangrove cover change, fragmentation and impacts on fish diversity is poorly understood. The aims of this study are to detect spatiotemporal changes and mangrove status, examine fragmentation changes and associated effects on fish diversity. Landsat images in1989, 2000, and 2013 were used to classify mangrove cover in Ca Mau Province (Vietnam) and validated against high resolution Pleiades imagery. Fragmentation changes in mangrove cover were examined using series of landscape metrics evaluated against fish diversity indices (Simpson's index, Jaccard's coefficient and relative abundance). Results show that mangrove cover has declined 24.6% in the province. Currently, high and moderately dense mangroves distribute in southern half of the region while the low density mangroves occurs in the northern half. Over the 24 year study periods, the number of patches and edge density has increased 58% and 53.9%, respectively, while the mean patch size and mean patch edge has decreased 52.3% and 26.6%. Fish diversity in the more highly fragmented mangrove area was 1.78 times lower than the less fragmented mangrove. The study illustrates the applicability of using Landsat satellite imagery for use in mangrove fragmentation studies as well as the impact of fragmentation.

TI  - Evaluating Urban Land Carrying Capacity Based on the Ecological Sensitivity Analysis: A Case Study in Hangzhou, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present the evaluation of urban land carrying capacity (ULCC) based on an ecological sensitivity analysis. Remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) technology are employed to analyze topographic conditions, land-use types, the intensity of urban development, and ecological environmental sensitivity to create reasonable evaluation indicators to analyze urban land carrying capacity based on ecological sensitivity in the rapidly developing megacity of Hangzhou, China. In the study, ecological sensitivity is grouped into four levels: non-sensitive, lightly sensitive, moderately sensitive, and highly sensitive. The results show that the ecological sensitivity increases progressively from the center to the periphery. The results also show that ULCC is determined by ecologically sensitive levels and that the ULCC is categorized into four levels. Even though it is limited by the four levels, the ULCC still has a large margin if compared with the current population numbers. The study suggests that the urban ecological environment will continue to sustain the current population size in the short-term future. However, it is necessary to focus on the protection of distinctive natural landscapes so that decision makers can adjust measures for ecological conditions to carry out the sustainable development of populations, natural resources, and the environment in megacities like Hangzhou, China.

TI  - Possibility of Estimating Seasonal Snow Depth Based Solely on Passive Microwave Remote Sensing on the Greenland Ice Sheet in Spring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise related to the melting and thinning of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), a subject of growing concern in recent years, will eventually affect the global climate. Although the melting of snow on the GrIS is actively monitored by passive microwave remote sensing, very few studies have estimated the seasonal GrIS snow depth using this technique. In this study, to estimate seasonal snowpack on GrIS, we investigated the microwave property and optimum physical parameters. We used our microwave radiative transfer model to create a lookup table and a simple satellite retrieval algorithm to estimate seasonal snow depth on GrIS in spring, based on the microwave satellite brightness temperature from AMSR-E and AMSR2. Our research suggests there is potential for estimating snow depth based solely on GrIS passive microwave remote sensing data. We validated these estimates against in situ snow depths at several sites and compared them with the snow spatial distributions over the entire GrIS of several major products (ERA-interim, MAR ver. 5.3.1 and GLDAS-CLM) that evaluate snow depth.

TI  - Comparing Airborne Laser Scanning, and Image-Based Point Clouds by Semi-Global Matching and Enhanced Automatic Terrain Extraction to Estimate Forest Timber Volume
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information pertaining to forest timber volume is crucial for sustainable forest management. Remotely-sensed data have been incorporated into operational forest inventories to serve the need for ever more diverse and detailed forest statistics and to produce spatially explicit data products. In this study, data derived from airborne laser scanning and image-based point clouds were compared using three volume estimation methods to aid wall-to-wall mapping of forest timber volume. Estimates of forest height and tree density metrics derived from remotely-sensed data are used as explanatory variables, and forest timber volumes based on sample field plots are used as response variables. When compared to data derived from image-based point clouds, airborne laser scanning produced slightly more accurate estimates of timber volume, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.3% using multiple linear regression. In comparison, RMSEs for volume estimates derived from image-based point clouds were 28.3% and 29.0%, respectively, using Semi-Global Matching and enhanced Automatic Terrain Extraction methods. Multiple linear regression was the best-performing parameter estimation method when compared to k-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machine. In many countries, aerial imagery is acquired and updated on regular cycles of 1-5 years when compared to more costly, once-off airborne laser scanning surveys. This study demonstrates point clouds generated from such aerial imagery can be used to enhance the estimation of forest parameters at a stand and forest compartment level-scale using small area estimation methods while at the same time achieving sampling error reduction and improving accuracy at the forest enterprise-level scale.

TI  - Scattering Characteristics of X-, C- and L-Band PolSAR Data Examined for the Tundra Environment of the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula, Canada
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data at X-, C- and L-Bands, acquired by the satellites: TerraSAR-X (2011), Radarsat-2 (2011), ALOS (2010) and ALOS-2 (2016), were used to characterize the tundra land cover of a test site located close to the town of Tuktoyaktuk, NWT, Canada. Using available in situ ground data collected in 2010 and 2012, we investigate PolSAR scattering characteristics of common tundra land cover classes at X-, C- and L-Bands. Several decomposition features of quad-, co-, and cross-polarized data were compared, the correlation between them was investigated, and the class separability offered by their different feature spaces was analyzed. Certain PolSAR features at each wavelength were sensitive to the land cover and exhibited distinct scattering characteristics. Use of shorter wavelength imagery (X and C) was beneficial for the characterization of wetland and tundra vegetation, while L-Band data highlighted differences of the bare ground classes better. The Kennaugh Matrix decomposition applied in this study provided a unified framework to store, process, and analyze all data consistently, and the matrix offered a favorable feature space for class separation. Of all elements of the quad-polarized Kennaugh Matrix, the intensity based elements K0, K1, K2, K3 and K4 were found to be most valuable for class discrimination. These elements contributed to better class separation as indicated by an increase of the separability metrics squared Jefferys Matusita Distance and Transformed Divergence. The increase in separability was up to 57% for Radarsat-2 and up to 18% for ALOS-2 data.

TI  - Characterisation and improvement of the structure function estimation for application in PSI
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) is becoming state of the art for the compensation of atmospheric effects in InSAR and especially in PSI. The structure function (variogram) estimated on the InSAR data and on the NWP data is a required statistical characteristic and very useful in the processing of the data. For example, the structure function (typically the semivariogram) estimated on InSAR data is fundamental for the Kriging of the atmospheric phase screen (APS) based on irregular PSI estimates. The required parameters are the nugget, the range and the slope of the structure function. The practical implementation has shown that the NWP predicted structure function and the InSAR estimated structure function based on the conventional semivariogram equation do not match. Straightforward explanations are wrongly estimated APSs due to an insufficient number of interferograms or hindcasts that fail to capture the turbulent water vapour signal. However, in this paper we explain the effects of noise in interferograms and coarse resolution in the NWP on the conventional structure function estimation resulting in the observed mismatch. In order to avoid the mismatch, an alternative implementation based on wavelets is suggested and demonstrated using real Sentinel-1 data. We show that the wavelet based structure function estimation outperforms the conventional structure function estimation based on a variogram. Application of the proposed structure function alternative based on NWP data are the master selection, the estimation of the effective NWP data resolution, and a statistical consistency check of the estimated InSAR APS. To support the understanding, we demonstrate the effects of noise and resolution using simulated fractals. An application of the proposed wavelet based structure function estimation is the estimation of the effective NWP data resolution, which is demonstrated using the same Sentinel-1 data test case.

TI  - Malignancy in Solitary Thyroid Nodules: Evaluation of Risk Factors
T2  - ONCOLOGY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate patients with suspicious solitary nodules undergoing bilateral total thyroidectomy for the presence of malignancy. Patients and Methods: 141 patients with true solitary thyroid nodules who underwent bilateral total thyroidectomy at the Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Hospital between 2008 and 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. Parameters including demographics, ultrasonographic findings, and laboratory values were analyzed. Results: When the final pathology results were evaluated, malignancy was found in 52/141 (36.9%) patients. 49 (94.2%) of these lesions were papillary carcinoma. Colloidal nodules accounted for 30.3% of all benign cases. Nodular irregularity, increased vascularity, microcalcification, and central/lateral lymphadenopathy significantly increased the risk of malignancy. Among these factors, increased vascularity was the most important risk factor and microcalcification the second. Nodule size did not affect the risk of malignancy. Conclusion: Irregular borders, microcalcification, increased vascularity, and detection of cervical lymphadenopathy were found to be correlated with malignancy in solitary nodules. (C) 2017 S.

TI  - Metastasis detection from whole slide images using local features and random forests
T2  - CYTOMETRY PART A
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital pathology has led to a demand for automated detection of regions of interest, such as cancerous tissue, from scanned whole slide images. With accurate methods using image analysis and machine learning, significant speed-up, and savings in costs through increased throughput in histological assessment could be achieved. This article describes a machine learning approach for detection of cancerous tissue from scanned whole slide images. Our method is based on feature engineering and supervised learning with a random forest model. The features extracted from the whole slide images include several local descriptors related to image texture, spatial structure, and distribution of nuclei. The method was evaluated in breast cancer metastasis detection from lymph node samples. Our results show that the method detects metastatic areas with high accuracy (AUC=0.97-0.98 for tumor detection within whole image area, AUC=0.84-0.91 for tumor vs. normal tissue detection) and that the method generalizes well for images from more than one laboratory. Further, the method outputs aninterpretable classification model, enabling the linking of individual features to differences between tissue types.

TI  - Evaluation of directional normalization methods for Landsat TM/ETM plus over primary Amazonian lowland forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity mapping in extensive tropical forest areas poses a major challenge for the interpretation of Landsat images, because floristically clearly distinct forest types may show little difference in reflectance. In such cases, the effects of the bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) can be sufficiently strong to cause erroneous image interpretation and classification. Since the opening of the Landsat archive in 2008, several BRDF normalization methods for Landsat have been developed. The simplest of these consist of an empirical view angle normalization, whereas more complex approaches apply the semi-empirical Ross-Li BRDF model and the MODIS MCD43-series of products to normalize directional Landsat reflectance to standard view and solar angles. Here we quantify the effect of surface anisotropy on Landsat TMIETM-1-images over old-growth Amazonian forests, and evaluate five angular normalization approaches. Even for the narrow swath of the Landsat sensors, we observed directional effects in all spectral bands. Those normalization methods that are based on removing the surface reflectance gradient as observed in each image were adequate to normalize TIWETM+ imagery to nadir viewing, but Were less suitable for multitemporal analysis when the solar vector varied strongly among images. Approaches based on the MODIS BRDF model parameters successfully reduced directional effects in the visible bands, but removed only half of the systematic errors in the infrared bands. The best results were obtained when the semi-empirical BRDF model was calibrated using pairs of Landsat observation. This method produces a single set of BRDF parameters, which can then be used to operationally normalize Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery over Amazonian forests to nadir viewing and a standard solar configuration.

TI  - Variability in ice motion and dynamic discharge from Devon Ice Cap, Nunavut, Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature tracking of approximately annually separated Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery acquired from 1999 to 2010 and speckle tracking of 24-day separated RADARSAT-2 imagery acquired from 2009 to 2015 reveal that motion of the major tidewater glaciers of Devon Ice Cap is more variable than previously described. The flow of almost half (six of 14) of the outlet glaciers slowed over the observation period, while that of the terminus regions of three of 14 of the glaciers sped up in the most recent years of observation. The North Croker Bay Glacier of southern Devon Ice Cap showed the greatest variability in motion, oscillating between multi-year (three or more) periods of slower and faster flow and exhibited a pattern of velocity variability that is different from that of the rest of the ice cap's outlet glaciers. Comparisons between areas of dynamic variability and glacier bed topography indicate that velocity variability is largely restricted to regions where the glacier bed is grounded below sea level. Derived velocities are combined with measurements of ice thickness at the fronts of tidewater glacier to determine a mean annual (2009; 2011-15) dynamic ice discharge of 0.41 +/- 0.11 Gt a(-1) for Devon Ice Cap. The Belcher Glacier is becoming a larger source of mass loss via ice discharge.

TI  - Patterns and drivers for wetland connections in the Prairie Pothole Region, United States
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem function in rivers, lakes and coastal waters depends on the functioning of upstream aquatic ecosystems, necessitating an improved understanding of watershed-scale interactions including variable surface-water flows between wetlands and streams. As surface water in the Prairie Pothole Region expands in wet years, surface-water connections occur between many depressional wetlands and streams. Minimal research has explored the spatial patterns and drivers for the abundance of these connections, despite their potential to inform resource management and regulatory programs including the U.S. Clean Water Act. In this study, wetlands were identified that did not intersect the stream network, but were shown with Landsat images (1990-2011) to become merged with the stream network as surface water expanded. Wetlands were found to spill into or consolidate with other wetlands within both small (2-10 wetlands) and large (> 100 wetlands) wetland clusters, eventually intersecting a stream channel, most often via a riparian wetland. These surface-water connections occurred over a wide range of wetland distances from streams (averaging 90-1400 m in different ecoregions). Differences in the spatial abundance of wetlands that show a variable surface-water connection to a stream were best explained by smaller wetland-to-wetland distances, greater wetland abundance, and maximum surface-water extent. This analysis demonstrated that wetland arrangement and surface water expansion are important mechanisms for depressional wetlands to connect to streams and provides a first step to understanding the frequency and abundance of these surface-water connections across the Prairie Pothole Region.

TI  - Comparative study of presurgical skin infiltration depth measurements of melanocytic lesions with OCT and high frequency ultrasound
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A reliable, fast, and non-invasive determination of melanoma thickness in vivo is highly desirable for clinical dermatology as it may facilitate the identification of surgical melanoma margins, determine if a sentinel node biopsy should be performed or not, and reduce the number of surgical interventions for patients. In this work, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and high frequency ultrasound (HFUS) are evaluated for quantitative in vivo preoperative assessment of the skin infiltration depth of melanocytic tissue. Both methods allow non-invasive imaging of skin at similar axial resolution. Comparison with the Breslow lesion thickness obtained from histopathology revealed that OCT is slightly more precise in terms of thickness determination while HFUS has better contrast. The latter does not require image post-processing, as necessary for the OCT images. The findings of our pilot study suggest that non-invasive OCT and HFUS are able to determine the infiltration depth of lesions like melanocytic nevi or melanomas preoperatively and in vivo with a precision comparable to invasive histopathology measurements on skin biopsies. In future, to further strengthen our findings a statistically significant study comprising a larger amount of data is required which will be conducted in an extended clinical study in the next step.

TI  - Offline Implementation and Evaluation of the Canadian Small Lake Model with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme over Western Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), version 2, was run with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), version 3.6.1, in an offline regional test over western Canada. Forcing data were derived from ERA-Interim and downscaled using the fifth-generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5). The forcing precipitation field was adjusted using monthly data from the Canadian Gridded Temperature and Precipitation Anomalies (CANGRD) observation-based dataset. The modeled surface air temperature was evaluated against CANGRD data, the modeled albedo against MODIS data, and the modeled snow water equivalent against Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) and Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research (GlobSnow) data. The lake simulation itself was evaluated using the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) Reprocessing for Climate: Lake Surface Water Temperature and Ice Cover (ARC-Lake) dataset. Summer surface lake temperatures and the lake ice formation and breakup periods were well simulated, except for slight warm/cold summer/fall surface temperature biases, early ice breakup, and early ice formation, consistent with warm/cold biases in the climate simulation. Tests were carried out to investigate the sensitivity of the CSLM simulation to the default values assigned to the shortwave extinction coefficient and the average lake depth, and changing the former from 0.5 to 2.0m(-1) and the latter from 10.0 to 50.0 or 5.0m had minimal effects on the simulation. Comparisons of the average annual variations of the simulated net shortwave radiation, turbulent fluxes, snowpack, and maximum and minimum daily surface temperatures between the land and the lake fractions for tundra, boreal, and southern regions showed patterns consistent with those expected. Finally, a test of the CSLM over the large resolved lakes in the model domain demonstrated a performance comparable to that for subgrid lakes.

TI  - Mapping invasive plant <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> in arid land using high resolution remote sensing data and biophysical parameters
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, high resolution remote sensing data is used to extract Prosopis juliflora (P.juliflora), which is a major invader in the study area. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification is applied to map this invader with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an additional parameter. Optimal kernel selection has been done for SVM classification, and a polynomial kernel. has been selected for the analysis. SVM polynomial kernel generated the overall accuracy of 70% and Kappa of 0.63. Classification results were compared with the results of conventional maximum likelihood classification (MLC). It was observed that the classification accuracy is improved from 68% to 74% when NDVI was used in MLC. But, when the SVM approach was used with NDVI, the accuracy dramatically increased to 93%. This is because the NDVI is a ratio based index, which introduces information about biophysical properties, thereby helping in better separation of P.juliflora.

TI  - Hidden roles of protected areas in the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many of the current protected areas worldwide are established for the conservation of particular species of interest, yet their benefits may go beyond these species since they could also contribute to the conservation of entire biodiversity pools. In addition, they may also contribute to the provision of ecosystem services. However, these benefits are seldom evaluated or targeted for improvement. Using field and remotely sensed data, we evaluated how representative of the plant biodiversity pool and of carbon sequestration is a network of nature reserves specifically established for the conservation of a target species, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), an icon of biodiversity conservation. Our results show that forest structure (including tree/bamboo species composition) within the nature reserve network is representative of the forest structure across the entire study region, with the exception of forests located at lower elevations which are not well represented. In addition, of the areas of forest cover gained across the study region between 2000 and 2010 (similar to 10,700 km2) only about 15% occurred within panda reserves. Furthermore, accumulated net primary productivity (NPP) per year between 2000 and 2010 across the study region exhibited a monotonic increase, while the relative contribution of the reserve network to this accumulated NPP remained relatively constant (similar to 25.5%). This suggests that the areas inside nature reserves may be reaching their maximum forest cover and NPP levels. Therefore, despite the significant positive roles of these reserves beyond the conservation of the species of interest, further conservation actions are needed to maintain and improve the conservation of regional biodiversity pools, as well as to improve gains in forest cover and in carbon sequestration. The procedures shown in this study are easily transferable to other study regions for assessing the benefits they provide beyond the conservation of the target(s) species of interest.

TI  - Performance of five surface energy balance models for estimating daily evapotranspiration in high biomass sorghum
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Robust evapotranspiration (ET) models are required to predict water usage in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems under different geographical and agrometeorological conditions. As a result, several remote sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models have been developed to estimate ET over large regions. However, comparison of the performance of several SEB models at the same site is limited. In addition, none of the SEB models have been evaluated for their ability to predict ET in rain-fed high biomass sorghum grown for biofuel production. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of five widely used single-source SEB models, namely Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping ET with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI), and operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), for estimating ET over a high biomass sorghum field during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. The predicted ET values were compared against eddy covariance (EC) measured ET (ETEc) for 19 cloud-free Landsat image. In general, S-SEBI, SEBAL, and SEBS performed reasonably well for the study period, while METRIC and SSEBop performed poorly. All SEB models substantially overestimated ET under extremely dry conditions as they underestimated sensible heat (H) and overestimated latent heat (LE) fluxes under dry conditions during the partitioning of available energy. METRIC, SEBAL, and SEBS overestimated LE regardless of wet or dry periods. Consequently, predicted seasonal cumulative ET by METRIC, SEBAL, and SEBS were higher than seasonal cumulative ETEc in both seasons. In contrast, S-SEBI and SSEBop substantially underestimated ET under too wet conditions, and predicted seasonal cumulative ET by S-SEBI and SSEBop were lower than seasonal cumulative ETEc in the relatively wetter 2013 growing season. Our results indicate the necessity of inclusion of soil moisture or plant water stress component in SEB models for the improvement of their performance, especially under too dry or wet environments.

TI  - Epidemiological Features and Forecast Model Analysis for the Morbidity of Influenza in Ningbo, China, 2006-2014
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to identify circulating influenza virus strains and vulnerable population groups and investigate the distribution and seasonality of influenza viruses in Ningbo, China. Then, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for prediction was established. Influenza surveillance data for 2006-2014 were obtained for cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) (n = 129,528) from the municipal Centers for Disease Control and virus surveillance systems of Ningbo, China. The ARIMA model was proposed to predict the expected morbidity cases from January 2015 to December 2015. Of the 13,294 specimens, influenza virus was detected in 1148 (8.64%) samples, including 951 (82.84%) influenza type A and 197 (17.16%) influenza type B viruses; the influenza virus isolation rate was strongly correlated with the rate of ILI during the overall study period (r = 0.20, p < 0.05). The ARIMA (1, 1, 1) (1, 1, 0) 12 model could be used to predict the ILI incidence in Ningbo. The seasonal pattern of influenza activity in Ningbo tended to peak during the rainy season and winter. Given those results, the model we established could effectively predict the trend of influenza-related morbidity, providing a methodological basis for future influenza monitoring and control strategies in the study area.

TI  - Development of MODIS data-based algorithm for retrieving sea surface temperature in coastal waters
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A new algorithm was developed for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST) in coastal waters using satellite remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Aqua platform. The new SST algorithm was trained using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method and tested using 8 years of remote sensing data from MODIS Aqua sensor and in situ sensing data from the US coastal waters in Louisiana, Texas, Florida, California, and New Jersey. The ANN algorithm could be utilized to map SST in both deep offshore and particularly shallow nearshore waters at the high spatial resolution of 1 km, greatly expanding the coverage of remote sensing-based SST data from offshore waters to nearshore waters. Applications of the ANN algorithm require only the remotely sensed reflectance values from the two MODIS Aqua thermal bands 31 and 32 as input data. Application results indicated that the ANN algorithm was able to explaining 82-90% variations in observed SST in US coastal waters. While the algorithm is generally applicable to the retrieval of SST, it works best for nearshore waters where important coastal resources are located and existing algorithms are either not applicable or do not work well, making the new ANN-based SST algorithm unique and particularly useful to coastal resource management.

TI  - A Markov random field integrating spectral dissimilarity and class co-occurrence dependency for remote sensing image classification optimization
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops a novel Markov Random Field (MRF) model for edge-preserving spatial regularization of classification maps. MRF methods based on the uniform smoothness lead to oversmoothed solutions. In contrast, MRF methods which take care of local spectral or gradient discontinuities, lead to unexpected object particles around boundaries. To solve these key problems, our developed MRF method first establishes a spatial energy function integrating local spectral dissimilarity to smooth the initial classification map while preserving object boundaries. Second, a new anisotropic spatial energy function integrating the class co-occurrence dependency is constructed to regularize pixels around object boundaries. The effectiveness of the method is tested using a series of remote sensing data sets. The obtained results indicate that the method can avoid oversmoothing and significantly improve the classification accuracy with regards to traditional MRF classification models and some other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Effects of Spatial Resolution for Evapotranspiration Estimation by Using the Triangular Method Over Heterogeneous Underling Surface
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to verify the applicability of different triangular methods for evapotranspiration (ET) estimation and the effect of spatial resolution on triangular methods, the applicability of normalized-difference vegetation index-land surface temperature (NDVI-LST) and NDVI-albedo triangular methods was validated based on the enhanced thematic mapper (ETM)+moderateresolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) data. Considering the effecting of soil moisture on ET, a new triangular method was developed by using the perpendicular drought index (PDI). Compared to the measured values, the result showed that LSTs retrieved by a single-channel method using ETM+ data were closed to the measured values, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.7 K. Given the inhomogeneity of the underlying surface, the remote-sensing data related to the low spatial resolution blur the between-pixel differences. A higher spatial resolution of the remote sensing (RS) data corresponds to a greater homogeneity of the distribution of scatter plots in the eigenspace and greater differences between pixels, particularly in the NDVI-LST eigenspace. The eigenspace formed by the PDI and the NDVI possess distinct triangular characteristics, particularly the inversion results of the ETM+ data, with an mean absolute percent error of 14% and an RMSE of 103 W.m(-2). The dry-edge slope introduced by the PDI in the expression increases the accuracy of the estimated ET. Compared to the measured data, the RMSEs of ET estimated by the NDVI-PDI using the ETM+ and MODIS data were reduced to 92 and 121 W.m(-2), respectively. The regional distribution of ET inverted by the NDVI-PDI method significantly coincided with the actual scenario of the underlying surface.

TI  - Integration of Landscape Metrics and Variograms to Characterize and Quantify the Spatial Heterogeneity Change of Vegetation Induced by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of spatial heterogeneity can be used to examine the structure of ecological systems. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake caused severe vegetation damage. In addition to simply detecting change, the magnitude of changes must also be examined. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were used to produce landscape maps before and after the earthquake and analyze the spatial-temporal change of the vegetation pattern. Landscape metrics were selected to quantify the spatial heterogeneity in a categorical map at both the class and landscape levels. The results reveal that the Wenchuan earthquake greatly increased the heterogeneity in the study area. In particular, forests experienced the most fragmentation among all of the landscape types. In addition, spatial heterogeneity in a numerical map was studied by using variogram analysis of normalized difference vegetation indices derived from Landsat images. In comparison to before the earthquake, the spatial variability after the earthquake had doubled. The structure of the spatial heterogeneity represented by the range of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) variograms also changed due to the earthquake. Moreover, the results of the NDVI variogram analysis of three contrasting landscapes, which were farmland, broadleaved forest, and coniferous forest, confirm that the earthquake produced spatial variability and changed the structure of the landscapes. Regardless of before or after the earthquake, farmland sites are the most heterogeneous among the three landscapes studied.

TI  - Long-term changes in the distribution and core habitat use of a coastal delphinid in response to anthropogenic coastal alterations
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of anthropogenic habitat loss on animal distribution and core habitat use can be particularly strong in animals with narrow habitat selectivity, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), a delphinid species that specifically inhabits coastal and estuarine waters. This study measured the extent of habitat loss in the waters around Xiamen City, China, where intense environmental changes and coast utilization have occurred in the past 40years. The extent of occurrence and the core habitat of the humpback dolphin were measured based on sighting records from censuses conducted in different years. A Landsat image series revealed a permanent 119.95km(2) loss of coastal waters to land reclamation, coastal modification and harbour construction from 1973 to 2013. The distribution of the humpback dolphin showed a significant shift from inshore to offshore waters and away from artificial shorelines. Though the extent of occurrence appears to change minimally, a significant shift in the core habitat from the original coastal habitats into mid-channel waters was observed in the eastern Xiamen Bay. These results imply multiple consequences of anthropogenic coastal alterations for the humpback dolphin: the elimination of vital habitats, changes in habitat use preferences, and the partitioning of the social structure of the population. The need to adjust current protected area designations along with adequate measures to restore habitat quality and population connectivity, both locally and regionally, are considered.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes of glaciers and glacial lakes and their causes were examined in the Hengduan Shan from 1990 to 2014, based on Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images. A total glacier area of 1298.8 +/- 62.1 km(2) and glacial lake area of 255.8 +/- 31.6 km were inventoried in 2014. The area of glaciers declined at an average rate of -0.40 +/- 0.26% a(-1), while glacial lakes expanded at average rate of +0.12 +/- 0.03% a(-1) over the past 24 years. These changes probably resulted from an observable temperature increase and slight precipitation increase. A 'corridor-barrier' effect formed by the longitudinal range-gorge terrain may have had major impacts on the distributions and changes of glaciers and glacial lakes. The Ningjing-Yunling Shan, where glaciers and glacial lakes are sparsely distributed, are an important geographic transition line in the Hengduan Shan because of the barrier effect of the mountain ranges against moisture from the southwest. In contrast, between the south and north, there were small differences with respect to the distributions and changes of glaciers and glacial lakes, owing to a north-south corridor effect for water and heat transport and diffusion through the longitudinal gorges in the Hengduan Shan.

TI  - Mapping <i>Torreya grandis</i> Spatial Distribution Using High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery with the Expert Rules-Based Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid expansion of Torreya forests in the mountainous region in Zhejiang Province in the past three decades has produced many environmental problems such as soil erosion and poor water quality, requiring an update of its spatial distribution in a timely way. However, to date there are no suitable approaches available for mapping Torreya forest distribution, especially the new Torreya plantations, due to the complex landscapes. This research used high spatial resolution Chinese Gaofen (GF-1) and Ziyuan (ZY-3) satellite images and digital elevation model (DEM) data to extract old Torreya forests and new Torreya plantations using a newly proposed expert rules-based approach. Different variables such as spectral bands, vegetation indices, textural images, and DEM-derived variables were examined, and separability analyses of different land covers were explored. An expert rules-based approach was developed for the extraction of old Torreya forests and new Torreya plantations. The accuracy assessment using field survey data and Google Earth images indicates that this newly-proposed approach can effectively distinguish both old Torreya forests and new Torreya plantations from other land covers with producer's accuracies of 84% and 92%, and user's accuracies of 77% and 85%, respectively, much better classification accuracies than the maximum likelihood classifier. This new approach may be used for other study area for extracting Torreya forest distribution. This research provides valuable data sources for better managing existing Torreya forests and planning potential Torreya expansions in this region in the near future.

TI  - MODIS Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth over Turbid Coastal Water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new approach to retrieve Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the turbid coastal water. This approach supplements the operational Dark Target (DT) aerosol retrieval algorithm that currently does not conduct AOD retrieval in shallow waters that have visible sediments or sea-floor (i.e., Class 2 waters). Over the global coastal water regions in cloud-free conditions, coastal screening leads to similar to 20% unavailability of AOD retrievals. Here, we refine the MODIS DT algorithm by considering that water-leaving radiance at 2.1 m to be negligible regardless of water turbidity, and therefore the 2.1 m reflectance at the top of the atmosphere is sensitive to both change of fine-mode and coarse-mode AODs. By assuming that the aerosol single scattering properties over coastal turbid water are similar to those over the adjacent open-ocean pixels, the new algorithm can derive AOD over these shallow waters. The test algorithm yields similar to 18% more MODIS-AERONET collocated pairs for six AERONET stations in the coastal water regions. Furthermore, comparison of the new retrieval with these AERONET observations show that the new AOD retrievals have equivalent or better accuracy than those retrieved by the MODIS operational algorithm's over coastal land and non-turbid coastal water product. Combining the new retrievals with the existing MODIS operational retrievals yields an overall improvement of AOD over those coastal water regions. Most importantly, this refinement extends the spatial and temporal coverage of MODIS AOD retrievals over the coastal regions where 60% of human population resides. This expanded coverage is crucial for better understanding of impact of anthropogenic aerosol particles on coastal air quality and climate.

TI  - Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth for Chongqing Using the HJ-1 Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a common indicator applied in monitoring aerosols in the atmosphere. The hilly landscape and rapid economic growth of the megacity Chongqing have facilitated increased aerosol concentration, and it is meaningful to accurately retrieve AOD over Chongqing. The HJ-1A/B satellite of China carries a sensor/camera called the Charge Coupled Device (CCD), the spatial resolution of which meets the requirement for retrieving high resolution AOD. In this paper, analysis of the AOD retrievals from different methods using the HJ-1 satellite data revealed the most suitable algorithm. Through comparison with the AOD product of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the AOD retrieval results using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to estimate dark pixels showed the highest correlation. The continental aerosol model was used to build a lookup table that was able to facilitate a good AOD retrieval for both city and rural areas. Finally, the algorithm that combined dark pixels, buffer areas, and the deep blue algorithm was found to be most suitable for AOD retrieval. The AOD retrieval results based on the HJ-1 data were consistent with MODIS products, and our algorithm yields reasonable results in most cases. The results were also compared with ground-based PM10 measurements synchronized with the overpass time of the HJ-1 satellite, and high correlation was found. The findings are relevant to other Chinese satellite data used for retrieving AOD on the same channels.

TI  - A nationwide annual characterization of 25 years of forest disturbance and recovery for Canada using Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of complex demands on forest resources and climate change, synoptic and spatially-explicit base-line data characterizing national trends in forest disturbance and subsequent return of vegetation (and eventual return to forest) are increasingly required. Time series analyses of remotely sensed data enable the retrospective generation of baseline data depicting both forest disturbance and recovery, enabling a more holistic examination of forest dynamics. In this research, we utilize the outputs of the Composite2Change, or C2C, algorithm that lever-ages the extensive Landsat archive to produce annual, gap-free, surface reflectance composites to date and label disturbance types and to characterize vegetation recovery over the >650 million ha of Canada's forested ecosystems. From 1985 to 2010, 57.5 Mha or 10.75% of Canada's net forested ecosystem area (exclusive of water) were disturbed by either wildfire or harvest, representing an annual rate of disturbance of approximately 0.43% per year. Wildfire accounted for 2.5 times more area disturbed than harvest. On average, wildfire disturbed 1.6 Mha annually and had greater inter-annual variability with a standard deviation of 1.1 Mha, compared to the 0.65 Mha disturbed annually by harvesting (sigma = 0.1 Mha). Herein, we defined a longer-term measure of spectral recovery (the number of years it took for a pixel to attain 80% of its pre-disturbance Normalized Burn Ratio or NBR value), which indicated that harvested areas are recovering more consistently over time relative to areas disturbed by wildfire, with 78.6% of harvested areas requiring <= 10 years to recover, compared to only 35.5% of wildfire areas. A shorter-term (5-year) measure of spectral recovery, also based on the NBR, indicated that vegetation in wildfire areas returned more rapidly than harvested areas; however, when the magnitude of the disturbance was incorporated into the metric, with magnitude typically larger and more variable for wildfire areas, harvested areas were found to be recovering more rapidly on average in the short-term. Overall, < 1% of the areas disturbed by wildfire and harvest were identified as non-recovering by all three spectral measures of recovery used in our analysis. Regionally, trends in disturbance and recovery largely echoed trends found at the national level, although the relative amounts and rates of wildfire or harvest varied by ecozone. Time series Landsat composites provide an opportunity to characterize relative trends in disturbance and recovery at a national scale, by disturbance type and ecozone, in a spatially explicit manner and at a level of spatial detail that is relevant to both forest management and science.

TI  - Moving to the RADARSAT Constellation Mission: Comparing Synthesized Compact Polarimetry and Dual Polarimetry Data with Fully Polarimetric RADARSAT-2 Data for Image Classification of Peatlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For this research, the Random Forest (RF) classifier was used to evaluate the potential of simulated RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) data for mapping landcover within peatlands. Alfred Bog, a large peatland complex in Southern Ontario, was used as a test case. The goal of this research was to prepare for the launch of the upcoming RCM by evaluating three simulated RCM polarizations for mapping landcover within peatlands. We examined (1) if a lower RCM noise equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) affects classification accuracy, (2) which variables are most important for classification, and (3) whether classification accuracy is affected by the use of simulated RCM data in place of the fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2. Results showed that the two RCM NESZs (-25 dB and -19 dB) and three polarizations (compact polarimetry, HH+HV, and VV+VH) that were evaluated were all able to achieve acceptable classification accuracies when combined with optical data and a digital elevation model (DEM). Optical variables were consistently ranked to be the most important for mapping landcover within peatlands, but the inclusion of SAR variables did increase overall accuracy, indicating that a multi-sensor approach is preferred. There was no significant difference between the RF classifications which included RADARSAT-2 and simulated RCM data. Both medium- and high-resolution compact polarimetry and dual polarimetric RCM data appear to be suitable for mapping landcover within peatlands when combined with optical data and a DEM.

TI  - Development and Implementation of an Electronic Crosstalk Correction for Bands 27-30 in Terra MODIS Collection 6
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The photovoltaic bands on the long-wave infrared focal plane assembly of Terra MODIS, bands 27-30, have suffered from steadily increasing contamination from electronic crosstalk as the mission has progressed. This contamination has a great impact on MODIS data products, including image striping and radiometric bias in the Level-1B calibrated radiance product, and incorrect retrieval in atmospheric products that rely on data from bands 27-30, such as the cloud mask and cloud particle phase products. In this work, we describe the development of an electronic crosstalk correction for bands 27-30 of Terra MODIS using observations of the Moon. In this approach, the derived correction coefficients account for both the "in-band" and "out-of-band" contribution to the signal contamination, which is not considered in previous implementations of the lunar-based correction. The correction coefficients are applied to both the on-board calibrator data and the Earth-view data, resulting in a significant reduction in the image striping and radiometric bias in the Level-1B data, as well as a better performance in the Level-2 cloud mask and cloud particle phase products. This approach will be implemented for Terra MODIS Collection 6 in 2017.

TI  - Monthly flooded area classification using low resolution SAR imagery in the Sudd wetland from 2007 to 2011
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The annual flood cycle of the Sudd wetland in South Sudan plays an important role in the Nile River Basin water balance. The wetland, however, is extensive and sparsely instrumented, which has inhibited credible understanding of regional flooding across space and time. Here we explore the potential to apply low resolution C-band ENVISAT Advanced SAR imagery for remote estimation of Sudd flooded area. Over a five year study period (2007-2011) the time-averaged flooded Sudd area was found to be 18,033 km(2) with an average annual high of 29,702 km(2) in late September and a low of 10,128 km(2) in early May. Annual peak flood area ranges considerably from 19,259 km(2) in 2009 to 36,649 km(2) in 2007, but we found no systematic trend over the five year study period. Derived flood frequency maps identify areas of open water and permanent flooding (12% of total area), seasonal flooding (29%), and intermittent flooding (48%). To evaluate the certainty of our results, we consider their consistency with (1) prior studies, (2) evapotranspiration estimates from the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance algorithm, (3) watershed storage anomaly estimates from GRACE, (4) supervised classification of open water area using Landsat, and (5) a rough measure of water availability (antecedent precipitation). The analyses show reasonable temporal and spatial consistency with available lines of evidence. We conclude that low resolution C-band SAR imagery shows promise for study of Sudd wetland flood dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implementation of a Modified Bedside Handoff for a Postpartum Unit
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The most frequent cause of sentinel events is poor communication during the nurse-to-nurse handoff process. Standardized methods of handoff do not fit in every patient care setting. The aims of this quality improvement project were to successfully implement a modified bedside handoff model, with some report outside and some inside the patient's room, in a postpartum unit. A structured educational module and champion nurses were used. The new model was evaluated based on the change in compliance, patient satisfaction, and nursing satisfaction. Two months after implementation, there was an increase in nursing compliance in completing all aspects of the model as well as an increase in both patient and staff satisfactions of the process. Replicating this project may help other specialty units adhere to safety recommendations for handoff report.

TI  - Assessing Impervious Surface Changes in Sustainable Coastal Land Use: A Case Study in Hong Kong
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Hong Kong, reclamation is the main method for developing new land use areas as most country parks and mountains are protected under a land policy that emphasizes conservation for their high ecological value. Therefore, the land use for urbanized area in Hong Kong is limited, which has become an issue of concern. Hong Kong's population is increasing; however, the amount of available land use is insufficient to meet the demand. Developing a high density of buildings is one of the critical strategies of Hong Kong's government. Highly dense development may result in an urban heat island as well as health problems. In this study, we present an assessment of urban impervious surface changes in coastal megacities like Hong Kong based on satellite images. Landsat satellite images are employed to analyze urban impervious surface changes from 1995 to 2015 in coastal urban areas of Hong Kong. The results show that the increase of impervious surface area is almost the same as the increase in land reclamation area. This suggests that Hong Kong's land use policy, which underlines conservation for high ecological value and reclamation, may be able to maintain its sustainable development of coastal land use.

TI  - Milk yield, fat yield and fat percentage associations in a Thai multibreed dairy population
T2  - Agriculture and Natural Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - Milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY) and fat percentage (FP) are important traits for dairy cattle selection and dairy farm profitability in Thailand. Most dairy cattle in Thailand are multibreed, comprising multiple breeds (three from eight breeds per animal). This multibreed composition of dairy animals has generated a large amount of variation in dairy traits among cows raised under farm, tropical environmental conditions across the country. Effective genetic evaluation and selection programs for dairy traits in this population require reliable variance components and genetic parameters estimated under the management, nutritional, health, and climatic conditions in Thai dairy farms. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for MY, FY and FP in a Thai dairy multibreed dairy cattle population using farm-collected information. The dataset consisted of pedigree and phenotypic data for MY, FY and FP from 6596 first lactation cows from 687 farms. The data were analyzed using a three-trait (MY, FY and FP), animal mixed model. Fixed effects were herd-year-season, Holstein fraction, heterozygosity and age at first calving. Random effects were animal and residual. An average, information-restricted, maximum likelihood procedure was used to estimate variance components, which in turn were used to compute heritabilities and genetic correlations. Means (SD) were 4315.43 kg (1112 kg) for MY, 157.41 kg (50.42 kg) for FY and 3.59% (0.56%) for FP. Heritability estimates were 0.22 +/- 0.06 for MY, 0.17 +/- 0.06 for FY and 0.24 +/- 0.07 for FP. Genetic correlations were 0.47 +/- 0.16 between MY and FY, -0.30 +/- 0.20 between MY and FP, and 0.30 +/- 0.21 between FY and FP. These estimates of genetic parameters indicated that Thai dairy producers would achieve reasonable amounts of genetic progress if they selected dairy animals based on MY and either FY or FP.

TI  - Utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy for uterine cancer
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: To limit the potential short and long-term morbidity of lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy has been proposed for endometrial cancer. The principle of sentinel lymph node biopsy relies on removal of a small number of lymph nodes that are the first drainage basins from a tumor and thus the most likely to harbor tumor cells. While the procedure may reduce morbidity, efficacy data are limited and little is known about how commonly the procedure is performed.OBJECTIVE: We examined the patterns and predictors of use of sentinel lymph node biopsy and outcomes of the procedure in women with endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy.STUDY DESIGN: We used the Perspective database to identify women with uterine cancer who underwent hysterectomy from 2011 through 2015. Billing and charge codes were used to classify women as having undergone lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, or no nodal assessment. Multivariable models were used to examine clinical, demographic, and hospital characteristics with use of sentinel lymph node biopsy. Length of stay and cost were compared among the different methods of nodal assessment.RESULTS: Among 28,362 patients, 9327 (32.9%) did not undergo nodal assessment, 17,669 (62.3%) underwent lymphadenectomy, and 1366 (4.8%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 1.3% (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6%) of abdominal hysterectomies, 3.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.7-4.1%) of laparoscopic hysterectomies, and 7.5% (95% confidence interval, 7.0-8.0%) of robotic-assisted hysterectomies. In a multivariable model, more recent year of surgery was associated with performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy. Compared to abdominal hysterectomy, those undergoing laparoscopic (adjusted risk ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-3.18) and robotic-assisted (adjusted risk ratio, 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 2.19-3.30) hysterectomy were more likely to undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy. Among women who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy, length of stay and cost were lower for sentinel lymph node biopsy compared to lymphadenectomy.CONCLUSION: The use of sentinel lymph node biopsy for endometrial cancer increased from 2011 through 2015. The increased use was most notable in women who underwent a robotic-assisted hysterectomy.

TI  - Upscaling <i>in situ</i> albedo for validation of coarse scale albedo product over heterogeneous surfaces
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the essential steps for satellite albedo validation is upscaling in situ measurements to corresponding pixel scale over relatively heterogeneous land surfaces. Although the multi-scale validation strategy is applicable for heterogeneous surfaces, the calibration of the high-resolution imagery during upscaling process is never perfect, and thus the upscaling results suffer from errors. The regression-kriging (RK) technique can compensate the calibration part by applying kriging to upscale residuals and produce more accurate upscaling results. In this paper, in situ measurements and high spatial resolution albedo imagery combined with RK technique was proposed. This method is illustrated by upscaling surface albedo from in situ measurements scale to the coarse pixel scale in the core experimental area of HiWATER, where 17 WSN nodes were deployed at heterogeneous area. The upscaling results of this method were compared with the upscaling results from multi-scale strategy. The results show that the upscaling method based on in situ measurements and high-resolution imagery combined with RK technique can capture the spatial characteristics of surface albedo better. Further, an attempt was made to expand this method in time series. Finally, a preliminary validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer albedo product was performed as the tentative application.

TI  - Slum mapping in polarimetric SAR data using spatial features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Driven by massive urbanization processes, particularly in developing countries, people flock into the cities resulting in an evolution of large slum areas. Mapping and monitoring of slum areas have become an invaluable source for decision-making processes to implement policies related to improve living conditions. Space-borne remotely sensed data has been explored in the past for slum mapping, however, to a large extent supported by optical imagery. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of dual-polarized (HH/VV and W/VH) X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from TerraSAR-X images for slum extent mapping using the Kennaugh element framework for image preprocessing. In this way, spatial image descriptors based on texture, morphological profiles and polarimetric features have been tested at various window sizes [11 x 11,...,161 x 1611 for mapping slums using the random forest classifier in a series of experiments. For benchmarking the classification results, LDA as parametric linear classifier is used for comparison. Classification performance was evaluated by comparison with a reference map indicating that texture features hold the highest contribution to discriminating slums from other urban structures. Best window size was found using a spatial neighborhood of 81 x 81 pixels resulting in Overall Accuracy of 88.58 and Kappa of 0.7809 for RF classifier. A patch-based analysis of classification results reveals areal dependencies of the classifier in terms of larger slum patches that are mapped with higher precision than smaller patches. Analyses including additional spatial image descriptors based on mathematical profiles reveal no significant contribution to the classification result. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Four-Component Model-Based Decomposition for Ship Targets Using PolSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scattering mechanism (SM) analysis is a promising technique for ship detection and classification in polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images. In this paper, a four-component model-based decomposition method incorporating surface, double-bounce, volume and cross-polarized components is proposed for analyzing the SMs of ships. A novel cross-polarized scattering component capable of discriminating between the HV scattering power generated by the oriented scatterers on ships from that by volume scatterers is proposed as a means to address the problem of volume scattering power overestimation. In the decomposition stage, by taking into account both the real and imaginary parts of the elements h [T] i HV (1, 3) and h [T] i HV (2, 3) of the observed coherency matrix, the proposed cross-polarized component can preserve the reflection asymmetry information completely, which is an essential property of man-made targets, such as ships. Based on the proposed decomposition method and an analysis of the different SMs between ships and sea clutter, a novel ship detection metric defined as M = ln Pd + Pc/Ps is proposed. Experimental results conducted on RadarSat-2 quad-polarimetric data validate the proposed four-component decomposition method as being more suitable for analyzing the SMs of ship targets than the existing helix matrix-based decomposition methods. Additionally, we find that the proposed ship detection metric can effectively enhance the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) and improve ship detection performance.

T2  - JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The widespread use of antiretroviral treatment made HIV prevalence no longer a good measure of population-level transmission risk. The objective of this analysis was to use the prevalence of unsuppressed HIV to describe population-level HIV transmission risk.Methods: Using New York City (NYC) HIV surveillance data, we reported HIV prevalence and the prevalence of unsuppressed HIV, defined as the number of persons living with HIV with an unsuppressed viral load divided by population size.Results: The estimated number of persons living with HIV in NYC increased from 79,100 [95% confidence interval (CI): 78,200 to 80,000] in 2010 to 81,700 (95% CI: 80,500 to 82,900) in 2014. HIV prevalence (>= 18 years old) remained unchanged at 1.22% (95% CI: 1.21% to 1.24%) in 2010 and 1.22% (95% CI: 1.20% to 1.24%) in 2014. The prevalence of unsuppressed HIV (>= 18 years old) steadily decreased from 0.49% (95% CI: 0.48% to 0.51%) in 2010 to 0.34% (95% CI: 0.32% to 0.36%) in 2014. Men had both higher HIV prevalence (1.86% vs. 0.65% in 2014) and higher prevalence of unsuppressed HIV (0.51% vs. 0.18% in 2014) than women. In 2014, the black-white ratio of prevalence of unsuppressed HIV was 5.8 among men and 26.3 among women, and the Hispanic-white ratio was 2.7 among men and 10.0 among women.Conclusions: The prevalence of unsuppressed HIV has been steadily decreasing in NYC. As antiretroviral treatment continues to expand, programs should consider using the prevalence of unsuppressed HIV to measure population-level transmission risk.

TI  - The Application of ALOS/PALSAR InSAR to Measure Subsurface Penetration Depths in Deserts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry has been utilised to acquire high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with wide coverage, particularly for persistently cloud-covered regions where stereophotogrammetry is hard to apply. Since the discovery of sand buried drainage systems by the Shuttle Imaging Radar-A (SIR-A) L-band mission in 1982, radar images have been exploited to map subsurface features beneath a sandy cover of extremely low loss and low bulk humidity in some hyper-arid regions such as from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite 1 (JERS-1) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR). Therefore, we hypothesise that a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived by InSAR in hyper-arid regions is likely to represent a subsurface elevation model, especially for lower frequency radar systems, such as the L-band system (1.25 GHz). In this paper, we compare the surface appearance of radar images (L-band and C-band) with that of optical images to demonstrate their different abilities to show subsurface features. Moreover, we present an application of L-band InSAR to measure penetration depths in the eastern Sahara Desert. We demonstrate how the retrieved L-band InSAR DEM appears to be of a consistently 1-2 m lower elevation than the C-band Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM over sandy covered areas, which indicates the occurrence of penetration and confirms previous studies.

TI  - Derivation of fractional urban signals in better capturing urbanization process
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has changed land use and urban structure in China and therefore greatly modified land surface properties and land-atmosphere interactions, causing further local and regional climate change. Climate model simulation and urbanization process analysis are usually limited by poor accuracy of coarse-resolution land use/cover products employed in regional climate models. This study sought to identify better urban representation from Landsat images and monitor urban expansion by change detection of spatial patterns and urban fractions in southeastern coastal region of China. We used the improved normalized indices-based method to classify urban and built-up areas from Landsat images in Jiading District, Shanghai. Classification results were evaluated at both the pixel scale and the model grid scale, with overall accuracy of 88% and k coefficient of 0.76. Moreover, urbanization process over the Guangzhou-Foshan-Dongguan area was examined from 2000 to 2009. We aggregated the original results of urban classification data from Landsat images as fractional cover information in 1-km grids. The total fractional urban change in 2000-2005 (10.65%) was approximately three times greater than in 2005-2009 (3.38%). We also compared the fractional cover of urban expansion with the corresponding period of MODIS land cover products. It showed that existing land cover products in models had deviations and could not capture well the underlying conditions and urbanization process. Different fractional covers of urban scenarios were expected to provide better inputs for accurate modeling of critical environmental feedbacks over expanding urban clusters.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays a crucial role in surface hydrology and energy balance, especially in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). This study used 12 years (2000-2011) of ground-observed snow depth at 87 meteorological stations to assess and verify the accuracy of the daily cloud-free snow-cover product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the QTP. On average, the daily cloud-free MODIS snow-cover product correctly identified the occurrence of snow cover with an accuracy of 90.74%, ranging from 54.39% to 99.07% among the 87 sites. The MODIS-derived data have large uncertainties in identifying the snow-cover phenology on the threshold of FSC >0 and FSC >50% (FSC, fractional snow cover). However, the MODIS-derived data can capture the interannual variability of the snow-cover phenology as compared with in situ observations. This study highlights the uncertainties in the daily snow-free MODIS snow-cover product to reflect snow-cover phenology over the QTP.

TI  - Tolerating dissimilar other when primed with death: neural evidence of self-control engaged by interdependent people in Japan
T2  - SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mortality salience (MS) has been shown to lead to derogation of others with dissimilar worldviews, yet recent research has shown that Asian-Americans who presumably adopt an interdependent self-construal (SC) tend to reveal greater tolerance after MS induction. In the present study, we demonstrated that Japanese individuals who are high on interdependent SC indeed show greater tolerance toward worldview-threatening other in the MS (vs control) condition, thus replicating the prior research. Extending this research, we also found that interdependent people's tolerance toward worldview-threatening other was mediated by increased activity in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the MS condition. These data suggested that when exposed to death-related stimuli, highly interdependent individuals may spontaneously activate their neural self-control system which may serve to increase tolerance toward others.

TI  - Mapping plastic greenhouse with medium spatial resolution satellite data: Development of a new spectral index
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic greenhouses (PGs) are an important agriculture development technique to protect and control the growing environment for food crops. The extensive use of PGs can change the agriculture landscape and affects the local environment. Accurately mapping and estimating the coverage of PGs is a necessity to the strategic planning of modern agriculture. Unfortunately, PG mapping over large areas is methodologically challenging, as the medium spatial resolution satellite imagery (such as Landsat data) used for analysis lacks spatial details and spectral variations. To fill the gap, the paper proposes a new plastic greenhouse index (PGI) based on the spectral, sensitivity, and separability analysis of PGs using medium spatial resolution images. In the context of the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery, the paper examines the effectiveness and capability of the proposed PGI. The results indicate that PGs in Landsat ETM+ image can be successfully detected by the PGI if the PG fraction is greater than 12% in a mixed pixel. A kappa coefficient of 0.83 and overall accuracy of 91.2% were achieved when applying the proposed PGI in the case of Weifang District, Shandong, China. These results show that the proposed index can be applied to identifying transparent PGs in atmospheric corrected Landsat image and has the potential for the digital mapping of plastic greenhouse coverage over a large area.

TI  - Spatial and Spectral Hybrid Image Classification for Rice Lodging Assessment through UAV Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice lodging identification relies on manual in situ assessment and often leads to a compensation dispute in agricultural disaster assessment. Therefore, this study proposes a comprehensive and efficient classification technique for agricultural lands that entails using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. In addition to spectral information, digital surface model (DSM) and texture information of the images was obtained through image-based modeling and texture analysis. Moreover, single feature probability (SFP) values were computed to evaluate the contribution of spectral and spatial hybrid image information to classification accuracy. The SFP results revealed that texture information was beneficial for the classification of rice and water, DSM information was valuable for lodging and tree classification, and the combination of texture and DSM information was helpful in distinguishing between artificial surface and bare land. Furthermore, a decision tree classification model incorporating SFP values yielded optimal results, with an accuracy of 96.17% and a Kappa value of 0.941, compared with that of a maximum likelihood classification model (90.76%). The rice lodging ratio in paddies at the study site was successfully identified, with three paddies being eligible for disaster relief. The study demonstrated that the proposed spatial and spectral hybrid image classification technology is a promising tool for rice lodging assessment.

TI  - Moving Target Azimuth Velocity Estimation for the MASA Mode Based on Sequential SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel azimuth velocity estimation method is proposed based on the multiple azimuth squint angles (MASA) imaging mode, acquiring sequential synthetic aperture radar images with different squint angles and time lags. The MASA mode acquisition geometry is given first, and the effect of target motion on azimuth offset and slant range offset is discussed in detail. Then, the azimuth velocity estimation accuracy is analyzed, considering the errors caused by registration, defocusing, and range velocity. Moreover, the interaction between target azimuth velocity and range velocity is studied for a better understanding of the azimuth velocity estimation error caused by the range velocity. With the proposed error compensation step, the new method can achieve a very high accuracy in azimuth velocity estimation, as verified by experimental results based on both simulated data and the TerraSAR-X data.

TI  - Minimum Apparent Diffusion Coefficient for Predicting Lymphovascular Invasion in Invasive Cervical Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo investigate the diagnostic performance of minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (mini-ADC) for predicting lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in invasive cervical cancer.Materials and MethodsNinety-six patients with pathologically confirmed invasive cervical cancer (CC) underwent conventional preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on a 3.0T MRI system. Tumor ADC, mini-ADC and mini-ADC ratio (mini-ADC value / tumor ADC value) were obtained and compared between LVI-positive and LVI-negative invasive CC, and correlation between LVI status and Ki-67, p16, p63, and clinical prognostic factors were analyzed. ADC thresholds and diagnostic performance were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.ResultsTumor ADC showed no significant difference (P=0.300) between LVI-positive invasive CC (n=27) and LVI-negative invasive CC (n=69); the mini-ADC and mini-ADC ratio were significantly lower in LVI-positive invasive CC than in LVI-negative invasive CC ([0.7120.078 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s] vs. [0.8670.099 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s], P < 0.001; and [0.7720.062] vs. [0.9170.052], P < 0.001, respectively). ROC curve analysis yielded a cutoff mini-ADC value of 0.837 in the differentiation of LVI-positive and LVI-negative invasive CC, with a sensitivity of 65%, specificity of 100%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.885; a cutoff mini-ADC ratio of 0.875 with a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 100%, AUC of 0.970, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 64%. There was a positive correlation between LVI status and Ki-67 (r=0.241, P=0.014) and a negative correlation between mini-ADC and LVI status (r=-0.582, P < 0.001); mini-ADC and Ki-67 (r=-0.587, P < 0.001).ConclusionMini-ADC value appears to be a simple and effective tool for the prediction of LVI status in invasive CC, and the mini-ADC ratio may be the best parameter in discriminating between LVI-positive and LVI-negative invasive CC.

TI  - Mapping of Urban Surface Water Bodies from Sentinel-2 MSI Imagery at 10 m Resolution via NDWI-Based Image Sharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study conducts an exploratory evaluation of the performance of the newly available Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery for mapping water bodies using the image sharpening approach. Sentinel-2 MSI provides spectral bands with different resolutions, including RGB and Near-Infra-Red (NIR) bands in 10 m and Short-Wavelength InfraRed (SWIR) bands in 20 m, which are closely related to surface water information. It is necessary to define a pan-like band for the Sentinel-2 image sharpening process because of the replacement of the panchromatic band by four high-resolution multi-spectral bands (10 m). This study, which aimed at urban surface water extraction, utilised the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) at 10 m resolution as a high-resolution image to sharpen the 20 m SWIR bands. Then, object-level Modified NDWI (MNDWI) mapping and minimum valley bottom adjustment threshold were applied to extract water maps. The proposed method was compared with the conventional most related band- (between the visible spectrum/NIR and SWIR bands) based and principal component analysis first component-based sharpening. Results show that the proposed NDWI-based MNDWI image exhibits higher separability and is more effective for both classification-level and boundary-level final water maps than traditional approaches.

TI  - Impact of Tile Drainage on Evapotranspiration in South Dakota, USA, Based on High Spatiotemporal Resolution Evapotranspiration Time Series From a Multisatellite Data Fusion System
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil drainage is a widely used agricultural practice in the midwest USA to remove excess soil water to potentially improve the crop yield. Research shows an increasing trend in baseflow and streamflow in the midwest over the last 60 years, which may be related to artificial drainage. Subsurface drainage (i.e., tile) in particular may have strongly contributed to the increase in these flows, because of its extensive use and recent gain in the popularity as a yield-enhancement practice. However, how evapotranspiration (ET) is impacted by tile drainage on a regional level is not well-documented. To explore spatial and temporal ET patterns and their relationship to tile drainage, we applied an energy balance-based multisensor data fusion method to estimate daily 30-m ET over an intensively tile-drained area in South Dakota, USA, from 2005 to 2013. Results suggest that tile drainage slightly decreases the annual cumulative ET, particularly during the early growing season. However, higher mid-season crop water use suppresses the extent of the decrease of the annual cumulative ET that might be anticipated from widespread drainage. The regional water balance analysis during the growing season demonstrates good closure, with the average residual from 2005 to 2012 as low as -3 mm. As an independent check of the simulated ET at the regional scale, the water balance analysis lends additional confidence to the study. The results of this study improve our understanding of the influence of agricultural drainage practices on regional ET, and can affect future decision making regarding tile drainage systems.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate simulation of rice yield is very important and vital for agriculture and food security. This study has analyzed the applicability of the RS-P-YEC (the remote-sensing-photosynthesis-yield estimation for crops) model for the rice yield simulation of the Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River (MLRYR) in China. The simulated rice yield was compared with the actual statistical dataset, so as to obtain the accuracy of the model results. The results showed that the correlation coefficients (R) between simulated rice yield and statistical data is 0.708 (P < 0.01), the average relative errors were 9, 6.5, 7.2 %, and the root mean square errors were 777.5, 606.4, 693.4 kg/ha in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. It indicated that the RS-P-YEC model can be used to estimate rice yield in the MLRYR region of China.

TI  - Mapping reference evapotranspiration from meteorological satellite data and applications
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is an agrometeorological variable widely used in hydrology and agriculture. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith combination method (PM method) is a standard for computing ETo for water management. However, this scheme is limited to areas where climatic data with good quality are available. Maps of 10-day averaged ETo at 5 km x 5 km grid spacing for the Taiwan region were produced by multiplying pan evaporation (E-pan), derived from ground solar radiation (GSR) retrieved from satellite images using the Heliosat-3 method, by a fixed pan coefficient (K-p). Validation results indicated that the overall mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and normalized root-mean-square deviation (NRMSD) were 6.2 and 7.7%, respectively, when compared with ETo computed by the PM method using spatially interpolated 10-day averaged daily maximum and minimum temperature datasets and GSR derived from satellite inputs. Land coefficient (K-L) values based on the derived ETo estimates and long term latent heat flux measurements, were determined for the following landscapes: Paddy rice (Oryza sativa), subtropical cypress forest (Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana and Chamaecyparis formosensis), warm-to-temperate mixed rainforest (Cryptocarya chinensis, Engelhardtia roxburghiana, Tutcheria shinkoensis, and Helicia formosana), and grass marsh (Brachiaria mutica and Phragmites australis). The determined land coefficients are indispensable to scale ETo in estimating regional evapotranspiration.

TI  - Urbanization Effects on Vegetation and Surface Urban Heat Islands in China's Yangtze River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of rapid urbanization, systematic research about temporal trends of urbanization effects (UEs) on urban environment is needed. In this study, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land surface temperature (LST) data and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data were used to analyze the temporal trends of UEs on vegetation and surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) at 10 big cities in Yangtze River Basin (YRB), China during 2001-2016. The urban and rural areas in each city were derived from MODIS land cover data and nighttime light data. It was found that the UEs on vegetation and SUHIs were increasingly significant in YRB, China. The Delta EVI (the UEs on vegetation, urban EVI minus rural EVI) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in 9, 7 and 5 out of 10 cities for annual, summer and winter, respectively. The annual daytime and nighttime SUHI intensity (SUHII; urban LST minus rural LST) increased significantly (p < 0.05) in 10 and 4 out of 10 cities, respectively. The increasing rate of daytime SUHII and the decreasing rate of Delta EVI in old urban areas were much less than the whole urban area (0.034 degrees C/year vs. 0.077 degrees C/year for annual daytime SUHII; 0.00209/year vs. 0.00329/year for Delta EVI). The correlation analyses indicated that the annual and summer daytime SUHII were significantly negatively correlated with Delta EVI in most cities. The decreasing Delta EVI may also contribute to the increasing nighttime SUHII. In addition, the significant negative correlations (r < -0.5, p < 0.1) between inter-annual linear slope of Delta EVI and SUHII were observed, which suggested that the cities with higher decreasing rates of Delta EVI may show higher increasing rates of SUHII.

TI  - Global bare ground gain from 2000 to 2012 using Landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bare ground gain, or vegetative cover loss, is an important component of global land cover change resulting from economic drivers such as urbanization and resource extraction. In this study, we characterized global bare ground gain from Landsat time series. The maps were then used to stratify the globe in creating a sample-based estimate of global bare ground gain extent, land cover/land use outcomes, and associated uncertainties from 2000 to 2012. An estimated total of 93,896 km(2) (+/- 9317 km(2) for 95% confidence interval) of bare ground gain occurred over the study period. Human-induced bare ground gain accounted for 95% of the total and consisted of the following components: 39% commercial and residential development, 23% resource extraction, 21% infrastructure development, 11% transitional, and 1% greenhouses. East Asia and the Pacific accounted for nearly half of all global bare ground gain area (45%), with China alone accounting for 35% of global gain. The United States was second to China, accounting for 17% of total bare ground gain. Land cover/land use outcomes of bare ground gain varied between regions and countries, reflecting different stages of development and the possible use of bare ground gain as an indicator of economic activity.

TI  - Coupling of field investigations and remote sensing data for karst hazards in Egypt: case study around the Sohag City
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Karst rocks cover a wide area of Egypt. These rocks include soluble sediments such as carbonate rock formations, evaporites, and sabkha deposits that are characterized by karstification features. Karst features could affect many current and developing projects (urban areas and infrastructure). The areas covered by the rocks susceptible to karstification need detailed studies to examine the presence of karst features and/or sinkholes. The current work provides a detailed evaluation of the karst and/or sinkhole hazards around the city of Sohag, Egypt. This research is rarely done in Egypt, using field investigation and remote sensing application to determine the main karstic rock formations and the distribution of the most problematic sinkhole areas. In this work, different types of the subsidence mechanisms were investigated. Our results indicated that field investigations help in finding different features related to karstification including small-scale versus large-scale features and empty caves versus filled caves. In addition, remote sensing techniques succeeded in predicting and locating the sinkhole areas, and those determinations were verified in the field. Finally, fundamental considerations are discussed to better evaluate and manage the hazard of karst and/or sinkholes.

TI  - Dynamics of Hierarchical Urban Green Space Patches and Implications for Management Policy
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately quantifying the variation of urban green space is the prerequisite for fully understanding its ecosystem services. However, knowledge about the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban green space is still insufficient due to multiple challenges that remain in mapping green spaces within heterogeneous urban environments. This paper uses the city of Hangzhou to demonstrate an analysis methodology that integrates sub-pixel mapping technology and landscape analysis to fully investigate the spatiotemporal pattern and variation of hierarchical urban green space patches. Firstly, multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis was applied to time series Landsat data to derive green space coverage at the sub-pixel level. Landscape metric analysis was then employed to characterize the variation pattern of urban green space patches. Results indicate that Hangzhou has experienced a significant loss of urban greenness, producing amore fragmented and isolated vegetation landscape. Additionally, a remarkable amelioration of urban greenness occurred in the city core from 2002 to 2013, characterized by the significant increase of small-sized green space patches. The green space network has been formed as a consequence of new urban greening strategies in Hangzhou. These strategies have greatly fragmented the built-up areas and enriched the diversity of the urban landscape. Gradient analysis further revealed a distinct pattern of urban green space landscape variation in the process of urbanization. By integrating both sub-pixel mapping technology and landscape analysis, our approach revealed the subtle variation of urban green space patches which are otherwise easy to overlook. Findings from this study will help us to refine our understanding of the evolution of heterogeneous urban environments.

NIR light-activatable polymer nanoparticles are widely exploited for enhanced cancer imaging (diagnosis) and therapy owing to their superior photostability, photothermal conversion efficiency (or high emission rate), and minimal toxicity to cells and tissues. This review surveys the most recent advances in the synthesis of different NIR-absorbing and emissive polymer nanoformulations, and their applications for cancer imaging, photothermal therapy, theranostics and combination therapy by delivering multiple small molecule chemotherapeutics. Photo-responsive drug delivery systems for NIR light-triggered drug release are also discussed with particular emphasis on their molecular designs and formulations as well as photo-reaction mechanisms. Finally, outlook and challenges are presented regarding potential clinical applications of NIR light-activatable nanoformulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Multi-Year Study on Rice Morphological Parameter Estimation with X-Band Polsar Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice fields have been monitored with spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems for decades. SAR is an essential source of data and allows for the estimation of plant properties such as canopy height, leaf area index, phenological phase, and yield. However, the information on detailed plant morphology in meter-scale resolution is necessary for the development of better management practices. This letter presents the results of the procedure that estimates the stalk height, leaf length and leaf width of rice fields from a copolar X-band TerraSAR-X time series data based on a priori phenological phase. The methodology includes a computationally efficient stochastic inversion algorithm of a metamodel that mimics a radiative transfer theory-driven electromagnetic scattering (EM) model. The EM model and its metamodel are employed to simulate the backscattering intensities from flooded rice fields based on their simplified physical structures. The results of the inversion procedure are found to be accurate for cultivation seasons from 2013 to 2015 with root mean square errors less than 13.5 cm for stalk height, 7 cm for leaf length, and 4 mm for leaf width parameters. The results of this research provided new perspectives on the use of EM models and computationally efficient metamodels for agriculture management practices.

TI  - Prediction of Potential Fishing Zones for Skipjack Tuna During the Northwest Monsoon Using Remotely Sensed Satellite Data.
T2  - Ilmu Kelautan
M3  - Article
AB  - One of economically important fish in the Bay of Bone is Skipjack tuna which their distribution and migration are influenced by surrounding environment. This study aims to investigate the relationship between skipjack tuna and their environments, and to predict potential fishing zones (PFZs) for the fish in the Bone Bay-Flores Sea using satellite-based oceanography and catch data. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to assess the relationship. A generalized linear model(GLM) constructed from GAMs was used for prediction. Monthly mean sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a during the northwest monsoon (December-January) together with catch data were used for the year 2012-2013. We used the GAMs to assess the effect of the environment variables on skipjack tuna CPUE (catch per unit effort). The best GLM was selected to predict skipjack tuna abundance. Results indicated that the highest CPUEs (fish/trip) occurred in areas where SST and chlorophyll-a ranged from 29.5[degree]-31.5[degree]C and 0.15 - 0.25 mg m-3, respectively. The PFZs for skipjack were closely related to the spatial distribution of the optimum oceanographic conditions and these mainly developed in three locations, northern area of Bone Bay in December, in the middle area of the bay (4[degree]-5.5[degree]S and 120.5[degree]-121.5[degree]E) during January and moved to the Flores Sea in February. The movement of skipjack concentration was consistent with the fishery data. This suggests that the dynamics of the optimum oceanographic signatures provided a good indicator for predicting feeding grounds as hotspot areas for skipjack tuna in Bone Bay-Flores Sea during northwest monsoon.

TI  - Effects of Boundary Layer Height on the Model of Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations from AOD: Comparison of Stable and Convective Boundary Layer Heights from Different Methods
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol optical depth (AOD) from satellites or ground-based sun photometer spectral observations has been widely used to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations by regression methods. The boundary layer height (BLH) is a popular factor in the regression model of AOD and PM2.5, but its effect is often uncertain. This may result from the structures between the stable and convective BLHs and from the calculation methods of the BLH. In this study, the boundary layer is divided into two types of stable and convective boundary layer, and the BLH is calculated using different methods from radiosonde data and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data for the station in Beijing, China during 2014-2015. The BLH values from these methods show significant differences for both the stable and convective boundary layer. Then, these BLHs were introduced into the regression model of AOD-PM2.5 to seek the respective optimal BLH for the two types of boundary layer. It was found that the optimal BLH for the stable boundary layer is determined using the method of surface-based inversion, and the optimal BLH for the convective layer is determined using the method of elevated inversion. Finally, the optimal BLH and other meteorological parameters were combined to predict the PM2.5 concentrations using the stepwise regression method. The results indicate that for the stable boundary layer, the optimal stepwise regression model includes the factors of surface relative humidity, BLH, and surface temperature. These three factors can significantly enhance the prediction accuracy of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, with an increase of determination coefficient from 0.50 to 0.68. For the convective boundary layer, however, the optimal stepwise regression model includes the factors of BLH and surface wind speed. These two factors improve the determination coefficient, with a relatively low increase from 0.65 to 0.70. It is found that the regression coefficients of the BLH are positive and negative in the stable and convective regression models, respectively. Moreover, the effects of meteorological factors are indeed related to the types of BLHs.

T2  - MICROSCOPY AND MICROANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cytological responses in different organs of sentinel organisms have proven to be useful tools for characterizing the health status of those organisms and assessing the impact of environmental contaminants. Our study shows that nickel (II) accumulated in both germ cells (oogonia and developing oocytes) and somatic cells (muscle cells, follicle cells) in the Astacus leptodactylus ovary. Muscle cells from ovarian wall show disorganization and the disruption of cytoplasmic microtubules and pyknosis of the cell nucleus. Follicle cells, both those that surround the developing oocytes and also those that are not associated with the oocytes contained within the cytoplasm vacuoles of different sizes, degenerated mitochondria, myelin bodies, disorganized microtubules, and pyknotic nuclei. The most evident pathological phenomenon was the alteration and disorganization of the basal matrix, which separates the ovarian interstitium from ovarian follicles compartment. Exposure to nickel induces cytoplasmic vacuolation in oogonia and developing oocytes, structural alteration of the developing yolk granules and condensation of the nucleoli. Ultrastructural autometallography has shown grains of silver-enhanced nickel inside the cytoplasm of the muscle cells with altered morphology, including the cytoplasm, nucleus, and basal matrix of the follicle cells, and in intracisternal granules and developing yolk granules of the oocytes.

TI  - Seasonal and Interannual Variability of Satellite-Derived Chlorophyll-a (2000-2012) in the Bohai Sea, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the chlorophyll-a dynamics and their long-term changes is important for assessing marine ecosystems, especially for coastal waters. In this study, the spatial and temporal variability of sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) in the Bohai Sea were investigated using 13-year (2000-2012) satellite-derived products from MODIS and SeaWiFS observations. Based on linear regression analysis, the results showed that the entire Bohai Sea experienced an increase in Chl-a on a long-term scale, with the largest increase in the central Bohai Sea and the smallest increase in the Bohai strait. Distinct seasonal patterns of Chl-a existed in different sub-regions of the Bohai Sea. A long-lasting Chl-a peak was observed from May to September in coastal waters (Liaodong bay, Qinhuangdao coast, and Bohai bay) and the central Bohai Sea, whereas Laizhou bay had relatively low Chl-a in early summer. In the Bohai strait, two pronounced Chl-a peaks occurred in March and September, but the lowest Chl-a was in summer. This pattern was quite different from those in other regions of the Bohai Sea. The water column condition (stratified or mixed) was likely an important physical factor that affects the seasonal pattern of Chl-a in the Bohai Sea. Meanwhile, increased human activity (e.g., river discharge) played a significant role in changing the Chl-a distribution in both coastal waters and the central Bohai Sea, especially in summer. The increasing trend of Chl-a in the Bohai Sea might be attributed to the increase in nutrient contents from riverine inputs. The Chl-a dynamics documented in this study provide basic knowledge for the future exploration of marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystem evolution in the Bohai Sea.

TI  - Crop classification and acreage estimation in North Korea using phenology features
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In North Korea, reliable and timely information on crop acreage and spatial distribution is hard to obtain. In this study, we developed a fast and robust method to estimate crop acreage in North Korea using time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We proposed a method to identify crop type based on NDVI phenology features using data collected in other areas with similar agri-environmental conditions to mitigate the shortage of ground truth data. Eventually the classification map (MODIScrop) was assessed using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistical data and high-resolution crop classification maps derived from one Landsat scene (LScrop). The Pareto boundary method was used to assess the accuracy and crop distribution of the MODIScrop maps. Results showed that acreage derived from the MODIScrop maps was generally consistent with that reported in the FAO data (a relative error <4.1% for rice and <6.1% for maize, and <9.0% for soybean except for in 2004, 2008, and 2009) and the maps derived from the LScrop (a relative error about 5% in 2013, and 7% in 2008 and 2014). The classification accuracy reached 74.4%, 69.8%, and 73.1% of the areas covered by the Landsat images in 2008, 2013, and 2014, respectively. This indicates that features derived from NDVI profiles were able to characterize major crops, and the approaches developed in this study are feasible for crop mapping and acreage estimation in regions with limited ground truth data.

TI  - An Extended Kriging Method to Interpolate Near-Surface Soil Moisture Data Measured by Wireless Sensor Networks
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the practice of interpolating near-surface soil moisture measured by a wireless sensor network (WSN) grid, traditional Kriging methods with auxiliary variables, such as Co-kriging and Kriging with external drift (KED), cannot achieve satisfactory results because of the heterogeneity of soil moisture and its low correlation with the auxiliary variables. This study developed an Extended Kriging method to interpolate with the aid of remote sensing images. The underlying idea is to extend the traditional Kriging by introducing spectral variables, and operating on spatial and spectral combined space. The algorithm has been applied to WSN-measured soil moisture data in HiWATER campaign to generate daily maps from 10 June to 15 July 2012. For comparison, three traditional Kriging methods are applied: Ordinary Kriging (OK), which used WSN data only, Co-kriging and KED, both of which integrated remote sensing data as covariate. Visual inspections indicate that the result from Extended Kriging shows more spatial details than that of OK, Co-kriging, and KED. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Extended Kriging was found to be the smallest among the four interpolation results. This indicates that the proposed method has advantages in combining remote sensing information and ground measurements in soil moisture interpolation.

TI  - The assessment of landslide susceptibility mapping using random forest and decision tree methods in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility mapping is an indispensable prerequisite for landslide prevention and reduction. At present, research into landslide susceptibility mapping has begun to combine machine learning with remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The random forest model is a new integrated classification method, but its application to landslide susceptibility mapping remains limited. Landslides represent a serious threat to the lives and property of people living in the Zigui-Badong area in the Three Gorges region of China, as well as to the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir. However, the geological structure of this region is complex, involving steep mountains and deep valleys. The purpose of the current study is to produce a landslide susceptibility map of the Zigui-Badong area using a random forest model, multisource data, GIS, and remote sensing data. In total, 300 pre-existing landslide locations were obtained from a landslide inventory map. These landslides were identified using visual interpretation of high-resolution remote sensing images, topographic and geologic data, and extensive field surveys. The occurrence of landslides is closely related to a series of environmental parameters. Topographic, geologic, Landsat-8 image, raining data, and seismic data were used as the primary data sources to extract the geo-environmental factors influencing landslides. Thirty-four layers of causative factors were prepared as predictor variables, which can mainly be categorized as topographic, geological, hydrological, land cover, and environmental trigger parameters. The random forest method is an ensemble classification technique that extends diversity among the classification trees by resampling the data with replacement and randomly changing the predictive variable sets during the different tree induction processes. A random forest model was adopted to calculate the quantitative relationships between the landslide-conditioning factors and the landslide inventory map and then generate a landslide susceptibility map. The analytical results were compared with known landslide locations in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The random forest model has an area ratio of 86.10%. In contrast to the random forest (whole factors, WF), random forest (12 major factors, 12F), decision tree (WF), decision tree (12F), the final result shows that random forest (12F) has a higher prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, the random forest models have higher prediction accuracy than the decision tree model. Subsequently, the landslide susceptibility map was classified into five classes (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high). The results demonstrate that the random forest model achieved a reasonable accuracy in landslide susceptibility mapping. The landslide hazard zone information will be useful for general development planning and landslide risk management.

TI  - STUDY ON THE MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ESTIMATION OF TROPICAL CYCLONE INTENSITY USING FY-3 MWRI BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE DATA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A technique for estimating tropical cyclone (TC) intensity over the Western North Pacific utilizing FY-3 Microwave Imager (MWRI) data is developed. As a first step, we investigated the relationship between the FY-3 MWRI brightness temperature (TB) parameters, which are computed in concentric circles or annuli of different radius in different MWRI frequencies, and the TC maximum wind speed (Vmax) from the TC best track data. We found that the parameters of lower frequency channels' minimum TB, mean TB and ratio of pixels over the threshold TB with a radius of 1.0 or 1.5 degrees from the center give higher correlation. Then by applying principal components analysis (PCA) and multiple regression method, we established an estimation model and evaluated it using independent verification data, with the RMSE being 13 kt. The estimated Vmax is always stronger in the early stages of development, but slightly weaker toward the mature stage, and a reversal of positive and negative bias takes place with a boundary of around 70 kt. For the TC that has a larger error, we found that they are often with less organized and asymmetric cloud pattern, so the classification of TC cloud pattern will help improve the acuracy of the estimated TC intensity, and with the increase of statistical samples the accuracy of the estimated TC intensity will also be improved.

TI  - Beyond the margins: real-time detection of cancer using targeted fluorophores
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past two decades, synergistic innovations in imaging technology have resulted in a revolution in which a range of biomedical applications are now benefiting from fluorescence imaging. Specifically, advances in fluorophore chemistry and imaging hardware, and the identification of targetable biomarkers have now positioned intraoperative fluorescence as a highly specific real-time detection modality for surgeons in oncology. In particular, the deeper tissue penetration and limited autofluorescence of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging improves the translational potential of this modality over visible-light fluorescence imaging. Rapid developments in fluorophores with improved characteristics, detection instrumentation, and targeting strategies led to the clinical testing in the early 2010s of the first targeted NIR fluorophores for intraoperative cancer detection. The foundations for the advances that underline this technology continue to be nurtured by the multidisciplinary collaboration of chemists, biologists, engineers, and clinicians. In this Review, we highlight the latest developments in NIR fluorophores, cancer-targeting strategies, and detection instrumentation for intraoperative cancer detection, and consider the unique challenges associated with their effective application in clinical settings.

TI  - Compact Polarimetric Response of Rape (<i>Brassica napus</i> L.) at C-Band: Analysis and Growth Parameters Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Growth parameters like biomass, leaf area index ( LAI) and stem height play an import role for crop monitoring and yield prediction. Compact polarimetric (CP) SAR has shown great potential and similar performance to fully-polarimetric (FP) SAR in crop mapping and phenology retrieval, but its potential in growth parameters inversion has not been fully explored. In this paper, a time series of images of CP SAR was simulated from five FP SAR data gathered during the entire growth season of rape. CP response of 27 parameters, relying on Stokes parameters and their child parameters, decomposition parameters and backscattering coefficients, were extracted and investigated as a function of days after sowing (DAS) during the whole rape growth cycle to interpret their sensitivity to each growth parameter. Then, random forest (RF) was chosen as an automatic approach for the growth parameters inversion method, and its results were compared with traditional single-parameter regression models. Most of the CP parameters showed high sensitivity with growth parameters and great potential for growth parameters inversion. Among all of the regression models, the quadratic regression model showed the best performance for all of the growth parameters inversion, the best result for biomass inversion was the third component of the Stokes parameters (g3) with R-2 of 0.765 and RMSE of 73.20 g/m(2). For LAI and stem height was one of the Stokes child parameters, the circular polarization ratio (U-c), with R-2 of 0.857 and 0.923 and RMSE of 0.66 and 18.71 cm, respectively. RF showed the highest accuracy and smallest RMSE for all of three growth parameters inversion; R-2 for biomass, LAI and stem height were 0.93, 0.96 and 0.95, respectively; RMSE were 46.24 g/m(2), 0.25 and 13.5 cm, respectively. However, there are also some CP parameters, which showed low sensitivity to growth parameters, that had high importance for RF inversion. The results confirmed the potential of CP data and the RF method in growth parameters inversion, but they also confirmed that it was difficult to give a physical interpretation for the RF inversion model.

TI  - Comparisons of global land surface seasonality and phenology derived from AVHRR, MODIS, and VIIRS data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface seasonality has been widely investigated from satellite observations for monitoring the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems in response to climate change. A great deal of efforts has focused on the characterization of interannual variation and long-term trends of vegetation phenological metrics derived from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data across regional and global scales. Recently, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data have become available for the detections of global land surface phenology. These data sets provide us a potential opportunity to generate a consistent long-term climate data record of land surface phenology. However, to bridge the multiple-sensor-based phenology measurements, we need to understand their consistency and discrepancy across various geographical and ecological regions. To this end, we collected daily AVHRR, MODIS, and VIIRS data (similar to 5 km) globally, compared their temporal trajectories of two band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) during 2013 and 2014, examined their discrepancy of phenology retrievals, and explored the influence of EVI2 data quality from the three satellite sensors on phenology detections. The results revealed the similarity and discrepancy of EVI2 time series and land surface phenology retrievals globally. Specifically, EVI2 time series from VIIRS and MODIS observations were similar with some discrepancies mainly arising from unsystematic impact factors. In contrast, VIIRS EVI2 was systematically higher than AVHRR EVI2, in which their differences could be greatly reduced by intersensor calibration. Further, the quality of EVI2 time series among AVHRR, MODIS, and VIIRS varied largely across the globe, which was generally better in Northern Hemisphere than in Southern Hemisphere. Their differences in EVI2 data quality led to the inconsistencies in the detections of phenological dates. On average, the absolute difference of phenological transition dates among the three products was larger than 10 days in about 30% of pixels in Northern Hemisphere and more than 40% in Southern Hemisphere.

AB  - Water is essential for life as it provides drinking water and food for humans and animals. Additionally, the water environment provides habitats for numerous species and plays an important role in hydrological, nutrient, and carbon cycles. Among the existing natural resources on Earth's surface, water is the most extensive as it covers more than 70% of the Earth. To gather a comprehensive understanding of the focus of past, present, and future directions of remote sensing water research, we provide an alternative perspective on water research using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery by conducting a comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis of research development, current hotspots, and future directions using a bibliometric analysis. Our study suggests that there has been a rapid growth in the scientific outputs of water research using MODIS imagery over the past 15 years compared to other popular satellites around the world. The analysis indicated that Remote Sensing of Environment was the most active journal, and "remote sensing," "imaging science photographic technology," "environmental sciences ecology," "meteorology atmospheric sciences," and "geology" are the top 5 most popular subject categories. The Chinese Academy of Sciences was the most productive institution with a total of 477 papers, and Hu CM (Chinese) was the most productive author with 76 papers. A keyword analysis indicated that "vegetation index," "evapotranspiration," and "phytoplankton" were the most active research topics throughout the study period. In addition, it is predicted that more attention will be paid to research on climate change and phenology in the future. Based on the keyword analysis and in consideration of current environmental problems, more studies should focus on the following three aspects: (1) develop methods suitable for data assimilation to fully explain climate or phenological phenomena at continental or global scales rather than at local scales; (2) accurately predict the effect of global change and human activities on evapotranspiration and the water cycle; and (3) determine the evolutionary process of the water environment (i.e., water quality, macrophytes, cyanobacteria, etc.), ascertaining its dominant factors and driving mechanisms. By focusing on these three aspects, researchers will be able to provide timely monitoring and evaluation of water quality and its response to global change and human activities.

TI  - Using principal component analysis and annual seasonal trend analysis to assess karst rocky desertification in southwestern China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing exploitation of karst resources is causing severe environmental degradation because of the fragility and vulnerability of karst areas. By integrating principal component analysis (PCA) with annual seasonal trend analysis (ASTA), this study assessed karst rocky desertification (KRD) within a spatial context. We first produced fractional vegetation cover (FVC) data from a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index using a dimidiate pixel model. Then, we generated three main components of the annual FVC data using PCA. Subsequently, we generated the slope image of the annual seasonal trends of FVC using median trend analysis. Finally, we combined the three PCA components and annual seasonal trends of FVC with the incidence of KRD for each type of carbonate rock to classify KRD into one of four categories based on K-means cluster analysis: high, moderate, low, and none. The results of accuracy assessments indicated that this combination approach produced greater accuracy and more reasonable KRD mapping than the average FVC based on the vegetation coverage standard. The KRD map for 2010 indicated that the total area of KRD was 78.76 x 10(3) km(2), which constitutes about 4.06% of the eight southwest provinces of China. The largest KRD areas were found in Yunnan province. The combined PCA and ASTA approach was demonstrated to be an easily implemented, robust, and flexible method for the mapping and assessment of KRD, which can be used to enhance regional KRD management schemes or to address assessment of other environmental issues.

TI  - Anticyclonic Eddy Sheddings from Kuroshio Loop and the Accompanying Cyclonic Eddy in the Northeastern South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sheddings of Kuroshio Loop Current (KLC) eddies in the northeastern South China Sea (SCS) are investigated using mooring arrays, multiple satellite data, and data-assimilative HYCOM products. Based on altimeter sea surface heights between 1992 and 2014, a total of 19 prominent KLC eddy shedding (KLCES) events were identified, among which four events were confirmed by the concurrent moored and satellite observations. Compared to the leaping behavior of Kuroshio, KLCES is a relatively short-duration phenomenon that primarily occurs in boreal autumn and winter. The KLC and its shedding anticyclonic eddy (AE) trap a large amount of Pacific water with high temperature-salinity and low chlorophyll concentration in the upper layer. The corresponding annual-mean transport caused by KLCES reaches 0.24-0.38 Sv (1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)), accounting for 6.8%-10.8% of the upper-layer Luzon Strait transport. Altimeter-based statistics show that among; similar to 90% of the historical KLCES events, a cyclonic eddy (CE) is immediately generated behind the AE southwest of Taiwan. Both energetics and stability analyses reveal that because of its large horizontal velocity shear southwest of Taiwan, the northern branch of KLC is strongly unstable and the barotropic instability of KLC constitutes the primary generation mechanism for the CE. After CE is generated, it quickly grows and gradually migrates southward, which in turn facilitates the detachment of AE from KLC. The intrinsic relationship between KLC and CE explains well why eddy pairs are commonly observed in the region southwest of Taiwan.

TI  - Application Potential of GF-4 Images for Dynamic Ship Monitoring
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful launch of the GF-4 satellite has greatly enhanced wide-swath and high-frequency imaging capabilities, both of which are urgently needed in the fields of ship detection and monitoring. In this letter, the applicability of GF-4 satellite data for ship recognition and maritime traffic surveillance was investigated. It is concluded that the movement of ships, the velocity and direction, for instance, can be detected by using either a single GF-4 image that has short time lags between bands, or time-series GF-4 images that have a short interval between their acquisition times, implying that GF-4 satellite images have the potentiality for the monitoring of moving ships.

TI  - Biomass retrieval from L-band polarimetric UAVSAR backscatter and PRISM stereo imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest above-ground biomass (AGB) and spatial distribution of vegetation elements have profound effects on the productivity and biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems. In this paper, we evaluated biomass estimation from L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) and the improvement of accuracy by adding canopy height information derived from stereo imagery acquired by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Panchromatic Remote Sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) on-board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Various models for prediction of forest biomass from UAVSAR data were investigated at pixel sizes of 1/4 ha (50 m x 50 m) and 1 ha. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated for each of the explanatory variables in multivariable regression models to assess the multi-collinearity between explanatory variables. In addition, the t- and p-values were used to interpret the significance of the coefficients of each explanatory variables. The R-2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bias and Akaike information criterion (AIC), and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and bootstrapping were used to validate models. At 1/4-ha scale, the R-2 and RMSE of biomass estimation from a model using a single track of polarimetric UAVSAR data were 0.59 and 52.08 Mg/ha. With canopy height from PRISM as additional independent variable, R-2 increased to 0.76 and RMSE decreased to 39.74 Mg/ha (28.24%). At 1-ha scale, the RMSE of biomass estimation based on UAVSAR data of a single track was 39.42 Mg/ha with a R-2 of 0.77. With the canopy height from PRISM, R-2 increased to 0.86 and RMSE decreased to 29.47 Mg/ha (20.18%). The models using UAVSAR data alone underestimated biomass at levels above similar to 150 Mg/ha showing the saturation phenomenon. Adding canopy height from PRISM stereo imagery significantly improved the biomass estimation and elevated the saturation level in estimating biomass. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation. Combined use of UAVSAR data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation at 1/4-ha scale, R-2 increased from 0.59 to 0.66 and RMSE reduced from 52.08 to 48.57 Mg/ha. Averaging multiple acquisitions of UAVSAR data from the same look azimuth direction did not improve biomass estimation. A biomass map derived from NASA's LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging System) waveform data was used as a reference for evaluation of the biomass maps from these models. The study has also shown that the errors decreased when deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests were modeled separately but the improvement was not significant.

TI  - Extraction of Terraces on the Loess Plateau from High-Resolution DEMs and Imagery Utilizing Object-Based Image Analysis
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Terraces are typical artificial landforms on the Loess Plateau, with ecological functions in water and soil conservation, agricultural production, and biodiversity. Recording the spatial distribution of terraces is the basis of monitoring their extent and understanding their ecological effects. The current terrace extraction method mainly relies on high-resolution imagery, but its accuracy is limited due to vegetation coverage distorting the features of terraces in imagery. High-resolution topographic data reflecting the morphology of true terrace surfaces are needed. Terraces extraction on the Loess Plateau is challenging because of the complex terrain and diverse vegetation after the implementation of vegetation recovery. This study presents an automatic method of extracting terraces based on 1 m resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and 0.3 m resolution Worldview-3 imagery as auxiliary information used for object-based image analysis (OBIA). A multi-resolution segmentation method was used where slope, positive and negative terrain index (PN), accumulative curvature slope (AC), and slope of slope (SOS) were determined as input layers for image segmentation by correlation analysis and Sheffield entropy method. The main classification features based on DEMs were chosen from the terrain features derived from terrain factors and texture features by gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) analysis; subsequently, these features were determined by the importance analysis on classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Extraction rules based on DEMs were generated from the classification features with a total classification accuracy of 89.96%. The red band and near-infrared band of images were used to exclude construction land, which is easily confused with small-size terraces. As a result, the total classification accuracy was increased to 94%. The proposed method ensures comprehensive consideration of terrain, texture, shape, and spectrum characteristics, demonstrating huge potential in hilly-gully loess region with similarly complex terrain and diverse vegetation covers.

TI  - Simulation of water and carbon fluxes in a broad-leaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountains based on Biome-BQC model and Ensemble Kalman Filter method
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation provides an effective way to integrate the model simulation and remote sensing observation, through the integration of remote sensing data in the run of the model, adjusting the model trajectory to reduce model error and improve simulation accuracy. This paper uses the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) assimilated MODIS LAI into the Biome-BGC model in growing season to simulate the water and carbon fluxes in a broad-leaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountains. At the same time, the simulated snow sublimation and the parameters of the calculation method of soil temperature are improved, which can effectively reduce the error of the ecological respiration in winter. The result shows that as compared with the original model simulated without data assimilation, the improved Biome-BGC model with the assimilation of the MODIS LAI makes the correlation coefficient between the simulated values and the observed values of the gross ecosystem primary productivity (GPP) increased by 0.06, and reduced the centered root mean-square error (RMSE) by 0.48 g C . m(-2) . d(-1), ecosystem respiration (RE) correlation coefficient increased by 0.02, centered root-mean-square error decreased by 0.20 g C . m(-2) . d(-1); the correlation coefficient of net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) increased by 0.35, centered root-mean-square error decreased by 0.50 g C . m(-2) . d(-1). Meanwhile, data assimilation has no significant effect on the simulation precision of evapotranspiration (ET), but the improved model improves the correlation coefficient of ET. The data assimilation based on EnKF algorithm improves the accuracy of the carbon flux simulation in the broad-leaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountains, and has an important significance on more accurate estimation of carbon flux at regional scale.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Distribution of Air Pollutants and Their Relationship with Land-Use Patterns in Hangzhou City, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution contributes to a large fraction of the total mortality estimated under the global burden of disease project (GBD) of the World Health Organization (WHO). This paper discusses an integrated study to obtain the spatiotemporal characteristics of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and trace gases (O-3, SO2, NO2, and CO) pollutants in Hangzhou City (China) for the years 2014-2016. Our detailed analysis shows a relationship between air pollutants and land-use/land-cover change. Air quality parameters (PM2.5 and PM10) and trace gases (SO2, NO2, and CO) show strong monthly variations in the months of January (higher values) and July (lower values). During monsoon and summer seasons, air quality and trace gases show low values, whereas ozone (O-3) is higher in the summer and lower in the winter. The spatial distribution of air pollutants is retrieved using the kriging method at the monitoring sites in Hangzhou City. We have considered normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) from the Landsat 8 data. The correlation between air pollutants and land use at the street-town unit suggests that areas with low NDVI, high road density, large built-up density, and LST are consistent with high concentrations of particulate matter and SO2, NO2, and CO. Among the trace gases, NO2 is found to be the most sensitive element affected by land use patterns, and O-3 shows weak correlation with land use. SO2 shows a strong positive correlation with road density and LST, whereas CO shows positive correlation with the built-up density, LST, and population density.

TI  - Phase Correction of Single-Look Complex Radar Images for User-Friendly Efficient Interferogram Formation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new interferometric synthetic aperture radar processing approach that removes topography-dependent phase from single-look complex (SLC) radar images, making inter-ferogram formation more efficient. We first adopt motion compensation techniques to resample SLC images with respect to an ideal reference orbit and then separate the residual topographic phase contributions into parts dependent only on individual SLC acquisitions, and generate topography-compensated images directly in latitude-longitude coordinates. Since the number of inter-ferograms is typically much larger than the number of SLCimages, our approach greatly reduces needed computational resources. Furthermore, we move the need for precise knowledge of imaging geometry upstream from the end user to the data provider. We demonstrate our approach for both preprocessed SLC images and raw data using COSMO-SkyMed L1A and ALOS L0 products. The performance of our method depends on the quality of the digital elevation model (DEM) used-DEM error affects the correction phase proportionally to the baseline between radar scenes and the reference orbital path. With a 1000-m baseline and a nominal 30 degrees incidence angle, we find that the uncertainty of estimated deformation increases by approximately 1 cm with every 3 m increase in the DEM error.

TI  - An Improved Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval Algorithm for Moderate to High Spatial Resolution Optical Remotely Sensed Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To extract quantitative land information accurately and monitor the air pollution at city scale from moderate to high spatial resolution (MHSR) with a resolution no coarser than 30 m, optical remotely sensed imagery and aerosol parameters, especially aerosol optical depth (AOD), are a necessary step. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that can effectively estimate the spatial distribution of atmospheric aerosols and retrieve surface reflectance from moderate to high spatial resolution imagery under general atmosphere and land surface conditions. This algorithm has been improved in the following three aspects: (i) it has been developed for most of the moderate to high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery; (ii) it can be applied to all kinds of land surface types including bright surface; and (iii) it is completely automatic. This algorithm is therefore suitable for operational applications. The derived AOD in Beijing from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Huan Jing 1 (HJ-1/CCD) data is validated with AErosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) ground measurements at Beijng and Xianghe stations.

TI  - A Dark Target Algorithm for the GOSAT TANSO-CAI Sensor in Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval over Land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and Aerosol Imager (CAI) onboard the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) is a multi-band sensor designed to observe and acquire information on clouds and aerosols. In order to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land from the CAI sensor, a Dark Target (DT) algorithm for GOSAT CAI was developed based on the strategy of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) DT algorithm. When retrieving AOD from satellite platforms, determining surface contributions is a major challenge. In the MODIS DT algorithm, surface signals in the visible wavelengths are estimated based on the relationships between visible channels and shortwave infrared (SWIR) near the 2.1 mu m channel. However, the CAI only has a 1.6 mu m band to cover the SWIR wavelengths. To resolve the difficulties in determining surface reflectance caused by the lack of 2.1 m band data, we attempted to analyze the relationship between reflectance at 1.6 mu m and at 2.1 mu m. We did this using the MODIS surface reflectance product and then connecting the reflectances at 1.6 mu m and the visible bands based on the empirical relationship between reflectances at 2.1 mu m and the visible bands. We found that the reflectance relationship between 1.6 mu m and 2.1 mu m is typically dependent on the vegetation conditions, and that reflectances at 2.1 mu m can be parameterized as a function of 1.6 mu m reflectance and the Vegetation Index (VI). Based on our experimental results, an Aerosol Free Vegetation Index (AFRI(2.1))-based regression function connecting the 1.6 mu m and 2.1 mu m bands was summarized. Under light aerosol loading (AOD at 0.55 mu m < 0.1), the 2.1 mu m reflectance derived by our method has an extremely high correlation with the true 2.1 mu m reflectance (r-value = 0.928). Similar to the MODIS DT algorithms (Collection 5 and Collection 6), a CAI-applicable approach that uses AFRI(2.1) and the scattering angle to account for the visible surface signals was proposed. It was then applied to the CAI sensor for AOD retrieval; the retrievals were validated by comparisons with ground-level measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites. Validations show that retrievals from the CAI have high agreement with the AERONET measurements, with an r-value of 0.922, and 69.2% of the AOD retrieved data falling within the expected error envelope of +/- (0.1 + 15% AOD(AERONET)).

TI  - Extended Data-Based Mechanistic Method for Improving Leaf Area Index Time Series Estimation with Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the key parameters in crop growth monitoring and global change studies. Multiple LAI products have been generated from satellite observations, many of which suffer from data discontinuities due to persistent cloud contamination and retrieval algorithm inaccuracies. This study proposes an extended data-based mechanistic method (EDBM) for estimating LAI time series from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The data-based mechanistic model is universalized to supply the LAI background information, and then the vegetation canopy radiative-transfer model (PROSAIL) is coupled to calculate reflectances with the same observation geometry as MODIS reflectance data. The ensemble Kalman filter (ENKF) is introduced to improve LAI estimation based on the difference between simulated and observed reflectances. Field measurements from seven Benchmark Land Multisite Analysis and Intercomparison of Products (BELMANIP) sites and reference maps from the Imagine-S project La Albufera, Spain site were used to validate the model. The results demonstrate that when compared with field measurements, the LAI time-series estimates obtained using this approach were superior to those obtained with the MODIS 500 m resolution LAI product. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the MODIS LAI product and of the LAI estimated with the proposed method were 1.26 and 0.5, respectively. When compared with reference LAI maps, the results indicate that the estimated LAI is spatially and temporally consistent with LAI reference maps. The average differences between EDBM and the LAI reference map on the selected four days was 0.32.

M3  - Article
AB  - This letter presents a methodology for urban area mapping with density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) using the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR), Sentinel-1A, and HuanJing-1C data. Urban areas have a diversity of shapes, including circles, squares, strips, and other irregular shapes, and the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is suitable for identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes. Exploiting DBSCAN to extract urban areas is a key aspect of this method, and improvements via the incorporation of synthetic aperture radar data preprocessing and postprocessing also play important roles in optimizing the extractions. Different test site sizes were chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, and the validation results showed that the method is efficient and accurately extracts urban areas ranging from small towns to super metropolitan areas.

TI  - Mapping Winter Wheat with Multi-Temporal SAR and Optical Images in an Urban Agricultural Region
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat is the second largest food crop in China. It is important to obtain reliable winter wheat acreage to guarantee the food security for the most populous country in the world. This paper focuses on assessing the feasibility of in-season winter wheat mapping and investigating potential classification improvement by using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, optical images, and the integration of both types of data in urban agricultural regions with complex planting structures in Southern China. Both SAR (Sentinel-1A) and optical (Landsat-8) data were acquired, and classification using different combinations of Sentinel-1A-derived information and optical images was performed using a support vector machine (SVM) and a random forest (RF) method. The interference coherence and texture images were obtained and used to assess the effect of adding them to the backscatter intensity images on the classification accuracy. The results showed that the use of four Sentinel-1A images acquired before the jointing period of winter wheat can provide satisfactory winter wheat classification accuracy, with an F1 measure of 87.89%. The combination of SAR and optical images for winter wheat mapping achieved the best F1 measure-up to 98.06%. The SVM was superior to RF in terms of the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient, and was faster than RF, while the RF classifier was slightly better than SVM in terms of the F1 measure. In addition, the classification accuracy can be effectively improved by adding the texture and coherence images to the backscatter intensity data.

TI  - Trade-offs between carbon, water, soil and food in Guanzhong-Tianshui economic region from remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to ensure the efficient supply of land ecosystem services when the competition for land is increasing. In this paper we simulated the ecosystem services function under two scenarios, including carbon sequestration, agricultural production, water and soil conservation, and analyzed the tradeoffs among these ecosystem services in Guanzhong-Tianshui region from 2000 to 2050. Then the productive efficiency of ecosystem services was assessed under two scenarios and compared their production possibility frontiers (PPFs). Through the simulation analysis of their optimum allocation, we also provide the scientific evidence to the development of ecosystem. The natural rules were revealed that if these trade-offs emphasize the potential to sequester carbon in the landscape, along with very little loss of agricultural production, much more water is used. It could be identified to adhere to combine the exploitation and utilization, remediation and protection for land to promote the effective circulation of land eco-system, and meet the society's preferences for land ecosystem service function by adjusting the use of multiple eco-services.

TI  - High-Rise Building Layover Exploitation with Non-Local Frequency Estimation in SAR Interferograms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide application of high-resolution SAR data, such as TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X, has resulted in an increase of the data processing difficulty of interferograms, especially in urban areas with serious layovers caused by high-rise buildings. In this paper, a new method based on frequency estimation is proposed to extract and compensate the building layover phase without considering the building structure. We use a non-local algorithm to estimate the high-accuracy frequency in the range direction, which is utilized to extract the layover areas of a building. Then, a two-step method for estimating local frequencies is used for layover phase removal. Efficient frequency estimation and building extraction is demonstrated on real data in comparison with traditional methods. The results of the removal approach with both simulated and real TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X images are presented to prove the potential of the method.

TI  - Improving the mapping of crop types in the Midwestern US by fusing Landsat and MODIS satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping crop types is of great importance for assessing agricultural production, land-use patterns, and the environmental effects of agriculture. Indeed, both radiometric and spatial resolution of Landsat's sensors images are optimized for cropland monitoring. However, accurate mapping of crop types requires frequent cloud-free images during the growing season, which are often not available, and this raises the question of whether Landsat data can be combined with data from other satellites. Here, our goal is to evaluate to what degree fusing Landsat with MODIS Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data can improve crop-type classification. Choosing either one or two images from all cloud-free Landsat observations available for the Arlington Agricultural Research Station area in Wisconsin from 2010 to 2014, we generated 87 combinations of images, and used each combination as input into the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) algorithm to predict Landsat-like images at the nominal dates of each 8-day MODIS NBAR product. Both the original Landsat and STARFM-predicted images were then classified with a support vector machine (SVM), and we compared the classification errors of three scenarios: 1) classifying the one or two original Landsat images of each combination only, 2) classifying the one or two original Landsat images plus all STARFM-predicted images, and 3) classifying the one or two original Landsat images together with STARFM-predicted images for key dates. Our results indicated that using two Landsat images as the input of STARFM did not significantly improve the STARFM predictions compared to using only one, and predictions using Landsat images between July and August as input were most accurate. Including all STARFM-predicted images together with the Landsat images significantly increased average classification error by 4% points (from 21% to 25%) compared to using only Landsat images. However, incorporating only STARFM-predicted images for key dates decreased average classification error by 2% points (from 21% to 19%) compared to using only Landsat images. In particular, if only a single Landsat image was available, adding STARFM predictions for key dates significantly decreased the average classification error by 4 percentage points from 30% to 26% (p < 0.05). We conclude that adding STARFM-predicted images can be effective for improving crop-type classification when only limited Landsat observations are available, but carefully selecting images from a full set of STARFM predictions is crucial. We developed an approach to identify the optimal subsets of all STARFM predictions, which gives an alternative method of feature selection for future research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Murine norovirus detection in the exhaust air of IVCs is more sensitive than serological analysis of soiled bedding sentinels
T2  - LABORATORY ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - One limitation to housing rodents in individually ventilated cages (IVCs) is the ineffectiveness of traditional health monitoring programs that test soiled bedding sentinels every quarter. Aerogen transmission does not occur with this method. Moreover, the transmission of numerous pathogens in bedding is uncertain, and sentinel susceptibility to various pathogens varies. A novel method using particle collection from samples of exhaust air was developed in this study which was also systematically compared with routine health monitoring using soiled bedding sentinels. We used our method to screen these samples for the presence of murine norovirus (MNV), a mouse pathogen highly prevalent in laboratory animal facilities. Exhaust air particles from prefilters of IVC racks with known MNV prevalence were tested by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). MNV was detected in exhaust air as early as one week with one MNV-positive cage per rack, while sentinels discharged MNV RNA without seroconverting. MNV was reliably and repeatedly detected in particles collected from samples of exhaust air in all seven of the threemonth sampling rounds, with increasing MNV prevalence, while sentinels only seroconverted in one round. Under field conditions, routine soiled bedding sentinel health monitoring in our animal facility failed to identify 67% (n = 85) of positive samples by RT-qPCR of exhaust air particles. Thus, this method proved to be highly sensitive and superior to soiled bedding sentinels in the reliable detection of MNV. These results represent a major breakthrough in hygiene monitoring of rodent IVC systems and contribute to the 3R principles by reducing the number of animals used and by improving experimental conditions.

TI  - Implementation of evapotranspiration data assimilation with catchment scale distributed hydrological model via an ensemble Kalman Filter
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is a crucial component of terrestrial water cycles. The most common methods of estimating catchment-scale ETa are remote sensing and hydrological models. These methods have limitations when applied at the catchment scale due to coarse resolutions of data and uncertainties in model predictions. Data assimilation techniques that combine complementary information from hydrological models and observed data can overcome some of the limitations. These techniques have been used in many hydrological modeling studies, but few have applied data assimilation to ETa within a distributed precipitation-runoff catchment modeling framework. This paper proposes a catchment scale ETa data assimilation technique (termed ET-DA) that assimilates remotely sensed ETa data into a distributed time-variant gain hydrological model (DTVGM-ET) for improving hydrological model simulations. The DTVGM-ET improved the ETa computation on the basis of a nonlinear soil water availability function to establish an explicit time response relationship between ETa and soil moisture for implementing the ETa assimilation. The proposed ET-DA system was tested in the Upper Huai River Basin (UHRB), China using data from 2000 to 2012. Through synthetic simulation experiments, the capability of ET-DA for obtaining accurate, continuous time series of ETa estimates and achieving assimilation feedback on soil moisture and streamflow was examined. The results demonstrated that ET-DA provided improved regional ETa monitoring capability, and assimilation of ETa into the hydrological model led to improved model predictions of soil moisture and streamflow.

TI  - Predicting the potential distribution of wetland-dependant birds, based on garp niche model and BP algorithm.
T2  - Marine Environmental Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on waterfowl birds' survey data, such as Osprey, Black winged kite, Common buzzard, Oriental monty Yao, Red billed blue magpie and other 13 species of waterbirds, we select the 15 districts of it in Maipo-Deep Bay wetland of Hong Kong, January 2009 as a case. Then, collect the high resolution remote sensing data, climate and terrain data of this area at the same period. Finally, use GIS and RS technology to obtain nine kinds of impact factors, what is closely related to the birds. The Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) niche model is used to simulate the space distribution of a random sampling points of wetland-dependant birds. The result was not ideal for the waterfowl data space is not continuous, and we do not consider the waterfowl non-Presence points in the GARP model. So we introduce the BP neural network model to improve the simulation results of waterfowl. The results showed that the actual distribution of GARP model simulation waterfowl improved by BP algorithm has achieved good effect. AUC value from ROC curve was used to check and measure the training sample points, the AUC value of 0. 905, has a great increase compared with the last result of 0. 762. The simulation results demonstrate the characteristics of the distribution of wetland-dependent birds, intertidal zone and large areas of the pond area is its main habitat, mangrove, marsh, followed by habitat, due to human activities frequently interfered with the habitat of waterfowl, the waterfowl distribution less or no in deep bay, urban land used and urban green space area. The relationship between water birds and geographical environment was revealed very good.

TI  - Land subsidence in Tianjin for 2015 to 2016 revealed by the analysis of Sentinel-1A with SBAS-InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been suggested that Tianjin, China, has significant land subsidence due to excessive extraction of water. Although it is presently under control, the land subsidence around Tianjin suburbs in recent years should not be ignored. However, existing research work on land subsidence is based on traditional synthetic aperture radar satellite images in which the research time spans are mainly before 2012. An advanced time-series method, namely small baselines subset (SBAS) technique, is applied to a total of 27 Sentinel-1A images over Tianjin acquired between May 31, 2015, and May 13, 2016, to derive the subsidence magnitude and distribution of Tianjin. Furthermore, the overall and quantitative validations of SBAS-derived results are implemented. First, the overall subsidence distribution derived by SBAS is compared with the annual report of land subsidence in Tianjin 2015, which shows the same subsidence trend and distribution. Then, 44 benchmarks and 2 continuously operating reference station datasets, i.e., CH01 and XQYY, are processed to provide a specific validation of SBAS-derived results of Sentinel-1A. Finally, through investigation, an interpretation from two aspects of groundwater extraction and geological structures of the surrounding Wangqingtuo settlement funnel area is given.

TI  - Potential Role of Pet Cats As a Sentinel Species for Human Exposure to Flame Retardants
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flame retardants are a wide group of chemicals used by the industry to avoid combustion of materials. These substances are commonly found in plastics, electronic equipment, fabrics, and in many other everyday articles. Subsequently, ubiquitous environmental contamination by these common chemical is frequently reported. In the present study, we have evaluated the level of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs), and organophosphorous flame retardants (OPFRs) in pet cats through the analysis of their serum. We also analyzed the level exposure to such chemicals in a series of 20 cat owners, trying to disclose the role of pet cats as sentinel species of human exposure to FRs. Our results showed that PCBs, banned 40 years ago, showed the lowest levels of exposure, followed by BDEs banned recently. Congeners PCB-138 and PCB-180 were detected in >= 50% of the series, while BDE-47 was detected in near 90% of the pet cats. On the other hand, the highest levels were that of OPFRs, whose pattern of detection was similar to that observed in humans, thus suggesting a potential role of cats as a sentinel species for human exposure to these currently used FRs. Six out of 11 OPFRs determined [2-ethylhexyldiphenyl phosphate, tributylphosphate, triisobutylphosphate, triphenylphosphate, tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate, and tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate] were detected in 100% of the samples. It will be interesting to perform future studied aimed to elucidating the potential toxicological effects of these highly detected chemicals both, in cats and humans.

TI  - Comparing Pixel and Object-Based Approaches to Map an Understorey Invasive Shrub in Tropical Mixed Forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The establishment of invasive alien species in varied habitats across the world is now recognized as a genuine threat to the preservation of biodiversity. Specifically, plant invasions in understory tropical forests are detrimental to the persistence of healthy ecosystems. Monitoring such invasions using Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite remote sensing has been shown to be valuable in designing management interventions for conservation of native habitats. Object-based classification methods are very helpful in identifying invasive plants in various habitats, by their inherent nature of imitating the ability of the human brain in pattern recognition. However, these methods have not been tested adequately in dense tropical mixed forests where invasion occurs in the understorey. This study compares a pixel-based and object-based classification method for mapping the understorey invasive shrub Lantana camara (Lantana) in a tropical mixed forest habitat in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India. Overall, a hierarchical approach of mapping top canopy at first, and then further processing for the understorey shrub, using measures such as texture and vegetation indices proved effective in separating out Lantana from other cover types. In the first method, we implement a simple parametric supervised classification for mapping cover types, and then process within these types for Lantana delineation. In the second method, we use an object-based segmentation algorithm to map cover types, and then perform further processing for separating Lantana. The improved ability of the object-based approach to delineate structurally distinct objects with characteristic spectral and spatial characteristics of their own, as well as with reference to their surroundings, allows for much flexibility in identifying invasive understorey shrubs among the complex vegetation of the tropical forest than that provided by the parametric classifier. Conservation practices in tropical mixed forests can benefit greatly by adopting methods which use high resolution remotely sensed data and advanced techniques to monitor the patterns and effective functioning of native ecosystems by periodically mapping disturbances such as invasion.

TI  - Evaluation of wavelet spectral features in pathological detection and discrimination of yellow rust and powdery mildew in winter wheat with hyperspectral reflectance data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral absorption features are important indicators of characterizing plant biophysical variables for the automatic diagnosis of crop diseases. Continuous wavelet analysis has proven to be an advanced hyperspectral analysis technique for extracting absorption features; however, specific wavelet features (WFs) and their relationship with pathological characteristics induced by different infestations have rarely been summarized. The aim of this research is to determine the most sensitive WFs for identifying specific pathological lesions from yellow rust and powdery mildew in winter wheat, based on 314 hyperspectral samples measured in field experiments in China in 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2012. The resultant WFs could be used as proxies to capture the major spectral absorption features caused by infestation of yellow rust or powdery mildew. Multivariate regression analysis based on these WFs outperformed conventional spectral features in disease detection; meanwhile, a Fisher discrimination model exhibited considerable potential for generating separable clusters for each infestation. Optimal classification returned an overall accuracy of 91.9% with a Kappa of 0.89. This paper also emphasizes the WFs and their relationship with pathological characteristics in order to provide a foundation for the further application of this approach in monitoring winter wheat diseases at the regional scale.

TI  - Accuracy of axillary ultrasound after different neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles in breast cancer patients
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study determined whether axillary ultrasound (AUS) accurately predicted the status of axillary lymph nodes of patients who received different number of cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).Materials and Methods: From 2008 to 2015, 656 cases of patients with breast cancers who received NAC and had subsequent axillary lymph node dissection were included in this study. The findings of preoperative AUS were tested by pathological examination. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of AUS for patients who received two-, four-, and six-cycle NAC.Results: In the two- cycle subgroup, the sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were 80.2% (95% CI: 74.3%-86.2%), 61.4% (95% CI: 48.8%-74.0%) and 6.64 (95% CI: 3.36-12.4) respectively. In the four- cycle subgroup, the Sn, Sp and DOR were 69.7% (95% CI: 62.2%-77.1%), 66.1% (95% CI: 53.7%-78.5%) and 4.47 (95% CI: 2.32-8.62), respectively. In the six-cycle subgroup, the Sn, Sp and DOR were 56.7% (95% CI: 49.5%-64.0%), 74.5% (95% CI: 62.8%-87.2%) and 3.83 (95% CI: 1.863-7.86), respectively. Furthermore, the patients with normal AUS findings after six cycles of NAC have few positive nodes than patients with suspicious findings (p < 0.001).Conclusion: Preoperative AUS is a potentially useful imaging modality to predict the pathologic status of the axillary within four cycles of NAC. Although the accuracy is lower for patients who completed six cycles of NAC than that who received four-and two- cycles, the number of positive lymph nodes for patients with normal findings on AUS is low.

TI  - Ice lollies: An ice particle generated in supercooled conveyor belts
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 21 January 2009, a maturing low-pressure weather system approached the UK along with several associated frontal systems. As a part of the Aerosol Properties, PRocesses And InfluenceS on the Earth's climate-Clouds project, an observational research flight took place in southern England, sampling the leading warm front of this system. During the flight, a distinctive hydrometeor type was repeatedly observed which has not been widely reported in previous studies. We refer to the hydrometeors as "drizzle-rimed columnar ice" or "ice lollies" for short due to their characteristic shape. We discuss the processes that led to their formation using in situ and remote sensing data.

TI  - Influence of dry-season vegetation variability on Sahelian dust during 2002-2015
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The drivers of dust emission interannual variability in North Africa, the largest dust source on Earth, are still debated. Early studies outlined the role of previous-season rainfall and vegetation growth, while some recent studies emphasize the role of wind variability. Here we use a newly developed estimation of dry-season nonphotosynthetic vegetation cover in the Sahel based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) short-wave infrared bands over the 2002-2015 period. The vegetation growth anomalies caused by variability of rainfall in June-September translate to anomalies of dry vegetation cover that persist throughout the dry season until May. These vegetation anomalies explain 43% (50%) of the year-to-year variance in Sahelian-mean dry-season aerosol optical depth (AOD) as derived from MODIS Deep Blue (Sun photometers). Similar explained variance is found with 10 m wind speed and dust uplift potential. The central Sahel proves more important than the western Sahel for dry-season AOD variability.

TI  - Correlating Global Precipitation Measurement satellite data with karst spring hydrographs for rapid catchment delineation
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - To protect karst spring water resources, catchments must be known. We have developed a method for correlating spring hydrographs with newly available, high-resolution, satellite-based Global Precipitation Measurement data to rapidly and remotely locate recharge areas. We verify the method using a synthetic comparison of ground-based rain gage data with the satellite precipitation data set. Application to karst springs is proven by correlating satellite data with hydrographs from well-known springs with published catchments in Europe and North America. Application to an unknown-catchment spring in Pennsylvania suggests distant recharge, requiring a flow path that crosses topographic divides, as well as multiple lithologies, physiographic provinces, and tectonic boundaries. Although surprising, this latter result is consistent with published geologic/geophysical, monitoring well, and stream gage data. We conclude that the method has considerable potential to improve the speed and accuracy of catchment identification and hydrodynamic characterization, with applications to water resource protection and groundwater exploration, among others.Plain Language Summary We have developed a method for determining the recharge area for any spring using satellite-based precipitation data. These data are compared to changes in flow of the spring. That is, when there are surges in the spring flow, we look at satellite data to see where it has recently rained. This will have important applications in protecting spring water resources worldwide.

TI  - How much groundwater did California's Central Valley lose during the 2012-2016 drought?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimate net groundwater storage change in the Central Valley from April 2002 to September 2016 as the difference between inflows and outflows, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and changes in soil moisture and surface water storage. We also estimate total water storage change attributable to groundwater change using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, which should be equivalent to our water balance estimates. Over two drought periods within our 14-1/2years study period (January 2007 to December 2009 and October 2012 to September 2016), we estimate from our water balance that a total of 16.5km(3) and 40.0km(3) of groundwater was lost, respectively. Our water balance-based estimate of the overall groundwater loss over the 14-1/2years is -20.7km(3), which includes substantial recovery during nondrought periods The estimated rate of groundwater loss is greater during the recent drought (10.0 +/- 0.2 versus 5.5 +/- 0.3km(3)/yr) than in the 2007-2009 drought, due to lower net inflows, a transition from row crops to trees, and higher crop water use, notwithstanding a reduction in irrigated area. The GRACE estimates of groundwater loss (-5.0km(3)/yr for both water balance and GRACE during 2007-2009, and -11.2km(3)/yr for GRACE versus -10km(3)/yr for water balance during 2012-2016) are quite consistent for the two methods. However, over the entire study period, the GRACE-based groundwater loss estimate is almost triple that from the water balance, mostly because GRACE does not indicate the between-drought groundwater recovery that is inferred from our water balance.

TI  - Finite-fault slip model of the 2016 <i>M<sub>w</sub></i> 7.5 Chiloe earthquake, southern Chile, estimated from Sentinel-1 data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Subduction earthquakes have been widely studied in the Chilean subduction zone, but earthquakes occurring in its southern part have attracted less research interest primarily due to its lower rate of seismic activity. Here I use Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and range offset measurements to generate coseismic crustal deformation maps of the 2016 M-w 7.5 Chiloe earthquake in southern Chile. I find a concentrated crustal deformation with ground displacement of approximately 50 cm in the southern part of the Chiloe island. The best fitting fault model shows a pure thrust-fault motion on a shallow dipping plane orienting 4 degrees NNE. The InSAR-determined moment is 2.4 x 10(20) Nm with a shear modulus of 30 GPa, equivalent to M-w 7.56, which is slightly lower than the seismic moment. The model shows that the slip did not reach the trench, and it reruptured part of the fault that ruptured in the 1960 M-w 9.5 earthquake. The 2016 event has only released a small portion of the accumulated strain energy on the 1960 rupture zone, suggesting that the seismic hazard of future great earthquakes in southern Chile is high.

TI  - Impact of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aerosol Optical Depth and AirNow PM<sub>2.5</sub> assimilation on Community Multi-scale Air Quality aerosol predictions over the contiguous United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and AirNow PM2.5 measurements are assimilated into the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model using an optimal interpolation (OI) method. Over a 30 day test period in July 2011, three assimilation configurations were used in which MODIS AOD and AirNow PM2.5 measurements were first assimilated separately before being assimilated simultaneously. The background error covariance is estimated using both the National Meteorological Center approach and the Hollingsworth-Lnnberg method. The AOD observations from Terra are assimilated at 17Z and the Aqua AOD observations are assimilated at 20Z each day. AirNow PM2.5 measurements are assimilated 4 times a day at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z, and 18Z. Model performances are measured by the daily averaged and domain-averaged biases and the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) obtained by comparing the predictions with the AirNow PM2.5 observations that were not assimilated. Either assimilating the MODIS AOD or assimilating the AirNow PM2.5 alone helps PM2.5 predictions over the entire 30 days. The case that assimilates the observations from both sources has the best performance. While the CMAQ PM2.5 results exhibit exaggerated diurnal variations compared to the AirNow measurements, this is not as severe at rural sites as at urban or suburban sites. It was also found that assimilating the total AOD observations is more beneficial for correcting the PM2.5 underestimations than directly assimilating the AirNow PM2.5 measurements every 6 h. While the simple approach of applying the AOD scaling factors uniformly throughout the vertical columns proved effective, it is liable to produce substantial errors. This is demonstrated by a high-AOD event.

TI  - Mesoscale modeling of smoke transport from equatorial Southeast Asian Maritime Continent to the Philippines: First comparison of ensemble analysis with in situ observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric transport of smoke from equatorial Southeast Asian Maritime Continent (Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia) to the Philippines was recently verified by the first-ever measurement of aerosol composition in the region of the Sulu Sea from a research vessel named Vasco. However, numerical modeling of such transport can have large uncertainties due to the lack of observations for parameterization schemes and for describing fire emission and meteorology in this region. These uncertainties are analyzed here, for the first time, with an ensemble of 24 Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations. The ensemble reproduces the time series of observed surface nonsea-salt PM2.5 concentrations observed from the Vasco vessel during 17-30 September 2011 and overall agrees with satellite (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data. The difference of meteorology between National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP's) Final (FNL) and European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF's) ERA renders the biggest spread in the ensemble (up to 20 mu g m(-3) or 200% in surface PM2.5), with FNL showing systematically superior results. The second biggest uncertainty is from fire emissions; the 2 day maximum Fire Locating and Modelling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) emission is superior than the instantaneous one. While Grell-Devenyi (G3) and Betts-Miller-Janjic cumulus schemes only produce a difference of 3 mu g m(-3) of surface PM2.5 over the Sulu Sea, the ensemble mean agrees best with Climate Prediction Center (CPC) MORPHing (CMORPH)'s spatial distribution of precipitation. Simulation with FNL-G3, 2 day maximum FLAMBE, and 800 m injection height outperforms other ensemble members. Finally, the global transport model (Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS)) outperforms all WRF-Chem simulations in describing smoke transport on 20 September 2011, suggesting the challenges to model tropical meteorology at mesoscale and finer scale.Plain Language Summary It is well known that smoke particles from fires in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia can affect each other's air quality. Less known and surely not well documented is the transport of smoke particles from these countries to the Philippines. Here we use the first-ever measurements took nearby the coastal of the Philippines to analyze an ensemble of 24 WRF-Chem simulations of smoke transport. Because of persistent cloud cover and the complexity of meteorology, mesoscale modeling of smoke transport in these regions normally has large uncertainties. We show these uncertainties are caused first by meteorology and then by fire emissions. We further show that models with finer resolution not necessarily produce better results.

TI  - Using MODIS cloud regimes to sort diagnostic signals of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coincident multiyear measurements of aerosol, cloud, precipitation, and radiation at near-global scales are analyzed to diagnose their apparent relationships as suggestive of interactions previously proposed based on theoretical, observational, and model constructs. Specifically, we examine whether differences in aerosol loading in separate observations go along with consistently different precipitation, cloud properties, and cloud radiative effects. Our analysis uses a cloud regime (CR) framework to dissect and sort the results. The CRs come from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and are defined as distinct groups of cloud systems with similar covariations of cloud top pressure and cloud optical thickness. Aerosol optical depth used as proxy for aerosol loading comes from two sources, MODIS observations and the MERRA-2 reanalysis, and its variability is defined with respect to local seasonal climatologies. The choice of aerosol data set impacts our results substantially. We also find that the responses of the marine and continental component of a CR are frequently quite disparate. Overall, CRs dominated by warm clouds tend to exhibit less ambiguous signals but also have more uncertainty with regard to precipitation changes. Finally, we find weak, but occasionally systematic covariations of select meteorological indicators and aerosol, which serve as a sober reminder that ascribing changes in cloud and cloud-affected variables solely to aerosol variations is precarious.Plain Language Summary Aerosols are known to affect clouds and rainfall. This study examines whether satellite observations sampled and organized under a new framework can be used to detect the interactions and whether the results are consistent with expectations. The study is more extensive than previous similar efforts and highlights what is feasible and what is still challenging when attempting to find and evaluate signals of the interactions and providing interpretations of the underlying processes.

TI  - Accurate sea-land segmentation using ratio of average constrained graph cut for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Separating sea surface and land areas in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is challenging yet of great importance to coastline extraction and subsequent coastal classification. Results of the previous state-of-art methods often suffer from a number of limitations that arise from the presence of the speckle effect and the inadequate returned signal around the boundaries. We propose a graph cut (GC)-based approach to tackle these limitations and achieve accurate sea-land segmentation results. To be more specific, as the first step, three powerful multipolarization features are extracted from the polarimetric SAR data as descriptors to fully characterize the sea area and land area. Starting from that, seeds of the sea and land are selected automatically to build the prior model for GC. Based on the prior model, we construct the undirected graph in GC using the multipolarization descriptors. Finally, we incorporate the ratio of average operator to eliminate the speckle effect and get finer results for some finer structures. Experiments on Radarsat-2 quad-polarization images demonstrate significantly improved results of our proposed algorithms compared with several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative and visual performance.

TI  - Oblique propagation of monsoon gravity waves during the northern hemisphere 2007 summer
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a combination of satellite observation and high-resolution model output to understand monsoon convection as a source of high-latitude mesospheric gravity waves (GWs). The GWs generated over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) monsoon region during the 2007 summer and the role of the winds in focusing these GWs toward the high-latitude middle atmosphere are analyzed using the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry/Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (SABER/TIMED) satellite temperature data and the high-resolution Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System-Advanced Level Physics High Altitude (NOGAPS/ALPHA) model results. In the NH, above the stratosphere, the monsoon GW Momentum Flux (GWMF) exhibits a poleward tilt that follows the slanted structure of the easterly jet. The correlation coefficients (>0.5) between the time series of NH tropical stratospheric GWMF and the global winds also have a slanted structure that coincide with the easterly jet, confirming the modeling theory that stratospheric monsoon GWs are refracted into the summer easterly jet and can reach the high-latitude mesosphere. Since Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs) are sensitive indicators of changes in the polar summer mesosphere, we compared the time series of tropical stratospheric GWMF to the PMC occurrence frequency (OF) obtained from the Cloud Imaging and Particle Size/Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere satellite data to assess the influence of this wave focusing in the mesosphere. There is a significant positive correlation between the high-latitude PMC OF and the tropical stratospheric GWMF suggesting a definite influence of monsoon GWs on the high-latitude mesosphere. The disagreement in correlation at the end of the PMC season is attributed to the enhancement of the quasi 5 day planetary wave dominating over the influence of monsoon GWs on PMCs.

TI  - A simple temperature domain two-source model for estimating agricultural field surface energy fluxes from Landsat images
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple and robust satellite-based method for estimating agricultural field to regional surface energy fluxes at a high spatial resolution is important for many applications. We developed a simple temperature domain two-source energy balance (TD-TSEB) model within a hybrid two-source model scheme by coupling "layer" and "patch" models to estimate surface heat fluxes from Landsat thematic mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) imagery. For estimating latent heat flux (LE) of full soil, we proposed a temperature domain residual of the energy balance equation based on a simplified framework of total aerodynamic resistances, which provides a key link between thermal satellite temperature and subsurface moisture status. Additionally, we used a modified Priestley-Taylor model for estimating LE of full vegetation. The proposed method was applied to TM/ETM+ imagery and was validated using the ground-measured data at five crop eddy-covariance tower sites in China. The results showthat TD-TSEB yielded root-mean-square-error values between 24.9 (8.9) and 78.2 (21.4) W/m(2) and squared correlation coefficient (R-2) values between 0.60 (0.51) and 0.97 (0.90), for the estimated instantaneous (daily) surface net radiation, soil, latent, and sensible heat fluxes at all five sites. The TD-TSEBmodel shows good accuracy for partitioning LE into soil (LEsoil) and canopy (LEcanopy) components with an average bias of 11.1% for the estimated LEsoil/LE ratio at the Daman site. Importantly, the TD-TSEB model produced comparable accuracy but requires fewer forcing data (i.e., no wind speed and roughness length are needed) when compared with two other widely used surface energy balance models. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that this accurate operational model provides an alternative method for mapping field surface heat fluxes with satisfactory performance.

TI  - Retrieval of volcanic ash height from satellite-based infrared measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A new algorithm for retrieving volcanic ash cloud height from satellite-based measurements is presented. This algorithm, which was developed in preparation for China's next-generation meteorological satellite (FY-4), is based on volcanic ash microphysical property simulation and statistical optimal estimation theory. The MSG satellite's main payload, a 12-channel Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager, was used as proxy data to test this new algorithm. A series of eruptions of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano during April to May 2010 and the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex eruption in the Chilean Andes on 16 June 2011 were selected as two typical cases for evaluating the algorithm under various meteorological backgrounds. Independent volcanic ash simulation training samples and satellite-based Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization data were used as validation data. It is demonstrated that the statistically based volcanic ash height algorithm is able to rapidly retrieve volcanic ash heights, globally. The retrieved ash heights show comparable accuracy with both independent training data and the lidar measurements, which is consistent with previous studies. However, under complicated background, with multilayers in vertical scale, underlying stratus clouds tend to have detrimental effects on the final retrieval accuracy. This is an unresolved problem, like many other previously published methods using passive satellite sensors. Compared with previous studies, the FY-4 ash height algorithm is independent of simultaneous atmospheric profiles, providing a flexible way to estimate volcanic ash height using passive satellite infrared measurements.

TI  - Survival and axillary recurrence following sentinel node-positive breast cancer without completion axillary lymph node dissection: the randomized controlled SENOMAC trial
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The role of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has increasingly been called into question among patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes. Two recent trials have failed to show a survival difference in sentinel node-positive breast cancer patients who were randomized either to undergo completion ALND or not. Neither of the trials, however, included breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy or those with tumors larger than 5 cm, and power was debatable to show a small survival difference.Methods: The prospective randomized SENOMAC trial includes clinically node-negative breast cancer patients with up to two macrometastases in their sentinel lymph node biopsy. Patients with T1-T3 tumors are eligible as well as patients prior to systemic neoadjuvant therapy. Both breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy, with or without breast reconstruction, are eligible interventions. Patients are randomized 1: 1 to either undergo completion ALND or not by a web-based randomization tool. This trial is designed as a non-inferiority study with breast cancer-specific survival at 5 years as the primary endpoint. Target accrual is 3500 patients to achieve 80% power in being able to detect a potential 2.5% deterioration of the breast cancer-specific 5-year survival rate. Follow-up is by annual clinical examination and mammography during 5 years, and additional controls after 10 and 15 years. Secondary endpoints such as arm morbidity and health-related quality of life are measured by questionnaires at 1, 3 and 5 years.Discussion: Several large subgroups of breast cancer patients, such as patients undergoing mastectomy or those with larger tumors, have not been included in key trials; however, the use of ALND is being questioned even in these groups without the support of high-quality evidence. Therefore, the SENOMAC Trial will investigate the need of completion ALND in case of limited spread to the sentinel lymph nodes not only in patients undergoing any breast surgery, but also in neoadjuvantly treated patients and patients with larger tumors.

TI  - Performance of PolSAR backscatter and PolInSAR coherence for scattering characterization of forest vegetation using single pass X-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been successfully used for forest height inversion; however, there is limited applicability in spaceborne scenarios due to high temporal decorrelation. This study investigates the potential of a high-resolution fully polarimetric interferometric pair of TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X SAR data with no temporal decorrelation to analyze the backscatter and coherence response and to implement polarimetric SAR interferometry-based height inversion algorithms. The data were acquired over Barkot forest region of Uttarakhand state in India. Yamaguchi decomposition was implemented onto the dataset to express total backscatter as a sum of different scattering components from a single SAR resolution cell. Coherency matrix was used to compute complex coherence for different polarization channels. Forest areas suffered from low coherence due to volume decorrelation, whereas a dry river bed had shown high coherence. The coherence amplitude inversion approach overestimated the forest height and also resulted in false heights for this dry river bed. These limitations were overcome by implementing three-stage inversion modeling, which assumes polarizationindependent volume coherence. The results were validated using ground truth data available for 49 plots, and the latter was found to be more accurate with an overall accuracy of 90.15% and root-mean-square error of 2.42 m.

TI  - Human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) in England and Wales, 2004 to 2013: testing and diagnoses
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection has been under enhanced surveillance in England and Wales since 2002, however, little is known about testing patterns. Using data from two surveillance systems held at Public Health England, we described HTLV antibody testing patterns between 2008 and 2013 and the demographic and clinical characteristics of persons diagnosed with HTLV in England and Wales between 2004 and 2013. An increase in HTLV testing was observed in England between 2008 and 2013 (3,581 to 7,130). Most tests (82%; 7,597/9,302) occurred within secondary care, 0.5% (48/9,302) of persons were reactive for HTLV antibodies and 0.3% (27/9,302) were confirmed positive. Increasing age and female sex were predictors of a reactive HTLV screen and confirmed diagnosis. Testing in primary care including sexual health and antenatal services was infrequent. Between 2004 and 2013, 858 people were diagnosed with HTLV, most of whom were female (65%; 549/851), of black Caribbean ethnicity (60%), not born in the United Kingdom (72%; 369/514) and asymptomatic at diagnosis (45%; 267/595). Despite increased testing, the epidemiology and clinical features of those diagnosed with HTLV have remained consistent. Apart from donor screening, testing for HTLV infection remains uncommon, except to diagnose associated disease.

TI  - Interim estimates of the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine against A(H3N2) influenza in adults in South Korea, 2016-2017 season
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 2016-2017 season, the A(H3N2) influenza epidemic presented an unusual early peak pattern compared with past seasons in South Korea. The interim vaccine effectiveness (VE) of influenza vaccination in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was estimated using test-negative design through the tertiary hospital-based influenza surveillance system in South Korea. From 1 September, 2016 to 7 January, 2017, adjusted VE of influenza vaccination in preventing laboratory-confirmed A(H3N2) was -52.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], -147.2 to 6.4); -70.0% (95% CI, -212.0 to 7.4) in 19-64 years and 4.3% (95% CI, -137.8 to 61.5) in the elderly. Circulating A(H3N2) viruses belonged to the three phylogenetic subclades of 3C. 2a, differently to A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, the current vaccine strain. Amino acid substitutions in hemagglutinin of circulating viruses seem to contribute to low VE. In conclusion, interim VE analysis presented that the protection of laboratory-confirmed influenza by seasonal influenza vaccination did not show the statistical significance in South Korea in the 2016-2017 influenza season.

TI  - Epidemiology of influenza B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages in South Africa, 2005-2014
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundStudies describing the epidemiology of influenza B lineages in South Africa are lacking.MethodsWe conducted a prospective study to describe the circulation of influenza B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages among patients of all ages enrolled in South Africa through three respiratory illness surveillance systems between 2005 and 2014: (i) the Viral Watch (VW) program enrolled outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) from private healthcare facilities during 2005-2014; (ii) the influenza-like illnesses program enrolled outpatients in public healthcare clinics (ILI/PHC) during 2012-2014; and (iii) the severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI) program enrolled inpatients from public hospitals during 2009-2014. Influenza B viruses were detected by virus isolation during 2005 to 2009 and by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from 2009-2014. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients hospitalized with SARI and infected with different influenza B lineages were also compared using unconditional logistic regression.ResultsInfluenza viruses were detected in 22% (8,706/39,804) of specimens from patients with ILI or SARI during 2005-2014, of which 24% (2,087) were positive for influenza B. Influenza B viruses predominated in all three surveillance systems in 2010. B/Victoria predominated prior to 2011 (except 2008) whereas B/Yamagata predominated thereafter (except 2012). B lineages co-circulated in all seasons, except in 2013 and 2014 for SARI and ILI/PHC surveillance. Among influenza B-positive SARI cases, the detection of influenza B/Yamagata compared to influenza B/Victoria was significantly higher in individuals aged 45-64 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-16.5) and >= 65 years (aOR: 12.2; 95% CI: 2.3-64.4) compared to children aged 0-4 years, but was significantly lower in HIV-infected patients (aOR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.9).ConclusionB lineages co-circulated in most seasons except in 2013 and 2014. Hospitalized SARI cases display differential susceptibility for the two influenza B lineages, with B/Victoria being more prevalent among children and HIV-infected persons.

TI  - Assessment of hailstorm damage in wheat crop using remote sensing
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy rainfall and hailstorm events occurred in major wheat-growing areas of India during February and March 2015 causing large-scale damages to the crop. An attempt was made to assess the impact of hailstorms in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (MP) using remote sensing data. Multi-year remote sensing data from Resourcesat 2 AWiFS was used for the purpose. Wheat crop map, generated by the operational FASAL project, was used in the study. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) deviation images were generated from the NDVI images of a similar period in 2014 and 2015. This was combined with the gridded data of cumulative rainfall during the period. The logical modelling approach was used for damage classification into normal, mild, moderate and severe. It was found that the northern and southern districts in Haryana were severely affected due to rainfall/hailstorm. Eastern Rajasthan and western MP were also highly affected. Western UP was mildly affected. Crop cutting experiments (CCE) were carried out in two districts of MP. The CCE data showed that the affected fields had 7% lower yield than the unaffected fields. Empirical yield model was developed between wheat yield and NDVI using CCE data. This model was used to compute the loss in state-level wheat production. This showed that there was a reduction of 8.4% in national wheat production. The production loss estimated through this method matched with the Government estimates.

TI  - Serotyping and Genetic Characterization of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD)-Associated Enteroviruses of No-EV71 and Non-CVA16 Circulating in Fujian, China, 2011-2015
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common contagious disease in infants; it is caused by multiple serotypes of human enterovirus (EV), which belongs to the enterovirus genus of the picornavirus family. According to sentinel surveillance, infection with EVs other than EV71 and CVA 16 have become increasingly common in recent years among HFMD patients, posing new challenges for HFMD control. This study aimed to explore the spectrum of serotypes in the other EVs (non-EV71 and non-CVA16) in Fujian province in southeastern China.Material/Methods: We investigated 562 samples from EVs-infected HFMD patients with diagnosis confirmed by real-time RT-PCR with other EVs infection between 2011 and 2015. Nucleotide acid detection and the serotyping of the entero-viruses were also performed. The complete VP1 gene was amplified and sequenced. VP1-based phylogenetic analyses of CVA6, CVA10, CVA4, and CVA2 were also performed.Results: Among the samples, 22 serotypes of the other EVs, which belong to 4 species of human enterovirus A-D, were identified. Of the 22 serotypes, CVA6 (57.8%) and CVA10 (21.0%) were most common, followed by CVA4 (6.8%) and CVA2 (2.7%). The other 18 serotypes accounted for 11.7% of samples, none of which exceeded 2%. Among 47 (8.4%) samples from patients with severe HFMD, 10 serotypes were identified and most samples belonged to CVA6 (20/47), followed by CVA10 (11/47). Entire VP1 comparison revealed that overall genetic identities were 96.7%, 96.3%, 94.4%, and 94.9% among strains within CVA6, CVA10, CVA4, and CVA2, respectively.Conclusions: VP1-based phylogenetic analysis for the 4 predominant serotypes indicated various clades or sub-clades, which suggests the complex transmissions of other entero-viruses in Fujian.

T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vaccination is recommended to prevent influenza virus infection and associated complications. This study aimed to estimate the influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization in the 2015/16 season in Beijing.Methods: Patients who were hospitalized in the 5 study hospitals between 1 Oct 2015 and 15 May 2016 were recruited. Influenza vaccination status was obtained for PCR-confirmed influenza patients and the selected controls who tested negative for the virus. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the influenza VE matching by calendar week, and adjusting for age, study sites, underlying medical conditions, smoking status, and hospital admissions over the past 12 months.Results: The overall VE was 37.9% (95% CI: -103.3, 6.5) against laboratory-confirmed influenza associated hospitalization. The 2015-16 seasonal vaccine was had 61.9% (95% CI: -211.9, 15.9), 5.4% (95% CI: -108.1, 46.6) and -45.2% (95% CI: -152.6, 16.5) effectiveness to prevent infection from A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B, respectively.Conclusions: Influenza vaccination did not show effective protection against hospitalization with influenza in 2015/16 season in Beijing.

TI  - Phenology-based <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> mapping in coastal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using time series of GaoFen satellite no. 1 wide field of view imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora is an aggressive invasive plant species that replaces native species, changes the structure and function of the ecosystem across coastal wetlands in China, and is thus a major conservation concern. Mapping the spread of its invasion is a necessary first step for the implementation of effective ecological management strategies. The performance of a phenology-based approach for S. alterniflora mapping is explored in the coastal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using a time series of GaoFen satellite no. 1 wide field of view camera (GF-1 WFV) imagery. First, a time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was constructed to evaluate the phenology of S. alterniflora. Two phenological stages (the senescence stage from November to mid-December and the green-up stage from late April to May) were determined as important for S. alterniflora detection in the study area based on NDVI temporal profiles, spectral reflectance curves of S. alterniflora and its coexistent species, and field surveys. Three phenology feature sets representing three major phenology-based detection strategies were then compared to map S. alterniflora: (1) the single-date imagery acquired within the optimal phenological window, (2) the multitemporal imagery, including four images from the two important phenological windows, and (3) the monthly NDVI time series imagery. Support vector machines and maximum likelihood classifiers were applied on each phenology feature set at different training sample sizes. For all phenology feature sets, the overall results were produced consistently with high mapping accuracies under sufficient training samples sizes, although significantly improved classification accuracies (10%) were obtained when the monthly NDVI time series imagery was employed. The optimal single-date imagery had the lowest accuracies of all detection strategies. The multitemporal analysis demonstrated little reduction in the overall accuracy compared with the use of monthly NDVI time series imagery. These results show the importance of considering the phenological stage for image selection for mapping S. alterniflora using GF-1 WFV imagery. Furthermore, in light of the better tradeoff between the number of images and classification accuracy when using multitemporal GF-1 WFV imagery, we suggest using multitemporal imagery acquired at appropriate phenological windows for S. alterniflora mapping at regional scales.

TI  - Ecosystem sentinels for climate change? Evidence of wetland cover changes over the last 30 years in the tropical Andes
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - While the impacts of climate change on individual species and communities have been well documented there is little evidence on climate-mediated changes for entire ecosystems. Pristine alpine environments can provide unique insights into natural, physical and ecological response to climate change yet broad scale and long-term studies on these potential 'ecosystem sentinels' are scarce. We addressed this issue by examining cover changes of 1689 high-elevation wetlands (temporarily or perennial water-saturated grounds) in the Bolivian Cordillera Real, a region that has experienced significant warming and glacier melting over the last 30 years. We combined high spatial resolution satellite images from PLEIADES with the long-term images archive from LANDSAT to 1) examine environmental factors (e.g., glacier cover, wetland and watershed size) that affected wetland cover changes, and 2) identify wetlands' features that affect their vulnerability (using habitat drying as a proxy) in the face of climate change. Over the (1984-2011) period, our data showed an increasing trend in the mean wetland total area and number, mainly related to the appearance of wet grassland patches during the wetter years. Wetland cover also showed high inter-annual variability and their area for a given year was positively correlated to precipitation intensities in the three months prior to the image date. Also, round wetlands located in highly glacierized catchments were less prone to drying, while relatively small wetlands with irregularly shaped contours suffered the highest rates of drying over the last three decades. High Andean wetlands can therefore be considered as ecosystem sentinels for climate change, as they seem sensitive to glacier melting. Beyond the specific focus of this study, our work illustrates how satellite-based monitoring of ecosystem sentinels can help filling the lack of information on the ecological consequences of current and changing climate conditions, a common and crucial issue especially in less-developed countries.

TI  - Modeling birch seed supply and seedling establishment during forest regeneration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The seed ecology and regeneration management of birch species in Fennoscandia has been quite thoroughly investigated through decades of forestry research. Nonetheless, there are few methods for precise predictions of spontaneous natural regeneration. In this study a first framework of a model is presented that combines possible seed supply with seed emergence and seedling survival based on GIS data and the results of past experiments. The birch seed supply was calculated by combining spatial data on standing birch volume with birch seed dispersal distributions. The establishment on a site was further estimated based on the effect parameters of soil moisture conditions and soil scarification. This model shows a reduced variance compared to general means of seed supply and partly explains the variation between sites with the same soil scarification treatments. Even though additional management and ecological variables should be incorporated to increase the model's predictive ability, it could already be of use in practical forestry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite-based evapotranspiration estimates in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and continuous estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for effective water resource management. We used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) standard ET algorithm forced by the MODIS land products and the three-hourly solar radiation datasets to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration of China (ET_MOD) for the years 2001 to 2015. From the point scale validations using seven eddy covariance tower sites, the results showed that the agreement of ET_MOD estimates and observations was higher for monthly and daily values than that of instantaneous values. Under the major river basin and subbasin levels' comparisons with the variable infiltration capacity hydrological model estimates, the ET_MOD exhibited a slight overestimation in northern China and underestimation in southern China. The mean annual ET_MOD estimates agreed favorably with the hydrological model with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.93 and 0.83 at major river basin and subbasin scale, respectively. At national scale, the spatiotemporal variations of ET_MOD estimates matched well with those ET estimates from various sources. However, ET_MOD estimates were generally lower than the other estimates in the Tibetan Plateau. This underestimation may be attributed to the plateau climate along with low air temperature and sparsely vegetated surface on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Impact of Saharan dust on North Atlantic marine stratocumulus clouds: importance of the semidirect effect
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - One component of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) involves dust and marine stratocumulus clouds (MSc). Few observational studies have focused on dust-MSc interactions, and thus this effect remains poorly quantified. We use observations from multiple sensors in the NASA A-Train satellite constellation from 2004 to 2012 to obtain estimates of the aerosol-cloud radiative effect, including its uncertainty, of dust aerosol influencing Atlantic MSc off the coast of northern Africa between 45 degrees W and 15 degrees E and between 0 and 35 degrees N. To calculate the aerosol-cloud radiative effect, we use two methods following Quaas et al. (2008) (Method 1) and Chen et al. (2014) (Method 2). These two methods yield similar results of -1.5 +/- 1.4 and -1.5 +/- 1.6Wm(-2), respectively, for the annual mean aerosol-cloud radiative effect. Thus, Saharan dust modifies MSc in a way that acts to cool the planet. There is a strong seasonal variation, with the aerosol-cloud radiative effect switching from significantly negative during the boreal summer to weakly positive during boreal winter. Method 1 (Method 2) yields -3.8 +/- 2.5 (-4.3 +/- 4.1) during summer and 1 +/- 2.9 (0.6 +/- 1) Wm(-2) during winter. In Method 1, the aerosol-cloud radiative effect can be decomposed into two terms, one representing the first aerosol indirect effect and the second representing the combination of the second aerosol indirect effect and the semidirect effect (i.e., changes in liquid water path and cloud fraction in response to changes in absorbing aerosols and local heating). The first aerosol indirect effect is relatively small, varying from 0.7 +/- 0.6 in summer to 0.1 +/- 0.5Wm(-2) in winter. The second term, however, dominates the overall radiative effect, varying from 3.2 +/- 2.5 in summer to 0.9 +/- 2.9 Wm(-2) during winter. Studies show that the semidirect effect can result in a negative (i.e., absorbing aerosol lies above low clouds like MSc) or positive (i.e., absorbing aerosol lies within low clouds) aerosol-cloud radiative effect. The semipermanent MSc are low and confined within the boundary layer. CALIPSO shows that 61.8 +/- 12.6% of Saharan dust resides above North Atlantic MSc during summer for our study area. This is consistent with a relatively weak first aerosol indirect effect and also suggests the second aerosol indirect effect plus semidirect effect (the second term in Method 1) is dominated by the semidirect effect. In contrast, the percentage of Saharan dust above North Atlantic MSc in winter is 11.9 +/- 10.9 %, which is much lower than in summer. CALIPSO also shows that 88.3 +/- 8.5% of dust resides below 2.2 km the winter average of MSc top height. During summer, however, there are two peaks, with 35.6 +/- 13% below 1.9 km (summer average of MSc top height) and 44.4 +/- 9.2% between 2 and 4 km. Because the aerosol-cloud radiative effect is positive during winter, and is also dominated by the second term, this again supports the importance of the semidirect effect. We conclude that Saharan dust-MSc interactions off the coast of northern Africa are likely dominated by the semidirect effect.

TI  - Carbon dioxide sources from Alaska driven by increasing early winter respiration from Arctic tundra
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - High-latitude ecosystems have the capacity to release large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in response to increasing temperatures, representing a potentially significant positive feedback within the climate system. Here, we combine aircraft and tower observations of atmospheric CO2 with remote sensing data and meteorological products to derive temporally and spatially resolved year-round CO2 fluxes across Alaska during 2012-2014. We find that tundra ecosystems were a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere annually, with especially high rates of respiration during early winter (October through December). Long-term records at Barrow, AK, suggest that CO2 emission rates from North Slope tundra have increased during the October through December period by 73% +/- 11% since 1975, and are correlated with rising summer temperatures. Together, these results imply increasing early winter respiration and net annual emission of CO2 in Alaska, in response to climate warming. Our results provide evidence that the decadalscale increase in the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle may be linked with increasing biogenic emissions in the Arctic, following the growing season. Early winter respirationwas not well simulated by the Earth System Models used to forecast future carbon fluxes in recent climate assessments. Therefore, these assessments may underestimate the carbon release from Arctic soils in response to a warming climate.

TI  - The vegetation and wildlife habitats of the Savuti-Mababe-Linyanti ecosystem, northern Botswana.
T2  - Koedoe
M3  - Article
AB  - This study classified the vegetation of the Savuti-Mababe-Linyanti ecosystem (SMLE), northern Botswana and developed a detailed map that provides a reliable habitat template of the SMLE for future wildlife habitat use studies. The major vegetation units of the SMLE were determined from satellite imagery and field visits and then mapped using Landsat 8 and RapidEye imagery and maximum likelihood classifier. These units were sampled using 40 m x 20 m (800 m m2) plots in which the coverage of all plant species was estimated. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) demonstrated that plant communities were determined by gradients in soil texture or fertility and wetness. NMS 1 represented a gradient of soil texture with seven woodland communities on sandy soils (sandveld communities and Baikiaea forest) dominated by Baikiaea plurijuga in Baikiaea forest and Terminalia sericea and Philenoptera nelsii in sandveld, with various indicator species differentiating the various sandveld community types. Mopane woodland further from and riparian woodland adjacent to permanent water was common on less sandy alluvial soils. Mineral-rich, heavy clay soils in the sump of a large paleolake system support open grassland and mixed Senegalia/Vachellia (Acacia) savanna, with the mineral-rich soils supporting grasses high in minerals such as phosphorus, calcium, sodium and potassium, and thus this region is a critical wet season range for migratory zebra. Taller, high-quality grasses in the mosaic of sandveld and mopane woodland communities provide critical grazing for taller grass grazers such as buffalo, roan and sable antelope, whereas wetland communities provide reliable green forage during the dry season for a variety of herbivores, including elephant. This study has demonstrated how large-scale environmental gradients determine functional habitat heterogeneity for wildlife. Conservation implications: Our study demonstrated that the functionality of protected areas is determined by large-scale environmental gradients. Thus conservation science must aim to ensure that protected areas cover the full range of key environmental gradients in a region ( soil texture and wetness in our study). Our habitat map provides a data base for wildlife habitat use studies in the region.

TI  - A nomogram to predict the probability of axillary lymph node metastasis in female patients with breast cancer in China: A nationwide, multicenter, 10-year epidemiological study
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone may lead to postoperative complications. Among patients with positive ALN in the preoperative examination, approximately 40% patients do not have SLN metastasis. Herein, we aimed to develop a model to predict the probability of ALN metastasis as a preoperative tool to support clinical decision-making. We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features of 4211 female patients with breast cancer who were diagnosed in seven breast cancer centers representing entire China, over 10 years (1999-2008). The patients were randomly categorized into a training cohort or validation cohort (3:1 ratio). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for 1869 patients with complete information on the study variables. Age at diagnosis, tumor size, tumor quadrant, clinical nodal status, local invasion status, pathological type, and molecular subtypes were the independent predictors of ALN metastasis. The nomogram was then developed using the seven variables. Further, it was subsequently validated in 642 patients with complete data on variables in the validation cohort. Coefficient of determination (R-2) and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were calculated to be 0.979 and 0.7007, showing good calibration and discrimination of the model, respectively. The false-negative rates of the nomogram were 0 and 6.9% for the predicted risk cut-off values of 14.03% and 20%, respectively. Therefore, when the predicted risk is less than 20%, SLNB may be avoided. After further validation in various patient populations, this model may support increasingly limited axillary surgery in breast cancer.

TI  - Bovine WC1<SUP>+</SUP> and WC1<SUP>neg</SUP> γδ T Lymphocytes Influence Monocyte Differentiation and Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cell Maturation during <i>In Vitro Mycobacterium avium</i> Subspecies <i>paratuberculosis</i> Infection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During early Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map) infection, complex interactions occur between the bacteria, cells from the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) including both resident (macrophages and dendritic cells) and recruited (monocytes) cells, and other mucosal sentinel cells such as gamma delta T lymphocytes. Though the details of early host-pathogen interactions in cattle remain largely underexplored, our hypothesis is that these significantly influence development of host immunity and ultimate success or failure of the host to respond to Map infection. The aims of the present study were to first characterize monocyte-derived MPS cells from young calves with respect to their immunophenotype and function. Then, we set out to investigate the effects of WC1(+) and WC1(neg) gamma delta T lymphocytes on (1) the differentiation of autologous monocytes and (2) the maturation of autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). To achieve this, peripheral blood WC1(+) or WC1(neg) gamma delta T lymphocytes were cocultured with either autologous freshly isolated peripheral blood-derived monocytes or autologous immature MDDCs (iMDDCs). We began by measuring several markers of interest on MPS cells. Useful markers to distinguish monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from MDDCs include CD11b, CD163, and CD172a, which are expressed significantly higher on MDMs compared with MDDCs. Function, but not phenotype, was influenced by WC1(neg) gamma delta T lymphocytes: viability of Map harvested from monocytes differentiated in the presence of WC1(neg) gamma delta T lymphocytes (dMonWC1(neg)) was significantly lower compared to MDMs and MDDCs. With respect to DC maturation, we first showed that mature MDDCs (mMDDCs) have significantly higher expression of CD11c, CD80, and CD86 compared with iMDDCs, and the phagocytic capacity of mMDDCs is significantly reduced compared to iMDDCs. We then showed that gamma delta T lymphocyte subsets induce functional (reduced phagocytosis) but not phenotypic (surface marker expression) iMDDC maturation. These data collectively show that gamma delta T lymphocytes influence differentiation, maturation, and ultimately the function of monocytes during Map infection, which has significant implications on survival of Map and success of host defense during early Map infection.

TI  - Surgery in late melanoma adrenal metastasis.
T2  - BMJ case reports
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Metastatic melanoma to adrenal gland are very infrequent, being generally associated with additional evidence of systemic disease and, consequently, with short-term survival. However, the prognosis and the therapeutic management vary depending on some important oncological features. Long-term survival rates have been described after complete resection of metastatic disease. Here, we report the case of a woman aged 41 years diagnosed with a cutaneous melanoma on the right side of her paravertebral region, level III of Clark, in 2002, who underwent surgical excision of the tumour with negative margins and a negative sentinel node. She posteriorly developed pulmonary metastasis in 2006 and 2009, both resected with curative intention and in 2013, she was diagnosed with an adrenal metastasis. Therefore, she was submitted to an uneventful right laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The pathology report described metastasis of a cutaneous melanoma, negative for BRAF mutation. The patient is actually disease-free after 30 months of follow-up.

TI  - Optimized calibration methodology of VIIRS day-night band low-gain stage using a solar diffuser
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An enhanced methodology of the standard on-orbit calibration of the day-night band (DNB) of the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite is presented, specifically for the low-gain stage. The range of the "sweet spot" for the fully illuminated scans in the calibration events is expanded from 4 degrees to 7.8 degrees in order to increase the number of fully illuminated scans to 72, which then permits a complete calibration of the DNB to be carried out within one orbit for all 36 aggregated modes and the two mirror sides. This improves over the current operational methodology, which is with a more restricted range for the sweet spot that requires multiple orbits to complete a calibration. The expansion necessarily requires the expansion of a key calibration input, the product of the bidirectional reflectance factor of the solar diffuser (SD) with the vignetting function describing the transmission of the attenuation screen in front of the SD port, or BVP for short. The expanded BVP is derived by fitting the function in three separate intervals and joining them smoothly to form a single function. Additional enhancements include the adaptation of the previously improved SD degradation and all other improvements developed for reflective solar bands from the previous work. The time-dependent relative spectral response is also characterized and implemented, and its impact and improvements are studied and discussed. The result shows that the improved DNB calibration coefficients are more stable and smooth, and less noisy. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

TI  - The effects of forest canopy shading and turbulence on boundary layer ozone
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere close to the surface is known to be strongly influenced by vegetation. However, two critical aspects of the forest environment have been neglected in the description of the large-scale influence of forests on air pollution: the reduction of photolysis reaction rates and the modification of vertical transport due to the presence of foliage. Here we show that foliage shading and foliage-modified vertical diffusion have a profound influence on atmospheric chemistry, both at the Earth's surface and extending throughout the atmospheric boundary layer. The absence of these processes in three-dimensional models may account for 59-72% of the positive bias in North American surface ozone forecasts, and up to 97% of the bias in forested regions within the continent. These processes are shown to have similar or greater influence on surface ozone levels as climate change and current emissions policy scenario simulations.

TI  - Losing a jewel-Rapid declines in Myanmar's intact forests from 2002-2014
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - New and rapid political and economic changes in Myanmar are increasing the pressures on the country's forests. Yet, little is known about the past and current condition of these forests and how fast they are declining. We mapped forest cover in Myanmar through a consortium of international organizations and environmental non-governmental groups, using freely-available public domain data and open source software tools. We used Landsat satellite imagery to assess the condition and spatial distribution of Myanmar's intact and degraded forests with special focus on changes in intact forest between 2002 and 2014. We found that forests cover 42,365,729 ha or 63% of Myanmar, making it one of the most forested countries in the region. However, severe logging, expanding plantations, and degradation pose increasing threats. Only 38% of the country's forests can be considered intact with canopy cover >80%. Between 2002 and 2014, intact forests declined at a rate of 0.94% annually, totaling more than 2 million ha forest loss. Losses can be extremely high locally and we identified 9 townships as forest conversion hotspots. We also delineated 13 large (> 100,000 ha) and contiguous intact forest landscapes, which are dispersed across Myanmar. The Northern Forest Complex supports four of these landscapes, totaling over 6.1 million ha of intact forest, followed by the Southern Forest Complex with three landscapes, comprising 1.5 million ha. These remaining contiguous forest landscape should have high priority for protection. Our project demonstrates how open source data and software can be used to develop and share critical information on forests when such data are not readily available elsewhere. We provide all data, code, and outputs freely via the internet at (for scripts: https://bitbucket.org/rsbiodiv/; for the data: http://geonode.themimu.info/layers/geonode%3Amyan_ lvl2_ smoothed_ dec2015_ resamp)

TI  - GLEAM v3: satellite-based land evaporation and root-zone soil moisture
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is a set of algorithms dedicated to the estimation of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture from satellite data. Ever since its development in 2011, the model has been regularly revised, aiming at the optimal incorporation of new satellite-observed geophysical variables, and improving the representation of physical processes. In this study, the next version of this model (v3) is presented. Key changes relative to the previous version include (1) a revised formulation of the evaporative stress, (2) an optimized drainage algorithm, and (3) a new soil moisture data assimilation system. GLEAM v3 is used to produce three new data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture, including a 36-year data set spanning 1980-2015, referred to as v3a (based on satellite-observed soil moisture, vegetation optical depth and snow-water equivalent, reanalysis air temperature and radiation, and a multi-source precipitation product), and two satellite-based data sets. The latter share most of their forcing, except for the vegetation optical depth and soil moisture, which are based on observations from different passive and active C-and L-band microwave sensors (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative, ESA CCI) for the v3b data set (spanning 2003-2015) and observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite in the v3c data set (spanning 2011-2015). Here, these three data sets are described in detail, compared against analogous data sets generated using the previous version of GLEAM (v2), and validated against measurements from 91 eddy-covariance towers and 2325 soil moisture sensors across a broad range of ecosystems. Results indicate that the quality of the v3 soil moisture is consistently better than the one from v2: average correlations against in situ surface soil moisture measurements increase from 0.61 to 0.64 in the case of the v3a data set and the representation of soil moisture in the second layer improves as well, with correlations increasing from 0.47 to 0.53. Similar improvements are observed for the v3b and c data sets. Despite regional differences, the quality of the evaporation fluxes remains overall similar to the one obtained using the previous version of GLEAM, with average correlations against eddy-covariance measurements ranging between 0.78 and 0.81 for the different data sets. These global data sets of terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture are now openly available at www.GLEAM.eu and may be used for large-scale hydrological applications, climate studies, or research on land-atmosphere feedbacks.

TI  - Carbon isotope-constrained seasonality of carbonaceous aerosol sources from an urban location (Kanpur) in the Indo-Gangetic Plain
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in northern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh is a major source of carbonaceous aerosols in South Asia. However, poorly constrained seasonality of their sources over the IGP leads to large uncertainty in climate and health effects. Here we present a first data set for year-round radiocarbon (C-14) and stable carbon (C-13)-based source apportionment of total carbon (TC) in ambient PM10 (n = 17) collected from an urban site (Kanpur: 26.5 degrees N, 80.3 degrees E) in the IGP during January 2007 to January 2008. The year-round C-14-based fraction biomass (f(bio-TC)) estimate at Kanpur averages 777% and emphasizes an impact of biomass burning emissions (BBEs). The highest f(bio-TC) (%) is observed in fall season (October-November, 856%) followed by winter (December-February, 804%) and spring (March-May, 758%), while lowest values are found in summer (June-September, 69 +/- 2%). Since biomass/coal combustion and vehicular emissions mostly contribute to carbonaceous aerosols over the IGP, we predict C-13(TC) (C-13(pred)) over Kanpur using known C-13 source signatures and the measured C-14 value of each sample. The seasonal variability of C-13(obs)-C-13(pred) versus C-14(TC) together with air mass back trajectories and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer fire count data reveal that carbonaceous aerosols in winter/fall are significantly influenced by atmospheric aging (downwind transport of crop residue burning/wood combustion emissions in the northern IGP), while local sources (wheat residue combustion/vehicular emissions) dominate in spring/summer. Given the large temporal and seasonal variability in sources and emission strength of TC over the IGP, C-14-based constraints are, thus, crucial for reducing their uncertainties in carbonaceous aerosol budgets in climate models.

TI  - Fracture propagation and stability of ice shelves governed by ice shelf heterogeneity
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tabular iceberg calving and ice shelf retreat occurs after full-thickness fractures, known as rifts, propagate across an ice shelf. A quickly evolving rift signals a threat to the stability of Larsen C, the Antarctic Peninsula's largest ice shelf. Here we reveal the influence of ice shelf heterogeneity on the growth of this rift, with implications that challenge existing notions of ice shelf stability. Most of the rift extension has occurred in bursts after overcoming the resistance of suture zones that bind together neighboring glacier inflows. We model the stresses in the ice shelf to determine potential rift trajectories. Calving perturbations to ice flow will likely reach the grounding line. The stability of Larsen C may hinge on a single suture zone that stabilizes numerous upstream rifts. Elevated fracture toughness of suture zones may be the most important property that allows ice shelves to modulate Antarctica's contribution to sea level rise.Plain Language Summary The Larsen C Ice Shelf is the largest floating mass of glacier ice attached to the Antarctic Peninsula. A giant crack began growing across the ice shelf in 2014. By the end of 2016, the crack has grown in length by over 70km. Sometime in the near future, it will release an iceberg the size of Delaware. Some scientists believe that this will be just the first in a series of cracks that may soon cause the ice shelf to shatter, just like its neighbor Larsen B in 2002. We studied this crack using satellite data from the years 2005 through 2016. We found that the crack grows in bursts, and it slows down when it reaches patches of stronger ice. We use a computer model to predict what direction the crack will grow. After the crack releases a giant iceberg, most of the remaining ice will speed up. Whether the ice shelf survives or soon shatters depends on a single, narrow stripe of strong ice that is currently preventing many additional cracks from growing across the ice shelf. If this stripe of strong ice is growing weaker, Larsen C may soon be history.

TI  - Information content of visible and midinfrared radiances for retrieving tropical ice cloud properties
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral instruments such as Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) have spectrally dense observations effective for ice cloud retrievals. However, due to the large number of channels, only a small subset is typically used. It is crucial that this subset of channels be chosen to contain the maximum possible information about the retrieved variables. This study describes an information content analysis designed to select optimal channels for ice cloud retrievals. To account for variations in ice cloud properties, we perform channel selection over an ensemble of cloud regimes, extracted with a clustering algorithm, from a multiyear database at a tropical Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site. Multiple satellite viewing angles over land and ocean surfaces are considered to simulate the variations in observation scenarios. The results suggest that AIRS channels near wavelengths of 14, 10.4, 4.2, and 3.8m contain the most information. With an eye toward developing a joint AIRS-MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) retrieval, the analysis is also applied to combined measurements from both instruments. While application of this method to MODIS yields results consistent with previous channel sensitivity studies, the analysis shows that this combination may yield substantial improvement in cloud retrievals. MODIS provides most information on optical thickness and particle size, aided by a better constraint on cloud vertical placement from AIRS. An alternate scenario where cloud top boundaries are supplied by the active sensors in the A-train is also explored. The more robust cloud placement afforded by active sensors shifts the optimal channels toward the window region and shortwave infrared, further constraining optical thickness and particle size.

TI  - Tissue-resident lymphocytes: sentinel of the transformed tissue
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Tumor cells can be detected and cleared by lymphocytes in a process termed cancer immunosurveillance. However, the contributing cell types had not been fully characterized. Using oncogene-induced murine models of epithelial cancer, a recent study showed that cell transformation triggers expansion of tissue-resident lymphocytes derived from innate, T cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta and TCR gamma delta lineages. These type-1-like innate lymphoid cells (ILC1ls) and type 1 innate-like T cells (ILTC1s) share a gene expression program distinct from those of conventional lymphocytes, and exhibit cytolytic activities against tumor cells. Further deciphering such a tumor-elicited immunosurveillance mechanism may 1 day be harnessed for novel cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - The balanced radiative effect of tropical anvil clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coincident instantaneous broadband radiation budget measurements from Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System and cloud vertical structure information from CloudSat-Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations radar-lidar observations are combined to study the relationship of cloud vertical structure to top-of-atmosphere energy balance fluctuations. Varying optical and physical thickness of high ice clouds produces most of the covariation between albedo and outgoing longwave radiation in regions of tropical convection. Rainy cores of tropical convective clouds have a negative impact on the radiation balance, while nonprecipitating anvil clouds have a positive effect. The effect of anvil clouds on the radiative heating profile is to warm near cloud base and cool near cloud top, and to reduce the radiative cooling rate in the clear air below the cloud. The cooling rate in the clear air below the anvil is reduced to small values for moderately thick anvils, and the driving of instability in the anvil itself also saturates for relatively thin clouds. It is hypothesized that the dependence of radiative heating on cloud thickness may be important in driving the distribution of tropical cloud structures toward one that produces net neutrality of the cloud radiative effect at the top-of-the-atmosphere, as is found in regions of deep convection over ocean areas with high and relatively uniform surface temperatures. This idea is tested with a single-column model, which indicates that cloud-radiation interactions affect anvil cloud properties, encouraging further investigation of the hypothesis.Plain Language Summary Satellite data are used to show that tropical convective clouds have a small net effect on the energy balance because the cooling effect of thick tropical clouds is offset by the warming effect of thin upper level clouds that are connected to the thick clouds. Why these two types of clouds cancel each other out nearly exactly in the warm regions of the tropics is unknown. The effect of radiative transfer on the anvil clouds seems to be a possible contributor to the abundance of thin high clouds that give the positive influences on the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere.

TI  - Feasibility and diagnostic performance of dual-tracer-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in cT1-2N0M0 gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic studies
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Dual-tracer-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy may provide a promising diagnostic tool to assess accurately the status of lymph node metastasis in the surgical operation and assure the oncologic safety of the function or stomach preserving surgery. The diagnostic performance of this technology in recent studies varied. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis.Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered at the PROSPERO. Eligible studies were searched in the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane Library databases. A random-effect model was used to pool the data. Summary receiver operator characteristic curves, analysis for publication bias, meta-regression, and subgroup analysis were also performed.Results: The pooled SLN identification rate and sensitivity were 0.97 and 0.89. Tc-99m-human serum albumin with indocyanine green ( ICG), Tc-99m-antimony sulfur colloid with ICG, performing SLN biopsy >= 15 min after dye injection, an SLN >= 5, the basin dissection, laparoscopic surgery, in studies conducted in Japan and studies published after 2012, were associated with higher sensitivity. CT1 stage, performing SLN biopsy >= 15 min after dye injection, in studies conducted in Japan and studies published after 2012, were related with a higher identification rate.Conclusions: Dual tracer is promising in SLN biopsy in gastric cancer, and the clinical application of SLN biopsy should be limited to the patients of cT1N0M0 gastric cancer. The combination of Tc-99m-human serum albumin and ICG as well as the combination of Tc-99m-antimony sulfur colloid and ICG may be the optimal tracer combination. However, it seems not justified to put this technique into routine clinical application recently. Some factors that might enhance diagnostic value are identified.

TI  - Assimilation of AERONET and MODIS AOT observations using variational and ensemble data assimilation methods and its impact on aerosol forecasting skill
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical thickness (AOT) for aerosol forecasting was tested within the Navy Aerosol Analysis Prediction System (NAAPS) framework, using variational and ensemble data assimilation methods. Navy aerosol forecasting currently makes use of a deterministic NAAPS simulation coupled to Navy Variational Data Assimilation System for aerosol optical depth, a two-dimensional variational data assimilation system, for MODIS AOT assimilation. An ensemble version of NAAPS (ENAAPS) coupled to an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) from the Data Assimilation Research Testbed was recently developed, allowing for a range of data assimilation and forecasting experiments to be run with deterministic NAAPS and ENAAPS. The main findings are that the EAKF, with its flow-dependent error covariances, makes better use of sparse observations such as AERONET AOT. Assimilating individual AERONET observations in the two-dimensional variational system can increase the analysis errors when observations are located in high AOT gradient regions. By including AERONET with MODIS AOT assimilation, the magnitudes of peak aerosol events (AOT>1) were better captured with improved temporal variability, especially in India and Asia where aerosol prediction is a challenge. Assimilating AERONET AOT with MODIS had little impact on the 24h forecast skill compared to MODIS assimilation only, but differences were found downwind of AERONET sites. The 24h forecast skill was approximately the same for forecasts initialized with analyses from AERONET AOT assimilation alone compared to MODIS assimilation, particularly in regions where the AERONET network is dense; including the United States and Europe, indicating that AERONET could serve as a backup observation network for over-land synoptic-scale aerosol events.

TI  - Temperature changes in Three Gorges Reservoir Area and linkage with Three Gorges Project
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three Gorges Project (TGP) is one of the largest hydroelectric projects throughout the world. It has brought many benefits to the society but also led to endless debates about its environmental and climatic impacts. Monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of temperature in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) is important for understanding the climatic impacts of the TGP. In this study, we used remote sensing-based land surface temperature (LST) and ground-measured air temperature data to investigate temperature changes in the TGRA. Results showed that during the daytime in summer, LST exhibited significant cooling (1-5 degrees C) in the downstream region of the reservoir, whereas LST during the nighttime in winter exhibited significant warming (1-5 degrees C) across the entire reservoir. However, these cooling and warming effects were both locally constrained within 5km buffer along the reservoir. The changes in air temperature were consistent with those in LST, with 0.67 degrees C cooling in summer and 0.33 degrees C warming in winter. The temperature changes along the reservoir not only resulted from the land-water conversion induced by the dam impounding but were also related to the increase of vegetation cover caused by the ecological restoration projects. Significant warming trends were also found in the upstream of TGRA, especially during the daytime in summer, with up to 5 degrees C for LST and 0.52 degrees C for air temperature. The warming was caused mainly by urban expansion, which was driven in part by the population resettlement of TGP. Based on satellite observations, we investigated the comprehensive climatic impacts of TGP caused by multiple factors.

TI  - Pre-seismic anomalies in remotely sensed land surface temperature measurements: The case study of 2003 Boumerdes earthquake
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of thermal anomaly prior to earthquake events has been widely confirmed by researchers over the past decade. One of the popular approaches for anomaly detection is the Robust Satellite Approach (RST). In this paper, we use this method on a collection of six years of MODIS satellite data, representing land surface temperature (LST) images to predict 21st May 2003 Boumerdes Algeria earthquake. The thermal anomalies results were compared with the ambient temperature variation measured in three meteorological stations of Algerian National Office of Meteorology (ONM) (DELLYS-AFIR, TIZI-OUZOU, and DAR-EL-BEIDA). The results confirm the importance of RST as an approach highly effective for monitoring the earthquakes. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of sentinel node biopsy and pathological ultrastaging in patients with early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDThe objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of radical hysterectomy (RH) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for the management of early-stage cervical cancer (stage IA2-IB1).METHODSA simple decision tree model was developed to follow a simulated cohort of patients with early-stage cervical cancer treated with RH and 1 of 3 lymph node assessment strategies: systematic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), SLNB using technetium 99 (Tc99) and blue dye, and SLNB using Tc99 only. SLNB using indocyanine green (ICG) was used as an exploratory strategy. Relevant studies were identified to extract the probability data and utility parameters and to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and absolute life-years (ALYs). Only direct medical costs were modeled, and the time horizon for the study was 5 years.RESULTSSLNB using Tc99 and blue dye cost $21,089 and yielded 4.54 QALYs and 4.90 ALYs. PLND cost $22,353 and yielded 4.47 QALYs and 4.91 ALYs. SLNB using blue dye and Tc99 was the most cost-effective strategy when ALYs were considered with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $144,531. When QALYs were considered, the SLNB technique using Tc99 and blue dye dominated all other strategies. SLNB using ICG cost $20,624 and yielded 4.90 ALYs and 4.54 QALYs. It was clinically superior to and less expensive than all other strategies when QALYs were the outcome of interest and had an ICER of $221,171 per ALY in comparison with RH plus PLND.CONCLUSIONSSLNB using Tc99 and blue dye with ultrastaging is considered the most cost-effective strategy with respect to 5-year progression-free survival and morbidity-free survival. Although it was included only as an exploratory strategy in this study, SLNB with ICG has the potential to be the most cost-effective strategy. Cancer 2017;123:1751-1759.

TI  - Spatiotemporal estimation of snow depth using point data from snow stakes, digital terrain models, and satellite data
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow availability in Alpine catchments plays an important role in water resources management. In this paper, we propose a method for an optimal estimation of snow depth (areal extension and thickness) in Alpine systems from point data and satellite observations by using significant explanatory variables deduced from a digital terrain model. It is intended to be a parsimonious approach that may complement physical-based methodologies. Different techniques (multiple regression, multicriteria analysis, and kriging) are integrated to address the following issues: We identify the explanatory variables that could be helpful on the basis of a critical review of the scientific literature. We study the relationship between ground observations and explanatory variables using a systematic procedure for a complete multiple regression analysis. Multiple regression models are calibrated combining all suggested model structures and explanatory variables. We also propose an evaluation of the models (using indices to analyze the goodness of fit) and select the best approaches (models and variables) on the basis of multicriteria analysis. Estimation of the snow depth is performed with the selected regression models. The residual estimation is improved by applying kriging in cases with spatial correlation. The final estimate is obtained by combining regression and kriging results, and constraining the snow domain in accordance with satellite data. The method is illustrated using the case study of the Sierra Nevada mountain range (Southern Spain). A cross-validation experiment has confirmed the efficiency of the proposed procedure. Finally, although it is not the scope of this work, the snow depth is used to asses a first estimation of snow water equivalent resources.

TI  - Distinguishing streamflow trends caused by changes in climate, forest cover, and permafrost in a large watershed in northeastern China
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how rivers respond to changes in land cover, climate, and subsurface conditions is critical for sustainably managing water resources and ecosystems. In this study, long-term hydrologic, climate, and satellite data (1973-2012) from the Upper Tahe River watershed (2359km(2)) in the Da Hinggan Mountains of northeast China were analysed to quantify the relative hydrologic effects of climate variability (system input) and the combined influences of forest cover change and permafrost thaw (system characteristics) on average annual streamflow (system response) using 2 methods: the sensitivity-based method and the Kendall-Theil robust line method. The study period was subdivided into a forest harvesting period (1973-1987), a forest stability period (1988-2001), and a forest recovery period (2002-2012). The results indicated that the combined effects of forest harvesting and permafrost thaw on streamflow (+ 47.0mm) from the forest harvesting period to the forest stability period was approximately twice as large as the effect associated with climate variability (+20.2mm). Similarly, from the forest stability period to the forest recovery period, the decrease in average annual streamflow attributed to the combined effects of forest recovery and permafrost thaw (-38.0mm) was much greater than the decrease due to climate variability (-22.2mm). A simple method was used to separate the distinct impacts of forest cover change and permafrost thaw, but distinguishing these influences is difficult due to changes in surface and subsurface hydrologic connectivity associated with permafrost thaw. The results highlight the need to consider multiple streamflow drivers in future watershed and aquatic ecosystem management. Due to the ecological and hydrological susceptibility to disturbances in the Da Hinggan Mountains, forest harvesting will likely negatively impact ecohydrological processes in this region, and the effects of forest species transition in the forest recovery process should be further investigated.

TI  - Identification and classification of structural soil conservation measures based on very high resolution stereo satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation affects large areas of land around the globe, with grave consequences for those living off the land. Major efforts are being made to implement soil and water conservation measures that counteract soil erosion and help secure vital ecosystem services. However, where and to what extent such measures have been implemented is often not well documented. Knowledge about this could help to identify areas where soil and water conservation measures are successfully supporting sustainable land management, as well as areas requiring urgent rehabilitation of conservation structures such as terraces and bunds. This study explores the potential of the latest satellite-based remote sensing technology for use in assessing and monitoring the extent of existing soil and water conservation structures. We used a set of very high resolution stereo Geoeye-1 satellite data, from which we derived a detailed digital surface model as well as a set of other spectral, terrain, texture, and filtered information layers. We developed and applied an object-based classification approach, working on two segmentation levels. On the coarser level, the aim was to delimit certain landscape zones. Information about these landscape zones is useful in distinguishing different types of soil and water conservation structures, as each zone contains certain specific types of structures. On the finer level, the goal was to extract and identify different types of linear soil and water conservation structures. The classification rules were based mainly on spectral, textural, shape, and topographic properties, and included object relationships. This approach enabled us to identify and separate from other classes the majority (78.5%) of terraces and bunds, as well as most hillside terraces (81.25%). Omission and commission errors are similar to those obtained by the few existing studies focusing on the same research objective but using different types of remotely sensed data. Based on our results, we estimate that the construction of the conservation structures in our study area in Eritrea required over 300,000 person-days of work, which underlines the huge efforts involved in soil and water conservation.

TI  - Improving forest sampling strategies for assessment of fuel reduction burning
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land managers typically make post hoc assessments of the effectiveness of fuel reduction burning (FRB), but often lack a rigorous sampling framework, A general, but untested, assumption is that variability in soil and fuel properties increases from small (similar to 1 m) to large spatial scales (similar to 10-100 km). Based on a recently published field-based sampling scheme, we addressed the following questions: (i) How much variability is captured in measurements collected at different spatial scales? (ii) What is the optimal number of sampling plots required for statistically robust characterisation of burnt areas? (iii) How can land managers improve their assessment of the effectiveness of FRB? We found that measurement variability does not increase with scale for all fuel components. Results showed that coarse woody debris is as variable at the small scale (plot, m) as it is at the landscape scale (km). For certain fuel components, such as litter biomass (in unburnt areas), overstorey biomass and leaf area, and soil properties such as total carbon and total nitrogen, samples taken at the small (plot) scale were indicative of variation at the larger scale of an individual FRB and more broadly across the landscape.We then tested the hypothesis that site stratification can reduce variability between sampling plots and as a consequence will reduce the required number of sampling plots. To test this hypothesis we used Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across areas treated with FRB and compared the number of sampling plots required to estimate mean fuel biomass with and without stratification. Stratification of burnt areas using remotely sensed vegetation indices reduced the number of sampling plots required. We provide a model of green biomass from Landsat NDVI and make recommendations on how sampling schemes can be improved for assessment of fuel reduction burning. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A fall of small objects took place on 27th April 2012 in Wargowo village near Oborniki, about 25 km NW from Poznan (Poland). There was only one eye-witness of the fall, who found two separate pieces (ca. 2.7 cm and ca. 2 cm), with several small additional fragments. After microscopic observations and chemical analysis a meteoritic origin of these objects was excluded. They are identified as space debris, therefore man-made.

TI  - Response of the pearl oyster <i>Pinctada margaritifera</i> to cadmium and chromium: Identification of molecular biomarkers
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was designed to identify in the pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera, used as a bio-accumulator, molecular biomarkers for the presence of heavy metals in the lagoon environment. Pearl oysters were exposed to 2 concentrations (1 and 10 mu g L-1) of cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) compared to a control. Twelve target genes encoding proteins potentially involved in the response to heavy metal contamination with antioxidant, detoxification or apoptosis activities were selected. P. margaritifera accumulated Cd but not Cr, and mortality was related to the amount of Cd accumulated in tissues. In response to Cd-Cr contamination, metallothionein (MT) was significantly up-regulated by Cd-Cr at both concentrations, while 7 others (SOD, CAT, GPX, GSTO, GSTM, CASP, MDR) were down-regulated. Based on the development of these molecular tools, we propose that the pearl oyster, P. margaritifera, could be used as a sentinel species for heavy metal contamination in the lagoons of tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Resiliency of the western Chesapeake Bay to total suspended solid concentrations following storms and accounting for land-cover
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of storms on water quality in the Chesapeake Bay has been studied in a patchwork fashion at various sites for short periods of time. In this paper, we use a relationship between MODIS-Terra red light reflectance and total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in order to develop a fourteen-year time period of TSS estimates during which effects of storms and land cover can be studied over a large portion of the Bay. Exponential fits were most appropriate, resulting in viable reflectance TSS relationships for the five major Western Shore rivers and the Mainstem of the Bay. Other tributaries were less well-disposed for such relationships due to lack of a large range of TSS concentrations, shallow river beds, or low number of data points. Treating the entire Chesapeake as a single entity and modeling a single reflectance-TSS relationship for the entire estuary produced poorer models with less significance compared to treating each channel separately. Over 2800 rain events were studied in the Lower Western Shore between 2000 and 2014. We found some evidence that higher rainfall amounts correspond to a lower distribution of TSS concentrations 1 day following the event in forested watersheds. At rainfall events of < 50 mm, maximum TSS within one day of the storm was highly variable, suggesting that rainfall amounts alone cannot explain variation in TSS levels. Finally, we found value in the use of prediction intervals around TSS estimates, a statistical procedure uncommonly used heretofore with satellite-based estimates but which can help to determine if results are significant or not.

TI  - Stormwater runoff plumes in the Southern California Bight: A comparison study with SAR and MODIS imagery
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Stormwater runoff is the largest source of pollution in the Southern California Bight (SCB), resulting from untreated runoff and pollutants from urban watersheds entering the coastal waters after rainstorms. We make use of both satellite SAR and MODIS-Aqua ocean color imagery to examine two different components of runoff plumes, the surface slick and the sediment discharge. We expand on earlier satellite SAR studies by examining an extensive collection of multi-platform SAR imagery, spanning from 1992 to 2014, that provides a more comprehensive view of the plume surface slick characteristics, illustrated with distribution maps of the extent and flow direction of the plumes. The SAR-detected surface plumes are compared with coincident rain and runoff measurements, and with available measured shoreline fecal bacteria loads. We illustrate differences in the detection of SAR surface plumes with the sediment-related discharge plumes derived from MODIS imagery. A conceptual satellite stormwater runoff monitoring approach is presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The incidence of metastases to the neck in testicular cancer is 4-15%, and in 5% of these cases the metastasis is the only symptom. We present a 57-year-old asymptomatic male, who had previously been treated for colon cancer. A routine PET-CT showed enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and at the neck. A core needle biopsy from the lymph node at the neck contained malignant cells, but not from colon cancer. The lymph node was extirpated, and pathological analysis proved it to be a metastasis from a testicular seminoma. A burned-out seminoma was subsequently found in the patient's right testicle.

TI  - Towards measles elimination in Italy: Virological surveillance and genotypes trend (2013-2015)
T2  - VIRUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In accordance with the goal of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, the Italian National Measles and Rubella Elimination Plan aimed to interrupt indigenous measles transmission in Italy by the end of 2015. However, from 2013 to 2015, Italy experienced high measles burden with 4902 measles cases (49.3% laboratory-confirmed) reported to the enhanced measles surveillance system (cumulative incidence in the triennium reference period: 2.4/100,000 population). The measles elimination goal was not reached.Laboratory surveillance of measles circulating genotypes is performed by the Measles and Rubella National Reference Laboratory (NRL) at the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanita - ISS), in Rome. Samples received from 1 January 2013-31 December 2015 were analysed. Those positive for measles genome by molecular tests were sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. Phylogenetic analysis performed by NRL identified that genotypes D4 and D8 were endemic and co-circulated in 2011-2013: study results show that genotype D4 disappeared during 2013. Sporadic cases were associated to genotype B3 during 2011-2013, which became endemic in Italy during 2014 and co-circulated with D8 until 2015. Sporadic cases were found belonging to genotypes D9 and H1 all over the period in exam. Similar trend has been observed in European WHO Region.

TI  - Temporal-spatial variations and driving factors analysis of coastal reclamation in China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal reclamation is the gain of land from the sea or coastal wetlands for agricultural purposes, industrial use or port expansions. Large-scale coastal land reclamation can have adverse effects on the coastal environment, including loss of marine habitats and deterioration of coastal water quality. In recent decades, coastal land reclamation has occurred extensively to meet the increasing needs of rapid economic development and urbanization in China. The overall objective of this study is to understand the coastal reclamation status of China from 1979 to 2014 and analyzed its driving factors for mitigating negative ecological effects. The data of coastal reclamation were done with the ERDAS Imagine V9.2 platform and ArcGIS software based on remote images including Landsat, SPOT, ZY-2 and ZY-3. Potential driving factors for sea reclamation were selected based on statistics bulletins and the knowledge of experts in coastal management. In order to understand the relationships among possible impact factors and coastal reclamation, the Partial Least-Squares Regression models was constructed. The analysis results indicated that the total area of reclamation was 11162.89 km(2) based on remote sensing images between 1979 and 2014. Shandong Province is the largest reclamation area, reaching 2736.54 km(2), and the reclamation is mainly concentrated in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Liaoning, where the reclamation areas were all more than 1000 km(2). According to the remote sensing images, there are three coastal reclamation hotspot regions including Bohai bay (in which is located Liaoning, Tianjin and Hebei), Jiangsu province coastal area and Hangzhou bay (in Zhejiang province). A large scale land reclamation plan of more than 5880 km(2) has been made by local government and 2469 km(2) has approved by the State Council. From the analyzed results, there is a significant collinearity between these indicators, and no significant correlation between the area of reclamation and selected indicators. Economic development and employees in marine industries have weak positive correlation and correspondingly, the area of cultivated land (ACL) had a negative correlation. Because of the weak correlation, there is an assumption that economic development, outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth were not only was the direct driving factor, but also the outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth was not the direct driving indicator. Construction land quota and huge economic returns to local government may be the direct driving factors according to our field investigation. To resolve the contradiction between the need for land and coastal wetland conservation, it is recommended that China should establish a special management agency and coordination mechanisms, reconsidered the implementation of the reclamation plans and projects that have been approved, enhance law enforcement and increase penalties and strengthen public participation in reclamation management.

TI  - Microphysical characterization of long-range transported biomass burning particles from North America at three EARLINET stations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong events of long-range transported biomass burning aerosol were detected during July 2013 at three EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network) stations, namely Granada (Spain), Leipzig (Germany) and Warsaw (Poland). Satellite observations from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) instruments, as well as modeling tools such as HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) and NAAPS (Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System), have been used to estimate the sources and transport paths of those North American forest fire smoke particles. A multiwavelength Raman lidar technique was applied to obtain vertically resolved particle optical properties, and further inversion of those properties with a regularization algorithm allowed for retrieving microphysical information on the studied particles. The results highlight the presence of smoke layers of 1-2 km thickness, located at about 5 km a.s.l. altitude over Granada and Leipzig and around 2.5 km a.s.l. at Warsaw. These layers were intense, as they accounted for more than 30% of the total AOD (aerosol optical depth) in all cases, and presented optical and microphysical features typical for different aging degrees: color ratio of lidar ratios (LR532/LR355) around 2, alpha-related angstrom exponents of less than 1, effective radii of 0.3 mu m and large values of single scattering albedos (SSA), nearly spectrally independent. The intensive microphysical properties were compared with columnar retrievals form co-located AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) stations. The intensity of the layers was also characterized in terms of particle volume concentration, and then an experimental relationship between this magnitude and the particle extinction coefficient was established.

TI  - Biomass assessment of microbial surface communities by means of hyperspectral remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland vegetation developed morphological and physiological strategies to cope with drought. However, as aridity increases, vascular plant coverage gets sparse and microbially-dominated surface communities (MSC), comprising cyanobacteria, algae, lichens and bryophytes together with heterotropic bacteria, archaea and fungi, gain relevance. Nevertheless, the relevance of MSC net primary prodtictivity has only rarely been considered in ecosystem scale studies, and detailed information on their contribution to the total photosynthetic biomass reservoir is largely missing.In this study, we mapped the spatial distribution of two different MSC (biological soil crusts and quartz fields hosting hypolithic crusts) at two different sites within the South African Succulent Karoo (Soebatsfontein and Knersvlakte). Then we characterized both types of MSC in terms of chlorophyll content, and combining these data with the biocrust and quartz field maps, we estimated total biomass values of MSCs and their spatial patterns within the two different ecosystems. Our results revealed that MSC are important vegetation components of the South African Karoo biome, revealing clear differences between the two sites, At Soebatsfontein, MSC occurred as biological soil crusts (biocrusts), which covered about one third of the landscape reaching an overall biomass value of similar to 480 g ha(-1) of chlorophyll a+b at the landscape scale. In the Knersvlakte, which is characterized by harsher environmental conditions (i.e. higher solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration), MSC occurred as biocrusts, but also formed hypolithic crusts growing on the lower soil-immersed parts of translucent quartz pebbles. Whereas chlorophyll concentrations of biocrusts and hypolithic crusts where insignificantly lower in the Knersvlakte, the overall MSC biomass reservoir was by far larger with similar to 780 g ha(-1) of chlorophyll a+b. Thus, the complementary microbially-dominated surface communities promoted biomass formation within the environmentally harsh Knersvlakte ecosystem. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Statistical approaches for the definition of landslide rainfall thresholds and their uncertainty using rain gauge and satellite data
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Models for forecasting rainfall-induced landslides are mostly based on the identification of empirical rainfall thresholds obtained exploiting rain gauge data. Despite their increased availability, satellite rainfall estimates are scarcely used for this purpose. Satellite data should be useful in ungauged and remote areas, or should provide a significant spatial and temporal reference in gauged areas. In this paper, the analysis of the reliability of rainfall thresholds based on rainfall remote sensed and rain gauge data for the prediction of landslide occurrence is carried out. To date, the estimation of the uncertainty associated with the empirical rainfall thresholds is mostly based on a bootstrap resampling of the rainfall duration and the cumulated event rainfall pairs (D,E) characterizing rainfall events responsible for past failures. This estimation does not consider the measurement uncertainty associated with D and E. In the paper, we propose (i) a new automated procedure to reconstruct ED conditions responsible for the landslide triggering and their uncertainties, and (ii) three new methods to identify rainfall threshold for the possible landslide occurrence, exploiting rain gauge and satellite data. In particular, the proposed methods are based on Least Square (IS), Quantile Regression (QR) and Nonlinear Least Square (NLS) statistical approaches. We applied the new procedure and methods to define empirical rainfall thresholds and their associated uncertainties in the Umbria region (central Italy) using both rain-gauge measurements and satellite estimates. We finally validated the thresholds and tested the effectiveness of the different threshold definition methods with independent landslide information. The NLS method among the others performed better in calculating thresholds in the full range of rainfall durations. We found that the thresholds obtained from satellite data are lower than those obtained from rain gauge measurements. This is in agreement with the literature, where satellite rainfall data underestimate the "ground" rainfall registered by rain gauges. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contemporary Remotely Sensed Data Products Refine Invasive Plants Risk Mapping in Data Poor Regions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive weeds are a serious problem worldwide, threatening biodiversity and damaging economies. Modeling potential distributions of invasive weeds can prioritize locations for monitoring and control efforts, increasing management efficiency. Forecasts of invasion risk at regional to continental scales are enabled by readily available downscaled climate surfaces together with an increasing number of digitized and georeferenced species occurrence records and species distribution modeling techniques. However, predictions at a finer scale and in landscapes with less topographic variation may require predictors that capture biotic processes and local abiotic conditions. Contemporary remote sensing (RS) data can enhance predictions by providing a range of spatial environmental data products at fine scale beyond climatic variables only. In this study, we used the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and empirical maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models to model the potential distributions of 14 invasive plant species across Southeast Asia (SEA), selected from regional and Vietnam's lists of priority weeds. Spatial environmental variables used to map invasion risk included bioclimatic layers and recent representations of global land cover, vegetation productivity (GPP), and soil properties developed from Earth observation data. Results showed that combining climate and RS data reduced predicted areas of suitable habitat compared with models using climate or RS data only, with no loss in model accuracy. However, contributions of RS variables were relatively limited, in part due to uncertainties in the land cover data. We strongly encourage greater adoption of quantitative remotely sensed estimates of ecosystem structure and function for habitat suitability modeling. Through comprehensive maps of overall predicted area and diversity of invasive species, we found that among lifeforms (herb, shrub, and vine), shrub species have higher potential invasion risk in SEA. Native invasive species, which are often overlooked in weed risk assessment, may be as serious a problem as non-native invasive species. Awareness of invasive weeds and their environmental impacts is still nascent in SEA and information is scarce. Freely available global spatial datasets, not least those provided by Earth observation programs, and the results of studies such as this one provide critical information that enables strategic management of environmental threats such as invasive species.

TI  - Influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates in the Dutch population from 2003 to 2014: The test-negative design case-control study with different control groups
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) is important for vaccine strain selection and immunization policy decisions. The test-negative design (TND) case-control study is commonly used to obtain IVE estimates. However, the definition of the control patients may influence IVE estimates. We have conducted a TND study using the Dutch Sentinel Practices of NIVEL Primary Care Database which includes data from patients who consulted the General Practitioner (GP) for an episode of acute influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) with known influenza vaccination status. Cases were patients tested positive for influenza virus. Controls were grouped into those who tested (1) negative for influenza virus (all influenza negative), (2) negative for influenza virus, but positive for respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus or enterovirus (non-influenza virus positive), and (3) negative for these four viruses (pan-negative). We estimated the IVE over all epidemic seasons from 2003/2004 through 2013/2014, pooled IVE for influenza vaccine partial/full matched and mismatched seasons and the individual seasons using generalized linear mixed-effect and multiple logistic regression models. The overall IVE adjusted for age, GP ILI/ARI diagnosis, chronic disease and respiratory allergy was 35% (95% CI: 15-48), 64% (95% CI: 49-75) and 21% (95% CI: 1 to 39) for all influenza negative, non influenza virus positive and pan-negative controls, respectively. In both the main and subgroup analyses IVE estimates were the highest using non-influenza virus positive controls, likely due to limiting inclusion of controls without laboratory-confirmation of a virus causing the respiratory disease.

TI  - Interplay between river dynamics and international borders: The Hirmand River between Iran and Afghanistan
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluvial dynamics in riverine borders can play an important role in political relationships between countries. Rivers move and evolve under the influence of natural processes and external drivers (e.g. land use change in river catchments). The Hirmand River is an important riverine border between Iran and Afghanistan. The present study shows the evolution and lateral shifting of the Hirmand River along the international border (25.6 km) over a period of 6 decades (1955-2015). Seven data series of aerial photos, topographic maps and Landsat images were used to analyze land cover and channel changes in the study reach. The land cover has changed dramatically on both sides of the border during the last 6 decades, especially in the Afghan part. Overall, 49% of all land surface changed its cover type, especially the area of agriculture and residential land contributed to that, with an increase in surface area of about 4931 ha and 561 ha, respectively. On the other hand, the natural cover and water bodies decreased to 38% and 63%, respectively. The impact of these land use changes on the morphological evolution of Hirmand River was investigated in 5 sub-reaches. We found an average decrease of the active channel width of 53% during 60 years and the average River Network Change Index for the whole study reach during 60 years was -1.25 m/year. Deposition and narrowing turned out to be the main processes occurring within the study reach. Furthermore, due to natural riverine processes the Hirmand River has moved towards Afghanistan (37 m on average) and lateral shifting was found to be up to 1900m in some sections.

TI  - Multicentric Castleman disease of hyaline vascular variant presenting with unusual systemic manifestations: a case report.
T2  - Journal of medical case reports
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Castleman disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder presenting with localized or disseminated lymphadenopathy and systemic manifestations. It can be categorized in numerous ways, such as unicentric versus multicentric, histopathological variants (hyaline-vascular, plasma cell, and mixed), or subtypes based on causative viral infections (human immunodeficiency virus, human herpesvirus-8, or Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus). Presentation ranges from asymptomatic to symptoms involving multiple organs. Even though the exact mechanism of pathogenesis is unknown, treatment is directed toward possible etiologies such as interleukin-6, cluster of differentiation 20, and viral agents.CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old Sri Lankan woman presented with generalized body swelling and foamy urine of 2weeks' duration. Examination revealed pallor; generalized edema; axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymphadenopathy; hypertension; and hepatomegaly. Investigations showed bicytopenia, nephrotic range proteinuria with hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and features of hyaline-vascular type Castleman disease in a lymph node biopsy. She was managed with rituximab and had good clinical improvement.CONCLUSIONS: Castleman disease has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, disease pathogeneses, and associations and/or complications. Medical professionals need to be familiar with this spectrum because timely diagnosis and aggressive targeted therapy are the cornerstones of managing these patients.

TI  - New Navigation Surgery for Resection of Lymphatic Malformations Using Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging.
T2  - The American journal of case reports
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND We used indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging to completely resect lymphatic malformations (LMs). This is the first report of navigation surgery utilizing ICG fluorescence imaging for resection of LMs. CASE REPORT A 15-year-old boy was diagnosed with LMs in the abdominal wall. The extent of the tumor was determined by an ultrasound, and ICG (Diagnogreen, Daiichi-Sankyo Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) was injected subcutaneously and intradermally into the core and 2 marginal regions of the tumor (3 injections in total), respectively. During surgery, the extent of the tumor was confirmed with a photodynamic eye, and the tumor was completely resected. A fluorescent portion macroscopically estimated as normal was additionally resected and no residual fluorescence or tumor were confirmed in the remaining tissue. Abnormal lymphatic vessels were histopathologically observed in the additionally resected tissue, indicating the invasion of LMs. The surgery had a good outcome with no evidence of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS We performed near-infrared fluorescence-guided imaging surgery for the resection of LMs in the abdominal wall. This is a single case study; therefore, assessment of more cases is warranted for further validation. This procedure could provide significant benefit to patients requiring resection of LMs.

TI  - Evaluation of automated urban surface water extraction from Sentinel-2A imagery using different water indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban surface water is characterized by complex surface continents and small size of water bodies, and the mapping of urban surface water is currently a challenging task. The moderate-resolution remote sensing satellites provide effective ways of monitoring surface water. This study conducts an exploratory evaluation on the performance of the newly available Sentinel-2A multispectral instrument (MSI) imagery for detecting urban surface water. An automatic framework that integrates pixel-level threshold adjustment and object-oriented segmentation is proposed. Based on the automated workflow, different combinations of visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared bands in Sentinel-2 image via different water indices are first compared. Results show that object-level modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI with band 11) and automated water extraction index are feasible in urban surface water mapping for Sentinel-2 MSI imagery. Moreover, comparative results are obtained utilizing optimal MNDWI from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images, respectively. Consequently, Sentinel-2 MSI achieves the kappa coefficient of 0.92, compared with that of 0.83 from Landsat 8 operational land imager.

AB  - AIM: The National Orthopaedic Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Collaborative was launched in November 2013 to implement ERAS protocols for hip and knee total joint arthroplasty (TJA) and fractured neck of femur (NOF) in participating district health boards (DHBs) by December 2014. This paper reports on the results.METHOD: ERAS protocols were developed for hip and knee TJA and fractured NOF. Breakthrough Series collaborative methodology was used to implement the ERAS protocols in 18 DHBs. We collected monthly data on compliance with protocols and average length of stay (ALOS). Data were analysed using run charts and Shewhart control charts.RESULTS: The national percentage of ERAS components achieved across all DHBs rose from 33% to 75% on the elective knee TJA pathway, from 31% to 78% on the elective hip TJA pathway and from 29% to 51% on the acute fractured NOF pathway. The ALOS for knee TJA reduced from 5.4 days to 4.5 days. The ALOS for hip TJA reduced from 5.1 days to 4.3 days. There was no change in the ALOS for fractured NOF.CONCLUSION: The National Orthopaedic ERAS Collaborative increased uptake of ERAS protocols across all three pathways and decreased ALOS for the elective pathways among participating DHBs. There was no decrease in ALOS for the fractured NOF pathway. Collaborative improvement methodology can be used successfully to implement orthopaedic ERAS across New Zealand DHBs.

TI  - Carbon monoxide column retrieval for clear-sky and cloudy atmospheres: a full-mission data set from SCIAMACHY 2.3 μm reflectance measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We discuss the retrieval of carbon monoxide (CO) vertical column densities from clear-sky and cloud contaminated 2311-2338 nm reflectance spectra measured by the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) from January 2003 until the end of the mission in April 2012. These data were processed with the Shortwave Infrared CO Retrieval algorithm (SICOR) that we developed for the operational data processing of the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) that will be launched on ESA's Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) mission. This study complements previous work that was limited to clear-sky observations over land. Over the oceans, CO is estimated from cloudy-sky measurements only, which is an important addition to the SCIAMACHY clear-sky CO data set as shown by NDACC and TCCON measurements at coastal sites. For Ny-Alesund, Lauder, Mauna Loa and Reunion, a validation of SCIAMACHY clear-sky retrievals is not meaningful because of the high retrieval noise and the few collocations at these sites. The situation improves significantly when considering cloudy-sky observations, where we find a low mean bias (b) over bar = +/- 6.0 ppb and a strong correlation between the validation and the SCIAMACHY results with a mean Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.7. Also for land observations, cloudy-sky CO retrievals present an interesting complement to the clear-sky data set. For example, at the cities Tehran and Beijing the agreement of SCIAMACHY clear-sky CO observations with MOZAIC/IAGOS airborne measurements is poor with a mean bias of (b) over bar = 171.2 ppb and 57.9 ppb because of local CO pollution, which cannot be captured by SCIAMACHY. For cloudy-sky retrievals, the validation improves significantly. Here the retrieved column is mainly sensitive to CO above the cloud and so not affected by the strong local surface emissions. Adjusting the MOZAIC/IAGOS measurements to the vertical sensitivity of the retrieval, the mean bias adds up to (b) over bar = 52.3 ppb and 5.0 ppb for Tehran and Beijing. At the less urbanised region around the airport Windhoek, local CO pollution is less prominent and so MOZAIC/IAGOS measurements agree well with SCIAMACHY clear-sky retrievals with a mean bias of (b) over bar = 15.5 ppb, but can be even further improved for cloudy SCIAMACHY observations with a mean bias of (b) over bar = 0.2 ppb. Overall the cloudy-sky CO retrievals from SCIA-MACHY short-wave infrared measurements present a major extension of the clear-sky-only data set, which more than triples the amount of data and adds unique observations over the oceans. Moreover, the study represents the first application of the S5P algorithm for operational CO data processing on cloudy observations prior to the launch of the S5P mission.

TI  - Satellite retrievals of <i>Karenia brevis</i> harmful algal blooms in the West Florida shelf using neural networks and impacts of temporal variabilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply a neural network (NN) technique to detect/track Karenia brevis harmful algal blooms (KB HABs) plaguing West Florida shelf (WFS) coasts from Visible-Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite observations. Previously KB HABs detection primarily relied on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS-A) satellite, depending on its remote sensing reflectance signal at the 678-nm chlorophyll fluorescence band (Rrs678) needed for normalized fluorescence height and related red band difference retrieval algorithms. VIIRS, MODIS-A's successor, does not have a 678-nm channel. Instead, our NN uses Rrs at 486-, 551-, and 671-nm VIIRS channels to retrieve phytoplankton absorption at 443 nm (a(ph443)). The retrieved a(ph443) images are next filtered by applying limits, defined by (i) low Rrs551-nm backscatter and (ii) a minimum a(ph443) value associated with KB HABs. The filtered residual images are then converted to show chlorophyll-a concentrations [Chla] and KB cell counts. VIIRS retrievals using our NN and five other retrieval algorithms were compared and evaluated against numerous in situ measurements made over the four-year 2012 to 2016 period, for which VIIRS data are available. These comparisons confirm the viability and higher retrieval accuracies of the NN technique, when combined with the filtering constraints, for effective detection of KB HABs. Analysis of these results as well as sequential satellite observations and recent field measurements underline the importance of short-term temporal variabilities on retrieval accuracies.

TI  - CLARA-A2: the second edition of the CM SAF cloud and radiation data record from 34 years of global AVHRR data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The second edition of the satellite-derived climate data record CLARA ("The CM SAF Cloud, Albedo And Surface Radiation dataset from AVHRR data" - second edition denoted as CLARA-A2) is described. The data record covers the 34-year period from 1982 until 2015 and consists of cloud, surface albedo and surface radiation budget products derived from the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) sensor carried by polar-orbiting, operational meteorological satellites. The data record is produced by the EUMETSAT Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF) project as part of the operational ground segment. Its upgraded content and methodology improvements since edition 1 are described in detail, as are some major validation results. Some of the main improvements to the data record come from a major effort in cleaning and homogenizing the basic AVHRR level-1 radiance record and a systematic use of CALIPSO-CALIOP cloud information for development and validation purposes. Examples of applications studying decadal changes in Arctic summer surface albedo and cloud conditions are provided.

TI  - Bioluminescence Imaging to Track <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> Inhibition of <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> Infection in Mice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis is an anaerobic, Gram-negative, commensal bacterium of the human gut. It plays an important role in promoting the maturation of the immune system, as well as suppressing abnormal inflammation. Many recent studies have focused on the relationship between B. fragilis and human immunity, and indicate that B. fragilis has many useful probiotic effects. As inhibition of intestinal pathogens is an important characteristic of probiotic strains, this study examined whether B. fragilis could inhibit pathogenic bacteria. Results showed that Vibrio parahaemolyticus was inhibited by B. fragilis in vitro, and that B. fragilis could protect both RAW 264.7 and LoVo cells from damage caused by V parahaemolyticus. Using in vivo imaging, we constructed a light-emitting V parahaemolyticus strain and showed that B. fragilis might shorten the colonization time and reduce the number of lux expressing bacteria in a mouse model. These results provide useful information for developing B. fragilis into a probiotic product, and also indicate that this commensal bacterium might aid in the clinical treatment of gastroenteritis caused by V parahaemolyticus.

TI  - A diffusion based study of population dynamics: Prehistoric migrations into South Asia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - A diffusion equation has been used to study migration of early humans into the South Asian subcontinent. The diffusion equation is tempered by a set of parameters that account for geographical features like proximity to water resources, altitude, and flatness of land. The ensuing diffusion of populations is followed in time-dependent computer simulations carried out over a period of 10,000 YBP. The geographical parameters are determined from readily-available satellite data. The results of our computer simulations are compared to recent genetic data so as to better correlate the migratory patterns of various populations; they suggest that the initial populations started to coalesce around 4,000 YBP before the commencement of a period of relative geographical isolation of each population group. The period during which coalescence of populations occurred appears consistent with the established timeline associated with the Harappan civilization and also, with genetic admixing that recent genetic mapping data reveal. Our results may contribute to providing a timeline for the movement of prehistoric people. Most significantly, our results appear to suggest that the Ancestral Austro-Asiatic population entered the subcontinent through an easterly direction, potentially resolving a hitherto-contentious issue.

TI  - The sero-prevalence and sero-incidence of African horse sickness and equine encephalosis in selected horse and donkey populations in Zimbabwe
T2  - ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel herds and samples submitted by private equine practitioners were used to determine the sero-prevalence and sero-incidence of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) and equine encephalosis virus (EEV) in horse and donkey populations in the Highveld region of Zimbabwe. The sero-prevalence and sero-incidence of antibodies against these viruses were determined using the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of serum antibodies. In donkeys, the median sero-prevalence of AHSV antibodies, across the three rainy seasons under study, was 75% (inter quartile range [IQR] 67-83), with a seasonal median sero-incidence of 45% (IQR 40-63). In horses, the median sero-prevalence of EEV antibodies was 63% (IQR 21-73), with a median seasonal sero-incidence of 10.5% (IQR 10-14), while in donkeys the median sero-prevalence of EEV antibodies was 80% (IQR 67-90), with a median seasonal sero-incidence of 50% (IQR 40-60). This study highlighted the significant levels of exposure of donkeys to AHSV and horses and donkeys to EEV in Zimbabwe despite equine encephalosis remaining unreported by Zimbabwean veterinarians to date. Most seroconversions in sentinel herd animals to AHSV and EEV occurred towards the end of the rainy season in March, April and May corresponding to the time of the year when the Culicoides vectors are in high abundance. In order to determine the clinical significance of these infections, blood and spleen samples, submitted by private equine veterinary practitioners over a 5-year period, from horses showing characteristic clinical signs of African horse sickness were tested for the presence of viral antigen using the antigen capture ELISA. The median sero-prevalence of AHSV antigen in horses recorded from these samples was 38% (IQR 33-88). The predominant AHSV antigen from these samples was serotype 7 (33%) followed by serotype 2 (26%) and serotypes 4 and 8 (16% each). African horse sickness virus serotypes 3 and 9, identified in this study, had not been previously reported in Zimbabwe.

TI  - Modelling and analyzing the water and carbon dynamics of Mediterranean macchia by the use of ground and remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the environmental changes which have occurred in the last decades. Evaluating the ecosystem response to these changes is therefore a top priority, particularly concerning water and carbon dynamics. The Pianosa Island is a well known test site where numerous environmental surveys have been performed to fully characterize the most typical vegetation type, Mediterranean macchia. A first measurement campaign concerning both vegetation and soil properties was performed in 2001, and was repeated in 2010 only for soil properties. Vegetation cover was characterized again by means of an aircraft high resolution LiDAR dataset taken in 2009. Additional medium and low spatial resolution satellite images (Landsat OLI and MODIS) and aircraft photos were recovered from various sources. The availability of these datasets offers a unique opportunity to develop and test a methodology capable of modelling and analyzing the water and carbon dynamics of Mediterranean macchia during the 2001-2010 decade. To this aim, simulation procedures integrating remotely sensed and ancillary data were first tuned towards the available observations of vegetation biomass and soil carbon content. These procedures were then applied to produce daily estimates of macchia actual evapotranspiration (AET), gross primary production (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE), whose accuracy was assessed against corresponding eddy covariance flux tower observations taken in two years (2007-2008). The results obtained are satisfactory and support the capability of the modelling approach to reproduce both the water and carbon dynamics of macchia during the study decade. From an ecological viewpoint, both fluxes are increasing in this time period, mainly depending on similarly increasing spring rainfall. The macchia ecosystem behaves as a net sink of carbon, which is stored primarily in soil (congruent to 90%) and secondarily in vegetation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Indoor residual spraying with micro-encapsulated pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic®300CS) against malaria vectors in the Lake Victoria basin, Tanzania
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe indoor residual spraying programme for malaria vectors control was implemented in four districts of the Lake Victoria basin of Tanzania namely Ukerewe, Sengerema, Rorya andSerengeti. Entomological monitoring activities were implemented in one sentinel village in each district to evaluate the efficacy of pirimiphos-methyl 300 CS sprayed on different wall surfaces and its impact against malaria vectors post-IRS intervention.MethodsThe residual decay rate of p-methyl 300 CS applied at a target dosage of 1g a.i./m(2) on the-sprayed wall surfaces was monitored for a period of 43 weeks post-IRSusing the WHO cone wall bioassay method. The bioassays were performed by exposing 2-5 days old unfed susceptible female Anopheles gambiae s.s. (Kisumu strain) to sprayed wall surfaces for a period of 30 minutes. In each sentinel village, mosquito collection was carried out by trained community mosquito collectors. Monthly mosquito collections were carried out from 6.00pm to 6.00am using CDC light traps and clay pot methods for indoors host seekingand outdoors resting mosquitoes respectively. Six traps (2 CDC light traps and 4 clay pots) were set per sentinel village per night for28 consecutive days in a moon. PCR and ELISA were used for mosquito species identification and sporozoite detection, respectively.ResultsBased on the WHOPES recommendation, insecticides should have a minimum efficacy of >= 80% mosquito mortality at 24 hours post exposure on the sprayed wall surfaces to be considered effective. In this study, p-methyl 300 CS was demonstrated to have a long residual efficacy of 21-43 weeks post-IRS on mud, cement, painted and wood wall surfaces. Number of anopheline mosquitoes decreased post-IRS interventions in all sentinel villages. The highest numbers ofanopheline mosquitoes were collected in November-December, 38-43 weeks post-IRS. A total of 270 female anopheline mosquitoes were analyzed by PCR; out of which 236 (87.4%) were An. gambiae s.l. and 34 (12.6%) were An. funestus group. Of the 236 An. gambiae s.l. identified 12.6% (n = 34) were An. gambiae s. s. and 68.6% (n = 162) were An. arabiensis. Ofthe 34 An. funestus group indentified 91.2% (n = 31) were An. parensis and 8.8% (n = 3) were An. rivulorum. The overall Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate was 0.7% (n = 2,098).ConclusionsPirimiphos-methyl 300 CS was found to be effective for IRS in the Lake Victoria basin, Tanzania. P-methyl 300 CShas a long residual efficacy on sprayed wall surfaces and therefore it is effective in controlling principal malaria vectors of An. gambiae s.l and An. funestus which rest on wall surfaces after and before feeding.

TI  - Super-resolution algorithm based on sparse representation and wavelet preprocessing for remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An effective super-resolution (SR) algorithm is proposed for actual spectral remote sensing images based on sparse representation and wavelet preprocessing. The proposed SR algorithm mainly consists of dictionary training and image reconstruction. Wavelet preprocessing is used to establish four subbands, i.e., low frequency, horizontal, vertical, and diagonal high frequency, for an input image. As compared to the traditional approaches involving the direct training of image patches, the proposed approach focuses on the training of features derived from these four subbands. The proposed algorithm is verified using different spectral remote sensing images, e.g., moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with different bands, and the latest Chinese Jilin-1 satellite images with high spatial resolution. According to the visual experimental results obtained from the MODIS remote sensing data, the SR images using the proposed SR algorithm are superior to those using a conventional bicubic interpolation algorithm or traditional SR algorithms without preprocessing. Fusion algorithms, e.g., standard intensity-hue-saturation, principal component analysis, wavelet transform, and the proposed SR algorithms are utilized to merge the multispectral and panchromatic images acquired by the Jilin-1 satellite. The effectiveness of the proposed SR algorithm is assessed by parameters such as peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, correlation coefficient, root-mean-square error, relative dimensionless global error in synthesis, relative average spectral error, spectral angle mapper, and the quality index Q4, and its performance is better than that of the standard image fusion algorithms.

TI  - Monitoring the impact of fugitive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on wheat growth in CCS-EOR areas using satellite and field data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In-situ monitoring of the environmental impact is essential for the verification of clean operation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. We conducted an empirical study based on remotely sensed data and field observations from an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) site in China. Geostatistical analysis and general linear model regression were performed to detect the impact of fugitive CO2 emission from oil buffer tanks. Results show that the emitted CO2 resulted in CO2 enrichment about 25-100 m away from the buffer tanks. The spatial pattern and semivariogram parameters of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) in the CCS core operating area had not been altered significantly. The CO2 concentration is not a statistically significant explanatory factor for the variation of wheat growth in the present CCS-EOR site that located in Gaoqing County in the east of China. The impact of fugitive CO2 emission on wheat growth appears limited because of the instability and rapid diffusion of emitted CO2. However, we emphasize that these results were extracted from the in-situ monitoring that characterized by macro level and short term. Long-term biology-based study at a micro-level is imperative for further understanding and determining the environmental impact of fugitive CO2 emission. Moreover, considering the incidental CO2 breakthrough and the unknown impact of emitted gas, including CO2 and hydrocarbons, on the quality of wheat plant and grain, long-time field monitoring, and improvement of production equipment and technique are essential to ensure the clean production of CCS-EOR.

TI  - Satellite-derived methane hotspot emission estimates using a fast data-driven method
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane is an important atmospheric greenhouse gas and an adequate understanding of its emission sources is needed for climate change assessments, predictions, and the development and verification of emission mitigation strategies. Satellite retrievals of near-surface-sensitive column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of atmospheric methane, i.e. X CH4, can be used to quantify methane emissions. Maps of time-averaged satellite-derived X CH4 show regionally elevated methane over several methane source regions. In order to obtain methane emissions of these source regions we use a simple and fast data-driven method to estimate annual methane emissions and corresponding 1 sigma uncertainties directly from maps of annually averaged satellite X CH4. From theoretical considerations we expect that our method tends to underestimate emissions. When applying our method to high-resolution atmospheric methane simulations, we typically find agreement within the uncertainty range of our method (often 100 %) but also find that our method tends to underestimate emissions by typically about 40 %. To what extent these findings are model dependent needs to be assessed. We apply our method to an ensemble of satellite X CH4 data products consisting of two products from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and two products from TANSO-FTS/GOSAT covering the time period 2003-2014. We obtain annual emissions of four source areas: Four Corners in the south-western USA, the southern part of Central Valley, California, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. We find that our estimated emissions are in good agreement with independently derived estimates for Four Corners and Azerbaijan. For the Central Valley and Turkmenistan our estimated annual emissions are higher compared to the EDGAR v4.2 anthropogenic emission inventory. For Turkmenistan we find on average about 50% higher emissions with our annual emission uncertainty estimates overlapping with the EDGAR emissions. For the region around Bakersfield in the Central Valley we find a factor of 5-8 higher emissions compared to EDGAR, albeit with large uncertainty. Major methane emission sources in this region are oil/gas and livestock. Our findings corroborate recently published studies based on aircraft and satellite measurements and new bottom-up estimates reporting significantly underestimated methane emissions of oil/gas and/or livestock in this area in EDGAR.

TI  - The spatial distribution and temporal variation of desert riparian forests and their influencing factors in the downstream Heihe River basin, China
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert riparian forests are the main restored vegetation community in Heihe River basin. They provide critical habitats and a variety of ecosystem services in this arid environment. Since desert riparian forests are also sensitive to disturbance, examining the spatial distribution and temporal variation of these forests and their influencing factors is important to determine the limiting factors of vegetation recovery after long-term restoration. In this study, field experiment and remote sensing data were used to determine the spatial distribution and temporal variation of desert riparian forests and their relationship with the environmental factors. We classified five types of vegetation communities at different distances from the river channel. Community coverage and diversity formed a bimodal pattern, peaking at the distances of 1000 and 3000 m from the river channel. In general, the temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) trend from 2000 to 2014 was positive at different distances from the river channel, except for the region closest to the river bank (i.e. within 500m from the river channel), which had been undergoing degradation since 2011. The spatial distribution of desert riparian forests was mainly influenced by the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties (e.g. soil moisture, bulk density and soil particle composition). Meanwhile, while the temporal variation of vegetation was affected by both the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties (e.g. soil moisture and soil particle composition) and to a lesser extent, the temporal variation of water availability (e.g. annual average and variability of groundwater, soil moisture and runoff). Since surface (0-30 cm) and deep (100-200 cm) soil moisture, bulk density and the annual average of soil moisture at 100 cm obtained from the remote sensing data were regarded as major determining factors of community distribution and temporal variation, conservation measures that protect the soil structure and prevent soil moisture depletion (e.g. artificial soil cover and water conveyance channels) were suggested to better protect desert riparian forests under climate change and intensive human disturbance.

TI  - Constraining the instantaneous aerosol influence on cloud albedo
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the uncertainty in estimates of the anthropogenic forcing of climate change comes from uncertainties in the instantaneous effect of aerosols on cloud albedo, known as the Twomey effect or the radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (RFaci), a component of the total or effective radiative forcing. Because aerosols serving as cloud condensation nuclei can have a strong influence on the cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), previous studies have used the sensitivity of the Nd to aerosol properties as a constraint on the strength of the RFaci. However, recent studies have suggested that relationships between aerosol and cloud properties in the present-day climate may not be suitable for determining the sensitivity of the Nd to anthropogenic aerosol perturbations. Using an ensemble of global aerosol-climate models, this study demonstrates how joint histograms between Nd and aerosol properties can account for many of the issues raised by previous studies. It shows that if the anthropogenic contribution to the aerosol is known, the RFaci can be diagnosed to within 20% of its actual value. The accuracy of different aerosol proxies for diagnosing the RFaci is investigated, confirming that using the aerosol optical depth significantly underestimates the strength of the aerosol-cloud interactions in satellite data.

TI  - Coseismic displacements of the 14 November 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.8 Kaikoura, New Zealand, earthquake using the Planet optical cubesat constellation
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite measurements of coseismic displacements are typically based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry or amplitude tracking, or based on optical data such as from Landsat, Sentinel-2, SPOT, ASTER, very high-resolution satellites, or air photos. Here, we evaluate a new class of optical satellite images for this purpose data from cubesats. More specific, we investigate the Planet-Scope cubesat constellation for horizontal surface displacements by the 14 November 2016 M-w 7.8 Kaikoura, New Zealand, earthquake. Single PlanetScope scenes are 2-4 m-resolution visible and near-infrared frame images of approximately 20-30 km x 9-15 km in size, acquired in continuous sequence along an orbit of approximately 375-475 km height. From single scenes or mosaics from before and after the earthquake, we observe surface displacements of up to almost 10 m and estimate matching accuracies from PlanetScope data between +/- 0.25 and +/- 0.7 pixels (similar to +/- 0.75 to +/- 2.0 m), depending on time interval and image product type. Thereby, the most optimistic accuracy estimate of +/- 0.25 pixels might actually be typical for the final, sun-synchronous, and near-polar-orbit PlanetScope constellation when unrectified data are used for matching. This accuracy, the daily revisit anticipated for the PlanetScope constellation for the entire land surface of Earth, and a number of other features, together offer new possibilities for investigating coseismic and other Earth surface displacements and managing related hazards and disasters, and complement existing SAR and optical methods. For comparison and for a better regional overview we also match the coseismic displacements by the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Sand Dune Encroachment and Desertification Processes of the Rigboland Sand Sea, Central Iran
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Early studies on sand dune movement and desertification in Iran have not always been convincingly demonstrated because of problems with the field-based measurements. In some areas where various land uses have been engulfed by aeolian sand dunes, desertification is clear, but in other less settled areas, it may not be so obvious. The objective of this study is to demonstrate encroachments of the Rigboland sand sea, central Iran, in its different directions and variable magnitude rates. Determining the rate and direction of the sand sea movements is critical for specifying which lands should be prioritized and quickly protected. The study has trialed a change detection technique which uses a Cross-Tabulation module to compare two available Landsat (TM) images over the Rigboland sand sea. This indicates that within a ten-year span (from 1988 to 1998) more than 200 ha/yr were added to the Rigboland sand sea, from the alluvial fan landforms in the eastern upstream, outer margins of the Rigboland sand sea. Coupled with GIS techniques, this type of analysis of the remote sensing (RS) images provides an effective tool for the monitoring and prognostication of sand dune movement and sand sea change.

TI  - Topographic mapping on large-scale tidal flats with an iterative approach on the waterline method
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats, which are both a natural ecosystem and a type of landscape, are of significant importance to ecosystem function and land resource potential. Morphologic monitoring of tidal flats has become increasingly important with respect to achieving sustainable development targets. Remote sensing is an established technique for the measurement of topography over tidal flats; of the available methods, the waterline method is particularly effective for constructing a digital elevation model (DEM) of intertidal areas. However, application of the waterline method is more limited in large-scale, shifting tidal flats areas, where the tides are not synchronized and the waterline is not a quasi-contour line. For this study, a topographical map of the intertidal regions within the Radial Sand Ridges (RSR) along the Jiangsu Coast, China, was generated using an iterative approach on the waterline method. A series of 21 multi-temporal satellite images (18 HJ-1A/B CCD and three Landsat TM/OLI) of the RSR area collected at different water levels within a five month period (31 December 2013-28 May 2014) was used to extract waterlines based on feature extraction techniques and artificial further modification. These 'remotely-sensed waterlines' were combined with the corresponding water levels from the 'model waterlines' simulated by a hydrodynamic model with an initial generalized DEM of exposed tidal flats. Based on the 21 heighted 'remotely-sensed waterlines', a DEM was constructed using the ANUDEM interpolation method. Using this new DEM as the input data, it was re-entered into the hydrodynamic model, and a new round of water level assignment of waterlines was performed. A third and final output DEM was generated covering an area of approximately 1900 km(2) of tidal flats in the RSR. The water level simulation accuracy of the hydrodynamic model was within 0.15 m based on five real-time tide stations, and the height accuracy (root mean square error) of the final DEM was 0.182 m based on six transects of measured data. This study aimed at construction of an accurate DEM for a large-scale, high-variable zone within a short timespan based on an iterative way of the waterline method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Urbanization Alters the Influence of Weather and an Index of Forest Productivity on Avian Community Richness and Guild Abundance in the Seattle Metropolitan Area
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluctuations in weather and forest productivity influence the abundance and richness of bird populations, however in a rapidly urbanizing landscape the relative importance of each factor may vary. We assessed this possibility in the Seattle, WA, USA region by correlating 10 years of bird richness and relative abundance of nine guilds indicative of their tolerance of human development, migration, diet and use of human food subsidies with an annual index of forest productivity (vegetation greenness derived from a 250m resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product from the MODIS satellite) and weather (variation in the Oceanic Nino Index, which estimates the strength of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, a major driver of local temperature and precipitation). We found that variation in NDVI exerted a strong influence on the richness of the avian community and the abundance of guilds in landscapes undergoing active development, but was less influential in areas of established housing development or forested reserves. Relative to NDVI, weather was much less influential on the abundance of guilds at actively changing sites, and slightly more influential in forest reserves and established developments. Following the warm winter and during the dry summer associated with a strong El Nino, migrants and herbivores declined in changing landscapes, insectivores declined in established developments, and herbivores declined while synanthropic species increased in reserves. These changes may presage the effects of climate change in the Pacific Northwest, which are expected to be similar to El Nino conditions. To buffer these changes in native bird communities, planners, developers, regulators, and home owners shouldminimize the loss of vegetation during development and attempt to quickly achieve mature landscaping that preferably provides food and shelter for birds.

TI  - Simultaneous detection of chikungunya virus, dengue virus and human pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i> genomes using a multiplex TaqMan<SUP>®</SUP> assay
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2005-2006 a major epidemics of Chikungunya disease occurred in South-West Indian Ocean islands. In Reunion Island, the magnitude of Chikungunya infection related symptoms was high and with over 38% of serological prevalence in the population. This epidemics illustrated the potential threat of emerging arboviral diseases for inhabitants of Reunion Island and elsewhere since vectors are worldwide distributed. A sentinel surveillance network was set-up to detect emerging pathogens associated with fever over 38 degrees C and in the absence of known etiologic causes. Leptospirosis is caused by a pathogenic spirochete of the Leptospira genus and is an endemic and recurrent seasonal disease of great concern in Reunion Island. To accurately diagnose potentially infected patients and to advise Health authorities on the presence of emerging pathogens, a rapid diagnostic test was needed that could differentiate between these 3 pathogens.Methods: A one-step multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed that can simultaneously detect RNA of Chikungunya and Dengue viruses and leptospiral DNA with good performance for a routine diagnostic use.Results: Simplex protocols already published were used with key modifications to implement a triplex assay which was set-up with a small reaction volume to improve cost efficiency.Conclusions: This approach has enabled greater diagnostic capacity in our laboratory. We established a multiplex approach validated and valuable for cost savings, and with the concurrent detection of 3 pathogens of public health concern.

TI  - Analysis of aerosol effects on warm clouds over the Yangtze River Delta from multi-sensor satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol effects on low warm clouds over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD, eastern China) are examined using co-located MODIS, CALIOP and CloudSat observations. By taking the vertical locations of aerosol and cloud layers into account, we use simultaneously observed aerosol and cloud data to investigate relationships between cloud properties and the amount of aerosol particles (using aerosol optical depth, AOD, as a proxy). Also, we investigate the impact of aerosol types on the variation of cloud properties with AOD. Finally, we explore how meteorological conditions affect these relationships using ERA-Interim reanalysis data. This study shows that the relation between cloud properties and AOD depends on the aerosol abundance, with a different behaviour for low and high AOD (i.e. AOD<0.35 and AOD>0.35). This applies to cloud droplet effective radius (CDR) and cloud fraction (CF), but not to cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud top pressure (CTP). COT is found to decrease when AOD increases, which may be due to radiative effects and retrieval artefacts caused by absorbing aerosol. Conversely, CTP tends to increase with elevated AOD, indicating that the aerosol is not always prone to expand the vertical extension. It also shows that the COT-CDR and CWP (cloud liquid water path)-CDR relationships are not unique, but affected by atmospheric aerosol loading. Furthermore, separation of cases with either polluted dust or smoke aerosol shows that aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) is stronger for clouds mixed with smoke aerosol than for clouds mixed with dust, which is ascribed to the higher absorption efficiency of smoke than dust. The variation of cloud properties with AOD is analysed for various relative humidity and boundary layer thermodynamic and dynamic conditions, showing that high relative humidity favours larger cloud droplet particles and increases cloud formation, irrespective of vertical or horizontal level. Stable atmospheric conditions enhance cloud cover horizontally. However, unstable atmospheric conditions favour thicker and higher clouds. Dynamically, upward motion of air parcels can also facilitate the formation of thicker and higher clouds. Overall, the present study provides an understanding of the impact of aerosols on cloud properties over the YRD. In addition to the amount of aerosol particles (or AOD), evidence is provided that aerosol types and ambient environmental conditions need to be considered to understand the observed relationships between cloud properties and AOD.

TI  - Targeting mannose receptor expression on macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques of apolipoprotein E-knockout mice using <SUP>111</SUP>In-tilmanocept
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Atherosclerotic plaque phenotypes are classified based on the extent of macrophage infiltration into the lesions, and the presence of certain macrophage subsets might be a sign for plaque vulnerability. The mannose receptor (MR) is over-expressed in activated macrophages. Tilmanocept is a tracer that targets MR and is approved in Europe and the USA for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the potential of In-111-labelled tilmanocept for the detection of MR-positive macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques of apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-KO) mouse model.Methods: Tilmanocept was labelled with In-111. The labelling stability and biodistribution of the tracer was first evaluated in control mice (n = 10) 1 h post injection (p.i.). For in vivo imaging studies, In-111-tilmanocept was injected into ApoE-KO (n = 8) and control (n = 8) mice intravenously (i.v.). The mice were scanned 90 min p.i. using a dedicated animal SPECT/CT. For testing the specificity of 111In-tilmanocept uptake in plaques, a group of ApoE-KO mice was co-injected with excess amount of non-labelled tilmanocept. For ex vivo imaging studies, the whole aortas (n = 9 from ApoE-KO and n = 4 from control mice) were harvested free from adventitial tissue for Sudan IV staining and autoradiography. Cryosections were prepared for immunohistochemistry (IHC).Results: In-111 radiolabelling of tilmanocept provided a yield of greater than 99%. After i.v. injection, In-111-tilmanocept accumulated in vivo in MR-expressing organs (i.e. liver and spleen) and showed only low residual blood signal 1 h p.i. MR-binding specificity in receptor-positive organs was demonstrated by a 1.5-to 3-fold reduced uptake of In-111-tilmanocept after co-injection of a blocking dose of non-labelled tilmanocept. Focal signal was detected in atherosclerotic plaques of ApoE-KO mice, whereas no signal was detected in the aortas of control mice. In-111-tilmanocept uptake was detected in atherosclerotic plaques on autoradiography correlating well with Sudan IV-positive areas and associating with subendothelial accumulations of MR-positive macrophages as demonstrated by IHC.Conclusions: After i.v. injection, In-111-tilmanocept accumulated in MR-expressing organs and was associated with only low residual blood signal. In addition, In-111-tilmanocept uptake was detected in atherosclerotic plaques of mice containing MR-expressing macrophages suggesting that tilmanocept represents a promising tracer for the non-invasive detection of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques.

TI  - Remote sensing-based measurement of Living Environment Deprivation: Improving classical approaches with machine learning
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides evidence on the usefulness of very high spatial resolution (VHR) imagery in gathering socioeconomic information in urban settlements. We use land cover, spectral, structure and texture features extracted from a Google Earth image of Liverpool (UK) to evaluate their potential to predict Living Environment Deprivation at a small statistical area level. We also contribute to the methodological literature on the estimation of socioeconomic indices with remote-sensing data by introducing elements from modern machine learning. In addition to classical approaches such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and a spatial lag model, we explore the potential of the Gradient Boost Regressor and Random Forests to improve predictive performance and accuracy. In addition to novel predicting methods, we also introduce tools for model interpretation and evaluation such as feature importance and partial dependence plots, or cross-validation. Our results show that Random Forest proved to be the best model with an R-2 of around 0.54, followed by Gradient Boost Regressor with 0.5. Both the spatial lag model and the OLS fall behind with significantly lower performances of 0.43 and 0.3, respectively.

TI  - Title, Rituals, and Land Use: The Heritage of a Nigerian Society
T2  - SAGE OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the Igbo of Southeastern Nigeria, land is regarded as the source of human sustenance and the eternal sacred pot from where all plants and humans draw their powers of fertility and reproduction. The Igbo venerate land as an earth goddess. As a predominantly agrarian society, they not only deify land by instituting shrines in its honor, they also take titles that regulate ownership and use of land. This study examines the interface between title-taking, African indigenous religious rituals, and land use practices among the Nsukka Igbo of Southeastern Nigeria. In the study area, there is no taxonomical distinction between land and the earth goddess, and titles relating to land are laden with rituals whose meaning needs to be investigated. As a study in the axiology of the people, the study adopted participant observations and field investigations. It combines its findings with views in extant literature on Igbo worldview on land and land ownership and sifts the difference between the Nsukka Igbo and other Igbo people. The research is anchored on the theory of cultural peculiarity. This line of thought, it is hoped, would clarify some of the gray and contentious issues about rituals and inheritance in the study area. Such clarification would help reduce the tension between those who take such titles and those, for reasons of cultural barriers, do not have the right to do so.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to assess the ass(o)ciation of long-term residential exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) with the incidence of stroke and its major subtypes.Methods: We ascertained the first occurrence of emergency hospital admission for stroke in a Hong Kong Chinese cohort of 66,820 older people (65+ years) who enrolled during 1998-2001 (baseline) and were followed up to December 31, 2010. High-resolution (1 x 1 km) yearly mean concentrations of PM2.5 were predicted from local monitoring data and US National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite data using linear regression. Baseline residential PM2.5 exposure was used as a proxy for long-term exposure. We used Cox proportional hazards to evaluate the risk of incident stroke associated with PM2.5 exposure adjusted for potential confounders, including individual and neighborhood factors.Results: Over a mean follow-up of 9.4 years, we ascertained 6,733 cases of incident stroke, of which 3,526 (52.4%) were ischemic and 1,175 (17.5%) were hemorrhagic. The hazard ratio for every 10 mu g/m(3) higher PM2.5 concentration was statistically significant at 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.41) for ischemic and non-statistically significant at 0.90 (95% CI 0.70-1.17) for hemorrhagic stroke in fully adjusted model 3. The estimates for ischemic stroke were higher in older participants (> 70 years), less educated participants, and in men for current smokers.Conclusion: Long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with higher risk of incident ischemic stroke, but the association with incident hemorrhagic stroke was less clear.

TI  - Extracting distribution and expansion of rubber plantations from Landsat imagery using the C5.0 decision tree method
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural tropical rainforests in China's Xishuangbanna region have undergone dramatic conversion to rubber plantations in recent decades, resulting in altering the region's environment and ecological systems. Therefore, it is of great importance for local environmental and ecological protection agencies to research the distribution and expansion of rubber plantations. The objective of this paper is to monitor dynamic changes of rubber plantations in China's Xishuangbanna region based on multitemporal Landsat images ( acquired in 1989, 2000, and 2013) using a C5.0-based decision-tree method. A practical and semiautomatic data processing procedure for mapping rubber plantations was proposed. Especially, haze removal and desha-dowing were proposed to perform atmospheric and topographic correction and reduce the effects of haze, shadow, and terrain. Our results showed that the atmospheric and topographic correction could improve the extraction accuracy of rubber plantations, especially in mountainous areas. The overall classification accuracies were 84.2%, 83.9%, and 86.5% for the Landsat images acquired in 1989, 2000, and 2013, respectively. This study also found that the Landsat-8 images could provide significant improvement in the ability to identify rubber plantations. The extracted maps showed the selected study area underwent rapid conversion of natural and seminatural forest to a rubber plantations from 1989 to 2013. The rubber plantation area increased from 2.8% in 1989 to 17.8% in 2013, while the forest/woodland area decreased from 75.6% in 1989 to 44.8% in 2013. The proposed data processing procedure is a promising approach to mapping the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of rubber plantations on a regional scale. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Forest cover mapping in post-Soviet Central Asia using multi-resolution remote sensing imagery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite rapid advances and large-scale initiatives in forest mapping, reliable cross-border information about the status of forest resources in Central Asian countries is lacking. We produced consistent Central Asia forest cover (CAFC) maps based on a cost-efficient approach using multi-resolution satellite imagery from Landsat and MODIS during 2009-2011. The spectral-temporal metrics derived from 2009-2011 Landsat imagery (overall accuracy of 0.83) was used to predict sub-pixel forest cover on the MODIS scale for 2010. Accuracy assessment confirmed the validity of MODIS-based forest cover map with a normalized root-mean-square error of 0.63. A general paucity of forest resources in post-Soviet Central Asia was indicated, with 1.24% of the region covered by forest. In comparison to the CAFC map, a regional map derived from MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields tended to underestimate forest cover, while the Global Forest Change product matched well. The Global Forest Resources Assessments, based on individual country reports, overestimated forest cover by 1.5 to 147 times, particularly in the more arid countries of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Multi-resolution imagery contributes to regionalized assessment of forest cover in the world's drylands while developed CAFC maps (available at https://data.zef.de/) aim to facilitate decisions on biodiversity conservation and reforestation programs in Central Asia.

TI  - An unsupervised two-stage clustering approach for forest structure classification based on X-band InSAR data - A case study in complex temperate forest stands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest structure at stand level plays a key role for sustainable forest management, since the biodiversity, productivity, growth and stability of the forest can be positively influenced by managing its structural diversity. In contrast to field-based measurements, remote sensing techniques offer a cost-efficient opportunity to collect area-wide information about forest stand structure with high spatial and temporal resolution. Especially Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which facilitates worldwide acquisition of 3d information independent from weather conditions and illumination, is convenient to capture forest stand structure. This study purposes an unsupervised two-stage clustering approach for forest structure classification based on height information derived from interferometric X-band SAR data which was performed in complex temperate forest stands of Traunstein forest (South Germany). In particular, a four dimensional input data set composed of first-order height statistics was non-linearly projected on a two-dimensional Self-Organizing Map, spatially ordered according to similarity (based on the Euclidean-distance) in the first stage and classified using the k-means algorithm in the second stage. The study demonstrated that X-band InSAR data exhibits considerable capabilities for forest structure classification. Moreover, the unsupervised classification approach achieved meaningful and reasonable results by means of comparison to aerial imagery and LiDAR data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mesoscale Modeling of the Meteorological Impacts of Irrigation during the 2012 Central Plains Drought
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the summer of 2012, the central plains of the United States experienced one of its most severe droughts on record. This study examines the meteorological impacts of irrigation during this drought through observations and model simulations using the Community Land Model coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. A simple parameterization of irrigation processes is added into the WRF Model. In addition to keeping soil moisture in irrigated areas at a minimum of 50% of soil moisture hold capacity, this irrigation scheme has the following new features: 1) accurate representation of the spatial distribution of irrigation area in the study domain by using a MODIS-based land surface classification with 250-m pixel size and 2) improved representation of the time series of leaf area index (LAI) values derived from crop modeling and satellite observations in both irrigated and nonirrigated areas. Several numerical sensitivity experiments are conducted. The WRF-simulated temperature field when including soil moisture and LAI modification within the model is shown to be most consistent with ground and satellite observations, all indicating a temperature decrease of 2-3K in irrigated areas relative to the control run. Modification of LAI in irrigated and dryland areas led to smaller changes, with a 0.2-K temperature decrease in irrigated areas and up to a 0.5-K temperature increase in dryland areas. Furthermore, the increased soil moisture and modified LAI are shown to lead to statistically significant increases in surface divergence and surface pressure and to decreases in planetary boundary layer height over irrigated areas.

TI  - A Global Dynamic Long-Term Inundation Extent Dataset at High Spatial Resolution Derived through Downscaling of Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new procedure is introduced to downscale low-spatial-resolution inundation extents from Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) to a 3-arc-s (90 m) dataset (known as GIEMS-D3). The methodology is based on topography and hydrography information from the HydroSHEDS database. A new floodability index is introduced and an innovative smoothing procedure is developed to ensure a smooth transition, in the high-resolution maps, between the low-resolution boxes from GIEMS. Topography information is pertinent for natural hydrology environments controlled by elevation but is more limited in human-modified basins. However, the proposed downscaling approach is compatible with forthcoming fusion of other, more pertinent satellite information in these difficult regions. The resulting GIEMS-D3 database is the only high-spatial-resolution inundation database available globally at a monthly time scale over the 1993-2007 period. GIEMS-D3 is assessed by analyzing its spatial and temporal variability and evaluated by comparisons to other independent satellite observations from visible (Google Earth and Landsat), infrared (MODIS), and active microwave (synthetic aperture radar).

TI  - Ultra-early angiographic vasospasm associated with delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE The clinical significance of cerebral ultra-early angiographic vasospasm (UEAV), defined as cerebral arterial narrowing within the first 48 hours of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), remains poorly characterized. The authors sought to determine its frequency, predictors, and impact on functional outcome.METHODS The authors prospectively studied UEAV in a cohort of 1286 consecutively admitted patients with aSAH between August 1996 and June 2013. Admission clinical, radiographic, and acute clinical course information was documented during patient hospitalization. Functional outcome was assessed at 3 months using the modified Rankin Scale. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were generated to assess predictors of UEAV and its relationship to delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and outcome. Multiple imputation methods were used to address data lost to follow-up.RESULTS The cohort incidence rate of UEAV was 4.6%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that younger age, sentinel bleed, and poor admission clinical grade were significantly associated with UEAV. Patients with UEAV had a 2-fold increased risk of DCI (odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-3.9, p = 0.002) and cerebral infarction (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.9, p = 0.04), after adjusting for known predictors. Excluding patients who experienced sentinel bleeding did not change this effect. Patients with UEAV also had a significantly higher hazard for DCI in a multivariable model. UEAV was not found to be significantly associated with poor functional outcome (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.4-1.6, p = 0.5).CONCLUSIONS UEAV may be less frequent than has been reported previously. Patients who exhibit UEAV are at higher risk for refractory DCI that results in cerebral infarction. These patients may benefit from earlier monitoring for signs of DCI and more aggressive treatment. Further study is needed to determine the long-term functional significance of UEAV.

TI  - Seasonal Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) Variability Using Satellite Data and its Comparison over Saudi Arabia for the Period 2002-2013
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variations of seasonal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) AOD at 550 nm from the Aqua satellite over Saudi Arabia for the period 2002-2013. Satellite retrieved AOD is also compared with AERONET AOD over the Solar Village and KAUST station. The result of the seasonal AOD spatial distribution shows that the peak AOD value of 0.6 is observed over Hafr Al Batin, Riyadh, and the Rub Al Khali desert during spring, whereas the Gizan area shows the peak AOD during summer. In contrast, the autumn shows the peak AOD value of 0.5 over Dhahran and in the proximity of Jeddah, whereas Hafr Al Batin, Al Khafji, Al Jubail, and the Rub Al Khali desert show the peak AOD value of 0.4 in winter. Regression analysis shows the AOD increasing trends during spring, summer, and autumn (except for winter) over the entire Saudi Arabia. Over the Solar Village, the AOD increasing trends are also noted during spring and summer, whereas autumn and winter display the AOD decreasing trends. The AOD increasing trends are displayed in all seasons over KAUST. Hence, the AOD increasing/decreasing trends indicate that the number of dust storms either increases or decreases over these regions. Over the Solar Village, the correlation values for MODIS DB AOD versus AERONET AOD are 0.77 (spring), 0.62 (summer), 0.65 (autumn), and 0.75 (winter). Likewise, over KAUST, the correlation values for the same pairing are 0.85 (spring), 0.71 (summer), 0.81 (autumn), and 0.89 (winter). The incorrect aerosol model selection and imperfect surface reflectance calculation are responsible for reducing the correlation. Therefore, this study recommends that the DB algorithm can be used effectively to detect AOD over Saudi Arabia, which will further help to improve the MODIS DB AOD product utilizing the next version of the algorithm.

TI  - An application of principal component analysis to the interpretation of ionospheric current systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ionospheric currents are driven by several different physical processes and exhibit complex spatial and temporal structure. Magnetic field measurements of ionospheric sources are often spatially sparse, causing significant challenges in visualizing current flow at a specific time. Standard methods of fitting equivalent current models to magnetic observations, such as line currents, spherical harmonic analysis, spherical cap harmonic analysis, and spherical elementary current systems (SECS), are often unable to capture the full spatial complexity of the currents or require a large number of parameters which cannot be fully determined by the available data coverage. These methods rely on a set of generic basis functions which contain limited information about the geometries of the various ionospheric sources. In this study, we develop new basis functions for fitting ground and satellite measurements, which are derived from physics-based ionospheric modeling combined with principal component analysis (PCA). The physics-based modeling provides realistic current flow patterns for all of the primary ionospheric sources, including their daily and seasonal variability. The PCA technique extracts the most relevant spatial geometries of the currents from the model run into a small set of equivalent current modes. We fit these modes to magnetic measurements of the Swarm satellite mission at low and middle latitudes and compare the resulting model with independent measurements and with the SECS approach. We find that our PCA method accurately reproduces features of the equatorial electrojet and Sq current systems with only 10 modes and can predict ionospheric fields far from the data region.

TI  - Ontology-based classification of remote sensing images using spectral rules
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation data is of great interest for a wide spectrum of scientific domain applications. An enhanced access to remote sensing images for "domain" experts thus represents a great advance since it allows users to interpret remote sensing images based on their domain expert knowledge. However, such an advantage can also turn into a major limitation if this knowledge is not formalized, and thus is difficult for it to be shared with and understood by other users. In this context, knowledge representation techniques such as ontologies should play a major role in the future of remote sensing applications. We implemented an ontology-based prototype to automatically classify Landsat images based on explicit spectral rules. The ontology is designed in a very modular way in order to achieve a generic and versatile representation of concepts we think of utmost importance in remote sensing. The prototype was tested on four subsets of Landsat images and the results confirmed the potential of ontologies to formalize expert knowledge and classify remote sensing images.

TI  - It's time to redefine inflammation
T2  - FASEB JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Inflammation has been defined formany years as the response to tissue injury and infection. We are now forced to reconsider this definition by the avalanche of reports that molecules and cells associated with inflammation are activated or expressed in high concentration in a large variety of states in the absence of tissue injury or infection. Modest increases in concentration of C-reactive protein, a circulating marker of inflammation, have been reported to be associated with an astounding number of conditions and lifestyles felt to be associated with poor health; these conditions represent or reflect minor metabolic stresses. In recent years we have learned that inflammation is triggered by sentinel cells that monitor for tissue stress and malfunction-deviations from optimal homeostasis-and that molecules that participate in the inflammatory process play a role in restoring normal homeostasis. Accordingly, we suggest that inflammation be redefined as the innate immune response to potentially harmful stimuli such as pathogens, injury, and metabolic stress.-Antonelli, M., Kushner, I. It's time to redefine inflammation.

TI  - Catalytic pyrolysis of straw biomasses (wheat, flax, oat and barley) and the comparison of their product yields
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the pyrolysis of several Canadian straw biomasses was studied using a thermogravimetric analyzer and a bench-scale horizontal fixed-bed reactor, in order to better understand the devolatilization process and to obtain information about the product yields of these biomasses. The straw biomasses were converted through pyrolysis performed in a fixed-bed reactor at temperatures of 500 degrees C to study the influence of the feedstock on product yields. The effects of various catalysts on product yields are also discussed. When using zeolite catalysts, the bio-oil and bio-char yields of the straw pyrolysis were increased to 46.44% and 38.77%, respectively, while the bio-gas yield was decreased to 13.65%. The use of catalyst zeolite ZY-SS had the most significant effect on overall bio-oil and bio-char yields, increasing the bio-oil yield by about 2% and the bio-char yield by 8%. This catalyst had the most significant effect on the pyrolysis of flax straw, where the bio-oil yield was increased to 46.44%. In the pyrolysis of oat straw, the use of the catalyst consistently decreased the bio-gas yield; however, the bio-oil yield increased the most significantly (43.32%) with the use of catalyst zeolite ZY-NS. The use of zeolite ZY-NS also increased the bio-oil yield during the pyrolysis of barley straw (43.03%).

TI  - Spectral remote sensing for onshore seepage characterization: A critical overview
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - In this article, we overview the application of spectral remote sensing data collected by multi-, and hyperspectral instruments in the visible-near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and longwave infrared (LWIR) wavelengths for characterization of seepage systems as an exploration indicator of subsurface hydrocarbon (HC) accumulations. Two seepage systems namely macro-, and microseepage are recognized. A macroseepage is defined as visible indications of oil and gas on the surface and in the air detectable directly by a remote sensing approach. A microseepage is defined as invisible traces of light HCs in soils and sediments that are detectable by its secondary footprints in the strata, hence an indirect remote sensing target. Based on these broad categories, firstly, a comprehensive set of well-described and reliable remote sensing case studies available in the literature are thoroughly reviewed and then systematically assessed as regards the methodological shortcomings and scantiness in data gathering, processing, and interpretation. The work subsequently attempts to go through seminal papers published on microseepage concept and interrelated geochemical and geophysical techniques, exhumed HC reservoirs, lab-based spectroscopic analysis of petroleum and other related disciplines from a remote sensing standpoint. The aim is to enrich the discussion and highlight the still unexplored capabilities of this technique in accomplishing exploration objectives using the concept of seepage system. Aspects of seepage phenomenon in environmental pollution and uncertainties associated with their role in global warming are also underlined. This work benefits from illustrative products generated over two study areas located in the Ventura Basin, State of California, USA and the Tucano Basin, State of Bahia, Brazil known to host distinctive macro-, and microseepage systems, respectively. In conclusion, we recommend further research over a diverse range of seepage systems and advocate for a mature conceptual model for microseepage phenomenon. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of using scatterometer and altimeter data on storm surge forecasting
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data are rarely used in storm surge models because of the lack of established methodologies. Nevertheless, they can provide useful information on surface wind and sea level, which can potentially improve the forecast. In this paper satellite wind data are used to correct the bias of wind originating from a global atmospheric model, while satellite sea level data are used to improve the initial conditions of the model simulations. In a first step, the capability of global winds (biased and unbiased) to adequately force a storm surge model are assessed against that of a high resolution local wind. Then, the added value of direct assimilation of satellite altimeter data in the storm surge model is tested. Eleven storm surge events, recorded in Venice from 2008 to 2012, are simulated using different configurations of wind forcing and altimeter data assimilation. Focusing on the maximum surge peak, results show that the relative error, averaged over the eleven cases considered, decreases from 13% to 7%, using both the unbiased wind and assimilating the altimeter data, while, if the high resolution local wind is used to force the hydrodynamic model, the altimeter data assimilation reduces the error from 9% to 6%. Yet, the overall capabilities in reproducing the surge in the first day of forecast, measured by the correlation and by the rms error, improve only with the use of the unbiased global wind and not with the use of high resolution local wind and altimeter data assimilation.

TI  - A 2-yr Mosquito Survey Focusing on Aedes koreicus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Northern Italy and Implications for Adult Trapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes koreicus (Edwards) is an invasive mosquito species, like Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald), that has already colonized a large part of northeastern Italy and other European countries. Despite its rapid expansion, information about adult distribution and trapping is lacking. Here, we conducted a 2-yr longitudinal survey using adult traps to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of Ae. koreicus and evaluated the effectiveness of three trapping devices in Latin square experiments conducted in an urban site and a forested site. The following three different traps were compared: a CO2-baited Biogents (BG) Sentinel trap, a CO2-baited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light trap (CDC trap), and a grass infusion-baited gravid trap.In northern Italy, Ae. koreicus was collected from late April to early November, with peak of abundance observed in August. Aedes koreicus was more abundant in 2015 than in 2014 because of higher temperatures during summer. Unlike Ae. albopictus, the abundance of Ae. koreicus was not related to the altitude of the sampling locations in the range 241-660 m above sea level. The BG Sentinel and gravid traps collected significantly more Ae. koreicus than the CDC trap in the urban site, whereas there was no significant difference between the three traps in the forested site. In the urban site, the BG Sentinel trap and the gravid trap were the most effective for collecting Ae. albopictus and Culex pipiens L., respectively. In the forested site, Cx. pipiens was primarily collected by the CDC trap.

TI  - Design space for space design: Dialogs through boundary objects at the intersections of art, design, science, and engineering
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - For over half a century space exploration has been dominated by engineering and technology driven practices. This paradigm leaves limited room for art and design. Yet in other parts of our lives, art and design play important roles: they stimulate new ideas and connect people to their experiences and to each other at a deeper level, while affecting our worldview as we evolve our cognitive models. We develop these models through circular. conversations with our environment, through perception and making sense through our sensory systems and responding back through language and interactions. Artists and designers create artifacts through conversation cycles of sense-giving and sense-making, thus increasing variety in the world in the form of evolving messages. Each message becomes information when the observer decodes it, through multiple sense making and re-sampling cycles. The messages form triggers to the cognitive state of the observer. Having a shared key between the artist/designer and the observer-for example, in the form of language, gestures, and artistic/design styles-is fundamental to encode and decode the information, in conversations. Art, design, science, and engineering, are all creative practices. Yet, they often speak different languages, where some parts may correspond, while others address a different variety in a cybernetic sense. These specialized languages within disciplines streamline communications, but limit variety. Thus, different languages between disciplines may introduce communication blocks. Nevertheless, these differences are desired as they add variety to the interactions, and could lead to novel discourses and possibilities. We may dissolve communication blocks through the introduction of boundary objects in the intersection of multiple disciplines. Boundary objects can ground ideas and bridge language diversity across disciplines. These artifacts are created to facilitate circular cybernetic conversations, supporting convergence towards common shared languages between the actors. The shared language can also create new variety that evolves through conversations between the participants. Misunderstandings through conversations can also lead to new ideas, as they stimulate questions and may suggest novel solutions. In this paper we propose new categorizations for boundary objects, drawn from design and cybernetic approaches. We evidence these categories with a number of space-related object examples. Furthermore, we discuss how these boundary objects facilitate communications between diverse audiences, ranging from scientists, and engineers, to artists, designers, and the general public.

TI  - <i>Bordetella pertussis</i> infections in travelers: data from the GeoSentinel global network
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pertussis is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable respiratory infection that is endemic worldwide. There are limited data regarding the occurrence of pertussis in travelers. The objective of this study is to identify travel-related pertussis cases reported to the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network.Methods: This is a descriptive, retrospective analysis of GeoSentinel records from 25 travel/tropical medicine clinics in 16 countries. Frequencies of demographic and travel-related characteristics and symptoms of 74 cases of pertussis in travelers and new immigrants from 1999 to 2015 were analysed.Results: There were 74 probable and confirmed cases of pertussis in the GeoSentinel database; median age was 44 years, and 38 (51%) patients were female. Tourism was the most common reason for travel (41; 55%). Country of exposure was determined in 66 cases with travelers returning from India and China constituting the highest number of cases (10 cases each; 15% each). Seventy of 74 (95%) patients had respiratory symptoms, while fatigue and fever were reported by 21 (28%) and 20 (27%), respectively. Immunization status against pertussis was unknown. Most cases were reported after 2005 (69; 93%).Conclusions: Our study describes 74 cases of pertussis acquired during travel and reported to the GeoSentinel Network. Pertussis should be considered in returned travelers who present with respiratory symptoms. Surveillance and detection of imported cases are important to prevent onward transmission in the community. The pre-travel consultation provides an opportunity to verify immunization status and provide routine vaccinations such as pertussis.

TI  - Variable rate nitrogen management in corn: Response in two crop rotations
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision-making criteria to accurately predict nitrogen (N) rates in corn (Zea mays L.) would greatly benefit canopy sensor-guided variable rate N (VRN) management with positive implications for water quality. The objectives of this study were to measure corn yield response to VRN applied at the midvegetative corn growth stage and compare yield and agronomic efficiency (AE) between a one-time spring-N application (preplant or early sidedress) and two VRN management strategies, split-N (VRNS) and rescue-N (VRNR). Field sites located across Iowa received spring-N fertilizer at six application rates, with additional N potentially applied with each VRN spring-N rate and for the VRNS and VRNR strategies at the V10 growth stage based on canopy sensing. Drought conditions were evident during 2012 and 2013 in Iowa, which resulted in reduced corn yield and requirement for N fertilizer at many site-years. The VRN with 0 and 56 kg N ha-1 (50 lb N ac-1) applied in the spring was most closely aligned with calculated economic optimum N rate and AE. The VRNS and VRNR strategies applied more N than was needed, compared to spring-N only. Canopy sensors did not detect adequate to excess N, and therefore N applied prior to VRN application should be part of sensing-based algorithm criteria. Mean corn yield with the soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.)-corn rotation was not maintained with VRN when no spring-N was applied. Yield comparison showed no differences between spring-N, VRNS, and VRNR for both rotations. However, the greatest AE was achieved with spring-N and the VRNS strategy in the soybean-corn rotation. Weather events that occur during and after canopy sensing and VRN application remain an important factor for successful corn yield response to N rate and timing, and should be considered with canopy sensor VRN. Results from this study provide feedback on how to translate remote sensing data into VRN management.

AB  - Classification of land cover dynamics via satellite imagery has played indispensible services in developing effective management strategies for evaluation and management of water resources. The present study employed geospatial techniques, i.e., integrated GIS and remote sensing for effectual land change study. Hybrid classification approach was applied using ERDAS Imagine 11 to detect changes in land cover dynamics using satellite imagery of Landsat 4, 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI for the years of 1992, 2002, and 2015, respectively. The study area was classified into four categories, i.e., vegetation, water body, barren, and urban area. Resultant maps, overlay maps, and post classification comparison maps were produced using ArcGIS 10.2 indicated remarkable shrinkage of water body up to 58.81%, reduction in vegetation area 53.24%, and increase in urban and barren area to 49.04 and 137.32%, respectively. The significant changes in land cover dynamics of Soan River are posing threats to its survival. Therefore, proper management, policies, and development of land use inventory are needs of the hour for saving Soan River.

TI  - Carbon emissions from agricultural expansion and intensification in the Chaco
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon emissions from land-use changes in tropical dry forest systems are poorly understood, although they are likely globally significant. The South American Chaco has recently emerged as a hot spot of agricultural expansion and intensification, as cattle ranching and soybean cultivation expand into forests, and as soybean cultivation replaces grazing lands. Still, our knowledge of the rates and spatial patterns of these land-use changes and how they affected carbon emissions remains partial. We used the Landsat satellite image archive to reconstruct land-use change over the past 30 years and applied a carbon bookkeeping model to quantify how these changes affected carbon budgets. Between 1985 and 2013, more than 142 000 km(2) of the Chaco's forests, equaling 20% of all forest, was replaced by croplands (38.9%) or grazing lands (61.1%). Of those grazing lands that existed in 1985, about 40% were subsequently converted to cropland. These land-use changes resulted in substantial carbon emissions, totaling 824 Tg C between 1985 and 2013, and 46.2 Tg C for 2013 alone. The majority of these emissions came from forest-to-grazing-land conversions (68%), but post-deforestation land-use change triggered an additional 52.6 Tg C. Although tropical dry forests are less carbon-dense than moist tropical forests, carbon emissions from land-use change in the Chaco were similar in magnitude to those from other major tropical deforestation frontiers. Our study thus highlights the urgent need for an improved monitoring of the often overlooked tropical dry forests and savannas, and more broadly speaking the value of the Landsat image archive for quantifying carbon fluxes from land change.

TI  - The Influence of External Digital Elevation Models on PS-InSAR and SBAS Results: Implications for the Analysis of Deformation Signals Caused by Slow Moving Landslides in the Northern Apennines (Italy)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) postprocessing, like persistent scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR), offers the possibility to investigate slow moving landslides, where standard interferometry is problematic. These advanced algorithms involve the analysis of a series of SAR acquisitions in both time and space. One input that requires particular attention for landslide applications is the external digital elevation model (DEM) that is used to correct the interferograms for the topographic phase term. When multiple elevation data sets are available for a given study area, it is difficult to decide which one should be used. In this paper, we test the sensitivity of PS-InSAR/Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) results to different DEMs. The study area is located in the Northern Apennines of Italy, where chaotic clay shales and finegrained flysch host slow-moving earth flows and ancient rock slides. C-band (Envisat) and X-band (Cosmo-SkyMed) data are processed with different DEMs. We describe a simple framework to statistically analyze the influence of these models on the final PS-InSAR/SBAS results. We find that individual interferograms do not vary much depending on the DEM, while the results from PS-InSAR and SBAS analysis do vary. This is likely caused by the way the DEM error is estimated. We find also that the quality of the DEM is more important than the resolution and that Xband InSAR data are more sensitive to the choice of the DEM than C-band. The significance of the results is discussed with reference to two landslide areas.

TI  - New ocean, new needs: Application of pteropod shell dissolution as a biological indicator for marine resource management
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pteropods, planktonic marine snails with a cosmopolitan distribution, are highly sensitive to changing ocean chemistry. Graphical abstract shows pteropod responses to be related to aragonite saturation state, with progressing decrease in Omega(ar) causing deteriorating biological conditions. Under high saturation state (Omega(ar) > 1.1; zone 0), pteropods are healthy with no presence of stress or shell dissolution. With decreasing Oar (zone 1), pteropod stress is demonstrated through increased dissolution and reduced calcification. At Omega(ar) < 0.8 (zones 2 and 3), severe dissolution and absence of calcification prevail: the impairment is followed by significant damages. Pteropods responses to OA are closely correlated to shell dissolution that is characterized by clearly delineated thresholds. Yet the practical utility of these species as indicators of the status of marine ecosystem integrity has been overlooked. Here, we set out the scientific and policy rationales for the use of pteropods as a biological indicator appropriate for low-cost assessment of the effect of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems. While no single species or group of species can adequately capture all aspects of ecosystem change, pteropods are sensitive, specific, quantifiable indicators of OA's effects on marine biota. In an indicator screening methodology, shell dissolution scored highly compared to other indicators of marine ecological integrity. As the socioeconomic challenges of changing ocean chemistry continue to grow in coming decades, the availability of such straightforward and sensitive metrics of impact will become indispensable. Pteropods can be a valuable addition to suites of indicators intended to support OA water quality assessment, ecosystem based management, policy development, and regulatory applications.

TI  - Distribution and risk assessment of trace metals in <i>Leptodius exarata</i>, surface water and sediments from Douglas Creek in the Qua Iboe Estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF TAIBAH UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Five trace metals in Leptodius exarata, epipellic sediments and surface water from an intertidal ecosystem in the Niger Delta (Nigeria) were studied to evaluate their spatial distributions, degrees of contamination, and associated ecological and health risks. The results show that the Cd (cadmium), Cr (chromium), Ni (nickel), Pb (lead) and Zn (zinc) concentrations in sediment range from 0.550-1.142, 9.57-15.95, 9.15-13.96, 2.00-8.90 and 91.5-121.6 mg kg(-1) dw, respectively, while the L. exarata tissue metal content varies from 0.162-0.931, 3.81-8.62, 4.45-17.15, 1.90-7.35, and 125.55-269.75 mg kg-1 dw, respectively. The bioconcentration factor ranking for trace metals was found to follow the Zn > Ni > Pb > Cr > Cd sequence. The high biota to sediment accumulation factor (B SAF) found for L. exarata reveals a sentinel metal bioindicator. Sediments from most sites were found to be uncontaminated to moderately contaminated (geoaccumulation, I-geo > 0), with Cd and Zn associated with anthropogenic intrusions. Low mean-ERM (effect range-median) and mean-PEL (probable effect level) quotients of sediments were found, indicating low-moderate degrees of contamination with 30% and 21% probabilities of toxicity. The multi-metal potential ecological risk index (R-1) for the intertidal ecosystem denotes low-moderate risk. Health risks associated with crab (L. exarata) consumption are more significant for children than for adults. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of the relationship between 2D/3D urban site characteristics and land surface temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the relationship between remotely-sensed urban site characteristics (USCs) and land surface temperature (LST). Particular emphasis is put on an extensive comparison of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) USCs as potential indicators of the surface urban heat island (UHI) effect and as potential predictors for thermal sharpening applications. Both widely-used as well as more recently proposed metrics of the urban remote sensing literature are investigated within a single experiment. While some of these USCs have already been used earlier, others have never been analyzed before in the context of urban temperature studies. In addition to the comparison of 2D and 3D USC5, the spatio-temporal dependencies of their relation to LST are examined. To this end, the experimental setup of this work includes two study areas, 26 USC5, and 16 LST scenes covering four seasons. Use is made of a comprehensive database compiled for the cities of Berlin and Cologne, Germany. After data preparation, very high resolution (VHR) multi-spectral and height data are employed to map fine-scale urban land cover (LC). The resulting LC maps are then used in conjunction with the height information to compute 2D and 3D USCs. Subsequently, multi-temporal LST images are retrieved from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes. The spatio-temporal investigation of the USC-LST connection constitutes the final stage of the workflow and is achieved in the framework of a dedicated correlation analysis. The results of this study highlight that the linkage between USCs and LST sensed at small scan angles is not stronger when 3D parameters are considered. Even though they may offer more holistic representations of the urban landscape, 3D USCs are consistently outperformed by some of the most widely-used 2D metrics. The analysis of spatial dependencies reveals that the USC-LST interplay does not only differ between, but also within the two test sites. This is due to their distinct geographies, with urban form and compactness, green spaces and street trees, and the structural composition of LC elements being some of the determining factors. The examination of temporal dependencies yielded that the association between USCs and LST is fairly stable over time but can be subject to larger inter- and intra-season variations for different reasons, including the season of acquisition, vegetation phonology, and meteorological conditions. Since previous research was based on the analysis of a single study area, a limited number of (mainly 2D) USCs, and/or only a few LST scenes acquired in specific seasons, it is concluded that the findings of this study provide researchers and practitioners with a more complete picture of the USC-LST relationship.

TI  - Atmospheric correction issues for retrieving total suspended matter concentrations in inland waters using OLI/Landsat-8 image
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric effects that influence on the signal registered by remote sensors might be minimized in order to provide reliable spectral information. In aquatic systems, the application of atmospheric correction aims to minimize such effects and avoid the under or overestimation of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). Accurately R-rs provides better information about the state of aquatic system, it means, establishing the concentration of aquatic compounds more precisely. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outputs from several atmospheric correction methods (Dark Object Subtraction DOS; Quick Atmospheric Correction - QUAC; Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes - FLAASH; Atmospheric Correction for OLI 'lite' - ACOLITE, and Provisional Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance Algorithm - L8SR) in order to investigate the suitability of R-rs for estimating total suspended matter concentrations (TSM) in the Barra Bonita Hydroelectrical Reservoir. To establish TSM concentrations via atmospherically corrected Operational Land Imager (OLI) scene, the TSM retrieval model was calibrated and validated with in situ data. Thereby, the achieved results from TSM retrieval model application demonstrated that L8SR is able to provide the most suitable R-rs values for green and red spectral bands, and consequently, the lowest TSM retrieval errors (Mean Absolute Percentage Error about 10% and 12%, respectively). Retrieved R-rs from near infrared band is still a challenge for all the tested algorithms. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Precipitation Analysis over the French Alps Using a Variational Approach and Study of Potential Added Value of Ground-Based Radar Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A one-dimensional variational data assimilation (1DVar) method to retrieve profiles of precipitation in mountainous terrain is described. The method combines observations from the French Alpine region rain gauges and precipitation estimates from weather radars with background information from short-range numerical weather prediction forecasts in an optimal way. The performance of this technique is evaluated using measurements of precipitation and of snow depth during two years (2012/13 and 2013/14). It is shown that the 1DVar model allows an effective assimilation of measurements of different types, including rain gauge and radar-derived precipitation. The use of radar-derived precipitation rates over mountains to force the numerical snowpack model Crocus significantly reduces the bias and standard deviation with respect to independent snow depth observations. The improvement is particularly significant for large rainfall or snowfall events, which are decisive for avalanche hazard forecasting. The use of radar-derived precipitation rates at an hourly time step improves the time series of precipitation analyses and has a positive impact on simulated snow depths.

TI  - Assessing landscape connectivity for large mammals in the Caucasus using Landsat 8 seasonal image composites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use is transforming habitats across the globe, thereby threatening wildlife. Large mammals are especially affected because they require large tracts of intact habitat and functioning corridors between core habitat areas. Accurate land-cover data is critical to identify core habitat areas and corridors, and medium resolution sensors such as Landsat 8 provide opportunities to map land cover for conservation planning. Here, we used all available Landsat 8 imagery from launch through December 2014 to identify large mammal corridors and assess their quality across the Caucasus Mountains (>700,000 km(2)). Specifically, we tested the usefulness of seasonal image composites (spring, summer, fall, and winter) and a range of image metrics (e.g., mean and median reflectance across all clear observations) to map nine land-cover classes with a Random Forest classifier. Using image composites from all four seasons yielded markedly higher overall accuracy than using single-season composites (8% increase) and the inclusion of image metrics further improved the classification significantly. Our final land-cover map had an overall accuracy of 85%. Using our land-cover map, we parameterized connectivity models for three generic large mammal groups and identified wildlife corridors and bottlenecks within corridors with cost-distance modeling and circuit theory. Corridors were numerous (in total, 85, 131, and 132 corridors for our three mammal groups, respectively), but often had bottlenecks or high average cost along the least-cost path, indicating limited functioning. Our findings highlight the potential of Landsat 8 composites to support connectivity analyses across large areas, and thus to contribute to conservation planning, and serve as an early warning system for biodiversity loss in areas where on-the-ground monitoring is challenging, such as in the Caucasus.

TI  - Inferring reservoir operating patterns across the Mekong Basin using only space observations
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the operating pattern of artificial reservoirs by examining their impact on streamflow through two parameters, residence time and flow alteration, using a purely satellite-based technique for the Mekong Basin. Overall residence times of individual reservoirs ranged from 0.09 to 4.04 years, while streamflow was altered between 11 and 130% of its natural variability. The current set of reservoirs appears to have increased the residence time of the entire Mekong basin by about 1 month. However, if subbasin variability is considered, the satellite-based method depicts a different picture. Residence time increases to 4 months when only regulated flows are considered. If low residence time reservoirs on major rivers are excluded and reservoirs on higher stream-order rivers considered, residence time increases to 1.3 years. Predictable strong seasonal patterns emerged in residence time, where reservoirs experience higher residence time in the dry season and lower residence time in the wet season and residence time varies inversely with precipitation. High variability in reservoir effects on streamflow between reservoirs could not be explained by any reservoir properties (e.g., size, use, location, etc.), highlighting the variability in the human decisions operating these reservoirs. The take-home message of this study is that satellite observations, in combination with physical models forced with satellite data, can elucidate the spatiotemporal variability of reservoir behavior in ungauged basins of the developing world. We demonstrate in this study that the requirement for ground data to monitor current or historical behavior of dams is not necessary.Plain Language Summary The key take home message of our study is that satellites can now see the diverse variability of surface water residence time due to reservoir construction in ungauged and international river basins that is otherwise intractable. As satellite observations become increasingly more widespread in the near future, the scientific community will be able to rely on space observations to understand the potential impact of extensive reservoir development planned by each riparian nation of major river basins in the developing world. Such an ability will improve water management, inform planning decisions, and better reservoir operations. Such an understanding can also counter the secrecy or the lack of capacity that is common among nations, and result in a more cooperative environment for the benefit of all the stakeholders of the basin.

TI  - A Novel Classification Technique of Landsat-8 OLI Image-Based Data Visualization: The Application of Andrews' Plots and Fuzzy Evidential Reasoning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Andrews first proposed an equation to visualize the structures within data in 1972. Since then, this equation has been used for data transformation and visualization in a wide variety of fields. However, it has yet to be applied to satellite image data. The effect of unwanted, or impure, pixels occurring in these data varies with their distribution in the image; the effect is greater if impurity pixels are included in a classifier's training set. Andrews' curves enable the interpreter to select outlier or impurity data that can be grouped into a new category for classification. This study overcomes the above-mentioned problem and illustrates the novelty of applying Andrews' plots to satellite image data, and proposes a robust method for classifying the plots that combines Dempster-Shafer theory with fuzzy set theory. In addition, we present an example, obtained from real satellite images, to demonstrate the application of the proposed classification method. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are investigated for different training set sizes and crop types, and are compared with the results of two traditional classification methods. We find that outlier data are easily eliminated by examining Andrews' curves and that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods when considering the classification accuracy.

TI  - Characterizing spatial-temporal patterns of landscape disturbance and recovery in western Alberta, Canada using a functional data analysis approach and remotely sensed data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape regionalization approaches are frequently used to summarize and visualize complex spatial patterns, environmental factors, and disturbance regimes. However, landscapes are dynamic and contemporary regionalization approaches based on spatial patterns often do not account for the temporal component that may provide important insight on disturbance, recovery, and how ecological processes change through time. The objective of this research was to quantify spatial patterns of disturbance and recovery over time for use as inputs in a regionalization that characterizes unique spatial temporal trajectories of disturbance in western Alberta, Canada. Cumulative spatial patterns of disturbance, representing the proportion, arrangement, size, and number of disturbances, and adjusted annually for spectral recovery, were quantified in 223 watersheds using a Landsat time series dataset where disturbance events are detected and classified annually from 1985 to 2011. Using a functional data analysis approach, disturbance patterns metrics were modelled as curves and scores from a functional principal components analysis were clustered using a Gaussian finite mixture model. The resulting eight watershed clusters were mapped with mean curves representing the temporal trajectory of disturbance. The cumulative mean disturbance pattern metric curves for each cluster showed considerable variability in curve amplitude which generally increased markedly in the mid 1990's, while curve amplitude remained low in parks and protected areas. A comparison of mean curves by disturbance type (e.g., fires, harvest, non stand replacing, roads, and well sites) using a functional analysis of variance showed that anthropogenic disturbance contributed substantially to curve amplitude in all clusters, while curve amplitude associated with natural disturbances was generally low. These differences enable insights regarding how cumulative spatial disturbance patterns evolve through time on the landscape as a function of the type of disturbance and rates of recovery.

TI  - Radioguided surgery and the GOSTT concept: From pre-operative image and intraoperative navigation to image-assisted excision
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio-guided surgery has been developed for application in those disease scheduled for surgical management, particularly in areas of complex anatomy. This is based on the use of pre-operative scintigraphic planar, tomographic and fused SPECT/CT images, and the possibility of 3D reconstruction for the subsequent intraoperative locating of active lesions using handheld devices (detection probes, gamma cameras, etc.). New tracers and technologies have also been incorporated into these surgical procedures. The combination of visual and acoustic signals during the intraoperative procedure has become possible with new portable imaging modalities. In daily practice, the images offered by these techniques and devices combine perioperative nuclear medicine imaging with the superior resolution of additional optical guidance in the operating room. In many ways they provide real-time images, allowing accurate guidance during surgery, a reduction in the time required for tissue location and an anatomical environment for surgical recognition. All these approaches have been included in the concept known as (radio) Guided intraOperative Scintigraphic Tumour Targeting (GOSTT). This article offers a general view of different nuclear medicine and allied technologies used for several GOSTT procedures, and illustrates the crossing of technological frontiers in radio-guided surgery.

TI  - Hyperspectral and Lidar Intensity Data Fusion: A Framework for the Rigorous Correction of Illumination, Anisotropic Effects, and Cross Calibration
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) sensor and airborne lidar scanner (ALS) data provides promising potential for applications in environmental sciences. Standard fusion approaches use reflectance information from the HSI and distance measurements from the ALS to increase data dimen-sionality and geometric accuracy. However, the potential for data fusion based on the respective intensity information of the complementary active and passive sensor systems is high and not yet fully exploited. Here, an approach for the rigorous illumination correction of HSI data, based on the radiometric cross-calibrated return intensity information of ALS data, is presented. The cross calibration utilizes a ray tracing-based fusion of both sensor measurements by intersecting their particular beam shapes. The developed method is capable of compensating for the drawbacks of passive HSI systems, such as cast and cloud shadowing effects, illumination changes over time, across track illumination, and partly anisotropy effects. During processing, spatial and temporal differences in illumination patterns are detected and corrected over the entire HSI wavelength domain. The improvement in the classification accuracy of urban and vegetation surfaces demonstrates the benefit and potential of the proposed HSI illumination correction. The presented approach is the first step toward the rigorous in-flight fusion of passive and active system characteristics, enabling new capabilities for a variety of applications.

TI  - Strong subsite-specific variation in detecting advanced adenomas by fecal immunochemical testing for hemoglobin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) for hemoglobin are increasingly recommended and used in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We aimed to provide a detailed assessment of the sensitivity of FIT according to type and subsite of neoplasms in a true screening setting. A quantitative FIT (FOB Gold, Sentinel Diagnostics, Milano, Italy) was applied prior to colonoscopy by 3,466 participants of the German screening colonoscopy program. Subsite specific sensitivity for various types of colorectal neoplasms was derived by comparing FIT results with findings at screening colonoscopy. The most advanced finding at colonoscopy was CRC, advanced adenoma, and nonadvanced adenoma in 29, 354 and 686 cases, respectively. Per-adenoma sensitivity for large advanced adenomas (>1 cm) strongly varied by location (p < 0.001): cecum: 0/14 (0%), ascending colon and right flexure: 11/43 (26%), transverse colon and left flexure: 2/14 (14%), descending colon: 7/12 (58%), sigmoid colon: 47/92 (51%), rectum: 14/39 (36%). By contrast, the FIT detected all of 5 proximal CRC and 23 out of 24 (96%) distal CRCs, whereas per-adenoma sensitivity of both proximal (17/259, 7%) and distal nonadvanced adenomas (20/237, 8%) essentially equaled the false positivity rate among those without neoplasms (152/2,397, 6%). In conclusion, we found a very large gradient of subsite specific FIT sensitivity for detecting large advanced adenomas ranging from 0% for advanced adenomas located in the cecum to >50% for those located in the descending or sigmoid colon. By contrast, FIT sensitivity was uniformly excellent for CRC and uniformly poor for nonadvanced adenomas, regardless of their location.

TI  - Performance Analysis of TanDEM-X Quad-Polarization Products in Pursuit Monostatic Mode
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2010, the two twin synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X have been acquiring high-resolution images to generate a global Earth's digital elevation model (DEM). Both satellites have been flying in a controlled close orbit formation, acquiring data in the nominal bistatic stripmap single-polarization mode. Once the acquisition of the dataset for the generation of the DEM has been completed, the flexibility offered by both SAR instruments in terms of interferometric, imaging, and polarization modes has been further exploited to demonstrate the different capabilities of the TanDEM-X experimental modes. By activating the dual-receive antenna mode, full polarimetric data can be acquired. For the first time, it has been possible to systematically command quad-polarization acquisitions in a dedicated TanDEM-X mission science phase, started in October 2014. In this paper, we present a first performance analysis and quality assessment of such quad-polarization products. The SAR image resolution and the noise equivalent sigma zero have been evaluated to show the quality of the focused SAR products. The influence of different instrument parameters on the SAR and interferometric performance, such as chirp bandwidth, pulse repetition frequency, or block adaptive quantization, has been investigated as well. For the evaluation of the interferometric performance, key parameters such as coherence and interferometric phase error have been analyzed. In this paper, the obtained results are presented and recommendations are given for the optimization in the commanding of TanDEM-X quad-polarization acquisitions.

TI  - Challenging a measured university from an indigenous perspective: placing "manaaki' at the heart of our professional development programme
T2  - HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, universities show an outward strength partly built upon imported and exported commonalities that are measurable and therefore accountable, rankable and marketable. While there are advantages to this, it can create a barrier within each institution to acknowledging and valuing indigeneity, local flavour or special character. Such a barrier is present in Aotearoa, New Zealand, where it can be challenging to uphold obligations to the founding Treaty - Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This paper presents a case study that highlights our experience as academic developers in embedding a Maori value, manaaki, in the creation of a professional development programme and imported recognition scheme for university teachers. We were challenged to view the external visitors (the United Kingdom Professional Standards Framework (including the UKPSF)) as an opportunity for our land, to welcome them into our community using the protocols of the pwhiri and to walk side by side with our colleagues, while aspiring to meet their needs. Embedding manaaki into a professional development programme has not been simply about being kind'. Manaaki is inseparable from a worldview that values and measures in a way that is fundamentally different to that of many modern European cultures. Within our University setting, manaaki as a measurement has sustained, nourished and uplifted both host (our team, our people, our University and our land) and visitor (the UKPSF and our participating colleagues) and it is continuing to challenge the existing view of measurement, cutting right through layers of institutional policy and practice. We are challenging the comfortable sameness, and the comfortably measurable sameness, in the global university. This case study aims to share the story behind the development of our programme, and will be of interest to those considering valuing indigeneity, local flavour or special character in a modern, measured university.

TI  - Land cover changes and landscape pattern dynamics in Senegal and Guinea Bissau borderland
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Different levels of climatic, agricultural, demographic, political and socioeconomic change have been detected in West African countries. For many years the human impact on the region was negligible, due to the low population density. However, in the last decades, demographic increase has accelerated exploitation of the natural resources and consequently the degradation of the ecosystems. Land cover degradation and landscape changes are more or less pronounced according to politic and socio-economic conditions of each country. In this study, a region located on the borderland of north Guinea-Bissau and south Senegal, is analyzed with regard to land cover and landscape trends, considering the socioeconomic factors that drive them and the borderline effect. In this analysis, remote sensing data (Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI data) were used to obtain four land cover maps for the years 1990, 2002, 2010 and 2015. The results show a similar landscape behavior in both countries, directly related to similar socio-economic practices. Forest area increase in both countries and there is a reduction in Agriculture/Bare soil areas until 2010. Main causes may be associated to the rural exodus, resulting from the conflict for independence of Casamance, which affects the borderland region of Senegal and Guinea Bissau, or to the conversion of agricultural areas into cashew orchards. In opposition, between 2010 and 2015, Forest area decrease and Agriculture/Bare soil increase, due to the recent trend of conversion of old cashew orchards into traditional fields of cereals and peanut. An increase in landscape fragmentation is observed in the period under analysis, revealing a heterogenization trend, which can be related to the adoption of similar human practices, in the last decades.

TI  - Examination of the impacts of vegetation on the correlation between snow water equivalent and passive microwave brightness temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow accumulation, ablation, and runoff in mountainous areas are critical components of the hydrologic cycle, but are poorly known. Passive microwave (PM) measurements are sensitive to snow water equivalent (SWE), even in mountain regions, but vegetation masks the microwave signals and reduces this sensitivity. This study examines how the PM snow signal is affected by the forest density in fourteen basins in the Sierra Nevada, USA, and in a series of sixteen subsets of the Kern basin that have varied vegetation density. 36.5 GHz vertical polarization brightness temperature (T-b) time series for each basin were produced from the spaceborne AMSR-E operational period (water year (WY) 2003 to WY2011). For each basin, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the annual minimum Tb and the concurrent SWE was calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the PM to SWE. The relationship between the R-2 values and the forest density was then analyzed to assess how vegetation affect the SWE information in the observed Tb. Mean forest coverage from MODIS was used to represent forest density. The R2 between the annual minimum Tb and concurrent SWE was >0.6 for three of the basins. Consistent with previous studies, WY2006 demonstrated anomalous Tb values for many basins, apparently due to anomalous warm winter rainfall. Excluding WY2006, R-2 is significantly higher in all basins: eight of fourteen basins have R-2 >0.6. For basins with average elevation >2500 m, SWE correlates well with Tb. The R-2 decreases monotonically with decreasing elevation. Basin elevation and forest cover are highly correlated in the Sierra; a basin elevation of 2500 m generally coincides with forest cover of 20%. A total of 42% of Sierra Nevada has <20% forest cover; this corresponds to an estimated 34% of the total SWE in the Sierra. Thus, SWE and Tb are empirically correlated for over a third of the SWE in the Sierra, typically at high elevations and above treeline. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring Spatial Patterns and Changes of Ecology, Production, and Living Land in Chinese Urban Agglomerations: 35 Years after Reform and Opening Up, Where, How and Why?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese urban agglomeration (UA) has gradually become a new world economic center and the strategic region of the "The Belt and Road Initiatives". The spatial patterns and variations of ecology-production-living land (EPL) profoundly affect UA's development and its ecological environment. Unfortunately, scientific understanding about the trajectories, patterns and drivers of EPL changes in Chinese urban agglomerations (UAs) since reform and opening up is still very limited. The aim of this paper was to monitor those characteristics during the last 35 years. Here, we proposed a new classification system of EPL, including ecology land (EL), industrial production land (IPL), agricultural production land (APL), urban living land (ULL) and rural living land (RLL) due to Chinese urban-rural dual structure. Then, we extracted EPL land from the Chinese LUCC product, which is the recently released remote sensing data product of high resolution spatial land use data in China at national level. Furthermore, we analyzed the spatial-temporal trajectories and driving factors of EPL for Chinese UAs during 1980-2015. The results showed that: (1) ULL and IPL in Chinese UAs were increased rapidly, while EL and APL were seriously decreased. (2) The growth patterns of ULL and IPL had shown a spatial heterogeneity. As to different regional UAs, the expansion rates of ULL and IPL ranked from high to low were as follows: eastern, central, western, and northeastern UAs. (3) National policies, population, and economy dominated the spatial-temporal changes of EPL in Chinese UAs. (4) The multi-planning integration in the structure of land use should be strengthened at UA-scale.

TI  - Comparative study between ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of axillary lymph nodes and sentinel lymph node histopathology in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The replacement of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-guided FNA) cytology of axillary lymph nodes is controversial, despite the simplicity and reduced cost of the latter. In the present study, US-guided FNA was performed in 27 patients with early-stage breast cancer for comparison with SNB. Data were analyzed by calculation of sample proportions. Tumor subtypes included invasive ductal carcinoma (85%), invasive lobular carcinoma (7%), and tubular and metaplastic carcinoma (4%). FNA had a sensitivity of 45%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 73%. Axillary lymph node cytology obtained by US guided-FNA in patients with breast cancer had a specificity similar to that of sentinel lymph node histopathology in the presence of axillary node metastases. However, when lymph node cytology is negative, it does not exclude the existence of metastatic implants, due to its low sensitivity in comparison to sentinel lymph node histopathology.

TI  - Spatial clustering of curves with an application of satellite data
T2  - SPATIAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality indicators are important to identify risks to the environment, society and human health. The European Community Water Framework Directive establishes guidelines for the classification of all water bodies across Europe and chemical and biological indicators were used to this scope. In particular, the Chlorophyll type A index (Chl-a) is a shared indicator of trophic status and monitoring activities may be useful to explain its spatial distribution and to discover local dangerous behaviours (for example the anoxic events). Differently by the classical approach based on an "average'' values over a period, we propose a functional clustering model that takes into account temporal and spatial dependence of Chl-a concentrations in the Adriatic Sea for defining appropriate clusters of sites. We use satellite monthly data, during the period 2002-2012, and we model the spatial dependence among the sites by means of a Markov random field model. Compared to similar attempts in literature by Jiang and Serban (2012) our formulation includes spatial covariates. This inclusion allows for more flexibility to obtain more homogeneous and representative clusters of sites in the Adriatic Sea. The estimation of the model and the identification of the number of clusters are carried out using a pseudolikelihood function. A small simulation study complements the real data analysis.

TI  - Multi-Decadal Surface Water Dynamics in North American Tundra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last several decades, warming in the Arctic has outpaced the already impressive increases in global mean temperatures. The impact of these increases in temperature has been observed in a multitude of ecological changes in North American tundra including changes in vegetative cover, depth of active layer, and surface water extent. The low topographic relief and continuous permafrost create an ideal environment for the formation of small water bodies-a definitive feature of tundra surface. In this study, water bodies in Nunavut territory in northern Canada were mapped using a long-term record of remotely sensed observations at 30 m spatial resolution from the Landsat suite of instruments. The temporal trajectories of water extent between 1985 and 2015 were assessed. Over 675,000 water bodies have been identified over the 31-year study period with over 168,000 showing a significant (p < 0.05) trend in surface area. Approximately 55% of water bodies with a significant trend were increasing in size while the remaining 45% were decreasing in size. The overall net trend for water bodies with a significant trend is 0.009 ha year(-1) per water body.

TI  - The Seasonal Timing of Snowshoe Hare Virus Transmission on the Island of Newfoundland, Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arthropod-borne diseases negatively affect humans worldwide. Understanding the biology of the arthropod vectors and the pathogens they harbor, the arthropods are moving targets as a result of climate change, ecosystem degradation, species introductions, and increased human travel. Viruses within the California serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus (family Bunyaviridae) are among the mosquito-borne viruses of concern owing to their zoonotic potential. Two of these, snowshoe hare virus (SSHV) and Jamestown Canyon virus, were shown, using a combination of serology and virus isolations, to circulate on the Island of Newfoundland, Canada, in the 1980s. More recently, serological analysis demonstrated that these two viruses continue to circulate on the Island in several domesticated and wild animals. Here, we detected the seroconversion to SSHV in wild snowshoe hares and in a single sentinel rabbit. The seroconversion in the sentinel rabbit occurred in early August (2011), which corresponded to the weeks of peak mosquito collections and the timing of the detection of SSHV in suspected mosquito vectors. A portion of the SSHV S segment sequence was generated from mosquito pools collected at sites near the sentinel rabbits and phylogenetically analyzed using the neighbor-joining method with other available California serogroup virus sequences. This analysis validated the SSHV identification but showed that the Newfoundland sequence fell outside the other SSHV sequences available, which originated from the United States between 1959 and 2005.

T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Adaptation of the technology of water turbidity simulation by satellite image data for the delta of the Selenga R., the largest Baikal tributary is given. The results of processing a series of 82 Landsat images are used to assess the seasonal variability of suspended sediment balance in the Selenga delta in period from 1989 up to the present time. It is shown that, at higher water discharges (> 1500 m(3)/s), suspended material will accumulate in the delta (on the average 15% of the total sediment transport at the delta head), governed by material precipitation within inundated floodplain area and lakes in the lower part of the delta. At lower water discharges (< 1500 m(3)/s), a longitudinal increase in suspended sediment transport may take place, caused by setups from Baikal side and channel erosion in the branches.

TI  - Follicular Malignant Melanoma: A Rare Morphologic Variant of Melanoma. Report of a Case and Review of the Literature
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Follicular malignant melanoma (FMM) is an exceedingly rare variant of melanoma. Only 8 cases have been reported in the literature thus far. Often bland on physical examination, FMM shows a striking histologic pattern, with atypical melanocytes sometimes consuming the entire follicle and extending into the dermis. Criteria have been suggested to help distinguish FMM from lentigo maligna melanoma; however, no clear criteria distinguish this cancer clinically. FMM cannot be distinguished from follicular metastases of melanoma based on histology, requiring close clinical correlation and detailed history taking on the part of the practitioner. In this publication, we present a case of FMM and a review of the literature. A 59-year-old man was incidentally found to have a small flesh-colored papule on the arm during a skin cancer screening. Biopsy revealed atypical melanocytes extending from the follicular infundibulum into the reticular dermis. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the melanocytic origin of the neoplasm. The patient underwent wide local excision with 2-cm margins. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative for melanoma. We present this case to highlight an unusual type of melanoma and illustrate how it may be distinguished from other neoplasms.

TI  - Integrating age in the detection and mapping of incongruous patches in coffee (<i>Coffea arabica</i>) plantations using multi-temporal Landsat 8 NDVI anomalies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of cost-effective, reliable and easy to implement crop condition monitoring methods is urgently required for perennial tree crops such as coffee (Coffea arabica), as they are grown over large areas and represent long term and higher levels of investment. These monitoring methods are useful in identifying farm areas that experience poor crop growth, pest infestation, diseases outbreaks and/or to monitor response to management interventions. This study compares field level coffee mean NDVI and LSWI anomalies and age-adjusted coffee mean NDVI and LSWI anomalies in identifying and mapping incongruous patches across perennial coffee plantations. To achieve thiS objective, we first derived deviation of coffee pixels from the global coffee mean NDVI and LSWI values of nine sequential 'Landsat 8 OLI image scenes. We then evaluated the influence of coffee age class (young, mature and old) on Landsat-scale NDVI and LSWI values using a one-way ANOVA and since resultS showed significant differences, we adjusted NDVI and LSWI anomalies for age-class. We then used the cumulative inverse distribution function (alpha <= 0.05) to identify fields and within field areas with excessive deviation of NDVI and LSWI from the global and the age-expected mean for each of the Landsat 8 OLI scene dates spanning three seasons. Results from accuracy assessment indicated that it was possible to separate incongruous and healthy patches using these anomalies and that using NDVI performed better than using LSWI for both global and age-adjusted mean anomalies. Using the age-adjusted anomalies performed better in separating incongruous and healthy patches than using the global mean for both NDVI (Overall accuracy =80.9% and 68.1% respectively) and for LSWI (Overall accuracy=68.1% and 48.9% respectively). When applied to other Landsat 8 OLI scenes, the results showed that the proportions of coffee fields that were modelled incongruent decreased with time for the young age category and while it increased for the mature and old age classes with time. We concluded that the method could be useful for the identification of anomalous patches using Landsat scale time series data to monitor large coffee plantations and provide an indication of areas requiring particular field attention.

TI  - Grassland conservation programs, vegetation rehabilitation and spatial dependency in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Three nationwide grassland conservation programs have been implemented in Inner Mongolia since 2000. All aim to relieve grazing pressure, hence to reverse the grassland degradation trend. The different timings and spatial configurations of these programs present an unusual setting of quasi-natural policy experiment for exploring their effectiveness and interactions with other drivers on a regional scale. In this paper, a spatial panel model was developed to examine the effects of the programs on vegetation rehabilitation, meanwhile to detect the spatial interdependent relationship among grassland management units occurring in the process of program implementation. The methodology used a panel dataset of SPOT-VEGETATION NDVI data, multi-station surface meteorological observations, and socio-economic statistics across 88 counties from 2000 to 2013. The modeling results suggested that these programs in general significantly facilitated grassland vegetation rehabilitation. Enrollment in the Beijing-Tianjin Wind/Sand Source Control Program and in the Grazing Withdrawal Program was predicted to increase the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value by an amount equivalent to the effects of 136 mm and 56 mm additional annual precipitation, respectively. The positive and significant coefficient of spatial lag term indicated that there was a synergistic relationship in the vegetation variations of neighboring counties, and a unit increase in the weighted sum of all neighboring counties' NDVI values could approximately increase a target county's NDVI value by 0.2, after controlling for other factors' effects. Certain spatial spillover mechanisms may function to generate this effect, such as benign competition, mutual cooperation and coordination, or sharing of successful experiences among neighboring counties in carrying out the programs. Nevertheless, the actual mechanisms need to be confirmed by field surveys in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Performance of MODIS C6 Aerosol Product during Frequent Haze-Fog Events: A Case Study of Beijing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly released MODIS Collection 6 aerosol products have been widely used to evaluate fine particulate matter with a 10 km Dark Target aerosol optic depth (DT AOD) product, a new 3 km DT AOD product and an enhanced Deep Blue (DB) AOD product. However, the representativeness of MODIS AOD products under different air quality conditions remains unclear. In this study, we obtained all three types of MODIS Terra AOD from 2001 to 2015 and Aqua AOD from 2003 to 2015 for the Beijing region to study the performance of the different AOD products (Collection 6) under different air quality situations. The validation of three MODIS AOD products suggests that DB AOD has the highest accuracy with an expected error (EE) envelope (containing at least 67% of the matchups on a scatter plot) of 0.05 + 0.15 tau, followed by 10 km DT AOD (0.08 + 0.2 tau) and 3 km DT AOD (0.35 + 0.15 tau), specifically for Beijing. Near-surface PM2.5 concentrations during the passage of MODIS from 2013 to 2015 were also obtained to categorize air quality as unpolluted, moderately, and heavily polluted, as well as to analyze the performance of the different AOD products under different air quality conditions. Very few MODIS 3 km DT retrievals appeared on heavily polluted days, making it almost impossible to play an effective role in air quality applications in Beijing. While the DB AOD allowed for considerable retrievals under all air quality conditions, it had a coarse spatial resolution. These results demonstrate that the MODIS 3 km DT AOD product may not be the appropriate proxy to be used in the satellite retrieval of surface PM2.5, especially for those areas with frequent haze-fog events like Beijing.

TI  - Evaluation of Urbanization Dynamics and its Impacts on Surface Heat Islands: A Case Study of Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the capital of China, Beijing has experienced a continued and rapid urbanization process in the past few decades. One of the key environmental impacts of rapid urbanization is the effect of urban heat island (UHI). The objective of this study was to estimate the urbanization indexes of Beijing from 1992 to 2013 based on the stable nighttime light (NTL) data derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Line Scanner System (DMSP/OLS), which has became a widely used remote sensing database after decades of development. The annual average value nighttime light Digital Number (NTL-DN), and the total lit number and urban area proportion within Beijing's boundary were calculated and compared with social-economic statistics parameters to estimate the correlation between them. Four Landsat thematic mapper (TM) images acquired in 1995 and 2009 were applied to estimate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized land surface temperature (LSTnor), and spatial correlation analysis was then carried out to investigate the relationship between the urbanization level and NDVI and LSTnor. Our results showed a strong negative linear relationship between the NTL-DN value and NDVI; however, in contrast, a strong positive linear relationship between existed between the NTL-DN value and LSTnor. By conducting a spatial comparison analysis of 1995 and 2009, the vegetation coverage change and surface temperature difference were calculated and compared with the NTL-DN difference. Our result revealed that the regions of fast urbanization resulted in a decrease of NDVI and increase of LSTnor. In addition, choropleth maps showing the spatial pattern of urban heat island zones were produced based on different temperatures, and the analysis result indicated that the spatial distribution of surface temperature was closely related with the NTL-DN and NDVI. These findings are helpful for understanding the urbanization process as well as urban ecology, which both have significant implications for urban planning and minimize the potential environmental impacts of urbanization in Beijing.

TI  - A pilot study to delimit tsetse target populations in Zimbabwe
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTsetse (Glossina sensu stricto) are cyclical vectors of human and animal trypanosomoses, that are presently targeted by the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) coordinated by the African Union. In order to achieve effective control of tsetse, there is need to produce elaborate plans to guide intervention programmes. A model intended to aid in the planning of intervention programmes and assist a fuller understanding of tsetse distribution was applied, in a pilot study in the Masoka area, Mid-Zambezi valley in Zimbabwe, and targeting two savannah species, Glossina morsitans morsitans and Glossina pallidipes.Methodology/Principal findingsThe field study was conducted between March and December 2015 in 105 sites following a standardized grid sampling frame. Presence data were used to study habitat suitability of both species based on climatic and environmental data derived from MODIS and SPOT 5 satellite images. Factors influencing distribution were studied using an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) whilst habitat suitability was predicted using a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model at a spatial resolution of 250 m. Area Under the Curve (AUC), an indicator of model performance, was 0.89 for G. m. morsitans and 0.96 for G. pallidipes. We then used the predicted suitable areas to calculate the probability that flies were really absent from the grid cells where they were not captured during the study based on a probability model using a risk threshold of 0.05. Apart from grid cells where G. m. morsitans and G. pallidipes were captured, there was a high probability of presence in an additional 128 km 2 and 144 km 2 respectively.Conclusions/SignificanceThe modelling process promised to be useful in optimizing the outputs of presence/absence surveys, allowing the definition of tsetse infested areas with improved accuracy. The methodology proposed here can be extended to all the tsetse infested parts of Zimbabwe and may also be useful for other PATTEC national initiatives in other African countries.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Uprooted Orchards Based on Orthophoto Texture Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permanent crops, such as olive groves, vineyards and fruit trees, are important in European agriculture because of their spatial and economic relevance. Agricultural geographical databases (AGDBs) are commonly used by public bodies to gain knowledge of the extension covered by these crops and to manage related agricultural subsidies and inspections. However, the updating of these databases is mostly based on photointerpretation, and thus keeping this information up-to-date is very costly in terms of time and money. This paper describes a methodology for automatic detection of uprooted orchards (parcels where fruit trees have been eliminated) based on the textural classification of orthophotos with a spatial resolution of 0.25 m. The textural features used for this classification were derived from the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and wavelet transform, and were selected through principal components (PCA) and separability analyses. Next, a Discriminant Analysis classification algorithm was used to detect uprooted orchards. Entropy, contrast and correlation were found to be the most informative textural features obtained from the co-occurrence matrix. The minimum and standard deviation in plane 3 were the selected features based on wavelet transform. The classification based on these features achieved a true positive rate (TPR) of over 80% and an accuracy (A) of over 88%. As a result, this methodology enabled reducing the number of fields to photointerpret by 60-85%, depending on the membership threshold value selected. The proposed approach could be easily adopted by different stakeholders and could increase significantly the efficiency of agricultural database updating tasks.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 Data for Retrieving LAI and Leaf and Canopy Chlorophyll Content of a Potato Crop
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content, at leaf and canopy level, are important variables for agricultural applications because of their crucial role in photosynthesis and in plant functioning. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that LAI, leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) of a potato crop can be estimated by vegetation indices for the first time using Sentinel-2 satellite images. In 2016 ten plots of 30 x 30 m were designed in a potato field with different fertilization levels. During the growing season approximately 10 daily radiometric field measurements were used to determine LAI, LCC, and CCC. These radiometric determinations were extensively calibrated against LAI2000 and chlorophyll meter (SPAD, soil plant analysis development) measurements for potato crops grown in the years 2010-2014. Results for Sentinel-2 showed that the weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI) using bands at 10 m spatial resolution can be used for estimating the LAI (R-2 of 0.809; root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.36). The ratio of the transformed chlorophyll in reflectance index and the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) showed to be a good linear estimator of LCC at 20 m (R-2 of 0.696; RMSEP of 0.062 g.m(2)). The performance of the chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI) at 10 m spatial resolution was slightly worse (R-2 of 0.656; RMSEP of 0.066 g.m(2)) compared to TCARI/OSAVI. Finally, results showed that the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen) was an accurate and linear estimator of CCC at 10 m (R-2 of 0.818; RMSEP of 0.29 g.m(2)). Results for CIgreen were better than for the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge, R-2 of 0.576, RMSE of 0.43 g.m(2)). Our results show that Sentinel-2 bands at 10 m spatial resolution are suitable for estimating LAI, LCC, and CCC, avoiding the need for red-edge bands that are only available at 20 m. This is an important finding for applying Sentinel-2 data in precision agriculture.

TI  - Alluvial groundwater recharge estimation in semi-arid environment using remotely sensed data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data limitations on groundwater (GW) recharge over large areas are still a challenge for efficient water resource management, especially in semi-arid regions. Thus, this study seeks to integrate hydrological cycle variables from satellite imagery to estimate the spatial distribution of GW recharge in the Ipanema river basin (IRB), which is located in the State of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. Remote sensing data, including monthly maps (2011-2012) of rainfall, runoff and evapotranspiration, are used as input for the water balance method within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Rainfall data are derived from the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) Version 7 (3B43V7) product and present the same monthly average temporal distributions from 15 rain gauges that are distributed over the study area (r = 0.93 and MAE = 12.7 mm), with annual average estimates of 894.3 (2011) and 300.7 mm (2012). The runoff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) method, which is based on regional soil information and Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor image, represents 29% of the TMPA rainfall that was observed across two years of study. Actual evapotranspiration data, which were provided by the SEBAL application of MODIS images, present annual averages of 1213 (2011) and 1067 (2012) mm. The water balance results reveal a large inter-annual difference in the IRB GW recharge, which is characterized by different rainfall regimes, with averages of 30.4 (2011) and 4.7 (2012) mm year(-1). These recharges were mainly observed between January and July in regions with alluvial sediments and highly permeable soils. The GW recharge approach with remote sensing is compared to the WTF (Water Table Fluctuation) method, which is used in an area of alluvium in the IRB. The estimates from these two methods exhibit reliable annual agreement, with average values of 154.6 (WTF) and 124.6 (water balance) mm in 2011. These values correspond to 14.89 and 13.53% of the rainfall that was recorded at the rain gauges and the TMPA, respectively. Only the WTF method indicates a very low recharge of 15.9 mm for the second year. The values in this paper provide reliable insight regarding the use of remotely sensed data to evaluate the rates of alluvial GW recharge in regions where the potential runoff cannot be disregarded from WB equation and must be calculated spatially.

T2  - ANNALI ITALIANI DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: To assess the sentinel-node identification rate at lymphoscintigraphy and its technical feasibility after neo-adjuvant treatments.MATERIAL OF STUDY: Between 2000 and 2013, 444 consecutive patients affected by primary locally advanced breast cancer were enrolled in this study. All individuals were candidate for neo-adjuvant treatments and for lymphoscintigraphy before surgery.RESULTS: The median age was 44 years at onset; almost one sentinel node was identified during lymphoscintigraphy in 430 cases. The detection rate at lymphoscintigraphy was 969% (95% CI, 94.8-98.1%). Considering the correlation between specific treatments and sentinel node identification rate, we verified that the detection rate did not vary significantly (p=0.53) according to the type of neo-adjuvant therapies administered to the patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node identification is a safe and feasible procedure after neo-adjuvant therapies, independently of treatment types.

TI  - Plasma sheet injections into the inner magnetosphere: Two-way coupled OpenGGCM-RCM model results
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plasma sheet injections associated with low flux tube entropy bubbles have been found to be the primary means of mass transport from the plasma sheet to the inner magnetosphere. This phenomenon has been primarily studied with satellite data and stand-alone ring current models with artificial boundary conditions. This study introduces a new two-way coupling between a kinetic ring current model (Rice Convection Model, or RCM) and a global magnetosphere MHD model (Open Geospace General Circulation Model, or OpenGGCM). Multiple geomagnetic storms and one period of quiet are modeled to track and characterize inward flow behavior. Simulations show that (1) there is a clear association of plasma sheet injections with bubbles, (2) the majority of inward plasma transport in the magnetotail beyond 6.6 R-E is due to bubbles, regardless of storm activity, and (3) the average peak velocity of injections is higher for increasing downtail distances, stronger storms (when compared with storms having similar drivers), and storms driven by corotating interaction regions (when compared with coronal mass ejection-driven storms of similar strength).Plain Language Summary Disturbances in the solar wind, most notably coronal mass ejections from the Sun, impact the plasma environment within the Earth's magnetosphere, the region where Earth's geomagnetic field dominates. This so-called space weather transfers energy and plasma into the magnetosphere, which ultimately affects the near-Earth plasma environment, or inner magnetosphere. Plasma is injected into this region from the nightside magnetosphere, or magnetotail, through a combination of steady and transient injections. There is significant debate about the relative importance of these processes, and the character of the injections themselves. In this study, we use simulations of the global magnetosphere to investigate transient injections to determine their relative importance in transporting plasma into the inner magnetosphere as well as the effect that different types of solar wind disturbances have. We find that transient injections are responsible for the vast majority of the plasma injected into the inner magnetosphere and that the velocity of these injections is dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic storm response and the type of solar wind disturbance.

TI  - Exploring the geomorphological processes of Qinghai Lake and surrounding lakes in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, using Multitemporal Landsat Imagery (1973-2015)
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of lake's coastline and shape changes and the influencing factors will contribute to knowledge about the geomorphological and hydrological evolutions of those lakes. This study extracted coastlines of Qinghai Lake and surrounding lakes in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau from multitemporal remote sensing data from 1973 to 2015. The geomorphological processes and the reasons for area and coastline variations were then analyzed. The results showed that: the changes of the total lake area were divided into three stages: the stable decrease stage (1973-1988), the fluctuant decrease stage (1988-2005), and the rapidly increase stage (2005-2015). The changes of Qinghai Lake area and Gahai Lake area showed a similar trend as the total lake area. The Erhai Lake area fluctuated from 1973 to 2004 and then increased from 2004 to 2015. Haiyanwan Lake was isolated from Qinghai Lake in 2003 and was linked into Qinghai Lake in 2006, again. The lakes area variations, excluding Erhai Lake and Shadao Lake, were positively correlated with the variation of the Qinghai Lake level, and estuary area variations were significantly negatively correlated to the lake level, indicating that the higher lake level led to more land being submerged. The evolutionary processes of lakes in the Shadao Region were influenced by aeolian sand and lake water balance experiencing relatively low precipitation and strong evaporation. Erhai Lake was also influenced by river runoff from Daotang River. Sediment loads from rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake, except for Buha River, were relative low and only slightly influenced the estuary. Aeolian sand transported by the lake waves and currents from west coast to east coast will form subaqueous barriers, the Shadao Region land area will increase slowly, and the coastline of the Shadao Region will extend towards the lake. Therefore, the diameter of Qinghai Lake from the west to east coast will become shorter, while the diameter from the south to north coast will become longer in future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An intense and fast moving convective line that crossed Massif Central/Cevennes-Vivarais area (south France) during the field campaign of Hydrological Cycle in Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) Special Observing Period 1 (SOP1) is examined. The mesoscale analysis demonstrates a complex convective system with a V-shape in the Infrared (IR) satellite imagery and a squall line pattern on the radar imagery. Ground stations observed up to 60 mm h(-1) of rain accumulation, while the lightning activity, as observed by 4 detection networks, was also exceptionally high. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to simulate this convective episode and sensitivity tests were performed with various microphysics and convective parameterization schemes. Satellite data from Meteosat SEVIRI Rapid Scanning Service were used in conjunction with radar, lightning and rain gauge data to conclude on the best simulation for which WRF model exhibits a rather precise and realistic distribution and evolution of the precipitation patterns. Finally, a study of the microphysics was performed indicating the interconnection of graupel with lightning activity, confirming recent results, compared against a sophisticated hydrometeor classification radar algorithm and lightning data.

TI  - Intramammary sentinel lymph node with capsular extravasation in breast cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been developed as the standard of treatment in breast cancer. Status of axillary sentinel lymph node is known to be a significant prognostic factor. Nevertheless, involvement of an intramammary lymph node with metastasis in breast cancer is a rare radiological and clinical presentation, and with extracapsular extravasation even more uncommon. Historically, reported series of patients with intramammary lymph node diagnosed by final histological examination are small in number and clinical significance of metastasis is still unclear. Here, we report a case of conservative breast cancer surgery with 3 intramammary sentinel lymph nodes containing metastasis and extracapsular extravasation. After multidisciplinary consensus, the patient was surgically reapproached with mastectomy. Even though the 3 intramammary sentinel lymph nodes were positive for metastases, pathology examination did not reveal any signs of malignancy in the mastectomy specimen.

TI  - Observed effects in the equatorial and low-latitude ionosphere in the South American and African sectors during the 2012 minor sudden stratospheric warming
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the effects of a minor sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event of 2012 in the ionosphere over South American and African sectors have been studied using C/NOFS satellite data and GPS observations. Also, the magnetometer measurements obtained at two stations in the equatorial and low-latitude regions in the South American sector are presented. There were significant Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC) depletions in the afternoon in both South American and African sectors during the 2012 minor SSW event. A novel feature of the present study is the reduction of the quasi 16-day oscillation (periods ranging from 11 to 20 days) in the daily averaged VTEC in the Brazilian and African sector during an SSW event. Also, the results for the Brazilian sector show an amplification of the 2-6 day period in the daily averaged VTEC at equatorial and low-latitude regions, after the SSW temperature peak. This investigation shows that a minor SSW can affect the irregularities at ionospheric heights in the Brazilian and African sectors. Ground-based magnetometer measurements in the American sector shows strongly enhanced equatorial electrojet (EEJ) after the SSW temperature peak.

TI  - Delineating morbillivirus entry, dissemination and airborne transmission by studying <i>in vivo</i> competition of multicolor canine distemper viruses in ferrets
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of cellular receptors and characterization of viral tropism in animal models have vastly improved our understanding of morbillivirus pathogenesis. However, specific aspects of viral entry, dissemination and transmission remain difficult to recapitulate in animal models. Here, we used three virologically identical but phenotypically distinct recombinant (r) canine distemper viruses (CDV) expressing different fluorescent reporter proteins for in vivo competition and airborne transmission studies in ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). Six donor ferrets simultaneously received three rCDVs expressing green, red or blue fluorescent proteins via conjunctival (ocular, Oc), intra-nasal (IN) or intra-tracheal (IT) inoculation. Two days post-inoculation sentinel ferrets were placed in physically separated adjacent cages to assess airborne transmission. All donor ferrets developed lymphopenia, fever and lethargy, showed progressively increasing systemic viral loads and were euthanized 14 to 16 days post-inoculation. Systemic replication of virus inoculated via the Oc, IN and IT routes was detected in 2/6, 5/6 and 6/6 ferrets, respectively. In five donor ferrets the IT delivered virus dominated, although replication of two or three different viruses was detected in 5/6 animals. Single lymphocytes expressing multiple fluorescent proteins were abundant in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues, demonstrating the occurrence of double and triple virus infections. Transmission occurred efficiently and all recipient ferrets showed evidence of infection between 18 and 22 days post-inoculation of the donor ferrets. In all cases, airborne transmission resulted in replication of a single-colored virus, which was the dominant virus in the donor ferret. This study demonstrates that morbilliviruses can use multiple entry routes in parallel, and co-infection of cells during viral dissemination in the host is common. Airborne transmission was efficient, although transmission of viruses expressing a single color suggested a bottleneck event. The identity of the transmitted virus was not determined by the site of inoculation but by the viral dominance during dissemination.

TI  - Detecting deforestation impacts in Southern Amazonia rainfall using rain gauges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, several climate-modelling studies have forecasted a decrease in precipitation in Southern Amazonia, projecting scenarios of a drier Amazon for the future in relation with deforestation (or forest cover). In this area, only a limited number of analyses using forest cover data and rainfall time series have considered the transitional zones between the Amazon Forest and the Cerrado biome. In this work, we evaluated whether forest cover and rainfall patterns are correlated. The analysis encompassed rainfall times series from 207 rain gauges during the 1971-2010 period, and forest cover data acquired from LANDSAT5 satellite images. The results indicate that, at local level (1-15 km), both seasonal and annual precipitation values are not correlated to forest cover, whereas at the regional scale (30-50 km) contrasting to annual values, significant correlation occurs between forest cover and seasonal precipitation. Additionally, the study suggests that the larger the forest areas, the greater the probabilities of those influencing precipitation at regional scale, in opposite direction to the observed local level effects.

TI  - Local land-atmosphere feedbacks limit irrigation demand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is known to influence regional climate but most studies forecast and simulate irrigation with offline (i.e. land only) models. Using south eastern Australia as a test bed, we demonstrate that irrigation demand is fundamentally different between land only and land-atmosphere simulations. While irrigation only has a small impact on maximum temperature, the semi-arid environment experiences near surface moistening in coupled simulations over the irrigated regions, a feedback that is prevented in offline simulations. In land only simulations that neglect the local feedbacks, the simulated irrigation demand is 25% higher and the standard deviation of the mean irrigation rate is 60% smaller. These local-scale irrigation-driven feedbacks are not resolved in coarse-resolution climate models implying that use of these tools will overestimate irrigation demand. Future studies of irrigation demand must therefore account for the local land-atmosphere interactions by using coupled frameworks, at a spatial resolution that captures the key feedbacks.

TI  - Modelling the urban heat island effect of smart growth policy scenarios in Brisbane
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Smart growth policy has been identified as a panacea to tackle a range of undesirable outcomes of sprawl development. Various neighbourhood planning concepts have been developed following smart growth principles such as transit oriented development, and infill development. Existing empirical studies, however, do not answer to a key policy question: can smart growth policies reduce the urban heat island (UHI) effect? If so, what type of smart growth policy would be most effective? This research examined the questions by deriving five alternative neighbourhood planning scenarios for Brisbane for 2023: a) business as usual, b) transit oriented development (TOD), c) infill development, d) motorway corridor oriented development, and e) sprawl development. The research utilises Landsat remote sensing images of 1991, 2004, and 2013 to: first, estimate and validate a Geographically Weighted Regression model in order to identify statistically significant factors influencing the UHI intensities in Brisbane; and second, predict the UHI intensities of the five policy scenarios. Two factors were identified to have significant influence on the UHI intensities in Brisbane: population density, and porosity. Results show that compared to the 2004 and 2013 levels, Brisbane will respectively experience a higher and lower levels of UHI effect in 2023, irrespective of the policy scenarios. On average, the infill development scenario, as a smart growth policy, has a marginally better potential to mitigate the UHI effect in Brisbane in 2023 compared to the sprawl development scenario conditional on the definition applied in this research. The UHI effect would be more equitably balanced spatially under the sprawl development scenario. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of the French National Health Insurance Information System as a tool for epidemiological surveillance of malaria
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Epidemiological surveillance of malaria in France is based on a hospital laboratory sentinel surveillance network. There is no comprehensive population surveillance. The objective of this study was to assess the ability of the French National Health Insurance Information System to support nationwide malaria surveillance in continental France.Materials and methods: A case identification algorithm was built in a 2-step process. First, inclusion rules giving priority to sensitivity were defined. Then, based on data description, exclusion rules to increase specificity were applied. To validate our results, we compared them to data from the French National Reference Center for Malaria on case counts, distribution within subgroups, and disease onset date trends.Results: We built a reusable automatized tool. From July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2014, we identified 4077 incident malaria cases that occurred in continental France. Our algorithm provided data for hospitalized patients, patients treated by private physicians, and outpatients for the entire population. Our results were similar to those of the National Reference Center for Malaria for each of the outcome criteria.Discussion: We provided a reliable algorithm for implementing epidemiological surveillance of malaria based on the French National Health Insurance Information System. Our method allowed us to work on the entire population living in continental France, including subpopulations poorly covered by existing surveillance methods.Conclusion: Traditional epidemiological surveillance and the approach presented in this paper are complementary, but a formal validation framework for case identification algorithms is necessary.

TI  - Forecasting long-term global solar radiation with an ANN algorithm coupled with satellite-derived (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) for regional locations in Queensland
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Forecasting solar radiation (G) is extremely crucial for engineering applications (e.g. design of solar furnaces and energy-efficient buildings, solar concentrators, photovoltaic-systems and a site-selection of sites for future power plants). To establish long-term sustainability of solar energy, energy practitioners utilize versatile predictive models of G as an indispensable decision-making tool. Notwithstanding this, sparsity of solar sites, instrument maintenance, policy and fiscal issues constraint the availability of model input data that must be used for forecasting the onsite value of G. To surmount these challenge, low-cost, readily-available satellite products accessible over large spatial domains can provide viable alternatives. In this paper, the preciseness of artificial neural network (ANN) for predictive modelling of G is evaluated for regional Queensland, which employed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land-surface temperature(LST) as an effective predictor. To couple an ANN model with satellite-derived variable, the LST data over 2012-2014 are acquired in seven groups, with three sites per group where the data for first two (2012-2013) are utilised for model development and the third (2014) group for cross-validation. For monthly horizon, the ANN model is optimized by trialing 55 neuronal architectures, while for seasonal forecasting, nine neuronal architectures are trailed with time-lagged LST. ANN coupled with zero lagged LST utilised scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, and while ANN with time-lagged LST utilised Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To ascertain conclusive results, the objective model is evaluated via multiple linear regression (MLR) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithms. Results showed that an ANN model outperformed MLR and ARIMA models where an analysis yielded 39% of cumulative errors in smallest magnitude bracket, whereas MLR and ARIMA produced 15% and 25%. Superiority of an ANN model was demonstrated by site-averaged (monthly) relative error of 5.85% compared with 10.23% (MLR) and 9.60 (ARIMA) with Willmott's Index of 0.954 (ANN), 0.899 (MLR) and 0.848 (ARIMA). This work ascertains that an ANN model coupled with satellite-derived LST data can be adopted as a qualified stratagem for the proliferation of solar energy applications in locations that have an appropriate satellite footprint.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - A 57-year-old man presented to the surgical oncology clinic with a mildly tender mass under his right arm. Four years prior, the patient had a melanoma removed from his right shoulder along with an ipsilateral right axillary sentinel lymph sampling. Computed tomography (CT) scan was negative for metastatic disease at that time. The patient did not undergo completion axillary node dissection and was lost to follow-up. The patient was originally from Australia, did not tan but reported multiple sunburns before age 18. He was of Irish ancestry. He denied weight gain, fever, fatigue, anorexia, or night sweats. The patient had a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, melanoma, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. His surgical history included an appendectomy and a facial laceration repair. His brother died at 16 years old from leukemia and his mother died from colon cancer. He consumed 3 alcoholic beverages per day and denied tobacco or illicit drug use. On physical exam, the patient's temperature was 98.8° Fahrenheit, heart rate of 73 beats / minute, blood pressure of 121 / 59 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 / min. He appeared to be healthy and in no apparent distress. Cardiovascular, respiratory, breast, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological exam were unremarkable. His right axillary lymph node exam revealed a firm mass roughly 2.5 cm tall by 1.5 cm wide. This mass was biopsied and findings were consistent with metastatic melanoma. CT scan revealed small volume mediastinal adenopathy and a 4.5 cm right axillary mass. There was a 4.7 cm lesion within the anterior left lower lobe of the liver and periportal node conglomerate measuring 3.9 cm consistent with metastatic disease (Figure 1). He was negative for the BRAF V600E mutation. The patient was consented for treatment with combination immune checkpoint inhibition with ipilimumab and nivolumab. After two cycles the patient showed good response, but temporarily stopped treatment after complications related to a ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. He developed mild pneumonitis felt to be related to nivolumab, and recovered after a short course of glucocorticosteroids. Restaging CT scans were ordered after two cycles of therapy (Figure 2), which showed decrease in the size of the axillary and hepatic metastases. At six months, CT scans showed continued durable response (Figure 3).

TI  - Coexistence trend contingent to Mediterranean oaks with different leaf habits
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In a previous work we developed a mathematical model to explain the co-occurrence of evergreen and deciduous oak groups in the Mediterranean region, regarded as one of the distinctive features of Mediterranean biodiversity. The mathematical analysis showed that a stabilizing mechanism resulting from niche difference (i.e. different water use and water stress tolerance) between groups allows their coexistence at intermediate values of suitable soil water content. A simple formal derivation of the model expresses this hypothesis in a testable form linked uniquely to the actual evapo-transpiration of forests community. In the present work we ascertain whether this simplified conclusion possesses some degree of explanatory power by comparing available data on oaks distributions and remotely sensed evapotranspiration (MODIS product) in a large-scale survey embracing the western Mediterranean area. Our findings confirmed the basic assumptions of model addressed on large scale, but also revealed asymmetric responses to water use and water stress tolerance between evergreen and deciduous oaks that should be taken into account to increase the understating of species interactions and, ultimately, improve the modeling capacity to explain co-occurrence.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, historical landscape dynamics were investigated to (i) map the land use/cover types for the years 1972, 1987, 2000 and 2014; (ii) determine the types and processes of landscape dynamics; and (iii) assess the landscape fragmentation and habitat loss over time. Supervised classification of multi-temporal Landsat images was used through a pixel-based approach. Post-classification methods included systematic and random change detection, trajectories analysis and landscape fragmentation assessment. The overall accuracies (and Kappa statistics) were of 68.86% (0.63), 91.32% (0.79), 90.66% (0.88) and 91.88% (0.89) for 1972, 1987, 2000 and 2014, respectively. The spatio-temporal analyses indicated that forests, woodlands and savannahs dominated the landscapes during the four dates, though constant areal decreases were observed. The most important dynamic process was the decline of woodlands with an average annual net loss rate of -2%. Meanwhile, the most important land transformation occurred during the transition 2000-2014, due to anthropogenic pressures. Though the most important loss of vegetation greenness occurred in the unprotected areas, the overall analyses of change indicated a declining trend of land cover quality and an increasing landscape fragmentation. Sustainable conservation strategies should be promoted while focusing restoration attention on degraded lands and fragmented ecosystems in order to support rural livelihood and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - MODEL-BASED ASSESSMENT OF SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE IN FORAGE HERB ECOSYSTEMS
T2  - Sel'skokhozyaistvennaya Biologiya
M3  - Article
AB  - Stomatal conductance is an important factor which controls carbon and water exchange. By changing stomatal width, a canopy simultaneously controls both the carbon dioxide supply and water loss during transpiration. Stomatal conductance is a parameter of photosynthesis and can help to estimate canopy growth and development in ecosystems. Therefore, it is a necessary component of transpiration models. The aim of this study was to validate a stomatal conductance model using radiometric measurements of energy balance parameters for vegetated surfaces: vegetated surface temperature, sensible and latent heat flux. Considering atmospheric surface layer stability, the crop was assumed to be a "big-leaf", with stomatal conductance influenced by environmental factors. External conditions not only control stomata width, but also directly affect the transpiration processes. We have tested the stomatal conductance model by J.M. Blonquist et al. (2009) based on radiometric canopy temperature and energy balance components such as latent and sensible heat fluxes. The applicability of the model for estimating stomatal conductance using automated ground-based measurements and remote sensing was first shown. Observations were carried out at two locations with forage herbs (60 degrees 5'6"N, 30 degrees 25'27"E and 60 degrees 5'16"N, 30 degrees 24'32"E) at Bugry in the Leningradskaya Province (on May 15 and 31, 2016, respectively). Model inputs, such as air temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, radiometric temperature and net radiation of vegetated surface were measured with automatic mobile field agrometeorological equipment AMFAE (Agrophysical Research Institute), with measurements taken every 90 seconds. Ground observations were carried out simultaneously with LandSat-8 satellite data surveys. LandSat-8 is an American Earth observation satellite, it contains two instruments: OLI (Operational Land Imager) has 5 visible bands and 4 near infrared bands, TIRS (Thermal InfraRed Sensor) has 2 longwave infrared bands. LandSat-8 data is freely available on the US Geological Survey. Atmospheric correction of satellite imagery was made using the 6S (Second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum) open source model with publicly available data of aerosol optical depth at 550 nm provided by the MODIS system and the global digital elevation model ASTER GDEM (data is freely available on the US Geological Survey). Components of the energy balance including net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible and latent heat flux were calculated with the SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) model by W.G.M. Bastiaanssen (1998) using the ground observation meteorological data from AMFAE. Obtained maps of net radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes were used to estimate the spatial distribution of stomatal conductance over the forage herbs. For stomatal conductance calculations the Land Sat -8 data for pixel values representing dense vegetation (NDVI > 0.7) were used. As a result of the study, maps of forage herbs stomatal conductance were obtained depending on the canopy temperature and the components of the energy balance with a stratification of the atmosphere boundary layer.

TI  - What is a System? An Ontological Framework
T2  - SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, the definition of system has eluded researchers and practitioners. We reviewed over 100 definitions of system to understand the variations and establish a framework for a widely acceptable system definition or a family of system definitions. There is much common ground in different families of definitions of system, but there are also important and significant ontological differences. Some differences stem from the variety of belief systems and worldviews, while others have risen within particular communities. Both limit the effectiveness of system communities' efforts to communicate, collaborate, and learn from others' experience. We consider three ontological elements:(1) a worldview-based framework for typology of different system types and categories, (2) key system concepts that are fundamental to the various system types and categories, and(3) appropriate language for the target audience.In this work, we establish the ontological framework, list key concepts associated with different types of system, and point to a direction for agreeing on an integrated set of system definitions in a neutral language consistent with the framework. The definitions are compatible with both the realist and constructivist worldviews, covering real (physical, concrete) and conceptual (abstract, logical, informatical) systems, which are both human-made (artificial) and naturally occurring, using language acceptable to a wide target stakeholder audience. The contribution of this paper is setting up an ontologically founded framework of system typologies, providing definitions for system, and identifying the issues involved in achieving a widely accepted definition or family of definitions of system.

TI  - Field-aligned current response to solar indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetometer data from three satellite missions have been used to analyze and identify the effects of varying solar radiation on the magnitudes and locations of field-aligned currents in the Earth's upper atmosphere. Data from the CHAMP, Orsted, and Swarm satellite missions have been brought together to provide a database spanning a 15year period. The extensive time frame has been augmented by data from the ACE satellite, as well as a number of indices of solar radiation. This data set has been sorted by a number of solar wind, interplanetary magnetic field, and solar radiation indices to provide measurements for the field-aligned current structures in both hemispheres for arbitrary seasonal tilts. In addition, routines have been developed to extract the total current for different regions of the current structures, including regions 0, 1, and 2. Results from this study have been used to evaluate the effects of variations in four different solar indices on the total current in different regions of the polar cap. While the solar indices do not have major influence on the total current of the polar cap when compared to solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field parameters, it does appear that there is a nonlinear response to increasing F-10.7, M-10.7, and S-10.7 solar indices. Surprisingly, there appears to be a very linear response as Y-10.7 solar index increases.

TI  - An Optical Classification Tool for Global Lake Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow and deep lakes receive and recycle organic and inorganic substances from within the confines of these lakes, their watershed and beyond. Hence, a large range in absorption and scattering and extreme differences in optical variability can be found between and within global lakes. This poses a challenge for atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms applied to optical remote sensing for water quality monitoring applications. To optimize these applications for the wide variety of lake optical conditions, we adapted a spectral classification scheme based on the concept of optical water types. The optical water types were defined through a cluster analysis of in situ hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance spectra collected by partners and advisors of the European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7) Global Lakes Sentinel Services (GLaSS) project. The method has been integrated in the Envisat-BEAM software and the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and generates maps of water types from image data. Two variations of water type classification are provided: one based on area-normalized spectral reflectance focusing on spectral shape (6CN, six-class normalized) and one that retains magnitude with no modification to the reflectance signal (6C). This resulted in a protocol, or processing scheme, that can also be applied or adapted for Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) datasets. We apply both treatments to MERIS imagery of a variety of European lakes to demonstrate its applicability. The studied target lakes cover a range of biophysical types, from shallow turbid to deep and clear, as well as eutrophic and dark absorbing waters, rich in colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). In shallow, high-reflecting Dutch and Estonian lakes with high sediment load, 6C performed better, while in deep, low-reflecting clear Italian and Swedish lakes, 6CN performed better. The 6CN classification of in situ data is promising for very dark, high CDOM, absorbing lakes, but we show that our atmospheric correction of the imagery was insufficient to corroborate this. We anticipate that the application of the protocol to other lakes with unknown in-water characterization, but with comparable biophysical properties will suggest similar atmospheric correction (AC) and in-water retrieval algorithms for global lakes.

TI  - Nanoparticles as Theranostic Vehicles in Experimental and Clinical Applications-Focus on Prostate and Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Prostate and breast cancer are the second most and most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and women worldwide, respectively. The American Cancer Society estimates that during 2016 in the USA around 430,000 individuals were diagnosed with one of these two types of cancers, and approximately 15% of them will die from the disease. In Europe, the rate of incidences and deaths are similar to those in the USA. Several different more or less successful diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have been developed and evaluated in order to tackle this issue and thereby decrease the death rates. By using nanoparticles as vehicles carrying both diagnostic and therapeutic molecular entities, individualized targeted theranostic nanomedicine has emerged as a promising option to increase the sensitivity and the specificity during diagnosis, as well as the likelihood of survival or prolonged survival after therapy. This article presents and discusses important and promising different kinds of nanoparticles, as well as imaging and therapy options, suitable for theranostic applications. The presentation of different nanoparticles and theranostic applications is quite general, but there is a special focus on prostate cancer. Some references and aspects regarding breast cancer are however also presented and discussed. Finally, the prostate cancer case is presented in more detail regarding diagnosis, staging, recurrence, metastases, and treatment options available today, followed by possible ways to move forward applying theranostics for both prostate and breast cancer based on promising experiments performed until today.

TI  - Phenologically distinct phytoplankton regions on the Faroe Shelf-identified by satellite data, <i>in-situ</i> observations and model
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marked inter-annual fluctuations in the primary production on the Faroe shelf propagate to higher trophic levels and influence commercial fish stocks. This has previously been demonstrated based on weekly chlorophyll samples from a coastal station, dating back to 1997.However, the spatial extent, for which the coastal samples are representative, has not been well defined, and potential bio-geographical segregations of the shelf have not been considered. By integrating 18 years of chlorophyll satellite data, supplemented by in-situ, model, and meteorological reanalysis data, we identify three regions with unique characteristics with regards to surface chlorophyll and vertical structure - the Central Shelf, the Outer Shelf and the Eastern Banks. The observed difference in timing of the spring bloom in these regions helps explain different spawning patterns of important fish stocks, and the spatial division of the Faroe Shelf should be considered when studying biology and hydrography in these waters.A positive correlation between annual means on the outer Fame Shelf and parts of the outer northwest Scottish Shelf indicates similarities between these neighbouring regions.We suggest that this similarity arises from the commonality in nutrient composition of the water masses shared by these neighbouring regions.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Military to civilian nurse: Personal and professional reconstruction
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims and objectives. To examine and describe the transition process of military nurses from military nursing practice to civilian nursing practice. A second aim was to identify challenges and facilitators to this transition.Background. Serving in the military, and embodying its values, can have a major impact on a person's worldview. These individuals serve not only as nurses but also as part of a larger military culture with a mission to protect. The decision to separate from the military and transition into the civilian workforce carries many challenges capable of influencing nurses' personal and professional identities.Design. Qualitative descriptive.Methods. Semi-structured interviews of 10 nurse veterans were conducted in 2015-2016. Data were collected until saturation was reached.Results. The transition includes four major phases from military to civilian nurse: Separating from Military Life, Conflict and Chaos, Shifting Sands and Personal and Professional Reconstruction. Duration and progress through each phase varied slightly for individual nurses.Conclusions. Both work-role and personal identity transition occur when a nurse leaves the military and enters civilian practice. Military and civilian organisations, in both the USA and other countries, can implement supports to aid these nurses during this personal and professional change. Recommendations from the study group are provided.Relevance to clinical practice. The global nursing profession, as well as healthcare organisations that employ nurse veterans, has a commitment and obligation to understand the transition process of nurses who practise within the scope of military nursing and later in civilian nursing environments so that they may be supported and used to the extent of their prior experience. Lessons learned and advice from this group of nurses may positively aid others in their transition experience.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation in Suspended Sediment Concentrations and Related Factors of Coastal Waters Based on Multispatial Satellite Data in Gyeonggi Bay, Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The variations in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in turbid coastal waters around Gyeonggi Bay, Korea were analyzed using multiresolution ocean-color satellite imagery. Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and Land Satellite 7 (Landsat-7) Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were atmospherically corrected, and an empirical algorithm was employed to generate maps of SSCs in the study area and investigate daily and annual variabilities in coastal water turbidity. SSC values were highest around 6 hours before high tide and around low tide, and the maximum values had strong positive relations with the tidal range near the sand ridge and channel (R-2 values of 0.74 and 0.72, respectively), which implies that the main driver of the diurnal variability in SSC is resuspension of bottom sediment by tides in areas of shallow water. Annually, the maximum SSC value near the sand ridge was about 400 g m(-3), showing remarkable variation over tidal cycles, whereas it was about 10 g m(-3) in the open sea, with little variation. The SSC around the sand ridge was higher in winter than in summer, mainly because of stronger resuspension resulting from winds during the NW monsoon in winter. The SSC around the Han River estuary was higher in summer than in winter because of the river discharge, which indicates that suspended sediments supplied by the Han River do not significantly affect SSC variation in the open ocean. This study revealed that application of the high temporal resolution of GOCI, combined with the high spatial resolution of Landsat-7 ETM+, can be useful for monitoring short- and long-term variations in SSC in Korean coastal waters.

TI  - A Comparison of the Detection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Using Indocyanine Green and Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging Versus Blue Dye During Robotic Surgery in Uterine Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to assess and compare the sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rate with indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared fluorescence imaging versus blue dye using the robotic platform in patients with uterine cancer.Methods We identified all patients with uterine cancer undergoing SLN mapping using ICG or blue dye on the robotic platform from January 2011 to December 2013. Our institutional SLN algorithm and pathologic processing protocol were adhered to uniformly. We compared detection rates of SLNs stratified by dye used. Appropriate statistical tests were used.Results A total of 472 patients were identified. ICG was used in 312 patients (66%) and blue dye in 160 patients (34%). Successful mapping was achieved in 425 (90%) of 472 patients. Mapping was bilateral in 352 patients (75%) and unilateral in 73 patients (15%); 47 patients (10%) did not map. Successful mapping was achieved in 295 (95%) of 312 patients using ICG compared with 130 (81%) of 160 patients using blue dye (P < 0.001). Mapping was bilateral in 266 (85%) of 312 patients in the ICG group compared with 86 (54%) of 160 in the blue dye group (P < 0.001). Additional lymph node dissection beyond removal of the SLNs was performed in 122 patients (39%) mapped with ICG compared with 98 patients (61%) mapped with blue dye (P < 0.001).Conclusions The SLN detection rate was superior when mapping with ICG rather than blue dye. Bilateral mapping was significantly improved, resulting in a lower rate of additional lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Impact of a 31-gene Expression Profiling Test for Cutaneous Melanoma on Dermatologists' Clinical Management Decisions
T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUGS IN DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance: Current guidelines for cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) provide general recommendations regarding surveillance while indicating that management should be tailored to patients' individual probability of recurrence. A 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test to predict metastatic risk has been previously validated, and classifies patients as either Class 1 (low risk) or Class 2 (high risk).Objective: To determine the impact of the 31-GEP test's result on clinical decision-making.Design, Setting, and Participants: Dermatology residents who attended a national educational conference were presented with clinical validity evidence for the 31-GEP. Respondents were given six CMM patient vignettes with descriptions of clinical features and answered questions about their willingness to recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx) or imaging based on each scenario. Additionally, respondents were asked to provide the Breslow thickness (BT), ranging from 0.7-1.5mm in 0.1mm increments, at which they would recommend SLNBx, imaging, or oncology referral.Main Outcomes and Measures: The number of respondents who would recommend each management modality based upon three outcomes (no result, Class 1, or Class 2) was quantified. Differences between response groups were assessed using Fisher's exact test.Results: The majority of respondents (62%, 57%, and 55%, respectively) indicated a 1.0mm BT as the guiding modality, reflecting adherence to current guidelines. After inclusion of a Class 2 result, the BT used to guide SLNBx, oncology referral, and imaging was changed in 47%, 50% and 47% of the responses, respectively, with 95%, 84% and 97% of the cases, respectively, changed in a risk appropriate direction (decreased BT). Based on a 31-GEP Class 1 or Class 2 result, risk appropriate recommendations were more likely to be made for each management modality tested in five of the six patient vignettes (P<0.05).Conclusions and Relevance: The 31-GEP test had a significant and appropriate impact on management while remaining within the context of established guidelines.

TI  - Meso-scale eddy in the South China Sea simulated by an eddy-resolving ocean model
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale eddies (MEs) in the South China Sea (SCS) simulated by a quasi-global eddy-resolving ocean general circulation model are evaluated against satellite data during 1993-2007. The modeled ocean data show more activity than shown by the satellite data and reproduces more eddies in the SCS. A total of 345 (428) cyclonic eddies (CEs) and 330 (371) anti-cyclonic eddies (AEs) generated for satellite (model) data are identified during the study period, showing increase of 24% and 12% for the model data, respectively. Compared with eddies in satellite, the simulated eddies tend to have smaller radii, larger amplitudes, a slightly longer lifetime, faster movement and rotation speed, a slightly larger nonlinear properties (U/c) in the model. However, the spatial distribution of generated eddies appears to be inhomogeneous, with more CEs in the northern part of SCS and fewer AEs in the southern part. This is attributed to the exaggerated Kuroshio intrusion in the model because the small islands in the Luzon Strait are still not well resolved although the horizontal resolution reaches (1/10)A degrees. The seasonal variability in the number and the amplitude of eddies generated is also investigated.

TI  - Groundwater storage variations in the North China Plain from GRACE with spatial constraints
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest agricultural production area and an industrial, political and economic center of China, the North China Plain (NCP) is facing severe water shortages. Here we present a joint analysis of groundwater storage (GWS) variations in the NCP using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, hydrological models, phreatic well observations, and groundwater models. Spatial constraints with the Tikhonov regularization are applied to original temporal gravity field products from GRACE, to minimize the leakage-out effect of mass variations in the NCP. From 2002 to 2014, GRACE detects significant GWS depletion in the NCP, at a rate of -7.40 +/- 0.9 km(3) . a(-1). The GWS depletion rate in shallow unconfined aquifers of NCP estimated from phreatic well observations is -1.2 km(3) . a(-1), far smaller than the GRACE estimate. The significant difference between them indicates the large GWS depletion in the confined aquifers of NCP. From 2002 to 2008, the GWS rate from GRACE is 5.3 +/- 2.2km(3) . a(-1), which agrees well with the mean rate from two regional groundwater models (i.e., -5.4 km(3) . a(-1)). Good agreement between them confirms the potential of GRACE to estimate GWS variations in the NCP. Besides the long-term depletion of GWS in the NCP, significant interannual GWS variations are detected by GRACE and well observations, which are related to precipitation anomalies in this region. During the drought years, i.e., 2002, 2005-2009, and 2014, GWS in the NCP decreases correspondingly. In spatial domain, large GWS depletion in the piedmont region of the Taihang Mountains and central plains of NCP is detected by GRACE, which agrees with well observations and regional groundwater models. Comparing with GRACE and regional groundwater models, global hydrological models, which simulate groundwater changes, fail to estimate GWS variations in the NCP with an acceptable accuracy or a reasonable spatial pattern. For example, WGHM overestimates the GWS rate in the NCP, while PCR-GLOBWB fails to simulate the spatial pattern of GWS in the NCP. This study indicates that GRACE provides an important observation tool to assess GWS variations in the NCP.

TI  - SMOS-IC: An Alternative SMOS Soil Moisture and Vegetation Optical Depth Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission over land surfaces is the production of global maps of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (tau) based on multi-angular brightness temperature (TB) measurements at L-band. The operational SMOS Level 2 and Level 3 soil moisture algorithms account for different surface effects, such as vegetation opacity and soil roughness at 4 km resolution, in order to produce global retrievals of SM and t. In this study, we present an alternative SMOS product that was developed by INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique) and CESBIO (Centre d'Etudes Spatiales de la BIOsphere). One of the main goals of this SMOS-INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) product is to be as independent as possible from auxiliary data. The SMOS-IC product provides daily SM and t at the global scale and differs from the operational SMOS Level 3 (SMOSL3) product in the treatment of retrievals over heterogeneous pixels. Specifically, SMOS-IC is much simpler and does not account for corrections associated with the antenna pattern and the complex SMOS viewing angle geometry. It considers pixels as homogeneous to avoid uncertainties and errors linked to inconsistent auxiliary datasets which are used to characterize the pixel heterogeneity in the SMOS L3 algorithm. SMOS-IC also differs from the current SMOSL3 product (Version 300, V300) in the values of the effective vegetation scattering albedo (omega) and soil roughness parameters. An inter-comparison is presented in this study based on the use of ECMWF (European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting) SM outputs and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). A six-year (2010-2015) inter-comparison of the SMOS products SMOS-IC and SMOSL3 SM (V300) with ECMWF SM yielded higher correlations and lower ubRMSD (unbiased root mean square difference) for SMOS-IC over most of the pixels. In terms of tau, SMOS-IC t was found to be better correlated to MODIS NDVI in most regions of the globe, with the exception of the Amazonian basin and the northern mid-latitudes.

TI  - Identification of high-risk cutaneous melanoma tumors is improved when combining the online American Joint Committee on Cancer Individualized Melanoma Patient Outcome Prediction Tool with a 31-gene expression profile-based classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A significant proportion of patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)-defined early-stage cutaneous melanoma have disease recurrence and die. A 31-gene expression profile (GEP) that accurately assesses metastatic risk associated with primary cutaneous melanomas has been described.Objective: We sought to compare accuracy of the GEP in combination with risk determined using the web-based AJCC Individualized Melanoma Patient Outcome Prediction Tool.Methods: GEP results from 205 stage I/II cutaneous melanomas with sufficient clinical data for prognostication using the AJCC tool were classified as low (class 1) or high (class 2) risk. Two 5-year overall survival cutoffs (AJCC 79% and 68%), reflecting survival for patients with stage IIA or IIB disease, respectively, were assigned for binary AJCC risk.Results: Cox univariate analysis revealed significant risk classification of distant metastasis-free and overall survival (hazard ratio range 3.2-9.4, P < . 001) for both tools. In all, 43 (21%) cases had discordant GEP and AJCC classification (using 79% cutoff). Eleven of 13 (85%) deaths in that group were predicted as high risk by GEP but low risk by AJCC.Limitations: Specimens reflect tertiary care center referrals; more effective therapies have been approved for clinical use after accrual.Conclusions: The GEP provides valuable prognostic information and improves identification of high-risk melanomas when used together with the AJCC online prediction tool.

TI  - Estimation of corn yield using multi-temporal optical and radar satellite data and artificial neural networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The yield forecasting of corn constitutes a key issue in agricultural management, particularly in the context of demographic pressure and climate change. This study presents two methods to estimate yields using artificial neural networks: a diagnostic approach based on all the satellite data acquired throughout the agricultural season, and a real-time approach, where estimates are updated after each image was acquired in the microwave and optical domains (Formosat-2, Spot-4/5, TerraSAR-X, and Radarsat-2) throughout the crop cycle. The results are based on the Multispectral Crop Monitoring experimental campaign conducted by the CESBIO (Centre d'Etudes de la BIOsphere) laboratory in 2010 over an agricultural region in southwestern France. Among the tested sensor configurations (multi-frequency, multi-polarization or multi-source data), the best yield estimation performance (using the diagnostic approach) is obtained with reflectance acquired in the red wavelength region, with a coefficient of determination of 0.77 and an RMSE of 6.6 q ha(-1). in the real-time approach the combination of red reflectance and C-HH backscattering coefficients provides the best compromise between the accuracy and earliness of the yield estimate (more than 3 months before the harvest), with an R-2 of 0.69 and an RMSE of 7.0 q ha-1 during the development of the central stem. The two best yield estimates are similar in most cases (for more than 80% of the monitored fields), and the differences are related to discrepancies in the crop growth cycle and/or the consequences of pests.

TI  - Healthcare Costs Reduced After Incorporating the Results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 Trial into Clinical Practice
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of our study was to quantitate the changes in axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), frozen section (FS), and the impact on costs after the publication of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial. We compared axillary nodal management and cost data in breast cancer patients who met Z0011 criteria and were treated with lumpectomy and sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) biopsy from 2007 to July 2013. Of 800 patients, 67 (13.5%) and 34 (12.5%) patients in the pre-and post-Z0011 era had 1-2 positive SLN. ALND decreased from 78% to 21% (p < 0.001) after publication of Z0011. The mean overall cost of SLN biopsy was $41,059 per patient, while SLN biopsy with completion ALND was $50,999 (p < 0.001). Intraoperative FS use decreased from 95% to 66% (p = 0.015). Omitting the FS decreased mean costs from $4,319 to $2,036. The application of Z0011 resulted in an overall mean cost savings of $571,653 from 2011 to July 2013. ACOSOG Z0011 significantly impacted axillary management resulting in a 20% reduction in the mean overall cost per patient by omitting ALND. In these patients, intraoperative FS analysis had poor sensitivity (56%) and doubled the cost of pathologic examination. Fewer ALND and intraoperative FS were performed after the publication of ACOSOG Z0011. Eliminating FS and ALND in patients who met Z0011 criteria, results in significant cost savings.

TI  - Adaptation of a malaria surveillance system for use in a visceral leishmaniasis elimination programme
T2  - INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful public practice relies on generation and use of high-quality data. A data surveillance system (the Disease Data Management System [DDMS]) in use for malaria was adapted for use in the Indian visceral leishmaniasis elimination programme.A situational analysis identified the data flows in current use. Taxonomic trees for the vector of visceral leishmaniasis in India, Phlebotomus argentipes, were incorporated into the DDMS to allow entry of quality assurance and insecticide susceptibility data. A new quality assurance module was created to collate the concentration of DDT that was applied to walls during the indoor residual spraying (IRS) vector control programme.The DDMS was implemented in Bihar State and used to collate and manage data from sentinel sites in eight districts. Quality assurance data showed that DDT was under-applied to walls during IRS; this, combined with insecticide susceptibility data showing widespread vector resistance to DDT prompted a national policy change to using compression pumps and alpha-cypermethrin insecticide for IRS.The adapted DDMS centralises programmatic data and enhances evidence-based decision making and active policy change. Moving forward, further modules of the system will be implemented, allowing extended data capture and streamlined transmission of key information to decision makers.

TI  - EO-1 Data Quality and Sensor Stability with Changing Orbital Precession at the End of a 16 Year Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth Observing One (EO-1) satellite has completed 16 years of Earth observations in early 2017. What started as a technology mission to test various new advancements turned into a science and application mission that extended many years beyond the satellite's planned life expectancy. EO-1's primary instruments are spectral imagers: Hyperion, the only civilian full spectrum spectrometer (430-2400 nm) in orbit, and the Advanced Land Imager (ALI), the prototype for Landsat-8's pushbroom imaging technology. Both Hyperion and ALI instruments have continued to perform well, but in February 2011, the satellite ran out of the fuel necessary to maintain orbit, which initiated a change in precession rate that led to increasingly earlier equatorial crossing times during its last five years. The change from EO-1's original orbit, when it was formation flying with Landsat-7 at a 10: 01 a.m. equatorial overpass time, to earlier overpass times results in image acquisitions with increasing solar zenith angles (SZAs). This study takes several approaches to characterize data quality as SZAs increased. The results show that for both EO-1 sensors, atmospherically corrected reflectance products, are within 5 to 10% of mean pre-drift products. No marked trend in decreasing quality in ALI or Hyperion is apparent through 2016, and these data remain a high quality resource through the end of the mission.

TI  - Carbapenem-Resistant <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>: A Strategic Roadmap for Infection Control
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The incidence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has increased worldwide with great regional variability. Infections caused by these organisms are associated with crude mortality rates of up to 70%. The spread of CRE in healthcare settings is both an important medical problem and a major global public health threat. All countries are at risk of falling victim to the emergence of CRE; therefore, a preparedness plan is required to avoid the catastrophic natural course of this epidemic. Proactive and adequate preventive measures locally, regionally, and nationally are required to contain the spread of these bacteria. The keys to success in preventing the establishment of CRE endemicity in a region are early detection through targeted laboratory protocols and containment of spread through comprehensive infection control measures. This guideline provides a strategic roadmap for infection control measures based on the best available evidence and expert opinion, to enable preparation of a multifaceted preparedness plan to abort epidemics of CRE.

TI  - Lithological mapping with multispectral data - setup and application of a spectral database for rocks in the Balakot area, Northern Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the frame of landslide susceptibility assessment, a spectral library was created to support the identification of materials confined to a particular region using remote sensing images. This library, called Pakistan spectral library (pklib) version 0.1, contains the analysis data of sixty rock samples taken in the Balakot region in Northern Pakistan. The spectral library is implemented as SQLite database. Structure and naming are inspired by the convention system of the ASTER Spectral Library. Usability, application and benefit of the pklib were evaluated and depicted taking two approaches, the multivariate and the spectral based. The spectral information were used to create indices. The indices were applied to Landsat and ASTER data to support the spatial delineation of outcropping rock sequences in stratigraphic formations. The application of the indices introduced in this paper helps to identify spots where specific lithological characteristics occur. Especially in areas with sparse or missing detailed geological mapping, the spectral discrimination via remote sensing data can speed up the survey. The library can be used not only to support the improvement of factor maps for landslide susceptibility analysis, but also to provide a geoscientific basis to further analyze the lithological spot in numerous regions in the Hindu Kush.

TI  - Snow Disaster Early Warning in Pastoral Areas of Qinghai Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to predict snow disasters to prevent and reduce hazards in pastoral areas. In this study, we build a potential risk assessment model based on a logistic regression of 33 snow disaster events that occurred in Qinghai Province. A simulation model of the snow disaster early warning is established using a back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) method and is then validated. The results show: (1) the potential risk of a snow disaster in the Qinghai Province is mainly determined by five factors. Three factors are positively associated, the maximum snow depth, snow-covered days (SCDs), and slope, and two are negative factors, annual mean temperature and per capita gross domestic product (GDP); (2) the key factors that contribute to the prediction of a snow disaster are (from the largest to smallest contribution): the mean temperature, probability of a spring snow disaster, potential risk of a snow disaster, continual days of a mean daily temperature below -5 degrees C, and fractional snow-covered area; and (3) the BP-ANN model for an early warning of snow disaster is a practicable predictive method with an overall accuracy of 80%. This model has quite a few advantages over previously published models, such as it is raster-based, has a high resolution, and has an ideal capacity of generalization and prediction. The model output not only tells which county has a disaster (published models can) but also tells where and the degree of damage at a 500 m pixel scale resolution (published models cannot).

TI  - Assessing the status of glaciers in part of the Chandra basin, Himachal Himalaya: A multiparametric approach
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the change in multiple glacier parameters of three valley-type glaciers (Sakchum (SC), Chhota Shigri (CS), and Bara Shigri (BS)) located in Chandra basin, Himachal Himalaya, sharing the same climatic regime, and assesses the control of nonclimatic factors on wholesome glacier response. Multitemporal satellite remote sensing data from Landsat-TM/ETM/OLI (1993-2014), and Terra-ASTER (2002-2014) along with an SRTM digital elevation model were used for extraction of the glacier parameters. Results show that while SC and BS retreated (SC: 10.65 +/- 2.52 m/y; BS: 15.51 +/- 2.52 m/y) and lost area (SC: 0.49 +/- 0.0032 km(2), BS: 1.18 +/- 0.0032 km(2)), the CS remained relatively stable (retreat rate: 4.06 +/- 2.52 m/y, area loss: 0.19 +/- 0.0032 km(2)) during 1993-2014. However, results of surface ice velocities (SIV) change (SC: 24.41%, CS: 21.60%, and BS: 28.49%) and surface elevation change (SC: - 1.22 m/y, CS: - 0.91 m/y and BS: - 1.21 m/y) suggest a comparable slowing down and surface lowering from 2002 to 2014. Debris cover also varied substantially (SC: 30.25%, CS: 11.96%, BS: 19.61%) on these glaciers. Results reveal that higher retreat/deglaciation of glaciers was associated with higher altitudinal range, slow SIV in lower ablation zones (LAZ), and glacier hypsometry. Debris cover on glaciers was found to be controlled by slope, higher deglaciation rates, higher SN in the upper ablation zone (UAZ) coupled with lower SIV in LAZ and surface lowering. Glacier SN was primarily governed by slope gradient, differential surface lowering, and size of accumulation zone (ACZ). The SN results confirm the presence of stagnant zones in the lower ablations of SC (<1 km upstream) and BS (<6 km upstream) and a major SIV dropdown in the UAZ (SC: 34.48%, BS: 3735%), indicating the expansion of stagnant zones farther up. Glacier surface lowering seemed to be influenced by ice-flux, changing spatial distribution of debris cover, presence of supraglacial lakes, and ice cliffs bordering them. Melting around supraglacial lakes and backwasting of ice cliffs may be the prime reasons behind intense mass loss observed in the stagnant zone of the Bara Shigri glacier, where surface lowering was similar to 32% higher than glacier-wide thinning. Differential surface lowering in glaciers reduced the surface gradient and hence the SN. Also, rapid surface gradient changes and SN dropdown in the Sakchum glacier indicate possible development of supraglacial lakes on it in the future. Interestingly, despite close proximity, SC, CS, and BS demonstrate three distinct ablation patterns, reemphasizing the role of nonclimatic factors. Overall, the study states that mutual variation of glacier parameters together with.nonclimatic factors exercise a great control on glacier response. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Surface Reflectance and Sun-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy Measurements Using a Small Hyperspectral UAS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the development of a small hyperspectral Unmanned Aircraft System (HyUAS) for measuring Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) surface reflectance and sun-induced fluorescence, co-registered with high-resolution RGB imagery, to support field spectroscopy surveys and calibration and validation of remote sensing products. The system, namely HyUAS, is based on a multirotor platform equipped with a cost-effective payload composed of a VNIR non-imaging spectrometer and an RGB camera. The spectrometer is connected to a custom entrance optics receptor developed to tune the instrument field-of-view and to obtain systematic measurements of instrument dark-current. The geometric, radiometric and spectral characteristics of the instruments were characterized and calibrated through dedicated laboratory tests. The overall accuracy of HyUAS data was evaluated during a flight campaign in which surface reflectance was compared with ground-based reference measurements. HyUAS data were used to estimate spectral indices and far-red fluorescence for different land covers. RGB images were processed as a high-resolution 3D surface model using structure from motion algorithms. The spectral measurements were accurately geo-located and projected on the digital surface model. The overall results show that: (i) rigorous calibration enabled radiance and reflectance spectra from HyUAS with RRMSE < 10% compared with ground measurements; (ii) the low-flying UAS setup allows retrieving fluorescence in absolute units; (iii) the accurate geo-location of spectra on the digital surface model greatly improves the overall interpretation of reflectance and fluorescence data. In general, the HyUAS was demonstrated to be a reliable system for supporting high-resolution field spectroscopy surveys allowing one to collect systematic measurements at very detailed spatial resolution with a valuable potential for vegetation monitoring studies. Furthermore, it can be considered a useful tool for collecting spatially-distributed observations of reflectance and fluorescence that can be further used for calibration and validation activities of airborne and satellite optical images in the context of the upcoming FLEX mission and the VNIR spectral bands of optical Earth observation missions (i.e., Landsat, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3).

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS Albedo Product over Ice Caps in Iceland and Impact of Volcanic Eruptions on Their Albedo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Albedo is a key variable in the response of glaciers to climate. In Iceland, large albedo variations of the ice caps may be caused by the deposition of volcanic ash (tephra). Sparse in situ measurements are insufficient to characterize the spatial variation of albedo over the ice caps due to their large size. Here we evaluated the latest MCD43 MODIS albedo product (collection 6) to monitor albedo changes over the Icelandic ice caps using albedo measurements from ten automatic weather stations on Vatnajokull and Langjokull. Furthermore, we examined the influence of the albedo variability within MODIS pixels by comparing the results with a collection of Landsat scenes. The results indicate a good ability of the MODIS product to characterize the seasonal and interannual albedo changes with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.47 to 0.90 (median 0.84) and small biases ranging from 0.07 to 0.09. The root-mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.08 to 0.21, are larger than that from previous studies, but we did not discard the retrievals flagged as bad quality to maximize the amount of observations given the frequent cloud obstruction in Iceland. We found a positive but non-significant relationship between the RMSE and the subpixel variability as indicated by the standard deviation of the Landsat albedo within a MODIS pixel (R = 0.48). The summer albedo maps and time series computed from the MODIS product show that the albedo decreased significantly after the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull and 2011 Grimsvotn eruptions on all the main ice caps except the northernmost Drangajokull. A strong reduction of the summer albedo by up to 0.6 is observed over large regions of the accumulation areas. These data can be assimilated in an energy and mass balance model to better understand the relative influence of the volcanic and climate forcing to the ongoing mass losses of Icelandic ice caps.

TI  - A study on uterine lymphatic anatomy for standardization of pelvic sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To describe the anatomy of uterine lymphatic drainage following cervical or fundal tracer injection to enable standardization of a pelvic sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept in endometrial cancer (EC).Methods. A prospective consecutive study of women with EC was conducted. A fluorescent dye (Indocyanine green) was injected into the cervix (n = 60) or the uterine fundus (n = 30). A systematic trans- and retroperitoneal mapping of uterine lymphatic drainage was performed. Positions of the pelvic SLNs, defined by afferent lymph vessels, and lymph node metastases were compared.Results. Two consistent lymphatic pathways with pelvic SLNs were identified irrespective of injection site; an upper paracervical pathway (UPP) with draining medial external and/or obturator lymph nodes and a lower paracervical pathway (LPP) with draining internal iliac and/or presacral lymph nodes. Bilateral display of at least one pelvic pathway following cervical and fundal injection occurred in 98% and 80% respectively (p = 0.005). Bilateral display of both pelvic pathways occurred in 30% and 20% respectively (p = 0.6) as the LPP was less often displayed. Nearly one third of the 19% node positive patients had metastases along the LPP. No false negative SLNs were identified.Conclusions. Based on uterine lymphatic anatomy a bilateral detection of at least one SLN in both the UPP and LPP should be aimed for. Absence of display of the LPP may warrant a full presacral lymphadenectomy. Although pelvic pathways and positions of SLNs are independent of the tracer injection Site, cervical injection is preferable due to a higher technical success rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Satellite-observed changes in vegetation sensitivities to surface soil moisture and total water storage variations since the 2011 Texas drought
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We combine soil moisture (SM) data from AMSR-E and AMSR-2, and changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) from time-variable gravity data from GRACE to delineate and characterize the evolution of drought and its impact on vegetation growth. GRACE-derived TWS provides spatially continuous observations of changes in overall water supply and regional drought extent, persistence and severity, while satellite-derived SM provides enhanced delineation of shallow-depth soil water supply. Together these data provide complementary metrics quantifying available plant water supply. We use these data to investigate the supply changes from water components at different depths in relation to satellite-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) from MODIS and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2, during and following major drought events observed in the state of Texas, USA and its surrounding semiarid area for the past decade. We find that in normal years the spatial pattern of the vegetation-moisture relationship follows the gradient in mean annual precipitation. However since the 2011 hydrological drought, vegetation growth shows enhanced sensitivity to surface SM variations in the grassland area located in central Texas, implying that the grassland, although susceptible to drought, has the capacity for a speedy recovery. Vegetation dependency on TWS weakens in the shrub-dominated west and strengthens in the grassland and forest area spanning from central to eastern Texas, consistent with changes in water supply pattern. We find that in normal years GRACE TWS shows strong coupling and similar characteristic time scale to surface SM, while in drier years GRACE TWS manifests stronger persistence, implying longer recovery time and prolonged water supply constraint on vegetation growth. The synergistic combination of GRACE TWS and surface SM, along with remote-sensing vegetation observations provides new insights into drought impact on vegetation-moisture relationship, and unique information regarding vegetation resilience and the recovery of hydrological drought.

AB  - Determining surface morphology using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data requires accurate topographic and microtopographic models. To distinguish different surface geometric patterns and to differentiate the formation of geological rock surfaces, it is necessary to model the smoothness and roughness of surfaces based on radar signal backscattering. Euclidean geometry is less able than fractal geometry to describe natural phenomena; however, in application to radar backscattering models, fractal geometry has never fully replaced Euclidean geometry. Using fractal geometry only, this paper attempts to improve the backscattering simulation generated by an Integral Equation Model to improve the description of geological rock surfaces. As the application of radar signal backscattering is a rarity in the domain of geology, the paper also discusses the efficiency of the method in improving the results of conventional geological mapping methods. The proposed method is applied to the Anaran geological formation (between Dehloran and Ilam in IRAN) using TerraSAR-X SAR data and in situ roughness measurements on pure sites with rough, intermediate, and smooth morphologies. This implementation shows fractal and diffractal behavior of geological morphologies under various conditions. (C) 2017 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization of the Spatial Variability of <i>In</i>-<i>Situ</i> Soil Moisture Measurements for Upscaling at the Spatial Resolution of RADARSAT-2
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study characterizes the spatial variability of soil moisture measurements using statistical and geostatistical analyses for the transferability of the ground measurements to the scale of the spatial resolution of RADARSAT-2 images. It aims to better interpret synthetic aperture radar backscattering relationships to soil moisture. Coincident with RADARSAT-2 overpasses, soil and crop parameters were measured in July 2008 and August 2009 over two Canadian agricultural sites (Kenaston, Saskatchewan, and Lennoxville, Quebec). The measured soil moisture was used to determine the theoretical semivariogram models that fit the experimental semivariograms. Aninverse correlation is obtained between the soil moisture coefficient of variation (CV) and the range (spatial correlation) of the semivariogram, which can assess the degree of the spatial correlation between the samples of each field. Soil moisture measurements with high values of CV (20%-40%) are correlated within a distance less than 10 m and those with lower CV (10%-20%) are correlated within a larger distance varying between 12 and 46 m. The soil moisture measurements of each field were upscaled to the spatial resolution of RADARSAT-2 images (6 x 5 and 9 x 5 m(2)) using either simple kriging or ordinary kriging. The results were cross validated using the surface scattering component, which is extracted from the Freeman-Durden decomposition applied to fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 images. They show that the kriging-based soil moisture better represents RADARSAT-2 surface scattering with strong clustered linear regressions (R-2 greater than similar to 0.6, RMSE lower than similar to 0.9 dB, and p-value of slope less than 0.05) than the nonkriged soil moisture samples.

TI  - Climate Variability and Mangrove Cover Dynamics at Species Level in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are complex in nature. For monitoring the impact of climate variability in this ecosystem, a multidisciplinary approach is a prerequisite. Changes in temperature and rainfall pattern have been suggested as an influential factor responsible for the change in mangrove species composition and spatial distribution. The main aim of this study was to assess the relationship between temperature, rainfall pattern and dynamics of mangrove species in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh, over a 38 year time period from 1977 to 2015. To assess the relationship, a three stage analytical process was employed. Primarily, the trend of temperature and rainfall over the study period were identified using a linear trend model; then, the supervised maximum likelihood classifier technique was employed to classify images recorded by Landsat series and post-classification comparison techniques were used to detect changes at species level. The rate of change of different mangrove species was also estimated in the second stage. Finally, the relationship between temperature, rainfall and the dynamics of mangroves at species level was determined using a simple linear regression model. The results show a significant statistical relationship between temperature, rainfall and the dynamics of mangrove species. The trends of change for Heritiera fomes and Sonneratia apelatala show a strong relationship with temperature and rainfall, while Ceriops decandra shows a weak relationship. In contrast, Excoecaria agallocha and Xylocarpus mekongensis do not show any significant relationship with temperature and rainfall. On the basis of our results, it can be concluded that temperature and rainfall are important climatic factors influencing the dynamics of three major mangrove species viz. H. fomes, S. apelatala and C. decandra in the Sundarbans.

TI  - Mobile Phone Surveys for Collecting Population-Level Estimates in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Literature Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: National and subnational level surveys are important for monitoring disease burden, prioritizing resource allocation, and evaluating public health policies. As mobile phone access and ownership become more common globally, mobile phone surveys (MPSs) offer an opportunity to supplement traditional public health household surveys.Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the current landscape of MPSs to collect population-level estimates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Methods: Primary and gray literature from 7 online databases were systematically searched for studies that deployed MPSs to collect population-level estimates. Titles and abstracts were screened on primary inclusion and exclusion criteria by two research assistants. Articles that met primary screening requirements were read in full and screened for secondary eligibility criteria. Articles included in review were grouped into the following three categories by their survey modality: (1) interactive voice response (IVR), (2) short message service (SMS), and (3) human operator or computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI). Data were abstracted by two research assistants. The conduct and reporting of the review conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.Results: A total of 6625 articles were identified through the literature review. Overall, 11 articles were identified that contained 19 MPS (CATI, IVR, or SMS) surveys to collect population-level estimates across a range of topics. MPSs were used in Latin America (n=8), the Middle East (n=1), South Asia (n=2), and sub-Saharan Africa (n=8). Nine articles presented results for 10 CATI surveys (10/19, 53%). Two articles discussed the findings of 6 IVR surveys (6/19, 32%). Three SMS surveys were identified from 2 articles (3/19, 16%). Approximately 63% (12/19) of MPS were delivered to mobile phone numbers collected from previously administered household surveys. The majority of MPS (11/19, 58%) were panel surveys where a cohort of participants, who often were provided a mobile phone upon a face-to-face enrollment, were surveyed multiple times.Conclusions: Very few reports of population-level MPS were identified. Of the MPS that were identified, the majority of surveys were conducted using CATI. Due to the limited number of identified IVR and SMS surveys, the relative advantages and disadvantages among the three survey modalities cannot be adequately assessed. The majority of MPS were sent to mobile phone numbers that were collected from a previously administered household survey. There is limited evidence on whether a random digit dialing (RDD) approach or a simple random sample of mobile network provided list of numbers can produce a population representative survey.

TI  - Eccrine Porocarcinoma: Patient Characteristics, Clinical and Histopathologic Features, and Treatment in 7 Cases.
T2  - Actas dermo-sifiliograficas
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Eccrine porocarcinoma is a rare, malignant cutaneous adnexal tumor that arises from the ducts of sweat glands. Found mainly in patients of advanced age, this tumor has diverse clinical presentations. Histology confirms the diagnosis, detects features relevant to prognosis, and guides treatment. Growth is slow, but the prognosis is poor if the tumor metastasizes to lymph nodes or visceral organs. We report 7 cases of eccrine porocarcinoma, describing patient characteristics, the clinical and histopathologic features of the tumors, and treatments used. Our observations were similar to those of other published case series. Given the lack of therapeutic algorithms or protocols for this carcinoma, we propose a decision-making schema based on our review of the literature and our experience with this case series. The algorithm centers on sentinel lymph node biopsy and histologic features.

TI  - Clinical tumor stage is the most important predictor of pathological complete response rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pathological complete response (pCR) is the ultimate response in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). It might be a surrogate outcome for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). We studied the effect of clinical tumor stage (cT-stage) on tumor pCR and the effect of pCR per cT-stage on 5-year OS and DFS.Using the Netherlands Cancer Registry, all primary invasive breast cancer patients treated with NCT from 2005 until 2008 were identified. Univariable logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of cT-stage on pCR, stepwise logistic regression analysis to correct for potential confounders and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses to calculate OS and DFS after five years.In 2366 patients, overall pCR rate was 21%. For cT1, cT2, cT3, and cT4, pCR rates were 31, 22, 18, and 17%, respectively. Lower cT-stage (cT1-2 vs cT3-4) was a significant independent predictor of higher pCR rate (p < 0.001, OR 3.15). Furthermore, positive HER2 status (p < 0.001, OR 2.30), negative estrogen receptor status (p = 0.062, OR 1.69), and negative progesterone receptor status (p = 0.008, OR 2.27) were independent predictors of pCR. OS and DFS were up to 20% higher in patients with cT2-4 tumors with pCR versus patients without pCR. DFS was also higher for cT1 tumors with pCR.The most important predictor of pCR in breast cancer patients is cT-stage: lower cT-stages have significantly higher pCR rates than higher cT-stages. Patients with cT2-4 tumors achieving pCR have higher OS and DFS compared to patients not achieving pCR.

TI  - Generating synthetic five-minute solar irradiance values from hourly observations
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed a method for generating synthetic five-minute pairs of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI), interpolated from hourly mean values.Our method develops a model based on five-minute pairs of GHI and DNI from a location where real five-minute data is available. Five-minute GHI and DNI clear sky index values are calculated for each five-minute time period, and hourly values are calculated for each hourly period. The hourly values identify a clear sky category into which the twelve five-minute GHI and DNI clear sky index values are placed. The result is clear sky categories each containing five-minute clear sky index values that capture how five-minute GHI and DNI fluctuates for each clear sky category.The process for generating synthetically interpolated five-minute pairs of GHI and DNI from hourly mean values is straightforward. Hourly GHI and DNI clear sky index values are used to identify the clear sky category from which twelve five-minute synthetic pairs of GHI and DNI clear sky index values are bootstrapped. The index values are multiplied by the modelled perfect clear sky GHI and DNI to give synthetically interpolated five-minute pairs of GHI and DNI.Our method performs well. The hourly total Normalised Root Mean Square Deviation (NRMSD) results for our method are 1.4-1.8% for GHI and 2.2-3.0% for DNI. The hourly total Mean Bias Deviation (MBD) results for our method are -0.6% to 0.2% for GHI and -1.5% to -0.2% for DNI. The R-2 values between observed and synthetic hourly totals are all greater than 0.99. The monthly Kolmogorov-Smirnov Integral (KSI) values were good for 97% of all months for DNI and for all months for GHI.Our method can be applied to locations where only hourly data is available. For example, it could be applied to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's hourly solar irradiance gridded satellite data, to capture the spatial variation in solar irradiance for multiple locations. The result would be particularly useful, from a solar energy perspective, for designing a reliable renewable energy electricity system where its performance could be evaluated for any location in Australia.

TI  - Correlation and variable importance in random forests
T2  - STATISTICS AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is about variable selection with the random forests algorithm in presence of correlated predictors. In high-dimensional regression or classification frameworks, variable selection is a difficult task, that becomes even more challenging in the presence of highly correlated predictors. Firstly we provide a theoretical study of the permutation importance measure for an additive regression model. This allows us to describe how the correlation between predictors impacts the permutation importance. Our results motivate the use of the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm for variable selection in this context. This algorithm recursively eliminates the variables using permutation importance measure as a ranking criterion. Next various simulation experiments illustrate the efficiency of the RFE algorithm for selecting a small number of variables together with a good prediction error. Finally, this selection algorithm is tested on the Landsat Satellite data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

TI  - Mimesis or Metamorphosis? Eastern Orthodox Liturgical Practice and Its Philosophical Background
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - What does Eastern Orthodox liturgy do? Is it a mimetic remembrance of Christ's acts or about a transformation of the believers who come to worship? This paper explores the larger philosophical worldview within which patristic liturgy emerged in order to negotiate this tension between mimetic and transformative aspects of liturgical practice. It suggests that ancient philosophical conceptions of the cosmos and of soul and body underlie and can hence elucidate what Byzantine liturgy does. Liturgy tries to unify soul and body, heaven and earth, in a particular way. Liturgy seeks to transform the human person and the cosmos in such a manner that they come to image and match each other. The introduction to the paper briefly examines some contemporary accounts to show the stakes of the question about what liturgy "does" and the role mimesis and metamorphosis play in this debate. The main part of the paper explores the shared philosophical heritage regarding imitation and transformation, inner and outer, heavenly and earthly in order to understand more fully the background for how liturgy negotiates these dimensions. The conclusion to the paper draws out the implications of this patristic heritage for making sense of what contemporary liturgy does in a broader sense.

TI  - National Automated Surveillance of Hospital-Acquired Bacteremia in Denmark Using a Computer Algorithm
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND In 2015, Denmark launched an automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired infections, the Hospital-Acquired Infections Database (HAIBA).OBJECTIVE To describe the algorithm used in HAIBA, to determine its concordance with point prevalence surveys (PPSs), and to present trends for hospital-acquired bacteremiaSETTING Private and public hospitals in DenmarkMETHODS A hospital-acquired bacteremia case was defined as at least 1 positive blood culture with at least 1 pathogen (bacterium or fungus) taken between 48 hours after admission and 48 hours after discharge, using the Danish Microbiology Database and the Danish National Patient Registry. PPSs performed in 2012 and 2013 were used for comparison.RESULTS National trends showed an increase in HA bacteremia cases between 2010 and 2014. Incidence was higher for men than women (9.6 vs 5.4 per 10,000 risk days) and was highest for those aged 61-80 years (9.5 per 10,000 risk days). The median daily prevalence was 3.1% (range, 2.1%-4.7%). Regional incidence varied from 6.1 to 8.1 per 10,000 risk days. The microorganisms identified were typical for HA bacteremia. Comparison of HAIBA with PPS showed a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 99%. HAIBA was less sensitive for patients in hematology departments and intensive care units. Excluding these departments improved the sensitivity of HAIBA to 44%.CONCLUSIONS Although the estimated sensitivity of HAIBA compared with PPS is low, a PPS is not a gold standard. Given the many advantages of automated surveillance, HAIBA allows monitoring of HA bacteremia across the healthcare system, supports prioritizing preventive measures, and holds promise for evaluating interventions.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship between the Arid Valley Boundary's Displacement and Climate Change during 1999-2013 in the Upper Reaches of the Min River, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The arid valley is a unique type of ecological fragile landscape in the Hengduan Mountain Area, China. The boundary of the arid valley is one of the response indicators to mountainous climate change. Based on the meteorological data from 1999 to 2013 and the SPOT remote sensing images in 1999 and 2013 this study explored the response characteristics of the arid valley boundary to regional climate change in the upper reaches of the Min River in the Hengduan Mountains. The results are as follows: (1) During 1999-2013, the temperature, precipitation, and evaporation increased, and the sunshine duration and relative humidity showed decreasing trends at the rates of 0.008 degrees C/a, 2.25 mm/a, 5.51 mm/a, -8.72 h/a, and -0.19%/a, respectively. Meanwhile, the climate showed the warm-dry tendency in the southern region and the warm-humid tendency in the central and northern areas. (2) On the whole, the arid valley boundary mainly distributed between 1601-3200 m and moved downward to 2428 m at the speed of -0.76 +/- 0.26 m/a along with global warming. The descent speeds in different regions showed the same decreasing order as the regional distributions of precipitation and sunshine duration. (3) The arid valley boundary's displacement in the whole basin had significant negative correlations with current climate change (p < 0.05), as well as with variations of moisture factors. Additionally, with the enhancements of the drought degree and humidity tendency, the variations of temperature, evaporation, and relative humidity, respectively, became the main factors that had significant correlations with the arid valley boundary's displacement. Therefore, climate change during 1999-2013 shows beneficial effects on the improvement of the arid valley habitat in the upper reaches of the Min River. The study provides a new method and gives basic data for research on climate change.

TI  - Spontaneous Pneumothoraces in Patients with Birt-Hogg-Dube Syndrome
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common complication of Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD).Objectives: The optimal approach to treatment and prevention of BHD-associated spontaneous pneumothorax, and to advising patients with BHD regarding risk of pneumothorax associated with air travel, is not well established.Methods: Patients with BHD were recruited from the Rare Lung Diseases Clinic Network and the BHD Foundation and surveyed about disease manifestations and air travel experiences.Results: A total of 104 patients completed the survey. The average age at diagnosis was 47 years, with an average delay from first symptoms of 13 years. Pulmonary cysts were the most frequent phenotypic manifestation of BHD, present in 85% of patients. Spontaneous pneumothorax was the presenting manifestation that led to the diagnosis of BHD in 65% of patients, typically after the second episode (mean, 2.4 episodes). Seventy-nine (76%) of 104 patients had at least one spontaneous pneumothorax during their lifetime, and 82% had multiple pneumothoraces. Among patients with multiple pneumothoraces, 73% had an ipsilateral recurrence, and 48% had a subsequent contralateral spontaneous pneumothorax following a sentinel event. The mean ages at first and second pneumothoraces were 36.5 years (range, 14-63 yr) and 37 years (range, 20-55 yr), respectively. The average number of spontaneous pneumothoraces experienced by patients with a sentinel pneumothorax was 3.6. Pleurodesis was generally performed after the second (mean, 2.4) ipsilateral pneumothorax and reduced the ipsilateral recurrence rate by half. A total of 11 episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax occurred among eight patients either during or within the 24-hour period following air travel, consistent with an air travel-related pneumothorax rate of8% per patient and 0.12% per flight. Prior pleurodesis reduced the occurrence of a subsequent flight-related pneumothorax.Conclusions: Spontaneous pneumothorax is an important, recurrent manifestation of pulmonary involvement in patients with BHD, and pleurodesis should be considered following the initial pneumothorax to reduce the risk of recurrent episodes. In general, in patients with BHD, pneumothorax occurs in about 1-2 per 1,000 flights, and the risk is lower among patients with a history of prior pleurodesis.

TI  - Enhanced Recovery After Surgery for Hip and Knee Replacements
T2  - ORTHOPAEDIC NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs or hip and knee replacements have had a significant effect on streamlining patient care with shorter stays, no increase in complications, and improved outcomes including reduced mortality.PURPOSE: To compare outcomes following the introduction of an ERAS program for hip and knee replacements developed at our institution with a historical cohort of patients.METHODS: ERAS protocols were developed at our institution for patients undergoing hip and knee joint replacements. Key aspects were changes in preadmission, a new education session, improved management of perioperative anemia, standardized anesthetic guidelines, day of surgery mobilization, and improved discharge planning. The results of the first 18 months (528 consecutive patients) were compared with those of a historical cohort of 507 patients from the 18 months prior to their introduction.RESULTS: In the ERAS group, the mean age was 68.3 years for patients who underwent hip replacement and 70.4 years for patients who underwent knee replacement. Thirty-two percent of patients were ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) Grades III and IV. The average preoperative Oxford score was 11. The average length of stay (ALOS) fell from 5.6 to 4.3 days for patients who underwent hip replacement and from 5.7 to 4.8 days for patients who underwent knee replacement (p <.001). Ninety-six percent of patients were discharged home. The 30-day readmission rate increased from 3.2% to 5.5% (p =.065). Six-month Oxford knee scores were higher in the ERAS group (39.8 vs. 36.3, p =.03). There was no increase in mortality or early revision rate.CONCLUSIONS: Substantial reductions in ALOS can be gained with the introduction of ERAS protocols, with high patient satisfaction and no increase in complications in a consecutive unselected group of public hospital patients. This requires a multidisciplinary approach and a strong clinical input.

TI  - Model improvements and validation of TerraSAR-X precise orbit determination
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The radar imaging satellite mission TerraSAR-X requires precisely determined satellite orbits for validating geodetic remote sensing techniques. Since the achieved quality of the operationally derived, reduced-dynamic (RD) orbit solutions limits the capabilities of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) validation, an effort is made to improve the estimated orbit solutions. This paper discusses the benefits of refined dynamical models on orbit accuracy as well as estimated empirical accelerations and compares different dynamic models in a RD orbit determination. Modeling aspects discussed in the paper include the use of a macro-model for drag and radiation pressure computation, the use of high-quality atmospheric density and wind models as well as the benefit of high-fidelity gravity and ocean tide models. The Sun-synchronous dusk-dawn orbit geometry of TerraSAR-X results in a particular high correlation of solar radiation pressure modeling and estimated normal-direction positions. Furthermore, this mission offers a unique suite of independent sensors for orbit validation. Several parameters serve as quality indicators for the estimated satellite orbit solutions. These include the magnitude of the estimated empirical accelerations, satellite laser ranging (SLR) residuals, and SLR-based orbit corrections. Moreover, the radargrammetric distance measurements of the SAR instrument are selected for assessing the quality of the orbit solutions and compared to the SLR analysis. The use of high-fidelity satellite dynamics models in the RD approach is shown to clearly improve the orbit quality compared to simplified models and loosely constrained empirical accelerations. The estimated empirical accelerations are substantially reduced by 30% in tangential direction when working with the refined dynamical models. Likewise the SLR residuals are reduced from to mm, and the SLR-derived normal-direction position corrections are reduced from 15 to 6 mm, obtained from the 2012-2014 period. The radar range bias is reduced from to mm with the updated orbit solutions, which coincides with the reduced standard deviation of the SLR residuals. The improvements are mainly driven by the satellite macro-model for the purpose of solar radiation pressure modeling, improved atmospheric density models, and the use of state-of-the-art gravity field models.

AB  - The treatment of metastases of penile cancer is confined to lymphatic metastases. Limited lymph node metastasis in penile cancer can be cured by radical lymph node surgery if complete removal of all lymph nodes of the region is achieved. Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended. This approach applies to the regional lymph nodes of the inguinal and pelvic regions. Applying this concept to retroperitoneal lymph node metastases may also be reasonable in selected cases. The individual prognosis depends on the extent of lymphatic spread.

TI  - Vulnerability of aquaculture-related livelihoods to changing climate at the global scale
T2  - FISH AND FISHERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is now a strong consensus that during the 20th century, and especially during recent decades, the earth has experienced a significant warming trend with projections suggesting additional further warming during the 21st century. Associated with this warming trend are changes in climate that are expected to show substantial spatial variability across the earth's surface. Globally, fish production has continued to increase during recent years at a rate exceeding that of human population growth. However, the contribution from capture fisheries has remained largely static since the late 1980s with the increase in production being accounted for by dramatic growth in the aquaculture sector. In this study, the distribution of vulnerability of aquaculture-related livelihoods to climate change was assessed at the global scale based on the concept of vulnerability as a function of sensitivity to climate change, exposure to climate change and adaptive capacity. Use was made of national-level statistics along with gridded climate and population data. Climate change scenarios were supplied using the MAGICC/SCENGEN climate modelling tools. Analysis was conducted for aquaculture in freshwater, brackish and marine environments with outputs represented as a series of raster images. A number of Asian countries (Vietnam, Bangladesh, Laos and China) were indicated as most vulnerable to impacts on freshwater production. Vietnam, Thailand, Egypt and Ecuador stood out in terms of brackish water production. Norway and Chile were considered most vulnerable to impacts on marine production while a number of Asian countries (China, Vietnam and the Philippines) also ranked highly.

TI  - A deterministic worldview promotes approval of state paternalism
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The proper limit to paternalist regulation of citizens' private lives is a recurring theme in political theory and ethics. In the present study, we examine the role of beliefs about free will and determinism in attitudes toward libertarian versus paternalist policies. Throughout five studies we find that a scientific deterministic worldview reduces opposition toward paternalist policies, independent of the putative influence of political ideology. We suggest that exposure to scientific explanations for patterns in human behavior challenges the notion of personal autonomy and, in turn, undermines libertarian arguments against state paternalism appealing to autonomy and personal choice.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Lake Water Quality in the Context of Remote Sensing Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates a number of methods for using field sampling and observed lake characteristics and patterns to improve techniques for development of algae remote sensing models and applications. As satellite and airborne sensors improve and their data are more readily available, applications of models to estimate water quality via remote sensing are becoming more practical for local water quality monitoring, particularly of surface algal conditions. Despite the increasing number of applications, there are significant concerns associated with remote sensing model development and application, several of which are addressed in this study. These concerns include: (1) selecting sensors which are suitable for the spatial and temporal variability in the water body; (2) determining appropriate uses of near-coincident data in empirical model calibration; and (3) recognizing potential limitations of remote sensing measurements which are biased toward surface and near-surface conditions. We address these issues in three lakes in the Great Salt Lake surface water system (namely the Great Salt Lake, Farmington Bay, and Utah Lake) through sampling at scales that are representative of commonly used sensors, repeated sampling, and sampling at both near-surface depths and throughout the water column. The variability across distances representative of the spatial resolutions of Landsat, SENTINEL-2 and MODIS sensors suggests that these sensors are appropriate for this lake system. We also use observed temporal variability in the system to evaluate sensors. These relationships proved to be complex, and observed temporal variability indicates the revisit time of Landsat may be problematic for detecting short events in some lakes, while it may be sufficient for other areas of the system with lower short-term variability. Temporal variability patterns in these lakes are also used to assess near-coincident data in empirical model development. Finally, relationships between the surface and water column conditions illustrate potential issues with near-surface remote sensing, particularly when there are events that cause mixing in the water column.

TI  - Validation of MODIS Sea Surface Temperature Product in the Coastal Waters of the Yellow Sea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) plays a fundamental role in the exchange of heat, momentum, and water vapor between atmosphere and ocean. Therefore, measurement of SST has been done from ships, buoys, offshore platforms, and satellites. During past decades satellites are being increasingly used, because datasets over wide areas can be obtained. In this paper, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra and Aqua SST products were examined and validated for coastal waters in the Yellow Sea by using the in situ buoy data. A strict match-up method was adopted in view of the complexity and variability of coastal area, resulting in 154 and 164 match-ups for Terra and Aqua, respectively. The MODIS SST agreed well with in situ buoy SST, with squared correlation coefficients R-2 of 0.989 for Terra, and 0.987 for Aqua. Relative to in situ SSTs, the satellite-derived SSTs had a bias of 0.23 degrees C and 0.06 degrees C, a standard deviation of 0.79 degrees C and 0.85 degrees C, and a root mean square error of 0.83 degrees C and 0.85 degrees C, for Terra and Aqua. The differences between MODIS and in situ SST exhibited apparent seasonal variations. The accuracy of MODIS SST products for spring and summer were lower than those for autumn andwinter, which could be caused by frequent sea fog along the southern coast of Shandong Peninsula. The SST bias approximately depended on wind velocity; low wind velocity could enhance the diurnal SST amplitude and the bulk-skin temperature difference. However, there is no significant dependence of the bias on air-sea temperature difference or surface flow velocity.

T2  - AMERICAN BEHAVIORAL SCIENTIST
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the 2016 presidential campaign by comparing the voice of the people with that of the press and the political establishment. By systematically collecting some 5,000 texts (political speeches, ads, and debates alongside print and broadcast coverage) during the campaign and comparing them with 1,200 letters to the editor written in 12 small American cities, an overview of the nation's quadrennial dialogue was made possible. By also comparing this sample with similar texts gathered for the 1948 through 2012 presidential campaigns, the 2016 campaign could be seen in sharper relief. These comparisons were facilitated by DICTION, a lexically based, content analytic program capable of producing rhetorical profiles of the discourse sampled. Overall, I found (a) that each voice produces distinct verbal patterns, thereby revealing its unique role in the polity; (b) that all three voicespoliticians, the press, and the peoplewere more strident and more philosophical in 2016 than in prior years; (c) that Donald Trump and his letter writing supporters were especially dismayed by the status quo; and (d) that many of the stereotypes about letter writers turn out not to be true, with only a small percentage being blind ideologues. The rest were either issue specialists, analytical problem solvers, champions of a particular worldview, or voters interested in dissecting the psychological makeup of the candidates.

TI  - Data assimilation of satellite-based actual evapotranspiration in a distributed hydrological model of a controlled water system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in earth observation (EC) and spatially distributed hydrological modelling provide an opportunity to improve modelling of controlled water systems. In a controlled water system human interference is high, which may lead to incorrect parameterisation in the model calibration phase. This paper analyses whether assimilation of EO actual evapotranspiration (ETa) data can improve discharge simulation with a spatially distributed hydrological model of a controlled water system. The EO ETa estimates are in the form of eight-day ETa composite maps derived from Terra/MODIS images using the ITA-MyWater algorithm. This algorithm is based on the surface energy balance method and is calibrated for this research for a low-lying reclamation area with a heavily controlled water system: the Rijnland area in the Netherlands. Data assimilation (DA) with the particle filter method is applied to assimilate the ETa maps into a spatially distributed hydrological model. The hydrological model and DA framework are applied using the open source software SIMGRO and PCRaster-Python respectively. The analysis is done for a period between July and October 2013 in which a high discharge peak followed a long dry-spell. The assimilation of EC ETa resulted in local differences in modelled ETa compared to simulation without data assimilation, while the area average ETa remained almost the same. The modelled cumulative discharge graphs, with and without DA, showed distinctive differences with the simulation, with DA better matching the measured cumulative discharge. The bias of simulated cumulative discharge to the observed data reduced from 14% to 4% when using DA of EO ETa. These results showed that assimilating EO ETa may not only be effective in the more common applications of soil moisture and crop-growth modelling, but also for improving discharge modelling of controlled water systems.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Patient Safety Measures in Adult Primary Care
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL QUALITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Safety measure development has focused on inpatient care despite outpatient visits far outnumbering inpatient admissions. Some measures are clearly identified as outpatient safety measures when published, yet outcomes from quality improvement studies also may be useful measures. The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify published articles detailing safety measures applicable to adult primary care. A total of 21 articles were identified, providing specifications for 182 safety measures. Each measure was classified into one of 6 outpatient safety dimensions: medication management, sentinel events, care coordination, procedures and treatment, laboratory testing and monitoring, and facility structures/resources. Compared to the multitude of available inpatient safety measures, the number of existing adult primary care measures is low. The measures identified by this systematic review may yield further insight into the breadth of safety events causing harm in primary care, while also identifying areas of patient safety in primary care that may be understudied.

TI  - Interactions between windthrow, bark beetles and forest management in the Tatra national parks
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural disturbances such as windthrow and bark beetle Ips typographus L outbreak often affect protected areas with non-intervention type of management located in close proximity to managed forest stands. This raises concerns about the migration of the beetle outbreak from non-intervention zones to adjacent managed forests. In this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of large-scale disturbances by intervention and non-intervention type of management in the Tatra mountains (Central Europe). We collected a time series of Landsat images from 2003 to 2014, and applied maximum likelihood classification to map the extent of forest, windthrow, clear-cuts, beetle outbreak and fire. Our classified maps achieved high overall accuracies: 0.93 +/- 0.03 <= OA <= 0.96 +/- 0.03. The extent of forest declined over the study period. We found higher rate of beetle induced tree mortality in non-intervention versus intervention zone. Within two growing seasons after the windthrow, beetle infestation occurred in close proximity to uncleared windthrow (<similar to 250 m), which suggest the positive effect of salvage logging (removal of windthrown trees) on lowering the risk of beetle outbreak. The two times higher sum of disturbances in intervention then in non-intervention zone indicated the limited impact of sanitation felling (removal of standing beetle infested trees) to reduce beetle population. However, sanitation felling highly contributed to the decline of the forest cover. Overall, our results document the dynamics of windthrow, bark beetle and clear-cuts by type of management, and limited impact of logging activities in reducing beetle outbreak in neighboring areas with intervention and non-intervention type of management.

TI  - The observed cooling effect of desert blooms based on high-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer products
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert greening through planting or irrigation is a potential approach to mitigate desertification and climate warming, but its influence on regional climate is unclear due to scarcity of observations. "Desert blooms," which are natural phenomena usually associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, regularly occur in the world's driest desert, the Atacama Desert. This sudden conversion of land cover likely has a large impact on regional climate through alteration of local energy budgets and provides a unique opportunity to study the potential climatic and environmental consequences of desert greening. Here we evaluated the land surface effects of blooms in the Atacama Desert using vegetation and climate data acquired from remote sensing. The rapid vegetation growth during blooms led to an increase in evapotranspiration and a decrease in albedo. These two processes caused a 0.31 degrees C +/- 0.05 degrees C decrease in daytime land surface temperature. During nighttime, we observed a 0.02 degrees C +/- 0.02 degrees C increase in land surface temperature due to enhanced heat capacity associated with blooms. This asymmetric diurnal variation in land surface temperature produced a net decrease in daily land surface temperature of 0.29 degrees C +/- 0.07 degrees C. Our observations demonstrate the potential benefits of desert blooms on local climate. Results from this study also provide new evidence for plausible climate consequences expected from local "desert greening" strategies.Plain Language Summary Desert areas have expanded globally over the past century and are projected to increase continually throughout the current century owing to global warming. " Desert greening" by plantation or irrigation has been proposed as a method to decrease desertification, mitigate climate warming through increased carbon sequestration, and produce food and biofuel. However, the actual impact of desert greening on regional climate is still poorly understood due to scarcity of observational studies. "Desert bloom" is a natural phenomenon that happened in the world's driest Atacama Desert. Relying on remote sensing observations, we find that this desert bloom-caused natural greening has obvious cooling effect on land surface. This finding has important implications for the design of desert greening strategies.

TI  - Environmental degradation in the urban areas of China: Evidence from multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and timely evaluation of urban environmental change is highly important for understanding urban sustainability in China. However, the comprehensive understanding of urban environmental change in China based on multi-source remote sensing data remains inadequate because current studies have mainly focused on a single aspect of the urban environment using a specific source of remote sensing data. In this study, we developed a comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) combining the remote sensing data of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration, land surface temperature (1ST) and vegetation cover (VC) to assess the urban environmental change in China at the national scale, among urban agglomerations and across the rapidly urbanized regions. We found a trend of environmental degradation in the urban areas of China between 2000 and 2012. Environmentally degraded and moderately degraded urban areas accounted for 48.14% of the total urban area in China. In particular, the expanded urban areas exhibited the most extensive environmental degradation, with 52.33% of the total expanded urban areas from 1992 to 2012 exhibiting environmental degradation or moderately environmental degradation. The increase in the PM2.5 concentration was one of the main manifestations of the environmental degradation in the expanded urban areas. We suggest that more attention should be paid to urban environmental issues during future urban development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Estimate over an Almond Orchard Using Landsat Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - California growers face challenges with water shortages and there is a strong need to use the least amount of water while optimizing yield. Timely information on evapotranspiration (ET), a dominant component of crop consumptive water use, is critical for growers to tailor irrigation management based on in-field spatial variability and in-season variations. We evaluated the performance of a remote sensing-based approach, Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), in mapping ET over an almond orchard in California, driven by Landsat satellite observations. Reference ET from a network of weather stations over well-watered grass (ETo) was used for the internal calibration and for deriving ET at daily and extended time period, instead of alfalfa based reference evapotranspiration (ETr). Our study showed that METRIC daily ET estimates during Landsat overpass dates agreed well with the field measurements. During 2009-2012, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.53 mm/day and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.87 were found between METRIC versus observed daily ET. Monthly ET estimates had a higher accuracy, with a RMSE of 12.08 mm/month, a R-2 of 0.90, and a relatively small relative mean difference (RMD) of 9.68% during 2009-2012 growing seasons. Net radiation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from remote sensing observations were highly correlated with spatial and temporal ET estimates. An empirical model was developed to estimate daily ET using NDVI, net radiation (R-n), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The validation showed that the accuracy of this easy-to-use empirical method was slightly lower than that of METRIC but still reasonable, with a RMSE of 0.71 mm/day when compared to ground measurements. The remote sensing based ET estimate will support a variety of State and local interests in water use and irrigation management, for both planning and regulatory/compliance purposes, and it provides the farmers observation-based guidance for site-specific and time-sensitive irrigation management.

TI  - Direct Estimation of Land Surface Albedo From Simultaneous MISR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of multiangular information from the NASA Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument provides an excellent opportunity for the characterization of surface anisotropy, which can be used for improving surface albedo estimation. However, the MISR data have been reported with large uncertainties and data gaps due to inaccurate aerosol estimation and/or cloud masking limiting its otherwise broader applications. To mitigate these issues, two approaches were proposed to estimate land surface albedo directly from surface reflectance (LSA_sfc) and Top-of-Atmosphere reflectance (LSA_toa), respectively. As a further development of the traditional albedo algorithms, this is the first attempt to simultaneously utilize multispectral and multiangular information in surface albedo estimation without any prior constraining information. Validations at AmeriFlux sites show that the proposed algorithms can achieve accuracies similar to that of the MISR product with respective bias and RMSE of 0.004 and 0.032 for LSA_sfc and 0.005 and 0.032 for LSA_toa algorithms. We found that the LSA_toa algorithm can significantly reduce data gaps and provide accurate surface albedo retrievals with two to three times more valid data than the current MISR product. In addition, these approaches can be easily applied to other optical sensors to produce accurate and gap-free clear-sky surface albedo estimations. The results of this paper also highlight the importance of having two to three simultaneous observations with sufficient angular sampling, which can improve albedo accuracy and reduce data gaps.

TI  - Physically Based Model for Multispectral Image Simulation of Earth Observation Sensors
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Physically based multispectral image simulation consists of sensor system modeling, bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) image generation, and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) image calculation. TOA radiance images are usually generated using a lookup table (LUT) for computational efficiency, which is calculated by means of atmospheric radiative transfer codes with different combination of input variables, including viewing zenith, solar zenith, and relative azimuth angles; visibility; columnar water vapor; and ground elevation. In this paper, a new strategy is proposed for TOA radiance image simulation, where transmitted surface radiance and atmospheric radiance at the TOA are calculated, respectively, to improve accuracy as well as efficiency. The transmitted surface radiance image is obtained from pixel-by-pixel calculation of BOA radiance and path transmittance. In calculating the atmospheric radiance of TOA, two LUTs are built for the emitted and the scattered radiance from each atmospheric layer, respectively. The effects of visibility and columnar water vapor on the atmospheric radiance are characterized by means of an equivalent path transmittance, which is related to the scene geometry as well as the thickness of atmospheric layer. In this way, when a new scene is simulated, except for three variables, i.e., viewing and solar zenith angles and atmospheric layer number, other parameters are set as constants in building the LUTs, enabling more combinations of input variables without adding excessive computational burden. Multispectral images in different bands with moderate spatial resolution are simulated and compared with the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to demonstrate the accuracy and the usefulness of the proposed strategy.

TI  - UAVs for data collection - plugging the gap
T2  - New Zealand Journal of Forestry
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as important and useful platforms for acquiring remotely sensed data, offering the ability to collect imagery and other data with increased spatial and temporal resolution. In the New Zealand and Australian forestry sectors, UAV applications include a range of tasks such as cutover mapping, forest health assessment, and silvicultural quality assessment. As a platform, UAVs remain constrained by weight, distance and regulatory considerations. These factors mean that UAVs have primarily found a niche collecting data for smaller areas of forest that are uneconomical to survey using satellite-based earth observation or aerial survey. UAV and sensor technologies are maturing rapidly and a range of potential applications highlighted by the forest industry are currently being investigated.

TI  - Remote sensing approach for spatial planning of land management interventions in West African savannas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest management, agroforestry and tree planting are some of the key approaches to sustainable rural development, and climate change adaptation and mitigation in West African savannas. However, the planning of land management interventions is hindered by the lack of information at relevant spatial resolution. We examined predictive models for mapping various tree, soil and species diversity attributes with a comparison of RapidEye and Landsat imagery. The field data was collected in the vicinity of the community-managed forest in southern Burkina Faso, where the main environmental threats are agricultural expansion and fuelwood extraction. The modelling was done using Random Forest algorithm. According to our results, tree crown cover and correlated attributes, such as basal area and tree species richness, were predicted most accurately. High spatial resolution RapidEye imagery provided the best accuracy but difference to medium resolution Landsat imagery was negligible for most attributes. Burn scar masked Landsat time series performed similar to dry season single date Landsat imagery, but the former avoids image selection and mosaicking, and could be less sensitive to artifacts due to the burn scars. The presented approach provides valuable information on important tree, soil and species diversity attributes for spatial planning of land management interventions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sea Surface Currents Estimated from Spaceborne Infrared Images Validated against Reanalysis Data and Drifters in the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-real time sea surface current information is needed for ocean operations. On a global scale, only satellites can provide such measurements. This can be done with data from infrared radiometers, available on several satellites, thus giving several images a day. This work analyses the accuracy of such an estimation of surface current fields retrieved with the maximum cross correlation (MCC) method, here used to track patterns of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) brightness temperature between 224 pairs of consecutive images taken between January and December 2015 in the western Mediterranean Sea. Comparison with in-situ drifters shows that relatively small patterns, moving at a slow speed, tracked between images separated by less than four hours give the best agreement. The agreement was strongest in summer, and consistent with low wind, non-eddying situations. When compared to a daily reanalysis field, the averaged satellite-retrieved fields showed good agreement, but not the in-situ drifter data. Drifter data should hence be used to complement satellite-retrieved currents rather than to validate them, since they may measure different components of the surface currents.

TI  - Use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Monitoring Recovery of Forest Vegetation on Petroleum Well Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Photogrammetric point clouds (PPCs) provide a source of three-dimensional (3-D) remote sensing data that is well-suited to use over small areas that are within the scope of observation by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We compared PPC-based structural metrics to traditional ground surveys conducted by field personnel in order to assess the capacity of PPC data to contribute to vegetation-reclamation surveys. We found good statistical agreement between key structural vegetation parameters, such as mean and maximum vegetation height, with PPC metrics successfully predicting most height and tree-diameter metrics using multivariate linear regression. However, PPC metrics were not as useful for estimating ground-measured vegetation cover. We believe that part of the issue lies in the mismatch between PPC- and ground-based measurement approaches, including subjective judgement on behalf of ground crews: a topic that requires more investigation. Our work highlights the emerging value of UAV-based PPCs to complement, and in some cases supplement, traditional ground-based sources of measured vegetation structure.

AB  - Over 2 million adults in the United States are incarcerated and over 650,000 return to the community each year. This disparate population is known to have an elevated burden of chronic disease and lower socioeconomic status. Medical residency training about care for incarcerated or previously incarcerated patients is significantly lacking in the United States. Curriculum can be developed and implemented in residency programs to help physicians learn how to work with this population, be sensitive to their unique needs, and achieve positive health outcomes. This article describes a method for educating the educators based on a workshop presented at a peer-reviewed national conference during the fall of 2016. Attendees participated in exercises addressing assumptions, expectations, bias, and worldview and increased their ability for self-reflection when interacting with patients who are or have experienced incarceration. In this session, strategies were identified that engaged the patient with the goal to aid in patient retention and compliance. Future steps include development of a formal curriculum for training in this area, incorporation into existing community medicine rotations or electives, and establishment of structured transition clinics where residents can be exposed to this population on a more regular basis and improve their overall health outcomes.

TI  - Investigation of the island-induced ocean vortex train of the Kuroshio Current using satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used satellite imagery to conduct a statistical study of the ocean vortex train induced by the Kuroshio Current on the leeward side of Green Island, Taiwan. The spatial scale and characteristics of the ocean vortex train were analyzed using image datasets from five different high-resolution satellites, including optical imagery from the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre and the Formosat-2 satellites and synthetic aperture radar imagery from the European Remote Sensing Satellite, Advanced Land Observing Satellite, and Sentinel -1. Satellite altimetry data and a moored acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) were used to calculate the velocity of the Kuroshio Current. The ADCP data suggest that the velocity increases on the western side of the vortex train when it is formed on the leeward side of Green Island. Data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) showed that the sea surface temperature of the recirculation water was over 2 degrees C colder and the chlorophyll-a concentration was two times higher than that of the surrounding waters. These phenomena suggested upwelling, mixing processes, and an island-mass effect. Wind forcing had a pronounced effect on the characteristics of the vortex train. High-resolution satellite images indicate that the averaged aspect ratio of the vortex train is 2.09 and the dimensionless width is 2.02 under southerly winds, compared to 1.91 and 2.76, respectively, under northerly winds.

TI  - A Comparison of Terrain Indices toward Their Ability in Assisting Surface Water Mapping from Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 mission provides frequent coverage of global land areas and is hence able to monitor surface water dynamics at a fine spatial resolution better than any other Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission before. However, SAR data acquired by Sentinel-1 also suffer from terrain effects when being used for mapping surface water, just as other SAR data do. Terrain indices derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are easy but effective approaches to reduce this kind of interference, considering the close relationship between surface water movement and topography. This study compares two popular terrain indices, namely the Multi-resolution Valley Bottom Flatness (MrVBF) and the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND), toward their performance on assisting surface water mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR data. Four study sites with different terrain characteristics were selected to cover a very wide range of topographic conditions. For two of these sites that are floodplain dominated, both normal and flooded scenarios were examined. MrVBF and HAND values for the whole study areas, as well as statistics of these values within water areas were compared. The sensitivity of applying different thresholds for MrVBF and HAND to mask out terrain effect was investigated by adopting quantity disagreement and allocation disagreement as the accuracy indicators. It was found that both indices help improve water mapping, reducing the total disagreement by as much as 1.6%. The HAND index performs slightly better in most of the study cases, with less sensitivity to thresholding. MrVBF classifies low-lying areas with more details, which sometimes makes it more effective in eliminating false water bodies in rugged terrain. It is therefore recommended to use HAND for large scale or global scale water mapping. However, for water detection in complex terrain areas, MrVBF also performs very well.

TI  - Air Temperature Estimation with MODIS Data over the Northern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of MODIS land surface temperature (T-s) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products, combined with digital elevation model (DEM) and meteorological data from 2001 to 2012, were used to map the spatial distribution of monthly mean air temperature over the Northern Tibetan Plateau (NTP). A time series analysis and a regression analysis of monthly mean land surface temperature (T-s) and air temperature (T-a) were conducted using ordinary linear regression (OLR) and geographical weighted regression (GWR). The analyses showed that GWR, which considers MODIS T-s, NDVI and elevation as independent variables, yielded much better results [R-Adj(2) > 0.79; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.51 degrees C-1.12 degrees C] associated with estimating T-a compared to those from OLR (R-Adj(2) = 0.40-0.78; RMSE = 1.60 degrees C-4.38 degrees C). In addition, some characteristics of the spatial distribution of monthly T-a and the difference between the surface and air temperature (T-d) are as follows. According to the analysis of the 0 degrees C and 10 degrees C isothermals, T-a values over the NTP at elevations of 4000-5000 m were greater than 10 degrees C in the summer (from May to October), and T-a values at an elevation of 3200 m dropped below 0 degrees C in the winter (from November to April). T-a exhibited an increasing trend from northwest to southeast. Except in the southeastern area of the NTP, T-d values in other areas were all larger than 0 degrees C in the winter.

TI  - Scattering Property Analysis of Supraglacial Debris Using Target Decomposition on Polarimetric SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial debris is widely distributed in the ablation zones of the glaciers in mountain valleys, and it influences glacier melting considerably. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) presents promising results in terms of glacier classification and monitoring, but the scattering mechanism of debris has been unclear until now. In this paper, we attempted to verify the main scattering components of debris in the L-and C-bands polarimetric SAR images. A newly developed target decomposition method that is specially designed for debris is used to quantitatively analyze the scattering component. The method combines the X-Bragg surface scattering, double bounce, and completely random volume scattering models. The results from the target decomposition agree well with the scattering property analysis from the phase difference and entropy-alpha methods. The Keqikaer glacier, which is in the southern Tianshan Mountains, is selected as the study area. Phased-Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) images from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), PALSAR-2 images from ALOS-2, and RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR images are employed. The results show that in the C-band, surface scattering is dominant in debris, and it accounts for approximately 70% of the total power; in the L-band, volume scattering increases to a larger portion (approximately 40%), but remains slightly weaker than surface scattering (approximately 56%).

TI  - Application of polarization signature to land cover scattering mechanism analysis and classification using multi-temporal C-band polarimetric RADARSAT-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel method of multi-temporal land cover classification based on the polarization signature (PS). Additionally, the temporal change of the scattering mechanism of crops and other land cover classes is analyzed based on the PS. Firstly, the scattering mechanisms of corn, soybean, wheat, forest and urban over time are analyzed. The correlation coefficient is computed between their PS and the PS of canonical targets to study their relationships with the completely polarized surface, dihedral, dipole and helix scattering targets. The pedestal height (PH) of their PS is also calculated to investigate their un-polarized components such as multiple scattering. Then, a novel multi-temporal supervised binary-tree classification scheme (MTSBTCS) with a criterion that maximizes the power difference of PS (MDPS) is developed (MTSBTCS-MDPS), in which the MDPS is proposed to find the optimum orientation angle, ellipticity angle and image acquisition date to maximize the power difference of two different land cover classes and a binary-tree classifier is constructed for the final multi-temporal classification. Seven fully polarimetric C-band RADARASAT-2 images in Fine Quad (FQ) 21 mode acquired in southwestern Ontario, Canada during the entire growing season from May to September in 2012 are used for the purpose of the scattering mechanism analysis and validation of the MTSBTCS-MDPS. The experiment demonstrates that, the scattering mechanism varies with crop type and also changes greatly for each crop when they are in different growing stages. However, the scattering mechanisms of urban and forest areas remain almost the same. In terms of the classification, comparison of the MDPS with the traditional support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and the Wishart distance (WD), shows that for the single-date image classification, both MDPS and WD achieve much higher accuracy on each date than that of the SVM and RF, but the MDPS consumes more time than that of the WD and its accuracy is also lower. However, when they are applied to the multi-temporal images, both SVM and RF suffer a severe misclassification between forest and urban with their accuracy lower than that of the MTSBTCS-MDPS. In addition, the MTSBTCS-MDPS developed in this paper is much less time-consuming approximately 2.5 times less than that of the MTSBTCS-WD, meanwhile, it also achieves the highest accuracy with its overall accuracy of 87.5% and kappa coefficient of 0.85 among all methods applied.

TI  - Patch-Based Forest Change Detection from Landsat Time Series
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the species-rich and structurally complex forests of the Eastern United States, disturbance events are often partial and therefore difficult to detect using remote sensing methods. Here we present a set of new algorithms, collectively called Vegetation Regeneration and Disturbance Estimates through Time (VeRDET), which employ a novel patch-based approach to detect periods of vegetation disturbance, stability, and growth from the historical Landsat image records. VeRDET generates a yearly clear-sky composite from satellite imagery, calculates a spectral vegetation index for each pixel in that composite, spatially segments the vegetation index image into patches, temporally divides the time series into differently sloped segments, and then labels those segments as disturbed, stable, or regenerating. Segmentation at both the spatial and temporal steps are performed using total variation regularization, an algorithm originally designed for signal denoising. This study explores VeRDET's effectiveness in detecting forest change using four vegetation indices and two parameters controlling the spatial and temporal scales of segmentation within a calibration region. We then evaluate algorithm effectiveness within a 386,000 km(2) area in the Eastern United States where VeRDET has overall error of 23% and omission error across disturbances ranging from 22% to 78% depending on agent.

TI  - Trends in axillary treatment for breast cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy as determined by a questionnaire from the Japanese Breast Cancer Society
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone has been compared with SLNB followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive breast cancer patients in randomized phase III trials: the addition of ALND did not further improve the patient's outcome. However, there is still some controversy, regarding the clinical application of SLNB alone. To identify the optimal axillary treatment in the era of SLNB, the Japanese Breast Cancer Society conducted a group study of SLNB in 2014.Methods A questionnaire on axillary surgery and radiation therapy was sent to 432 Japanese institutes in December 2014, and 309 (72 %) completed the questionnaire.Results SLNB was performed at 98 % of the institutes, and 77 % offered irradiation for cancer treatment. Regarding breast-conserving surgery (BCS), SLNB alone was indicated at 41 % of the institutes in the cases of SLN with micrometastases. However, in the cases of SLN with macrometastases, ALND was performed at 64 %. The proportion of ALND seemed to be higher in total mastectomy than in BCS regardless of the SLN-positive status. In the cases of SLN with micrometastases, the radiation field was localized in the conserved breast at about half of the institutes. On the other hand, in the cases of SLN with macrometastases, it was extended to axillary and/or supraclavicular lesions beyond the conserved breast at about 70 % of the institutes.Conclusions Japanese breast physicians were conservative with respect to the omission of ALND in SLN-positive breast cancer, especially in the cases of SLN with macrometastases.

TI  - T-matrix and radiative transfer hybrid models for densely packed particulates at mid-infrared wavelengths
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mid-infrared spectroscopy is a useful tool for remotely sensing the composition of Earth and other planets. Quantitative mineralogical investigations are possible using remotely sensed data; however, the difficulty in modeling complex interactions of light with particles that are on the order of the wavelength limits the usefulness of the remote sensing data. As part of an effort to develop a more effective treatment of light scattering in planetary regolith, we explore the ability of T-matrix and radiative transfer (RT) hybrid models to produce emissivity spectra that are consistent with laboratory measurements. Parameters obtained from T-matrix calculations are used in three different RT models to construct emissivity spectra of enstatite particles of different sizes. Compared to the widely used Mie/RT hybrid models, the T-matrix/RT hybrid models produce more consistent emissivity spectra for the finest particle size fraction (3.3m). Overall, T-matrix hybrid models produce improved emissivity spectra, but larger particle sizes are still difficult to model. The improvement observed in T-matrix/RT hybrid models is a result of the inclusion of multiple scattering in closely packed media, and it demonstrates the importance of the implementation of physically realistic factors in developing a more effective light scattering model for planetary regolith. Further development and implementation of this and similar hybrid models will result in an improvement in quantitative assessments of planetary particulate surfaces from mid-infrared spectra.Plain Language Summary Remote sensing in the mid-infrared wavelengths (similar to 5 - 50 m) has been used widely to interpret the mineralogy of planetary surfaces. This technique works well when the material (soil, sand, rock, etc.) of interest is large compared to the reflected or emitted wavelength, however interpretation of such data is complicated by the presence of fine materials with sizes similar to or less than the wavelength of light. In these cases, a substantial portion of light is diffracted and accurate interpretations of mineralogy from remote sensing data becomes very difficult. This has been a problem as planetary surfaces are often covered with fine regolith - closely packed particles with sizes frequently on the order of mid-infrared wavelengths. In an effort to resolve this problem, one area of on-going research is the modeling of the interaction of light with such particles using light scattering models. We contribute to this effort by investigating advanced light scattering models that more realistically incorporate the physical conditions of planetary regoliths. We demonstrate that our approach achieves improvements that have been mostly unattainable with previous methods as well as give a critical analysis of its effectiveness. This work advances the development of more effective light scattering models for planetary regoliths which is crucial for accurate mineralogical analyses from remote sensing data.

TI  - Detection of the spatiotemporal patterns of beetle-induced tamarisk (<i>Tamarix</i> spp.) defoliation along the Lower Rio Grande using Landsat TM images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) has long been targeted for removal by land managers in the western United States. Biocontrol of the non-native tamarisk started in 2001 by introducing the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda spp.) to the riparian ecosystems. Since then, the beetles quickly established and substantial tamarisk defoliation was subsequently observed along river corridors in the western states. The ability to monitor and track the patterns of beetle-induced tamarisk defoliation across space and time is key to understand its impact on ecosystem functioning and processes. In the present study, spatiotemporal patterns of tamarisk defoliation caused by the subtropical tamarisk leaf beetle (D. sublineata) were successfully detected using a classification based method along the Lower Rio Grande in West Texas from 2009 to 2014. Our results indicated that the subtropical beetle species can sustain a dispersal rate of approximately 102 km yr(-1) during the first year after release. Tamarisk abundance was the most important factor in directing beetle dispersal. We also found that the beetles preferred to forage within dense, connected tamarisk stands along wide sections of the riparian river corridors. These new findings of our study will help inform the land managers of the possible outcomes of tamarisk biocontrol to make effective management plans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trends in land use and land cover change in the protected and communal areas of the Zambezi Region, Namibia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land management decisions have extensively modified land use and land cover in the Zambezi Region. These decisions are influenced by land tenure classifications, legislation, and livelihoods. Land use and land cover change is an important indicator for quantifying the effectiveness of different land management strategies. However, there has been no evidence on whether protected or communal land tenure is more affected by land use and land cover changes in southern Africa and particularly Namibia. Our study attempted to fill this gap by analyzing the relationship between land use and land cover change and land tenure regimes stratified according to protected and communal area in the Zambezi Region. Multi-temporal Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery were used to determine the temporal dynamics of land use and land cover change from 1984 to 2010. The landscape showed distinctive modifications over the study period; broad trends include the increase in forest land after 1991. However, changes were not uniform across the study areas. Two landscape development stages were deduced: (1) 1984-1991 represented high deforestation and gradual increase in shrub land; (2) 1991-2000 and 2000-2010 represented lower deforestation and slower agropastoral expansion. The results further show clear patterns of the dynamics, magnitude, and direction of land use and land cover change by tenure regime. The study concluded that land tenure has a direct impact on land use and land cover, since it may restrict some activities carried out on the land in the Zambezi Region.

CP  - 61st Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials (MMM)
CL  - New Orleans, LA
AB  - We previously developed a magnetic probe equipped with a ring-shaped permanent magnet for detecting magnetic nanoparticle tracer accumulating in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). The magnetic probe enables us to identify SLNs objectively, without the risk of radiation exposure, unlike the conventional technique using dye and radioisotope. A technical challenge of the probe is to reduce the tip diameter of magnet to identify smaller SLNs. In this study, we optimized the size of smaller-tip magnet based on numerical analyses using the finite element method and evaluated the expected sensitivity. According to the analysis results, the optimum tip diameter and length of convex-shaped magnet were 16mmand 12 mm, respectively. The experimental results showed that the sensitivity of the probe with smaller-tip magnet was comparable to the previous one. We successfully developed a smaller tip magnet, maintaining the sensitivity to magnetic nanoparticles. The proposed probe will be capable of identifying the location of SLNs more easily.

TI  - Evaluation of Anthelmintic Resistance and Exhaust Air Dust PCR as a Diagnostic Tool in Mice Enzootically Infected with <i>Aspiculuris tetraptera</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The entry of infectious agents in rodent colonies occurs despite robust sentinel monitoring programs, strict quarantine measures, and stringent biosecurity practices. In light of several outbreaks with Aspiculuris tetraptera in our facilities, we investigated the presence of anthelmintic resistance and the use of exhaust air dust (EAD) PCR for early detection of A. tetraptera infection. To determine anthelmintic resistance, C57BL/6, DBA/2, and NCr nude mice were experimentally inoculated with embryonated A. tetraptera ova harvested from enzootically infected mice, followed by treatment with 150 ppm fenbendazole in feed, 150 ppm fenbendazole plus 5 ppm piperazine in feed, or 2.1 mg/mL piperazine in water for 4 or 8 wk. Regardless of the mouse strain or treatment, no A. tetraptera were recovered at necropsy, indicating the lack of resistance in the worms to anthelmintic treatment. In addition, 10 of 12 DBA/2 positive-control mice cleared the A. tetraptera infection without treatment. To evaluate the feasibility of EAD PCR for A. tetraptera, 69 cages of breeder mice enzootically infected with A. tetraptera were housed on a Tecniplast IVC rack as a field study. On day 0, 56% to 58% of the cages on this rack tested positive for A. tetraptera by PCR and fecal centrifugation flotation (FCF). PCR from EAD swabs became positive for A. tetraptera DNA within 1 wk of placing the above cages on the rack. When these mice were treated with 150 ppm fenbendazole in feed, EAD PCR reverted to pinworm-negative after 1 mo of treatment and remained negative for an additional 8 wk. The ability of EAD PCR to detect few A. tetraptera positive mice was investigated by housing only 6 infected mice on another IVC rack as a field study. The EAD PCR from this rack was positive for A. tetraptera DNA within 1 wk of placing the positive mice on it. These findings demonstrate that fenbendazole is still an effective anthelmintic and that EAD PCR is a rapid, noninvasive assay that may be a useful diagnostic tool for antemortem detection of A. tetraptera infection, in conjunction with fecal PCR and FCF.

TI  - Effective supervised multiple-feature learning for fused radar and optical data classification
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In multi-sensor data fusion based on multiple features, the high dimensionality of feature space increases the runtime and computational complexity. The present study proposes a new algorithm based on the combination of random subspace (RS), linear discriminant analysis and sparse regularisation (LDASR), namely RS-LDASR for feature space dimensionality reduction, supervised feature selection, and learning. The use of RSs can effectively solve the problem of high dimensionality and high feature-to-instance ratio. The extraction of multiple features from the images raises the possibility of a correlation between features which reduce classification accuracy. In this study, after the construction of several RSs, supervised feature selection and learning based on LDASR were applied with very high accuracy. Classification and image fusion for remote sensing data analysis were tested by the implementation of feature-based fusion on two pairs of fused synthetic aperture radar and optical data. Four feature matrices were constructed using attribute profiles (APs), multi-APs (MAPs), non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), and textural features. Support vector machine and rotation forest were applied as the base classifiers. The results show that use of RS-LDASR significantly improved the classification accuracy based on NMF plus texture features and even NMF alone.

TI  - Evaluation of the Plant Phenology Index (PPI), NDVI and EVI for Start-of-Season Trend Analysis of the Northern Hemisphere Boreal Zone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of plant phenology provides an important indicator of climate change. However, start of the growing season (SOS) estimates in Northern Hemisphere boreal forest areas are known to be challenged by the presence of seasonal snow cover and limited seasonality in the greenness signal for evergreen needleleaf forests, which can both bias and impede trend estimates of SOS. The newly developed Plant Phenology Index (PPI) was specifically designed to overcome both problems. Here we use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2000-2014) to analyze the ability of PPI for estimating start of season (SOS) in boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, in comparison to two other widely applied indices for SOS retrieval: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Satellite-based SOS is evaluated against gross primary production (GPP)-retrieved SOS derived from a network of flux tower observations in boreal areas (a total of 81 site-years analyzed). Spatiotemporal relationships between SOS derived from PPI, EVI and NDVI are furthermore studied for different boreal land cover types and regions. The overall correlation between SOS derived from VIs and ground measurements was rather low, but PPI performed significantly better (r = 0.50, p < 0.01) than EVI and NDVI which both showed a very poor correlation (r = 0.11, p = 0. 16 and r = 0.08, p = 0.24). PPI, EVI and NDVI overall produce similar trends in SOS for the Northern Hemisphere showing an advance in SOS towards earlier dates (0.28, 0.23 and 0.26 days/year), but a pronounced difference in trend estimates between PPI and EVI/NDVI is observed for different land cover types. Deciduous needleleaf forest is characterized by the largest advance in SOS when considering all indices, yet PPI showed less dramatic changes as compared to EVI/NDVI (0.47 days/year as compared to 0.62 and 0.74). PPI SOS trends were found to be higher for deciduous broadleaf forests and savannas (0.54 and 0.56 days/year). Taken together, the findings of this study suggest improved performance of PPI over NDVI and EVI in retrieval of SOS in boreal regions and precautions must be taken when interpreting spatio-temporal patterns of SOS from the latter two indices.

AB  - Sea ice concentration (SIC) is an important sea ice parameter for sea ice navigation, environmental research, and weather and ice forecasting. We have developed and tested a method for estimation of the Baltic Sea SIC using SENTINEL-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 passive microwave radiometer (MWR) data. Here, we present the method and results for January 2016. Ice concentration grids of Finnish Meteorological Institute daily ice charts have been used as reference data in this paper. We present a comparison of four SIC estimation methods with our reference data. In addition to the combined SAR/MWR SIC estimation method, we also compare SIC estimates produced using SAR alone and two MWR-based methods. The main target of this paper was to develop and test a high-resolution SIC estimation method suitable for operational use.

TI  - A loop-like relationship between water surface area of Lake Dongting and water level at Chenglingji, the Yangtze River
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Dongting is the second largest freshwater lake in China, directly connected to the Yangtze River. It has significance of practical effects on flood control, drought prevention and wetland conservation. This study addresses spatial-temporal variation in water surface area of Lake Dongting and its relationship with water level at Chenglingji of the Yangtze River. Water surface area were extracted from multi-temporal images of the Terra/MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) for the years 2000-2012. In combination of water level data of Chenglingji, a loop-like relationship was explored between the lake water surface area and the water level. Our results show that the lake area decreased from 2000 to 2012, with a strong seasonal variation in terms of rising (April-June), flooding (July-September), retreating (October-December) and drying (January-March) periods. The inundated area displays a seasonal change of spatial pattern with expansion from lake center to its maximum bounds during February-August and contraction from its maximum bounds to lake center during September-January. The lake water surface has a good correlation with the water level at Chenglingji and the correlation coefficient varies in seasons with the minimum value for drying period, the maximum for flooding period, and relatively high values for rising and retreating periods. The variation is probably related to the difference in controlling factors in different time periods. The Yangtze River has a relatively large impact on the loop-like relationship in drying season and flooding season, especially for the east Lake Dongting, which is the case even for high-and low-water years. Our findings offer an insight into the complexity of river-lake relationship and provide an important basis for flooding prevention in Lake Dongting and the mid-and lower-reaches of Yangtze River.

TI  - Contextual variation in the alarm call responses of dwarf mongooses, <i>Helogale parvula</i>
T2  - ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - Alarm calling is a widespread antipredator behaviour, but it is not always a reliable indication of real danger. Individuals must decide when to respond to alarm calls as a function of the relative costs and benefits, but experiments investigating contextual influences are rare. We used playback experiments in conjunction with supplementary feeding and the presentation of direct predator cues to examine variation in receiver responses to alarm calls in a habituated population of wild dwarf mongooses. First, we investigated whether individuals adjust their response to alarm calls depending on their own satiation level and spatial position of the caller. Individuals were more likely to respond to alarm calls when they had received supplementary food, and hence could prioritize minimization of predation risk over starvation. There was also increased responsiveness to alarm calls given by individuals from elevated positions compared to those on the ground; sentinels (raised guards) are more likely to detect potential predators than foragers, and alarm calls from elevated positions are probably perceived as more reliable. When individuals did respond, they were more likely to flee following an alarm call given from ground level; foragers are likely to detect predators in closer proximity than sentinels, requiring more urgent escape responses. Second, we examined how individuals combine social information provided by alarm calls with personal information relating to predator presence. Receiver responses to terrestrial and aerial alarm calls did not differ when they followed interaction with an olfactory predator cue compared to an olfactory control cue. Following interaction with a terrestrial predator cue, however, latency to nonvigilance was significantly longer after hearing an aerial alarm call than after hearing a terrestrial alarm call, potentially because of social information novelty. Our results provide experimental evidence that receivers respond flexibly to alarm calls depending on receiver, signaller and external factors.

TI  - Individual, interpersonal, and organisational factors of healthcare conflict: A scoping review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Unresolved conflicts among healthcare professionals can lead to difficult patient care consequences. This scoping review examines the current healthcare literature that reported sources and consequences of conflict associated with individual, interpersonal, and organisational factors. We identified 99 articles published between 2001 and 2015 from PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Excerpta Medical Database. Most reviewed studies relied on healthcare professionals' perceptions and beliefs associated with conflict sources and consequences, with few studies reporting behavioural or organisational change outcomes. Individual conflict sources included personal traits, such as self-focus, self-esteem, or worldview, as well as individuals' conflict management styles. These conflicts posed threats to one's physical, mental, and emotional health and to one's ability to perform at work. Interpersonal dynamics were hampered by colleagues' uncivil behaviours, such as low degree of support, to more destructive behaviours including bullying or humiliation. Perceptions of disrespectful working environment and weakened team collaboration were the main interpersonal conflict consequences. Organisational conflict sources included ambiguity in professional roles, scope of practice, reporting structure, or workflows, negatively affecting healthcare professionals' job satisfactions and intent to stay. Future inquiries into healthcare conflict research may target the following: shifting from research involving single professions to multiple professions; dissemination of studies via journals that promote interprofessional research; inquiries into the roles of unconscious or implicit bias, or psychological capital (i.e., resilience) in healthcare conflict; and diversification of data sources to include hospital or clinic data with implications for conflict sources.

TI  - Surgical treatment of early ovarian cancer with compartmental resection of regional lymphatic network and indocyanine-green-guided targeted compartmental lymphadenectomy (TCL, paraaortic part)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Whether pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy is of therapeutic benefit in advanced ovarian cancer will remain unclear until the publication of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie lymphadenectomy in ovarian neoplasms (AGO LION) trial. In early ovarian cancer, however, lymphadenectomy seems mandatory for diagnostic and also therapeutic reasons [1-3].Methods: Complete systematic lymphadenectomy is accompanied by morbidity which may be reduced by sentinel node biopsy already established for several solid tumors [4-6]. In ovarian cancer there are 2 main pathways in lymphatic drainage: along the ovarian vessels to the para-aortic nodes and the uterine vessels to the iliac lymph compartments [7]. Following injection of radioactive dye into the ovarian ligaments this could be confirmed suggesting that there is bidirectional flow at this level of the ovarian and uterine lymphatic pathways [8]. Indocyanine-green-guided (ICG) injection to the uterine corpus seems to be equally effective in labelling the "uterine Mullerian" and the "ovarian mesonephric" lymphatic drainage of the ovary [9,10].Results: This technique [9] was applied and will be outlined in the video showing the procedure with respect to the para-aortic lymphatic drainage. Isolated sentinel node biopsy and tumor excision will not resect the organ compartment together with its super-ordinated draining lymphatic system at risk.Conclusion: Thus, the authors suggest to remove the malignancy together with its draining lymphatic vessels and at least the first 2 sentinel nodes in each channel en bloc; we propose to analyze this procedure consistent with the ontogenetic approach [11, 12] with respect to diagnostic accuracy and loco-regional control. This could potentially avoid most of systematic lymphadenectomies in early ovarian cancer.

TI  - Outcome After Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection in Vulvar Cancer: A Subgroup Analysis of the AGO-CaRE-1 Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing the large patient cohort of the multicenter AGO-CaRE-1 study, we compared isolated sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) with radical lymph node dissection (LND) of the groin in relation to recurrence rates and survival.The AGO-CaRE-1 study retrospectively collected data on treatment patterns and follow-up of vulvar cancer patients [International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage 1B] treated at 29 gynecologic cancer centers between 1998 and 2008. This subgroup analysis evaluated the influence of SLND alone on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).In 487 (63.1%) of 772 included patients with tumors smaller than 4 cm, an LND was performed and no metastatic lymph nodes were detected (LN0). Another 69/772 (8.9%) women underwent SLND alone, showing a negative SLN (SLN0). Tumors in the LN0 group were larger and showed a deeper invasion (LN0 vs. SLN0 tumor diameter: 20.0 vs. 13.0 mm, p < 0.001; depth of invasion: 4.0 vs. 3.0 mm, p = 0.002). After a median follow-up of 33 months (0-156), no significant differences in relation to isolated groin recurrence rates (SLN0 3.0% vs. LN0 3.4%, p = 0.845) were detected. Similarly, univariate 3-year PFS analysis showed no significant differences between both groups (SLN0 82.7% vs. LN0 77.6%, p = 0.230). A multivariate Cox regression analysis, including tumor diameter, depth of invasion, age, grading, and lymphovascular space invasion was performed: PFS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.970, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.517-1.821] and OS (HR 0.695, 95% CI 0.261-1.849) did not differ significantly between both cohorts.This subgroup analysis of the large AGO-CaRE-1 study showed similar results for groin LND and SLND alone with regard to recurrence rates and survival in node-negative patients with tumors < 4 cm.

TI  - Feedback of observed interannual vegetation change: a regional climate model analysis for the West African monsoon
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - West Africa is a hot spot region for land-atmosphere coupling where atmospheric conditions and convective rainfall can strongly depend on surface characteristics. To investigate the effect of natural interannual vegetation changes on the West African monsoon precipitation, we implement satellite-derived dynamical datasets for vegetation fraction (VF), albedo and leaf area index into the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Two sets of 4-member ensembles with dynamic and static land surface description are used to extract vegetation-related changes in the interannual difference between August-September 2009 and 2010. The observed vegetation patterns retain a significant long-term memory of preceding rainfall patterns of at least 2 months. The interannual vegetation changes exhibit the strongest effect on latent heat fluxes and associated surface temperatures. We find a decrease (increase) of rainy hours over regions with higher (lower) VF during the day and the opposite during the night. The probability that maximum precipitation is shifted to nighttime (daytime) over higher (lower) VF is 12 % higher than by chance. We attribute this behaviour to horizontal circulations driven by differential heating. Over more vegetated regions, the divergence of moist air together with lower sensible heat fluxes hinders the initiation of deep convection during the day. During the night, mature convective systems cause an increase in the number of rainy hours over these regions. We identify this feedback in both water-and energy-limited regions of West Africa. The inclusion of observed dynamical surface information improved the spatial distribution of modelled rainfall in the Sahel with respect to observations, illustrating the potential of satellite data as a boundary constraint for atmospheric models.

TI  - Using digital camera and Landsat imagery with eddy covariance data to model gross primary production in restored wetlands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands have the ability to accumulate large amounts of carbon (C), and therefore wetland restoration has been proposed as a means of sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) to help mitigate climate change. There is a growing interest in using the C services of wetlands to help reduce habitat loss and finance restoration projects. However, including wetlands in C markets worldwide requires a better mechanistic understanding of CO2 and methane exchange and instruments and models that can accurately and inexpensively monitor and predict these fluxes across global wetlands. Remote sensing technology, including near-surface and satellite instruments/approaches, is an effective tool for modeling C fluxes including gross primary productivity (GPP) from the site to global scale. In this study, we evaluate the potential of using digital cameras as a simple, cost-effective means of estimating GPP in restored wetlands, and assess the suitability of using Landsat data to model GPP in these environments for regional upscaling. Our research focused on restored temperate freshwater marshes due to their high C sequestration potential.As observed in other ecosystems, daily GPP was strongly correlated with site greenness derived from camera imagery (GCC(cam)). Based on this, we show the potential of using GCCcam and eddy covariance data to adapt and parameterize a light use efficiency (LUE) model to predict daily GPP. The LUE model combining GCCcam and meteorological data was able to explain up to 91% of the variation in daily GPP at the restored marshes, and predict annual GPP budgets within 0% to 20% of observed budgets. However, model performance decreased with increasing site complexity, highlighting the need to explicitly consider spatial heterogeneity in LUE models. We also tested a similar model using Landsat-derived indices, and found that although model performance was high at a homogeneous wetland dominated by emergent vegetation, data-model agreement decreased at a site comprised of a mixture of open water and vegetation, reflecting limitations of Landsat data. Nonetheless, we show that digital camera and Land sat imagery can be used to model photosynthesis in restored wetlands, providing low-cost methods for monitoring C capture that can be used in C market-funded wetland conservation and restoration.

We apply our recent extension theorem for vector-valued Bake one functions to obtain an extension theorem for vector-valued functions f : F -> Y with pre-assigned derivatives, with preservation of differentiability (at every point where the pre-assigned derivative is actually a derivative), preservation of continuity, preservation of (point-wise) Lipschitz property and (for finite dimensional domain X) preservation of strict differentiability and global (eventually local) Lipschitz continuity.

TI  - UNITED STATES NOTIFICATIONS OF TRAVELERS FROM EBOLA-AFFECTED COUNTRIES
T2  - HEALTH SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The International Health Regulations (IHR), an international law under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO), mandates that countries notify other countries of "travelers under public health observation.'' Between November 10, 2014, and July 12, 2015, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made 2,374 notifications to the National IHR Focal Points in 114 foreign countries of travelers who were monitored by US health departments because they had been to an Ebola-affected country in West Africa. Given that countries have preidentified focal points as points of contacts for sharing of public health information, notifications could be made by CDC to a trusted public health recipient in another country within 24 hours of receipt of the traveler's information from a US health department. The majority of US health departments used this process, offered by CDC, to notify other countries of travelers intending to leave the United States while being monitored in their jurisdiction.

AB  - Based on satellite and in situ data, we quantitatively estimated the penetration of PAR (photosynthetically available solar radiation in the visible spectral range of 400-700 nm) into waters of the central Barents Sea in the summer seasons of 2014-2016. The effects of cloudiness and coccolithophore blooms on the incidence and penetration of PAR was examined. These blooms occur in the Barents Sea almost every year. We estimated the impact of visible solar radiation on the SST against a background of incoming warmer waters of the Norwegian Current and established that the PAR impact is the most pronounced under clear sky conditions in July and August.

TI  - Impacts of Thermal Time on Land Surface Phenology in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas alter local atmospheric conditions by modifying surface albedo and consequently the surface radiation and energy balances, releasing waste heat from anthropogenic uses, and increasing atmospheric aerosols, all of which combine to increase temperatures in cities, especially overnight, compared with surrounding rural areas, resulting in a phenomenon called the "urban heat island" effect. Recent rapid urbanization of the planet has generated calls for remote sensing research related to the impacts of urban areas and urbanization on the natural environment. Spatially extensive, high spatial resolution data products are needed to capture phenological patterns in regions with heterogeneous land cover and external drivers such as cities, which are comprised of a mixture of land cover/land uses and experience microclimatic influences. Here we use the 30 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product from the Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project to analyze the impacts of urban areas and their surface heat islands on the seasonal development of the vegetated land surface along an urban-rural gradient for 19 cities located in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We fit NDVI observations from 2003-2012 as a quadratic function of thermal time as accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) calculated from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1 km land surface temperature product to model decadal land surface phenology metrics at 30 m spatial resolution. In general, duration of growing season (measured in AGDD) in green core areas is equivalent to duration of growing season in urban extent areas, but significantly longer than duration of growing season in areas outside of the urban extent. We found an exponential relationship in the difference of duration of growing season between urban and surrounding rural areas as a function of distance from urban core areas for perennial vegetation, with an average magnitude of 669 AGDD (base 0 degrees C) and the influence of urban areas extending greater than 11 km from urban core areas. At the regional scale, relative change in duration of growing season does not appear to be significantly related to total area of urban extent, population, or latitude. The distance and magnitude that urban areas exert influence on vegetation in and near cities is relatively uniform.

AB  - Recent improvements in imaging diagnostics has led to a rising incidence of oligometastatic prostate cancer and, most notably, an increasing incidence of nodal-only biochemical recurrences. In this clinical setting, systemic therapy is still the treatment of choice. However, there is increasing evidence for surgical approaches in this challenging clinical setting.In this comprehensive review article, current evidence regarding surgical approaches of primary nodal metastases, nodal-only biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy, and osseous metastatic prostate cancer will be discussed.If nodal metastasis is clinically suspected, a significant survival benefit was observed in retrospective studies if radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed within a multimodal therapeutic setting. Salvage lymphadenectomy as a therapeutic option for nodal-only biochemical recurrence is clinically feasible and can postpone systemic therapy significantly. However, since most patients do not have a lasting PSA response, a survival benefit of this therapeutic approach is questionable based on current evidence. Regarding osseous metastatic prostate cancer, the surgical approach has an inferior position compared to conservative management and radiotherapy.Evidence regarding a surgical approach towards oligometastatic prostate cancer is increasing. However, current evidence is mainly based on retrospective studies that were conducted in the pre-PSMA-PET/CT era.

TI  - Temporal fluctuations and frontal area change of Bangni and Dunagiri glaciers from 1962 to 2013, Dhauliganga Basin, central Himalaya, India
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers have been receding for the last 100 years in many glaciated regions of the world, and the rate of recession has accelerated during the last 60 years. Recent assessments of changes in glaciers in the Himalaya have usually recognized their variable rate of recession. The present study deals with snout retreat, frontal area vacation, and estimation of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of Bangni and Dunagiri glaciers, in the Dhauliganga Basin, central Himalaya (India), using multi-image satellite data (Landsat MSS, 1976; Landsat TM, 1990; Landsat ETM +, 2005) and Survey of India topographic maps (1962; 1:50,000) along with field surveys (2012 to 2014) for the period of 1962-2013. The meteorological data of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and TRMM suggested that the central Himalaya received less precipitation between 1960 and 1990. Because of the less precipitation, glaciers receded rapidly during this period. The present study shows that Bangni and Dunagiri glaciers retreated similar to 2080 +/- 162 m and similar to 484 +/- 38 m with average rates of similar to 41 +/- 3.2 m a(-1) and similar to 9 +/- 0.6 m a(-1) between 1962 and 2013, respectively. During this period Bangni and Dunagiri glaciers lost about 17% and 11% of their length, respectively. The result also suggested that Bangni Glacier vacated similar to 598,948 +/- 12,257 m(2) frontal area, while Dunagiri Glacier vacated similar to 170,428 +/- 7833 m2 frontal area between 1962 and 2013. Moreover, the estimated ELA change for Bangni Glacier was similar to 64 +/- 30 m upward during the study period. The Geological Survey of India (GSI, 1998a,b) suggested that the ELA of Dunagiri Glacier rose similar to 28 m between 1984 and 1992 and that the glacier lost similar to(-)16 x 10(6) m(3) w.e. ice with an average rate of loss of similar to(-)1.04 m w.e.a(-1). The geomorphology of the Dunagiri Valley reflected that Bangni and Dunagiri glaciers were joined together in the past. Nevertheless, these two glaciers retreat at different rates, indicating that climate change is not the only factor in glacier retreat but that geometry (size, shape, slope, and orientation) of the glacier and basin topography also plays a major role.

TI  - Deep Learning Classification of Land Cover and Crop Types Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL) is a powerful state-of-the-art technique for image processing including remote sensing (RS) images. This letter describes a multilevel DL architecture that targets land cover and crop type classification from multitemporal multisource satellite imagery. The pillars of the architecture are unsupervised neural network (NN) that is used for optical imagery segmentation and missing data restoration due to clouds and shadows, and an ensemble of supervised NNs. As basic supervised NN architecture, we use a traditional fully connected multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the most commonly used approach in RS community random forest, and compare them with convolutional NNs (CNNs). Experiments are carried out for the joint experiment of crop assessment and monitoring test site in Ukraine for classification of crops in a heterogeneous environment using nineteen multitemporal scenes acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A RS satellites. The architecture with an ensemble of CNNs outperforms the one with MLPs allowing us to better discriminate certain summer crop types, in particular maize and soybeans, and yielding the target accuracies more than 85% for all major crops (wheat, maize, sunflower, soybeans, and sugar beet).

T2  - AIP ADVANCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 61st Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials (MMM)
CL  - New Orleans, LA
AB  - An experimental apparatus for three-dimensional sensitivity mapping of a handheld magnetic probe with a permanent magnet and a Hall sensorwas developed. To optimize the shapes and sizes of the magnets, the sensitivity mappings of two types of magnets, column-and cone-type magnets, were evaluated by the experimental apparatus. The longitudinal sensitivities of column and cone types are 8 and 9 mm, respectively, for 5 mu L of magnetic nanoparticles. The measured longitudinal sensitivities agree well with the sensitivities calculated by the finite element method. Furthermore, the maximum lateral resolutions of column and cone types are 4.1 and 3.7 mm, respectively. In terms of the directionality, the sensitivities of column and cone types of the angle of 90 degrees with respect to the probe axis fall approximately to 72% and 50% at 6 mm distance from the probe head, indicating that the cone type has high directionality due to its sharp shape. The measurement of sensitivity mapping revealed that the characteristics of the cone-type magnet are superior to that of the column-type magnet for the identification of sentinel lymph nodes.

TI  - Observed and projected sea surface temperature seasonal changes in the Western English Channel from satellite data and CMIP5 multi-model ensemble
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal Sea Surface Temperature (SST) changes in the Western English Channel have been estimated for the previous decades from high-resolution satellite data. Coastal seas, well separated from offshore waters by intense frontal structures, show colder SST by 1-2 degrees C in summer. A significant warming trend is observed in the autumn season. This positive trend is stronger offshore, with an annual mean SST increase of 0.32 degrees C decade(-1), but weaker in coastal waters (0.23 degrees C decade(-1)), where strong vertical mixing induced by tides and winds acts to reduce surface warming. The performance of an ensemble of CMIP5 climate model in simulating recent seasonal changes of SST in the region is estimated. The median of CMIP5 models very well reproduces the observed SST mean seasonal cycle in offshore waters but is less proficient in the coastal sector due to the coarse resolution of the models and the absence of tidal forcing and related processes. In the Iroise Sea, a region of intense biological activity located off the western tip of Brittany, the trend of the annual mean SST is relatively well simulated, albeit somewhat underestimated (0.20 degrees C decade(-1)) and evenly distributed throughout the year. Here, the increase in annual mean SST in CMIP5 future scenarios simulations ranges from 0.5 degrees C (RCP2.6) to 2.5 degrees C (RCP8.5) by year 2100, with a seasonal modulation leading to a more intense warming in summer than that in winter. This increase in SST may strongly affect marine biology, particularly phytoplankton phenology, macro-algae biomass and benthic fauna, including exploited shellfish, in the Western English Channel.

TI  - A Machine Learning Method for Co-Registration and Individual Tree Matching of Forest Inventory and Airborne Laser Scanning Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the exact position of a forest inventory plot-and hence the position of the sampled trees-is often hampered by a poor Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal quality beneath the forest canopy. Inaccurate geo-references hamper the performance of models that aim to retrieve useful information from spatially high remote sensing data (e.g., species classification or timber volume estimation). This restriction is even more severe on the level of individual trees. The objective of this study was to develop a post-processing strategy to improve the positional accuracy of GNSS-measured sample-plot centers and to develop a method to automatically match trees within a terrestrial sample plot to aerial detected trees. We propose a new method which uses a random forest classifier to estimate the matching probability of each terrestrial-reference and aerial detected tree pair, which gives the opportunity to assess the reliability of the results. We investigated 133 sample plots of the Third German National Forest Inventory (BWI, 2011-2012) within the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. For training and objective validation, synthetic forest stands have been modeled using the Waldplaner 2.0 software. Our method has achieved an overall accuracy of 82.7% for co-registration and 89.1% for tree matching. With our method, 60% of the investigated plots could be successfully relocated. The probabilities provided by the algorithm are an objective indicator of the reliability of a specific result which could be incorporated into quantitative models to increase the performance of forest attribute estimations.

TI  - The Influence of Psychosocial Constructs on the Adherence to Active Surveillance for Localized Prostate Cancer in a Prospective, Population-based Cohort
T2  - UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To evaluate the influence of psychosocial factors such as prostate cancer (PCa) anxiety, social support, participation in medical decision-making (PDM), and educational level on patient decisions to discontinue PCa active surveillance (AS) in the absence of disease progression.METHODS The Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation study is a prospective, population-based cohort study of men with localized PCa diagnosed in 2011-2012. PCa anxiety, social support, PDM, educational level, and patient reasons for discontinuing AS were assessed through patient surveys. A Cox proportional hazards model examined the relationship between psychosocial variables and time to discontinuation of AS.RESULTS Of 531 patients on AS, 165 (30.9%) underwent treatment after median follow-up of 37 months. Whereas 69% of patients cited only medical reasons for discontinuing AS, 31% cited at least 1 personal reason, and 8% cited personal reasons only. Patients with some college education discontinued AS significantly earlier (hazard ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 3.2) than patients with less education. PCa anxiety, social support, and PDM were not associated with seeking treatment.CONCLUSION We found that 31% of men who choose AS for PCa discontinue AS within 3 years. Eight percent of men who sought treatment did so in the absence of disease progression. Education, but not psychosocial factors, seems to influence definitive treatment-seeking. Future research is needed to understand how factors unrelated to disease severity influence treatment decisions among patients on AS to identify opportunities to improve adherence to AS.

TI  - Examining Spatial Variation in the Effects of Japanese Red Pine (<i>Pinus densiflora</i>) on Burn Severity Using Geographically Weighted Regression
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Burn severity has profound impacts on the response of post-fire forest ecosystems to fire events. Numerous previous studies have reported that burn severity is determined by variables such as meteorological conditions, pre-fire forest structure, and fuel characteristics. An underlying assumption of these studies was the constant effects of environmental variables on burn severity over space, and these analyses therefore did not consider the spatial dimension. This study examined spatial variation in the effects of Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) on burn severity. Specifically, this study investigated the presence of spatially varying relationships between Japanese red pine and burn severity due to changes in slope and elevation. We estimated conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models and compared them using three criteria; the coefficients of determination (R-2), Akaike information criterion for small samples (Lambda ICc), and Moran's I-value. The GWR model performed considerably better than the OLS model in explaining variation in burn severity. The results provided strong evidence that the effect of Japanese red pine on burn severity was not constant but varied spatially. Elevation was a significant factor in the variation in the effects of Japanese red pine on burn severity. The influence of red pine on burn severity was considerably higher in low-elevation areas but became less important than the other variables in high-elevation areas. The results of this study can be applied to location-specific strategies for forest managers and can be adopted to improve fire simulation models to more realistically mimic the nature of fire behavior.

TI  - Analysis on the Applicability of Simulated Image from SPOT 4 HRVIR Image
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the reducing number of satellite images with various periods and good quality caused not only by changes in climate conditions, but also typhoons, rainy seasons, and various atmospheric changes, continuous image production and identification of changes in biophysical characteristics have become increasingly difficult. To remedy this, the production of simulated image that consider user-preferred periods and satellite geometric information can be one of alternatives. In this study, a simulated image generation method that uses the back project under collinearity conditions and atmospheric simulation is proposed. To create input data for the generation of simulated image, we produced SPOT-4 HRVIR satellite image that geometric and atmospheric corrections are processed. The analysis results on the similarity between simulated image and target image show average R-2 of 0.88. In addition, the experimental results for each image application field showed that (1) in the case of natural color composite, pixels having a correlation coefficient greater than 0.99 occupied 98% of the total image, (2) the results of the NDVI, an index frequently used in the forestry field, showed that the R-2 of two images was 0.91, and (3) the results of a similarity analysis showed that, after land cover classification was performed using maximum likelihood classification, an average similarity of 96% per land cover was achieved as compared with the target image. These results verify the similarity between the simulated image and target image, and the applicability of the simulated image.

TI  - An Ensemble Spatiotemporal Model for Predicting PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although fine particulate matter with a diameter of <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) has a greater negative impact on human health than particulate matter with a diameter of <10 mu m (PM10), measurements of PM2.5 have only recently been performed, and the spatial coverage of these measurements is limited. Comprehensively assessing PM2.5 pollution levels and the cumulative health effects is difficult because PM2.5 monitoring data for prior time periods and certain regions are not available. In this paper, we propose a promising approach for robustly predicting PM2.5 concentrations. In our approach, a generalized additive model is first used to quantify the non-linear associations between predictors and PM2.5, the bagging method is used to sample the dataset and train different models to reduce the bias in prediction, and the variogram for the daily residuals of the ensemble predictions is then simulated to improve our predictions. Shandong Province, China, is the study region, and data from 96 monitoring stations were included. To train and validate the models, we used PM2.5 measurement data from 2014 with other predictors, including PM10 data, meteorological parameters, remote sensing data, and land-use data. The validation results revealed that the R-2 value was improved and reached 0.89 when PM10 was used as a predictor and a kriging interpolation was performed for the residuals. However, when PM10 was not used as a predictor, our method still achieved a CV R-2 value of up to 0.86. The ensemble of spatial characteristics of relevant factors explained approximately 32% of the variance and improved the PM2.5 predictions. The spatiotemporal modeling approach to estimating PM2.5 concentrations presented in this paper has important implications for assessing PM2.5 exposure and its cumulative health effects.

TI  - Super-Resolution Reconstruction of High-Resolution Satellite ZY-3 TLC Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution (SR) image reconstruction is a technique used to recover a high-resolution image using the cumulative information provided by several low-resolution images. With the help of SR techniques, satellite remotely sensed images can be combined to achieve a higher-resolution image, which is especially useful for a two-or three-line camera satellite, e.g., the ZY-3 high-resolution Three Line Camera (TLC) satellite. In this paper, we introduce the application of the SR reconstruction method, including motion estimation and the robust super-resolution technique, to ZY-3 TLC images. The results show that SR reconstruction can significantly improve both the resolution and image quality of ZY-3 TLC images.

TI  - Quantification of the response of global terrestrial net primary production to multifactor global change
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on an updated and comprehensive global NPP database, an artificial neural network (ANN) data mining approach was used to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns and control factors on global terrestrial ecosystem NPP between 1961 and 2010. Five variables (precipitation, air temperature, leaf area index, fraction of photosynthetically active radiation and atmospheric CO2 concentration) were selected and integrated to develop a three-layer back-propagation (BP) ANN model. The results indicated that the ANN method is capable of simulating and predicting the NPP of the global terrestrial ecosystem, yielding a simulation accuracy of 0.72 and a prediction accuracy of 0.60. The estimated global mean annual NPP was approximately 61.46 Pg C between 1961 and 2010, with an annual increase of 0.23 Pg C and a total increasing of 10.14 Pg C. The middle and high latitudinal zones made the major contribution to the total NPP increasing with percentage of 87.5% (8.87 Pg C), whereas the low latitude zone made the remaining contribution (1.27 Pg C). The atmospheric CO2 concentration was found to be the dominant factor that controlled the interannual variability and to be the major contribution (45.3%) of global NPP. Leaf area index, climate and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation resulted in NPP increases of 21.8%, 18.3% and 14.6%, respectively. Overall, multiple factors jointly control the variation in global NPP, and it is vital to consider the underlying mechanisms of combined environmental effects on NPP in future studies.

TI  - Forest dynamics to precipitation and temperature in the Gulf of Mexico coastal region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest is one of the most significant components of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) coast. It provides livelihood to inhabitant and is known to be sensitive to climatic fluctuations. This study focuses on examining the impacts of temperature and precipitation variations on coastal forest. Two different regression methods, ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR), were employed to reveal the relationship between meteorological variables and forest dynamics. OLS regression analysis shows that changes in precipitation and temperature, over a span of 12 months, are responsible for 56% of NDVI variation. The forest, which is not particularly affected by the average monthly precipitation in most months, is observed to be affected by cumulative seasonal and annual precipitation explicitly. Temperature and precipitation almost equally impact on NDVI changes; about 50% of the NDVI variations is explained in OLS modeling, and about 74% of the NDVI variations is explained in GWR modeling. GWR analysis indicated that both precipitation and temperature characterize the spatial heterogeneity patterns of forest dynamics.

TI  - IMPACT OF LAND USE ON URBAN WATER-LOGGING DISASTER: A CASE STUDY OF BEIJING AND NEW YORK CITIES
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban water-logging disasters are induced by multiple causes, such as land use structure, limited capacity of drainage system, climate change and lack of enforcement. Significant increase of impervious surface area is the main cause of urban water-logging disaster in big cities like Beijing. This article takes Beijing "7.21" storm and New York hurricane "Sandy" as examples, and explains the cause of urban water-logging from the perspective of land use structure. In this study, the infiltration and retention capacity for various land use types and regional total retention storage capacity are analysed based on the Landsat TM satellite imagery of Beijing City and New York City in 2011. To estimate the impact of the land use structure, a comparison of retention capacity and runoff in two regions has been carried out using precipitation and runoff data. The results show that the significant increase of impervious surface decreases the retention capacity and becomes the main cause of urban water-logging disaster. Waters is a major factor in retention capacity, while green and cultivated land can enhance the retention effect. Reducing impervious surface, protecting waters and increasing green fields can be implemented in combination with other structural best management practice (BMPs) to control and prevent urban water-logging disaster.

TI  - Measuring Azimuth Deformation With L-Band ALOS-2 ScanSAR Interferometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze the methods for measuring azimuth deformation with the L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) interferometry. To implement the methods, we extract focused bursts from the ALOS-2 full-aperture product, which is the only product available for ScanSAR interferometry at present. The extracted bursts are properly processed to measure azimuth deformation using interferometric phase. We apply the range split-spectrum method to ScanSAR to estimate the differential ionospheric phase of the interferogram, and take the azimuth derivative of the differential ionospheric phase to mitigate the relative azimuth shift caused by ionosphere. For the first time, azimuth deformation of a large earthquake (April 25, 2015 Nepal earthquake) is nearly completely measured by the L-band ScanSAR interferometry with moderate precision. The result is validated by the azimuth deformation measured by incoherent cross correlation using a pair of high-resolution RADARSAT-2 images. In addition to the final azimuth deformation, we show the possibility of processing full-aperture ScanSAR product using a burst-by-burst approach to form regular interferograms. We also show the recent strong large-scale ionospheric effects on the L-band ALOS-2 ScanSAR interferograms. Other possible applications of this paper include measuring the movement of glaciers.

TI  - Interferometry With ALOS-2 Full-Aperture ScanSAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) is designed to routinely acquire both scanning synthetic aperture radar (ScanSAR) and stripmap data. In this paper, we present a special multiband bandpass filter (MBF) to remove azimuth nonoverlap spectra for the interferometric processing of ALOS-2 full-aperture ScanSAR product. As required by the MBF, we estimate the important ScanSAR system parameters and the start times of raw bursts using ALOS-2 full-aperture ScanSAR image. The resulting MBF can remove the nonoverlap spectra caused by both Doppler centroid frequency difference and burst misalignment. It can be used in ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry, as well as ScanSAR-stripmap interferometry. Based on the MBF, we propose a single processing workflow that is able to implement both ScanSAR-ScanSAR interferometry and ScanSAR-stripmap interferometry. Finally, we present example interferograms of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal processed using the proposed processing workflow. The interferograms are greatly improved after applying the MBF to remove the significant amount of nonoverlap spectra in the data.

TI  - Long-Term Effects of Ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> on Hypertension and Blood Pressure and Attributable Risk Among Older Chinese Adults
T2  - HYPERTENSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, has also been hypothesized to be linked to PM2.5. However, epidemiological evidence has been mixed. We examined long-term association between ambient PM2.5 and hypertension and blood pressure. We interviewed 12 665 participants aged 50 years and older and measured their blood pressures. Annual average PM2.5 concentrations were estimated for each community using satellite data. We applied 2-level logistic regression models to examine the associations and estimated hypertension burden attributable to ambient PM2.5. For each 10 mu g/ m3 increase in ambient PM2.5, the adjusted odds ratio of hypertension was 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.22). Stratified analyses found that overweight and obesity could enhance the association, and consumption of fruit was associated with lower risk. We further estimated that 11.75% (95% confidence interval, 5.82%-18.53%) of the hypertension cases (corresponding to 914, 95% confidence interval, 453-1442 cases) could be attributable to ambient PM2.5 in the study population. Findings suggest that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 might be an important risk factor of hypertension and is responsible for significant hypertension burden in adults in China. A higher consumption of fruit may mitigate, whereas overweight and obesity could enhance this effect.

TI  - Ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and Stroke Effect Modifiers and Population Attributable Risk in Six Low- and Middle-Income Countries
T2  - STROKE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose-Short-term exposure to ambient fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) has been linked to increased stroke. Few studies, however, have examined the effects of long-term exposure.Methods-A total of 45 625 participants were interviewed and included in this study, the participants came from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health, a prospective cohort in 6 low-and middle-income countries. Ambient PM2.5 levels were estimated for participants' communities using satellite data. A multilevel logistic regression model was used to examine the association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and stroke. Potential effect modification by physical activity and consumption of fruit and vegetables was assessed.Results-The odds of stroke were 1.13 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.22) for each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5. This effect remained after adjustment for confounding factors including age, sex, smoking, and indoor air pollution (adjusted odds ratio= 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.21). Further stratified analyses suggested that participants with higher levels of physical activity had greater odds of stroke, whereas those with higher consumption of fruit and vegetables had lower odds of stroke. These effects remained robust in sensitivity analyses. We further estimated that 6.55% (95% confidence interval, 1.97%-12.01%) of the stroke cases could be attributable to ambient PM2.5 in the study population.Conclusions-This study suggests that ambient PM2.5 may increase the risk of stroke and may be responsible for the astounding stroke burden in low-and middle-income countries. In addition, greater physical activity may enhance, whereas greater consumption of fruit and vegetables may mitigate the effect.

TI  - Algorithm for Recovery of Integrated Water Vapor Content in the Atmosphere over Land Surfaces Based on Satellite Spectroradiometer Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm is proposed for making charts of the distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere based on multispectral images of the earth by the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on board of the European research satellite Sentinel-3. The algorithm is based on multiple regression fits of the spectral brightness coefficients at the upper boundary of the atmosphere, the geometric parameters of the satellite location (solar and viewing angles), and the total water vapor content in the atmosphere. A regression equation is derived from experimental data on the variation in the optical characteristics of the atmosphere and underlying surface, together with Monte-Carlo calculations of the radiative transfer characteristics. The equation includes the brightness coefficients in the near IR channels of the OLCI for the absorption bands of water vapor and oxygen, as well as for the transparency windows of the atmosphere. Together these make it possible to eliminate the effect of the reflection spectrum of the underlying surface and air pressure on the accuracy of the measurements. The algorithm is tested using data from a prototype OLCI, the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS). A sample chart of the distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere over Eastern Europe is constructed without using subsatellite data and digital models of the surface relief. The water vapor contents in the atmosphere determined using MERIS images and data provided by earthbound measurements with the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) are compared with a mean square deviation of 1.24 kg/m(2).

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping reduces practice pattern variations in surgical staging for endometrial adenocarcinoma: A before and after study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To examine the effects of universal sentinel lymph node mapping on the use of nodal staging in endometrial adenocarcinoma.Methods. Two approaches to laparoscopic staging for endometrial adenocarcinoma were compared using a before and after study design. The before cohort underwent selective lymphadenectomy from January 1, 2014-October 1, 2015 while the after cohort underwent universal sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping from October 2, 2015-September 29, 2016.Results. The before cohort comprised 215 patients and the after cohort 166 patients. In women undergoing SLN mapping, a sentinel node was identified at least unilaterally in 146/153 cases (95.4%), and bilaterally in 114/153 (74.5%) of cases. Pelvic nodes were removed in 35.8% of the before cohort versus 92.2% of the after cohort (p < 0.0001) with more nodal evaluation among both low risk (9.6% vs. 91%, p < 0.0001) and high risk cases (66% vs. 94%, p < 0.0001). While the proportion of low risk cases diagnosed with nodal involvement did not significantly change (0.9% to 3.1%, p = 0.32), there was a trend toward more diagnoses of nodal involvement in high risk cases (5% to 13.2%, p = 0.06). Mean number of pelvic lymph nodes removed (15 vs. 4, p < 0.0001), mean operative time (181 min vs. 137 min, p < 0.0001), estimated blood loss (80 ml vs. 56 ml, p = 0.004), and rate of postoperative complications (13% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.04) all decreased after the adoption of SLN dissection.Conclusions. Universal sentinel lymph node dissection for laparoscopic endometrial cancer staging reduces heterogeneity in surgeon staging practice, increases nodal detection, and lowers post-operative complications.

TI  - Lack of clinical impact of <SUP>18</SUP>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with simultaneous computed tomography for stage I and II Merkel cell carcinoma with concurrent sentinel lymph node biopsy staging: A single institutional experience from Westmead Hospital, Sydney
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objective(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography with simultaneous computed tomography (PET-CT) FDG PET-CT plays an important clinical role in the staging and management of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) although its role in stage I and II disease relative to a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is undefined. This study aimed to compare the clinical impact of FDG PET-CT and SLNB on management in stage I and II MCC.MethodsThis was a retrospective observational study. Between 2000 and 2014, 65 patients with biopsy-proven MCC (all stages) underwent a staging FDG PET-CT as part of their investigations in Westmead Hospital, Sydney. Since 2006, 26 patients have had an SLNB and of these, 16 underwent both an SLNB and FDGPET-CT. All 16 patients had a histological diagnosis consistent with MCC without clinical evidence of regional or distant metastases prior to SLNB and FDG PET-CT (stages IB and IIB). These patients were assessed with respect to MCC staging and the subsequent change of patient management post-SLNB and FDG PET-CT.ResultsThe SLNB identified occult lymph node metastases in 10 patients (63%), with FDG PET-CT positive in only one patient (6%). Of the six SLNB-negative patients, none demonstrated additional metastases on the FDG PET-CT.ConclusionsIn patients with stage I and II MCC, FDG PET-CT is less sensitive than an SLNB in detecting occult metastatic lymph nodes. The routine use of FDG PET-CT in these patients may not be justified.

TI  - Comparative Assessment of Two Vegetation Fractional Cover Estimating Methods and Their Impacts on Modeling Urban Latent Heat Flux Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying vegetation fractional cover (VFC) and assessing its role in heat fluxes modeling using medium resolution remotely sensed data has received less attention than it deserves in heterogeneous urban regions. This study examined two approaches (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)-derived and Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA)-derived methods) that are commonly used to map VFC based on Landsat imagery, in modeling surface heat fluxes in urban landscape. For this purpose, two different heat flux models, Two-source energy balance (TSEB) model and Pixel Component Arranging and Comparing Algorithm (PCACA) model, were adopted for model evaluation and analysis. A comparative analysis of the NDVI-derived and MESMA-derived VFCs showed that the latter achieved more accurate estimates in complex urban regions. When the two sources of VFCs were used as inputs to both TSEB and PCACA models, MESMA-derived urban VFC produced more accurate urban heat fluxes (Bowen ratio and latent heat flux) relative to NDVI-derived urban VFC. Moreover, our study demonstrated that Landsat imagery-retrieved VFC exhibited greater uncertainty in obtaining urban heat fluxes for the TSEB model than for the PCACA model.

TI  - Examining Forest Disturbance and Recovery in the Subtropical Forest Region of Zhejiang Province Using Landsat Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of forest disturbance and recovery has received much attention during the last two decades due to its important influence on forest carbon budget estimation. This research used Landsat time-series data from 1984 to 2015 to examine forest disturbance and recovery in a subtropical region of eastern Zhejiang Province, China, through the LandTrendr algorithm. Field inventory data and high spatial resolution images were used to evaluate the disturbance and recovery results. This research indicates that high producer and user accuracies for both disturbance and recovery classes were obtained and three levels of disturbance and recovery each can be detected. Through incorporation of climate data and disturbance results, drought events also can be successfully detected. More research is needed to incorporate multisource data for detection of forest disturbance types in subtropical regions.

TI  - Modeling the Footprint and Equivalent Radiance Transfer Path Length for Tower-Based Hemispherical Observations of Chlorophyll Fluorescence
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The measurement of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a new tool for estimating gross primary production (GPP). Continuous tower-based spectral observations together with flux measurements are an efficient way of linking the SIF to the GPP. Compared to conical observations, hemispherical observations made with cosine-corrected foreoptic have a much larger field of view and can better match the footprint of the tower-based flux measurements. However, estimating the equivalent radiation transfer path length (ERTPL) for hemispherical observations is more complex than for conical observations and this is a key problem that needs to be addressed before accurate retrieval of SIF can be made. In this paper, we first modeled the footprint of hemispherical spectral measurements and found that, under convective conditions with light winds, 90% of the total radiation came from an FOV of width 72 degrees, which in turn covered 75.68% of the source area of the flux measurements. In contrast, conical spectral observations covered only 1.93% of the flux footprint. Secondly, using theoretical considerations, we modeled the ERTPL of the hemispherical spectral observations made with cosine-corrected foreoptic and found that the ERTPL was approximately equal to twice the sensor height above the canopy. Finally, the modeled ERTPL was evaluated using a simulated dataset. The ERTPL calculated using the simulated data was about 1.89 times the sensor's height above the target surface, which was quite close to the results for the modeled ERTPL. Furthermore, the SIF retrieved from atmospherically corrected spectra using the modeled ERTPL fitted well with the reference values, giving a relative root mean square error of 18.22%. These results show that the modeled ERTPL was reasonable and that this method is applicable to tower-based hemispherical observations of SIF.

TI  - Using data from Landsat, MODIS, VIIRS and PhenoCams to monitor the phenology of California oak/grass savanna and open grassland across spatial scales
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean-type oak/grass savanna of California is composed of widely spaced oak trees with understory grasses. These savanna regions are interspersed with large areas of more open grasslands. The ability of remotely sensed data (with various spatial resolutions) to monitor the phenology in these water-limited oak/grass savannas and open grasslands is explored over the 2012-2015 timeframe using data from Landsat (30 m), the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS - gridded 500 m), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS gridded 500 m) data. Vegetation phenology detected from near-ground level, webcam based PhenoCam imagery from two sites in the Ameriflux Network (long-term flux measurement network of the Americas) (Tonzi Ranch and Vaira Ranch) is upscaled, using a National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial image (1 m), to evaluate the detection of vegetation phenology of these savannas and grasslands with the satellite data. Results show that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series observed from the satellite sensors are all strongly correlated with the PhenoCam NDVI values from Tonzi Ranch (R-2 > 0.67) and Vaira Ranch (R-2 > 0.81). However, the different viewing geometries and spatial coverage of the PhenoCams and the various satellite sensors may cause differences in the absolute phenological transition dates. Analysis of frequency histograms of phenological dates illustrate that the phenological dates in the relatively homogeneous open grasslands are consistent across the different spatial resolutions, in contrast, the relatively heterogeneous oak/grass savannas display has somewhat later greenup, maturity, and dormancy dates at 30 m resolution than at 500 m scale due to the different phenological cycles exhibited by the overstory trees and the understory grasses. In addition, phenologies derived from the MODIS view angle corrected reflectance (Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance NBAR) and the newly developed VIIRS NBAR are shown to provide comparable phenological dates (majority absolute bias <= 2 days) in this area.

TI  - Characterizing spatiotemporal patterns of air pollution in China: A multiscale landscape approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - China's tremendous economic growth in the past three decades has resulted in a number of environmental problems, including the deterioration of air quality. In particular, fine particulate matter (PM) has received increasing attention from scientists, governmental agencies, and the public due to its adverse impacts on human health. Monitoring the spatiotemporal patterns of air pollution is important for understanding its transport mechanisms and making effective environmental policies. The main goal of this study, therefore, was to quantify the spatial patterns and movement of air pollution in China at annual, daily, and hourly scales, so that the underlying drivers could be better understood. We used remote sensing data and landscape metrics together to capture spatiotemporal signatures of air pollution. Our results show that, at the annual scale, PM2.5 concentrations in China increased gradually from 1999 to 2011, with the highest concentrations occurring in the North China Plain as well as the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin. The total population affected by air pollution was about 975 million in 2010 (about 70% of China's population). Our more detailed analysis on daily and hourly scale further revealed that a heavy air pollution event occurred, expanded, aggregated, and finally dissipated over Northern China during Oct. 6-12, 2014, suggesting that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region a center of severe pollution. Crop stalks burning in agricultural areas in this region seemed to be one of the leading drivers, along with coal burning and transportation emissions. Our study demonstrates that spatial pattern analysis with landscape metrics is effective for analyzing source-sink dynamics of air pollution and its potential drivers. Our findings of major source areas and movement trajectories should be useful for making air pollution control policies to improve China's air quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Controversies in clinicopathological characteristics and treatment strategies of male breast cancer: A review of the literature
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Male breast cancer (MaBC) is a rare disease, accounting for less than 1% of malignancies in men. For this reason, literature data on its clinicopathological characteristics are very heterogeneous and treatment strategies have mostly been extrapolated from the female counterpart. However, immunohistochemical peculiarities of MaBC have recently emerged, defining it as a distinct entity from female breast cancer (FBC), thus requiring a tailored clinical approach. MaBC appears to be more often hormone receptor positive than FBC, while data on HER2 status still remain inconclusive, indicating a possible higher incidence of HER2 alterations.Treatment strategies for MaBC have evolved and less invasive local treatments such as lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy have become part of everyday clinical practice, while there are still controversies on the indication of radiotherapy, especially after mastectomy. Similarly, differences between male and female hormonal status have raised some concerns in the use of aromatase inhibitors in male patients and the choice of best endocrine therapy is still controversial.

TI  - Relationship between occurrence frequency of cyanobacteria bloom and meteorological factors in Lake Dianchi
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The published study suggested that cyanobacteria bloom was a phenomenon of excessive reproduction and aggregation with certain nutrient levels, climate and hydrological conditions and was the result of the comprehensive effect of meteorological and water environmental factors such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, pH values. It was also found that annual outbreak of cyanobacteria bloom in Lake Dianchi indicated that, under the current condition of water quality, the main factor was the meteorological factor. In order to further explore the regularity between meteorological factors and occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom, the relationship between frequency of cyanobacteria bloom and meteorological factors were studied, by using the remote sensing data of cyanobacteria bloom and the monthly meteorological data from the stations nearby Lake Dianchi from 2010 to 2011. The results showed that the cyanobacterial bloom frequency had significant correlation with the average temperature, minimum temperature, average wind speed, cumulative sunshine hours and precipitation, which had a significant negative correlation with sunshine hours and wind speed, respectively. Among the factors, the wind speed had the highest correlation coefficient. It showed that the weaker wind speed was the most closely related to the occurrence of cyanobacteria bloom in Lake Dianchi. And this further verified that the stability of the water body had a more important effect on the occurrence of cyanobacteria bloom, under certain conditions of sufficient nutrients for requires of cyanobacteria bloom. These results can be used as a scientific prediction to forecast the occurrence of cyanobacteria bloom, and to take appropriate measures to reduce the impact of the cyanobacteria bloom.

TI  - Global relationship of fire occurrence and fire intensity: A test of intermediate fire occurrence-intensity hypothesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire plays a significant role in global atmosphere and biosphere carbon and nutrient cycles. Globally, there are substantially different distributions and impacts between fire occurrence and fire intensity. It is prominent to have a thorough investigation of global relationship between fire occurrence and fire intensity for future fire prediction and management. In this study, we proposed an intermediate fire occurrence-intensity (IFOI) hypothesis for the global relationship between fire occurrence and fire intensity, suggesting that fire occurrence changes with fire intensity following a humped relationship. We examined this hypothesis via satellite data from January 2001 to December 2013 at a global scale, and in small and large fire intensity zones, respectively. Furthermore, the fire occurrence and fire intensity relationship was developed among different vegetation types to reveal the changes of parameters and strengths. Finally, the environmental factors (including climatic, hydraulic, biological, and anthropogenic variables) underpinning the fire occurrence and intensity pattern were evaluated for the underlying mechanisms. The results supported our IFOI hypothesis and demonstrated that the humped relationship is driven by different causes among vegetation types. Fire occurrence increases with fire intensity in small fire intensity zones due to alleviation of the factors limiting both fire occurrence and intensity. Beyond a certain fire intensity threshold, fire occurrence is constrained, probably due to the limitation of available fuels. The information generated in this study could be helpful for understanding global variation of fire occurrence and fire intensity due to fire-vegetation-climate-human interactions and facilitating future fire management.

TI  - Detection of neonatal unit clusters of <i>Candida parapsilosis</i> fungaemia by microsatellite genotyping: Results from laboratory-based sentinel surveillance, South Africa, 2009-2010
T2  - MYCOSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Neonatal candidaemia is a common, deadly and costly hospital-associated disease. To determine the genetic diversity of Candida parapsilosis causing fungaemia in South African neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). From February 2009 through to August 2010, cases of candidaemia were reported through laboratory-based surveillance. C.parapsilosis isolates from neonatal cases were submitted for identification by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing, antifungal susceptibility testing and microsatellite genotyping. Cluster analysis was performed using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA). Of 1671 cases with a viable Candida isolate, 393 (24%) occurred among neonates. Isolates from 143 neonatal cases were confirmed as C.parapsilosis sensu stricto. Many isolates were resistant to fluconazole (77/143; 54%) and voriconazole (20/143; 14%). Of 79 closely-related genotypes, 18 were represented by 2 isolates; 61 genotypes had a single isolate each. Seven clusters, comprised of 82 isolates, were identified at five hospitals in three provinces. Isolates belonging to certain clusters were significantly more likely to be fluconazole resistant: all cluster 7 isolates and the majority of cluster 4 (78%), 5 (89%) and 6 (67%) isolates (P<.001). Candida parapsilosis-associated candidaemia in public-sector NICUs was caused by closely related genotypes and there was molecular evidence of undetected outbreaks as well as intra-hospital transmission.

TI  - INDIRECT COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC LYMPHOGRAPHY FOR ILIOSACRAL LYMPHATIC MAPPING IN A COHORT OF DOGS WITH ANAL SAC GLAND ADENOCARCINOMA: TECHNIQUE DESCRIPTION
T2  - VETERINARY RADIOLOGY & ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node mapping can help to direct surgical oncologic staging and metastatic disease detection in patients with complex lymphatic pathways. We hypothesized that indirect computed tomographic lymphography ICTL) with a water-soluble iodinated contrast agent would successfully map lymphatic pathways of the iliosacral lymphatic center in dogs with anal sac gland carcinoma, providing a potential preoperative method for iliosacral sentinel lymph node identification in dogs. Thirteen adult dogs diagnosed with anal sac gland carcinoma were enrolled in this prospective, pilot study, and ICTL was performed via peritumoral contrast injection with serial caudal abdominal computed tomography scans for iliosacral sentinel lymph node identification. Technical and descriptive details for ICTL were recorded, including patient positioning, total contrast injection volume, timing of contrast visualization, and sentinel lymph nodes and lymphatic pathways identified. Indirect CT lymphography identified lymphatic pathways and sentinel lymph nodes in 12/13 cases 92%). Identified sentinel lymph nodes were ipsilateral to the anal sac gland carcinoma in 8/12 and contralateral to the anal sac gland carcinoma in 4/12 cases. Sacral, internal iliac, and medial iliac lymph nodes were identified as sentinel lymph nodes, and patterns were widely variable. Patient positioning and timing of imaging may impact successful sentinel lymph node identification. Positioning in supported sternal recumbency is recommended. Results indicate that ICTL may be a feasible technique for sentinel lymph node identification in dogs with anal sac gland carcinoma and offer preliminary data to drive further investigation of iliosacral lymphatic metastatic patterns using ICTL and sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - The urban heat island in the city of Poznan as derived from Landsat 5 TM
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To study urban heat island (UHI), Landsat 5 TM data and in situ measurements of air temperature from nine points in PoznaA" (Poland) for the period June 2008-May 2013 were used. Based on data from measurement points located in different types of land use, the surface urban heat island (SUHI) maps were created. All available and quality-controlled Landsat 5 TM images from 15 unique days were used to obtain the characteristics of land surface temperature (LST) and UHI intensity. In addition, spatial analysis of UHI was conducted on the basis of Corine Land Cover 2006 dataset. In situ measurements at a height of 2 m above ground level show that the UHI is a common occurrence in PoznaA" with a mean annual intensity of 1.0 A degrees C. The UHI intensity is greater during the warm half of the year. Moreover, results based on the remote sensing data and the Corine Land Cover 2006 indicate that the highest value of the mean LST anomalies (3.4 A degrees C) is attained by the continuous urban fabric, while the lowest value occurs within the broad-leaved forests (-3.1 A degrees C). To re-count from LST to the air temperature at a height of 2 m above ground level (T (agl)), linear and non-linear regression models were created. For both models, coefficients of determination equal about 0.80, with slightly higher value for the non-linear approach, which was applied to estimate the T (agl) spatial variability over the city of PoznaA".

TI  - Estimating inter-annual variability in winter wheat sowing dates from satellite time series in Camargue, France
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop simulation models are commonly used to forecast the performance of cropping systems under different hypotheses of change. Their use on a regional scale is generally constrained, however, by a lack of information on the spatial and temporal variability of environment-related input variables (e.g., soil) and agricultural practices (e.g., sowing dates) that influence crop yields. Satellite remote sensing data can shed light on such variability by providing timely information on crop dynamics and conditions over large areas. This paper proposes a method for analyzing time series of MODIS satellite data in order to estimate the inter-annual variability of winter wheat sowing dates. A rule-based method was developed to automatically identify a reliable sample of winter wheat field time series, and to infer the corresponding sowing dates. The method was designed for a case study in the Camargue region (France), where winter wheat is characterized by vernalization, as in other temperate regions. The detection criteria were chosen on the grounds of agronomic expertise and by analyzing high-confidence time-series vegetation index profiles for winter wheat. This automatic method identified the target crop on more than 56% (four-year average) of the cultivated areas, with low commission errors (11%). It also captured the seasonal variability in sowing dates with errors of 8 and 16 days in 46% and 66% of cases, respectively. Extending the analysis to the years 2002-2012 showed that sowing in the Camargue was usually done on or around November 1st ( +/- 4 days). Comparing inter-annual sowing date variability with the main local agro-climatic drivers showed that the type of preceding crop and the weather conditions during the summer season before the wheat sowing had a prominent role in influencing winter wheat sowing dates.

TI  - Comparison of Two Data Assimilation Methods for Improving MODIS LAI Time Series for Bamboo Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo forests, especially the Moso bamboo forest (MBF) and the Lei bamboo forest (LBF), have a strong carbon sequestration capability and play an important role in the global forest carbon cycle. The leaf area index (LAI) is an important structural parameter for simulating the spatiotemporal pattern of the carbon cycle in bamboo forests. However, current LAI products suffer from substantial noise and errors, and data assimilation methods are the most appropriate way to improve the accuracy of LAI data. In this study, two data assimilation methods (the Dual Ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKF) and Particle filter (PF) methods) were applied to improve the quality of MODIS LAI time-series data, which removed noises and smoothed the results using a locally adjusted cubic-spline capping method for the MBF and LBF during 2014-2015. The method with the highest correlation coefficient (r) and lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE) was used to generate highly accurate LAI products of bamboo forests in Zhejiang Province. The results show that the LAI assimilated using two methods saw greatly reduced fluctuations in the MODIS LAI product for both the MBF and the LBF. The LAI assimilated using DEnKF significantly correlated with the observed LAI, with an r value of 0.90 and 0.95, and an RMSE value of 0.42 and 0.42, for the MBF and the LBF, respectively. The PF algorithm achieved a better accuracy than the DEnKF algorithm, with an average increase in r of 8.78% and an average decrease in the RMSE of 33.33%. Therefore, the PF method was applied for LAI assimilation in Zhejiang Province, and the assimilated LAI of bamboo forests achieved a reasonable spatiotemporal pattern in Zhejiang Province. The PF algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of MODIS LAI products and provides a reliable structural parameter for the large-scale simulation of the carbon cycle in bamboo forest ecosystems.

TI  - Scrubbing Up: Multi-Scale Investigation of Woody Encroachment in a Southern African Savannah
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the extent of woody vegetation represent a major conservation question in many savannah systems around the globe. To address the problem of the current lack of broad-scale cost-effective tools for land cover monitoring in complex savannah environments, we use a multi-scale approach to quantifying vegetation change in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. We test whether medium spatial resolution satellite data (Landsat, existing back to the 1970s), which have pixel sizes larger than typical vegetation patches, can nevertheless capture the thematic detail required to detect woody encroachment in savannahs. We quantify vegetation change over a 13-year period in KNP, examine the changes that have occurred, assess the drivers of these changes, and compare appropriate remote sensing data sources for monitoring change. We generate land cover maps for three areas of southern KNP using very high resolution (VHR) and medium resolution satellite sensor imagery from February 2001 to 2014. Considerable land cover change has occurred, with large increases in shrubs replacing both trees and grassland. Examination of exclosure areas and potential environmental driver data suggests two mechanisms: elephant herbivory removing trees and at least one separate mechanism responsible for conversion of grassland to shrubs, theorised to be increasing atmospheric CO2. Thus, the combination of these mechanisms causes the novel two-directional shrub encroachment that we observe (tree loss and grassland conversion). Multi-scale comparison of classifications indicates that although spatial detail is lost when using medium resolution rather than VHR imagery for land cover classification (e.g., Landsat imagery cannot readily distinguish between tree and shrub classes, while VHR imagery can), the thematic detail contained within both VHR and medium resolution classifications is remarkably congruent. This suggests that medium resolution imagery contains sufficient thematic information for most broad-scale land cover monitoring requirements in heterogeneous savannahs, while having the benefits of being cost-free and providing a longer historical archive of data than VHR sources. We conclude that monitoring of broad-scale land cover change using remote sensing has considerable potential as a cost-effective tool for both better informing land management practitioners, and for monitoring the future landscape-scale impacts of management policies in savannahs.

TI  - Integration of spectral, thermal, and textural features of ASTER data using Random Forests classification for lithological mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ensemble classifier, Random Forests (RF), is assessed for mapping lithology using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) imagery over an area in southern Iran. The study area in the northern part of Rabor in the Kerman's Cenozoic magmatic arc (KCMA) is well exposed and contains some copper mineralization occurrences. In this research, the following six groups of ASTER datasets were used for RF classification: nine spectral bands in the VNIR and SWIR, five thermal bands in TIR, all 14 bands (including VNIR, SWIR, and TIR), band ratios, texture features, and principal components (PCs). The results showed that band ratios and all ASTER bands were able to more efficiently discriminate rock units than PC and texture images. The overall classification accuracies achieved were 62.58%, 55.40%, 65.04%, 67.12%, 54.54%, and 53.99% for the nine VNIR/SWIR bands, five TIR bands, all ASTER bands, band ratios, textural, and PCs datasets, respectively. Four datasets including all ASTER bands, band ratios, textural, and PCs datasets (37 bands) were combined as one group and applied in second RF classification which led to increase overall accuracy (up to 81.52%). Based on the four classified maps, an uncertainty map was produced to identify areas of variable (uncertain) classification results, which revealed that approximately 21.43% of all pixels on the classified map were highly uncertain. The RF algorithm found that 12 of the predictors were more important in the classification process. These predictors were used in a third RF classification, which resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 77.21%. Thus, the third RF classification decreases the accuracy. Field observations were used to validate our classification results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Interferometric SAR Mapping of Precipitable Water Vapor Over a Country-Spanning Area
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a methodology to generate maps of atmosphere's precipitable water vapor (PWV) over large areas with a length of hundreds of kilometers and a width of about 250 km, based on the use of interferometric Sentinel-1A/BC-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with a high spatial resolution of 5 x 20 m(2) and the revisiting time of six days. An algorithm to calibrate and merge PWV maps from different swaths of Sentinel-1 acquired along the same track, using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements, is described. The proposed methodology is tested on Sentinel-1A SAR images acquired over the Iberian Peninsula, along both descending and ascending tracks. The assessment with an independent set of GNSS measurements shows a mean difference of a fraction of millimeter and a dispersion lower than 2 mm. Both the use of Sentinel-1A/B SAR images and the proposed methodology open new perspectives on the application of SAR meteorology for the high-resolution mapping of PWV over large region-spanning areas and the assimilation of interferometric SAR data into numerical weather models.

TI  - Detection and mapping the spatial distribution of bracken fern weeds using the Landsat 8 OLI new generation sensor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bracken fern is an invasive plant that presents serious environmental, ecological and economic problems around the world. An understanding of the spatial distribution of bracken fern weeds is therefore essential for providing appropriate management strategies at both local and regional scales. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of the freely available medium resolution Landsat 8 OLI sensor in the detection and mapping of bracken fern at the Cathedral Peak, South Africa. To achieve this objective, the results obtained from Landsat 8 OLI were compared with those derived using the costly, high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery. Since previous studies have already Successfully mapped bracken fern using high spatial resolution WorldView-2 image, the comparison was done to investigate the magnitude of difference in accuracy between the two sensors in relation to their acquisition costs. To evaluate the performance of Landsat 8 OLI in discriminating bracken fern compared to that of Worldview-2, we tested the utility of (i) spectral bands; (ii) derived vegetation indices as well as (iii) the combinatidn of spectral bands and vegetation indices based on discriminant analysis classification algorithm. After resampling the training and testing data and reclassifying several times (n =100) based on the combined data sets, the overall accuracies for both Landsat 8 and WorldView-2 were tested for significant differences based on Mann-Whitney U test. The results showed that the integration of the spectral bands and derived vegetation indices yielded the best overall classification accuracy (80.08% and 87.80% for Landsat 8 OLI and WorldView-2 respectively). Additionally, the use of derived vegetation indices as a standalone data set produced the weakest overall accuracy results of 62.14% and 82.11% for both the Landsat 8 OLI and WorldView-2 images. There were significant differences {U (100) = 569.5, z = -10.8242, p < 0.01} between the classification accuracies derived based on Landsat OLI 8 and those derived using WorldView-2 sensor. Although there were significant differences between Landsat and WorldView-2 accuracies, the magnitude of variation (9%) between the two sensors was within an acceptable range. Therefore, the findings of this study demonstrated that the recently launched Landsat 8 OLI mtiltispectral sensor provides valuable information that could aid in the long term continuous monitoring and formulation of effective bracken fern management with acceptable accuracies that are comparable to those obtained from the high resolution WorldView-2 commercial sensor.

TI  - An innovative method for precise lymph node detection before surgical treatment in breast cancer
T2  - HELLENIC JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To describe a new method of 3D interactive modeling which integrates images obtained by separate SPET and multi slice computed tomography (MSCT) modalities using an original software in order to better localize SNL in BC patients. Subjects and Method: We used technetium-99m-colloid rhenium sulphate for identifying SNL in seven patients with BC. Markers were made of lead pearls wrapped with (99m) cotton wool soaked in Tc-pertechnetate and placed on the skin of the patients forming of a triangle. Using an original software, two separate 3D models were made after SPET and MSCT imaging and then merged into a hybrid 3D model which enabled precise visualization and localization of the SNL. Results: In all cases the position of the SNL established by our method was successfully verified using a gamma probe. Duration of SNL identi cation and extirpation were significantly reduced in less than 10 minutes per patient. The reproducibility of this method was con firmed by precise identi cation and biopsy of the SNL. Conclusion: We found this integrated SPET/MSCT 3D model to be much faster and easier to use as compared with the "classic" method, which was based on a radioactivity detection probe. In addition, our method was reproducible, accurate and of low cost. In other words, the method described in this paper could be very useful for health facilities with modest budget, because it obviates the need for buying expensive integrated SPET/MSCT hybrid imaging systems while detecting SNLs more accurately and in shorter time.

TI  - Landscape-scale quantification of fire-induced change in canopy cover following mountain pine beetle outbreak and timber harvest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the western United States, the three primary drivers of tree mortality and carbon balance are bark beetles, timber harvest, and wildfire. While these agents of forest change frequently overlap, uncertainty remains regarding their interactions and influence on specific subsequent fire effects such as change in canopy cover. Acquisition of pre- and post-fire Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data on the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon provided an opportunity to isolate and quantify fire effects coincident with specific agents of change. This study characterizes the influence of pre-fire mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) and timber harvest disturbances on LiDAR-estimated change in canopy cover. Observed canopy loss from fire was greater (higher severity) in areas experiencing pre-fire MPB (Delta 18.8%CC) than fire-only (Delta 11.1%CC). Additionally, increasing MPB intensity was directly related to greater canopy loss. Canopy loss was lower for all areas of pre-fire timber harvest (Delta 3.9%CC) than for fire-only, but among harvested areas, the greatest change was observed in the oldest treatments and the most intensive treatments [i.e., stand clearcut (Delta 5.0%CC) and combination of shelterwood establishment cuts and shelterwood removal cuts (Delta 7.7%CC)]. These results highlight the importance of accounting for and understanding the impact of pre-fire agents of change such as MPB and timber harvest on subsequent fire effects in land management planning. This work also demonstrates the utility of multi-temporal LiDAR as a tool for quantifying these landscape-scale interactions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Change in Low Cloud Cover in a Warmed Climate Inferred from AIRS, MODIS, and ERA-Interim
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Decreases in subtropical low cloud cover (LCC) occur in climate model simulations of global warming. In this study 8-day-averaged observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) spanning 2002-14 are combined with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts(ECMWF) interim reanalysis to compute the dependence of the observed variability of LCC on various predictor variables. Large-scale thermodynamic and dynamic predictors of LCC are selected based on insight from large-eddy simulations (LESs) and observational analysis. It is found that increased estimated inversion strength (EIS) is associated with increased LCC. Drying of the free troposphere is associated with decreased LCC. Decreased LCC accompanies subsidence in regions of relatively low EIS; the opposite is found in regions of high EIS. Finally, it is found that increasing sea surface temperature (SST) leads to a decrease in LCC. These results are in keeping with previous studies of monthly and annual data. Based upon the observed response of LCC to natural variability of the control parameters, the change in LCC is estimated for an idealized warming scenario where SST increases by 1 K and EIS increases by 0.2 K. For this change in EIS and SST the LCC is inferred to decrease by 0.5%-2.7% when the regression models are trained on data observed between 40 degrees S and 40 degrees N and by 1.1%-1.4% when trained on data from trade cumulus-dominated regions. When the data used to train the regression model are restricted to stratocumulusdominated regions the change in LCC is highly uncertain and varies between -1.6% and +1.4%, depending on the stratocumulus-dominated region used to train the regression model.

TI  - A polarimetric investigation of Jupiter: Disk-resolved imaging polarimetry and spectropolarimetry
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Polarimetry is a powerful remote sensing tool to characterise solar system planets and, potentially, to detect and characterise exoplanets. The linear polarisation of a planet as a function of wavelength and phase angle is sensitive to the cloud and haze particle properties in planetary atmospheres, as well as to their altitudes and optical thicknesses.Aims. We present for the first time polarimetric signals of Jupiter mapped over the entire disk, showing features such as contrasts between the belts and zones, the polar regions, and the Great Red Spot. We investigate the use of these maps for atmospheric characterisation and discuss the potential application of polarimetry to the study of the atmospheres of exoplanets.Methods. We have obtained polarimetric images of Jupiter, in the B, V, and R filters, over a phase angle range of alpha = 4 degrees -10.5 degrees. In addition, we have obtained two spectropolarimetric datasets, over the wavelength range 500-850 nm. An atmospheric model was sought for all of the datasets, which was consistent with the observed behaviour over the wavelength and phase angle range.Results. The polarimetric maps show clear latitudinal structure, with increasing polarisation towards the polar regions, in all filters. The spectropolarimetric datasets show a decrease in polarisation as a function of wavelength along with changes in the polarisation in methane absorption bands. A model fit was achieved by varying the cloud height and haze optical thickness; this can roughly produce the variation across latitude for the V and R filters, but not for the B filter data. The same model particles are also able to produce a close fit to the spectropolarimetric data. The atmosphere of Jupiter is known to be complex in structure, and data taken at intermediate phase angles (unreachable for Earth-based telescopes) seems essential for a complete characterisation of the atmospheric constituents. Because exoplanets orbit other stars, they are observable at intermediate phase angles and thus promise to be better targets for Earthbased polarimetry.

TI  - Detection and Establishment of <i>Aedes</i> <i>aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes</i> <i>albopictus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes in California, 2011-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In 2011, a thriving population of Aedes albopictus (Skuse), the Asian tiger mosquito, was discovered within three cities in Los Angeles County over an estimated 52-km(2) urban area. Two years later in 2013, Aedes aegypti (L.), the yellow fever mosquito, was detected within several urban areas of Madera, Fresno, and San Mateo counties. State and local vector control agencies responded with an aggressive effort to eradicate or interrupt the spread of these two invasive mosquitoes; however, known populations continued to expand outward and new infestations were identified at an accelerated pace in central and southern California. By the end of 2015, one or both species had been detected within the jurisdictional boundaries of 85 cities and census-designated places in 12 counties. Herein we report on the discovery and widespread establishment of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in urban areas of coastal, central, and southern California between 2011 and 2015 and discuss the subsequent rapid changes to the activities and priorities of vector control agencies in response to this unprecedented invasion.

TI  - Triple Collocation Analysis of Soil Moisture From Metop-A ASCAT and SMOS Against JRA-55 and ERA-Interim
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the quality of Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) surface soil moisture (SSM) retrievals with respect to other SSM products derived from the passive Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission and two reanalysis datasets, i.e., the JRA-55 and the ERA-Interim. In particular, the purposes of this study are to 1) characterize the global error structure of the satellite products, 2) understand the spatiotemporal variability of SSM at global scale, and 3) investigate in which areas the assimilation of satellite data may add value to reanalysis. For these purposes, we applied standard statistical methods as well as triple collocation analysis (TCA) for estimating signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). In line with previous studies, we find large and spatially variable biases between all four datasets, but overall spatiotemporal dynamics as reflected in Hovmoller diagrams agree well. With the exception of arid and semiarid environments, ASCAT performs better than SMOS in terms of both its correlation with the models and the SNR. As a result of TCA, we recognize the potential areas for assimilation of ASCAT data, characterized by a high SNR of the satellite data compared to the models, to be the savanna regions in Africa and Central Asia, southwestern North America, and eastern Australia.

TI  - Drought-associated phenological changes of coastal marshes in Louisiana
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought poses serious threats to the valuable coastal marsh ecosystems, especially considering that the frequency, intensity, and acuteness of drought may increase with prospective climate change. We study the drought-associated phenological changes of Louisiana coastal marshes through combining remote sensing-derived phenological record (i.e., Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI) and field-based environmental data during the past 30 yr. We find that drought condition in southeast Louisiana is characterized by decreased discharge of the Mississippi River and reduced precipitation, which correlate with the continental weather patterns over the conterminous United States influenced by La Nina. The peak NDVI day of saline marshes delays for two months (P < 0.01), from mid-July to mid-September, and their growth duration consequently shortens for two months (P < 0.01) in drought years. Such phenological changes might result from the inhibition of the growth of Spartina alterniflora, a dominant species in saline marshes whose biomass peaks earlier than the coexisting species, perhaps due to reduced freshwater input and increased water deficit. Drought might also cause Spartina dieback via similar mechanisms. Our results underline the correlation between drought in southeast Louisiana and La Nina and highlight the sensitivity of saline marshes to drought, thereby providing valuable information for coastal marsh management and conservation facing climate change.

TI  - Uncertainty of soil erosion modelling using open source high resolution and aggregated DEMs
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is one of the important parameters for soil erosion assessment. Notable uncertainties are observed in this study while using three high resolution open source DEMs. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model has been applied to analysis the assessment of soil erosion uncertainty using open source DEMs (SRTM, ASTER and CARTOSAT) and their increasing grid space (pixel size) from the actual. The study area is a part of the Narmada river basin in Madhya Pradesh state, which is located in the central part of India and the area covered 20,558 km(2). The actual resolution of DEMs is 30 m and their increasing grid spaces are taken as 90, 150, 210, 270 and 330 m for this study. Vertical accuracy of DEMs has been assessed using actual heights of the sample points that have been taken considering planimetric survey based map (toposheet). Elevations of DEMs are converted to the same vertical datum from WGS 84 to MSL (Mean Sea Level), before the accuracy assessment and modelling. Results indicate that the accuracy of the SRTM DEM with the RMSE of 13.31, 14.51, and 18.19 m in 30, 150 and 330 m resolution respectively, is better than the ASTER and the CARTOSAT DEMs. When the grid space of the DEMs increases, the accuracy of the elevation and calculated soil erosion decreases. This study presents a potential uncertainty introduced by open source high resolution DEMs in the accuracy of the soil erosion assessment models. The research provides an analysis of errors in selecting DEMs using the original and increased grid space for soil erosion modelling.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic effect of intraoperative radiotherapy, describe the method and examine the results of our experience.BACKGROUND: Breast conserving therapy has recently become a standard treatment modality in patients with early invasive cancer. Radiotherapy, along with surgery, is an integral part of such treatment. The important thing of radiotherapy is to deliver a high dose to the tumour bed. One of the methods is the intraoperative radiotherapy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis comprised 41 breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving surgery. Patient's range age was 35-80 years. Cancer type distribution inlcuded:" 95% ductal carcinoma, 5% other carcinoma. Applicator size: 4 cm. (12%), 5 cm. (64%), 6 cm. (17%), 7 cm. (7%). Electron energies: 6 MeV (22%), 8 MeV (56%), 10 MeV (22%). Intraoperative radiation therapy was delivered in the operating theatre during surgery. After that, all patients were treated with whole breast irradiation.RESULTS: 41 patients treated with IORT procedures completed. In general there were no severe postoperative complications and we did not detect tumor recurrence in any patient even if the time elapsed from the treatment is still short.CONCLUSIONS: Due to its exceptional physical and radiobiological properties, intraoperative radiation therapy can be a good alternative to other methods of boosting dose to the postoperative site in management.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMOPHYSICS

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th International Symposium on Temperature, Humidity, Moisture and Thermal Measurements in Industry and Science
CL  - Funchal, PORTUGAL
AB  - The new stage of the development of space-borne information systems is the creation of the Global Earth Observation System. For the full functioning of such a system, it is necessary to provide the uniformity of measurements of all national systems as members of the global system, with high-quality measurement data. This requires the implementation of a high level of ground (prelaunch) calibration of Earth remote sensing instruments. To solve these problems, there were created calibration facilities on the basis of large vacuum chambers with vacuum reference radiation sources, including sources on the basis of black bodies with a wide aperture of 500 mm in the spectral range from 3 mu m to 14 mu m. Such a facility was created by FGUP "VNIIOFI" in cooperationwith FGUP "TsNIIMash". The ground calibration of Earth remote sensing instruments is being carried out by using blackbody models as radiation sources with known spectral radiance. Facility for ground calibration of remote sensing devices on spectral radiance is based on the usage of a large-aperture blackbody (LABB) with 500 mm diameter and working temperature range from 213 K to 423 K, as a radiation source. This calibration setup comprises a set of reference blackbodies, such as a blackbody on the phase transition of Gallium, a variable-temperature blackbody with temperature range from 213 K to 423 K, a reference blackbody cooled with liquid nitrogen, and IR Fourier spectrometer utilized as a comparator to perform LABB calibration on spectral radiance. The second important characteristic of LABB is the uniformity of spectral radiance across the radiating aperture of this blackbody. The paper describes the device for measuring the spatial homogeneity of the radiation power of the LABB's radiating surface. This device is based on the use of two-color InSb-CdHgTe detector equipped with modulator and IR lens, which are mounted on a two-axis translation stage suitable for operation in vacuum and installed in the vacuum chamber against LABB. During the measurement of the radiation uniformity, the modulator sequentially sends probing radiation spot either from the LABB's surface or from the thermostatic radiation source to the detector input. The principle of operation of the device is described. The results of measurements of the radiation power homogeneity across the LABB's radiating aperture are presented in wide-temperature range.

TI  - Journalism and the Islamic Worldview: Journalistic roles in Muslim-majority countries
T2  - JOURNALISM STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper looks at the extent to which journalistic culture in Muslim-majority countries is shaped by a distinctive Islamic worldview. We identified four principles of an Islamic perspective to journalism: truth and truth-telling (siddiq and haqq), pedagogy (tabligh), seeking the best for the public interest (maslahah), and moderation (wasatiyyah). A survey of working journalists in Africa (Egypt, Sierra Leone, and Sudan), Asia (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates), and Europe (Albania and Kosovo) found manifestations of these roles in the investigated countries. The results point to the strong importance of an interventionist approach to journalismas embodied in the maslahah principlein most societies. Overall, however, journalists' roles in Muslim-majority countries are not so much shaped by a distinctively Islamic worldview as they were by the political, economic, and socio-cultural contexts.

TI  - Factors affecting ewe performance in a crossbred dairy sheep research flock in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Spooner Agricultural Research Station operated the only dairy sheep research flock in North America through 2016. The original nondairy ewe flock was "bred up" to a crossbred dairy flock through the use of rams and semen of the East Friesian (EF) and Lacaune (LA) dairy breeds. The objective of this study was to determine the environmental and nonadditive genetic effects that influence performance of dairy ewes. The traits analyzed were 180 d adjusted milk (180d MY), fat (180d FY), and protein (180d PY) yields, percentage fat (%F) and protein (%P) in milk, lactation average somatic cell score (LSCS), and number of lambs born per ewe lambing (NLB). The univariate repeatability models included the fixed effects of year of lambing, age, weaning system (except for the trait of NLB), individual breed composition, and individual retained heterosis along with the random additive genetic, permanent environmental, and residual effects. Estimates of heritability were moderate for 180d MY (0.32 +/- 0.04), 180d FY (0.26 +/- 0.04), and 180d PY (0.29 +/- 0.04), high for %F (0.54 +/- 0.04) and %P (0.61 +/- 0.04), and low for LSCS (0.12 +/- 0.03) and NLB (0.08 +/- 0.02). Ewes that reared their lambs had lower (P < 0.01) 180d MY, 180d FY, 180d PY, %F, and %P and higher (P < 0.001) LSCS than ewes that had their lambs removed shortly after parturition. Relative to nondairy breeding, EF and LA breeding had positive (P < 0.001) effects on 180d MY, 180d FY, and 180d PY, but a negative (P < 0.03) effect on %P. Purebred EF ewes were predicted to have lower (P < 0.001) %F than purebred LA or nondairy ewes. Purebred LA ewes were predicted to have a higher (P < 0.001) LSCS than purebred EF or nondairy ewes. Purebred EF ewes were expected to be more (P < 0.001) prolific than purebred LA or nondairy ewes. Individual retained heterosis had a favorable (P < 0.01) effect on 180d MY, 180d FY, 180d PY, and NLB. Knowledge of the factors affecting dairy ewe performance are important for dairy sheep producers to make more informed husbandry and breeding decisions.

TI  - Modelling informal Sand Forest harvesting using a Disturbance Index from Landsat, in Maputaland (South Africa)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous forests and savannah provide numerous benefits for rural communities and are utilised as a source of firewood, building material and for woodcraft production. Currently, there is insufficient information on the magnitude of human pressure affecting one such important forest community, namely Sand Forest, particularly in communal areas. The temporal monitoring of the spatial structures of forest areas, such as Sand Forest, within landscapes has been recommended in order to detect and model deteriorating trends in the forest structures and functioning. Remote sensing is critical in the generation of data that enables the identification and quantification of degraded and deforested areas.The constrained distribution and fragmented patches associated with Sand Forest, and the effects of a declining canopy closure, resulting from selective wood harvesting, requires the use of remote sensing techniques and procedures that could potentially account for these characteristics. A spectral index that has been widely successful in monitoring disturbances in forests is the Disturbance Index. The success of the Disturbance Index in detecting changes could be attributed to the components that comprise the Disturbance Index, in that it takes into account the relationship that exists between soil; vegetation; and canopy & soil moisture. The suitability of determining changes could also be attributed to the approach taken by the Disturbance Index i.e. monitoring disturbance versus a component of vegetation, such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (biomass). The rates of change derived for the study period (1998 to 2014) provided quantified information on the magnitude of human pressure affecting Sand Forest throughout Maputaland. The rates of change showed that the accumulated total loss in the extent of Sand Forest, across the South African section of Maputaland, was 15.53 km(2) over a period of 16 years.

TI  - The use of animals as a surveillance tool for monitoring environmental health hazards, human health hazards and bioterrorism
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This review discusses the utilization of wild or domestic animals as surveillance tools for monitoring naturally occurring environmental and human health hazards. Besides providing early warning to natural hazards, animals can also provide early warning to societal hazards like bioterrorism. Animals are ideal surveillance tools to humans because they share the same environment as humans and spend more time outdoors than humans, increasing their exposure risk. Furthermore, the biologically compressed lifespans of some animals may allow them to develop clinical signs more rapidly after exposure to specific pathogens. Animals are an excellent channel for monitoring novel and known pathogens with outbreak potential given that more than 60 % of emerging infectious diseases in humans originate as zoonoses. This review attempts to highlight animal illnesses, deaths, biomarkers or sentinel events, to remind human and veterinary public health programs that animal health can be used to discover, monitor or predict environmental health hazards, human health hazards, or bioterrorism. Lastly, we hope that this review will encourage the implementation of animals as a surveillance tool by clinicians, veterinarians, ecosystem health professionals, researchers and governments.

TI  - GIS based ecotourism potential assessment in Munessa Shashemene Concession Forest and its surrounding area, Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to understand GIS based ecotourism potential of Munessa Shashemene Concession Forest and its surrounding area in Ethiopia. Landsat images from 2009/2010 and 2013 were used to drive baseline data including land cover, land use, stream and road. Elevation based agro-ecology and slope map were derived from SRTM DEM. Rapid wild animals survey, identifying the location of known historical, cultural and unique features were carried out in the filed with the help of key-informants. A suitability model was designed in GIS environment to assess the suitability of an area for tourism considering suitability factors such as land cover types, wild animal zone, unique features, topography and distance to a road. The result showed areas which are highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, or unsuitable for tourism. The old giant, Podocarpus (Podocarpus falcatus) trees that serve as habitat of the endangered and endemic mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), were identified as very high suitable areas for tourists. The highly suitable areas include forest area along the lake which is seasonally visited by mountain nyala and areas of plantation forest that are found adjacent to natural forest. These areas follow remnants of the natural forest and found along boundary between the mid-highland and the highland agro-ecologies. The agricultural land use types consisting of maize/haricotbean and wheat/barley were evaluated as marginally suitable, nevertheless these could be considered as potential for agri-tourism. The study revealed that the concession area is found to be a suitable area with its huge potential for ecotourism development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - ISOLATION OF TEMBUSU VIRUS FROM <i>CULEX QUINQUEFASCIATUS</i> IN KANCHANABURI PROVINCE, THAILAND
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tembusu virus (TMUV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to Ntaya virus serogroup of Flaviviridae family. Of 1,478 female Culex mosquitoes collected from Mueang Kanchanaburi, Thailand using BG Sentinel Trap, 91.5% were Cx. quinquefasciatus. One pool from seventy pools of mosquitoes was TMUV-positive by reverse transcriptase-PCR and virus isolation. This is the first report of an isolation of TMUV from Cx. quinquefasciatus collected near a chicken farm, providing evidence for TMUV transmission by this Culex species in a natural habitat. This has implications for possible infection in humans.

TI  - Persistent Organic Pollutant and Hormone Levels in Harbor Porpoise with B Cell Lymphoma
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - B-cell lymphoma, a common morphologic variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, has been associated with persistent pollutants in humans, but this association is not well-characterized in top-level predators sharing marine resources with humans. We characterized and compared blubber contaminants and hormones of a pregnant harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) with B-cell lymphoma, with those in two presumed healthy fishery by-caught porpoises with no lymphoma: a pregnant adult and female juvenile. Common historic use compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and pesticides, were evaluated in blubber samples from three porpoises. In addition, blubber cortisol and progesterone levels (ng/g) were determined in all three animals. Total pollutant concentrations were highest in the juvenile porpoise, followed by the lymphoma porpoise and the nonlymphoma adult. Blubber cortisol concentrations were 191% greater in the pregnant with lymphoma porpoise compared with the pregnant no lymphoma porpoise, and 89% greater in the juvenile female compared with the pregnant no lymphoma porpoise. Although both adults were pregnant, progesterone levels were substantially greater (90%) in the healthy compared with the lymphoma adult. Health monitoring of top-level marine predators, such as porpoise, provides a sentinel measure of contaminants that serve as indicators of potential environmental exposure to humans.

TI  - Spring and Autumn Phenological Variability across Environmental Gradients of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous regions experience complex phenological behavior along climatic, vegetational and topographic gradients. In this paper, we use a MODIS time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to understand the causes of variations in spring and autumn timing from 2000 to 2015, for a landscape renowned for its biological diversity. By filtering for cover type, topography and disturbance history, we achieved an improved understanding of the effects of seasonal weather variation on land surface phenology (LSP). Elevational effects were greatest in spring and were more important than site moisture effects. The spring and autumn NDVI of deciduous forests were found to increase in response to antecedent warm temperatures, with evidence of possible cross-seasonal lag effects, including possible accelerated green-up after cold Januarys and early brown-down following warm springs. Areas that were disturbed by the hemlock woolly adelgid and a severe tornado showed a weaker sensitivity to cross-year temperature and precipitation variation, while low severity wildland fire had no discernable effect. Use of ancillary datasets to filter for disturbance and vegetation type improves our understanding of vegetation's phenological responsiveness to climate dynamics across complex environmental gradients.

TI  - Sentinel Node and Ovarian Tumors: A Series of 20 Patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Intraoperative detection of ovarian sentinel nodes has been shown to be feasible. We examined the detection rate and locations of sentinel nodes in patients with ovarian tumors. We also aimed to assess the reliability of sentinel node method in predicting regional lymph node metastasis.Methods Twenty patients scheduled for laparotomy because of a pelvic mass were recruited to the study. In the beginning of the laparotomy, radioisotope and blue dye were injected under the serosa next to the junction of the ovarian tumor and suspensory ligament. The number and locations of the hot and/or blue nodes/spots were recorded during the operation. If the tumor was malignant according to the frozen section, systematic lymphadenectomies were performed, the sentinel nodes sampled separately, and their status compared with other regional lymph nodes.Results Eleven patients had a right-sided ovarian tumor, 7 patients a left-sided tumor, and 2 patients had bilateral tumors. A median of 2 sentinel nodes/locations per patient (range, 1-3) were found. Sixty percent of all sentinel nodes were located in the para-aortic region only, compared with 30% in both para-aortic and pelvic areas and 10% in pelvic area only. Both unilateral and bilateral locations were found. In 83% of the cases with more than 1 sentinel node location, they were located in separate anatomical regions. In 3 patients, systematic lymphadenectomies were performed. One of them had nodal metastases in 2 regions and also a metastasis in 1 of her 2 sentinel nodes in 1 of those regions.Conclusions In patients with ovarian tumor(s), the detection of sentinel nodes is feasible. They are located in different anatomic areas both ipsilaterally and contralaterally, although most of them are found in the para-aortic region. The reliability of the sentinel node concept should be evaluated in the framework of a multicenter trial.

TI  - Next-generation probiotics: the spectrum from probiotics to live biotherapeutics
T2  - NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The leading probiotics currently available to consumers are generally drawn from a narrow range of organisms. Knowledge of the gut microbiota and its constituent actors is changing this paradigm, particularly given the phylogenetic range and relatively unknown characteristics of the organisms under investigation as novel therapeutics. For this reason, and because their development is likely to be more amenable to a pharmaceutical than a food delivery route, these organisms are often operationally referred to as next-generation probiotics, a concept that overlaps with the emerging concept of live biotherapeutic products. The latter is a class of organisms developed exclusively for pharmaceutical application. In this Perspective, we discuss what lessons have been learned from working with traditional probiotics, explore the kinds of organisms that are likely to be used as novel microbial therapeutics, discuss the regulatory framework required, and propose how scientists may meet this challenge.

TI  - Satisfaction and Condomless Anal Sex at Sexual Debut and Sexual Risk Among Young Black Same-Sex Attracted Men
T2  - ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - First sex may be a sentinel event crucial to understanding sexual health trajectories of young Black same-sex attracted men (YBSSAM). We sought to understand whether satisfaction, condomless anal sex, and contextual factors during first sex were associated with sexual risk and recent condom use in YBSSAM. A total of 201 YBSSAM aged 15-24 years completed an Internet survey exploring first sex, current condom use, and sexual risk. High risk was defined as >= 3 of the following: new/concurrent sex partners, STI history, and no/inconsistent condom use. Multivariate logistic regression assessed the association between predictor (satisfaction and first condomless anal sex) and outcome (sexual risk and condomless sex in the past 3 months) variables. Mean age at first sex was 15.2 (SD = 2.9) years, and emotional satisfaction (51.7 %), physical satisfaction (63.7 %), and condomless first anal sex (55.2 %) were common. YBSSAM describing high levels of satisfaction were no more likely to be at high risk or engage in recent condomless sex. Condomless first sex (AOR = 4.57, p = .001), younger age (AOR = 3.43, p = .02), and having a partner > 5 years older (AOR = 2.78, p = .03) at first sex were significantly associated with increased risk. Only condomless first sex (AOR = 4.28, p < .001) was associated with condomless recent sex. Satisfaction at first sex may not influence later sexual risk in YBSSAM. However, context of first sex, including condom use at first sex, may play an important role in subsequent risk. Prevention strategies on condom negotiation prior to first sex may help to mitigate HIV burden in YBSSAM.

TI  - Implications of land use transitions on soil nitrogen in dynamic landscapes in Tanzania
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use transitions are rated among the leading sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the tropics. They significantly challenge the functioning of ecosystems and affect multi-temporal stability of greenhouse gases such as N2O and soil properties. Studies on dynamics in nitrogen balances are essential in understanding greenhouse gas emissions such as N2O and to manage their impacts on productivity. In this study, multi-temporal Landsat images (1975, 1995 and 2012) were classified to determine land use transitions and potential drivers. The classified images were categorized into degraded and non-degraded lands and eighty sampling plots generated within the entire study area. Soil samples were then collected at 0-15, 15-30 and 30-60 cm depths on each plot and soil nitrogen determined. A regression analysis was developed to determine the influence of forest and grassland degradation on soil nitrogen. Results indicated a significant change in major land use and land cover types. Specifically, there was a decrease in areas covered by forests, woodland and grassland, however, area covered by less dense forest increased. Results also indicated variability in mean nitrogen content between degraded and non-degraded areas and depths. Furthermore, levels of degradation influence nitrogen content up to a soil depth of 30 cm. The present study is relevant in the detailed assessment of the extent of damage and threats posed to biodiversity hotspots in sub-Saharan Africa. These results are transferable to other parts of the world characterized by dynamic ecological transformation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Review
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to develop clinically relevant and evidence-based guidelines as part of European Society of Gynaecological Oncology's mission to improve the quality of care for women with gynecologic cancers across Europe.Methods The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology Council nominated an international development group made of practicing clinicians who provide care to patients with vulvar cancer and have demonstrated leadership and interest in the management of patients with vulvar cancer (18 experts across Europe). To ensure that the statements are evidence based, the current literature identified from a systematic search has been reviewed and critically appraised. In the absence of any clear scientific evidence, judgment was based on the professional experience and consensus of the development group (expert agreement). The guidelines are thus based on the best available evidence and expert agreement. Prior to publication, the guidelines were reviewed by 181 international reviewers including patient representatives independent from the development group.Results The guidelines cover diagnosis and referral, preoperative investigations, surgical management (local treatment, groin treatment including sentinel lymph node procedure, reconstructive surgery), radiation therapy, chemoradiation, systemic treatment, treatment of recurrent disease (vulvar recurrence, groin recurrence, distant metastases), and follow-up.

TI  - Timing of completion lymphadenectomy after positive sentinel node biopsy in patients with melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNodal staging with sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and completion lymph node dissection (CLND) provides prognostic information to patients with melanoma and their physicians. It is not known whether the timing of CLND is associated with survival outcome and/or CLND tumour load. This study investigated whether CLND timing is associated with CLND tumour load, disease-free survival (DFS) and/or melanoma-specific survival (MSS).MethodsA retrospective cohort of patients with SNB-positive melanoma from nine European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Melanoma Group centres undergoing surgery between 1993 and 2009 were examined. Patients were selected based on availability of CLND and follow-up data. The CLND interval was defined as the number of days between diagnosis and CLND. Patient and tumour characteristics were collected. Five-year DFS and MSS rates were calculated. Cox and logistic regression analysis were performed, adjusting for known prognostic/predictive indicators.ResultsA total of 784 patients were included in the study. Their median age was 51 (i.q.r. 40-62) years, and 418 patients (533 per cent) were men. Median Breslow thickness was 30 (i.q.r. 20-50)mm, and 148 patients (189 per cent) had a residual tumour load. Median CLND interval was 84 (i.q.r. 65-105) days. Five-year DFS and MSS rates were not significantly different for patients operated on with a median CLND interval of less than 84days and those with an interval of at least 84days (DFS: 542 versus 533 per cent respectively; MSS: 669 versus 651 per cent). In a multivariable Cox model, CLND interval was not a significant prognostic indicator. CLND interval was negatively correlated with identification of positive non-sentinel nodes, but following adjustment for known risk factors this effect was no longer found.ConclusionThe time interval between diagnosis of melanoma and CLND did not influence CLND tumour load, DFS or MSS.No rush

TI  - Large-Scale Assessment of Coastal Aquaculture Ponds with Sentinel-1 Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an earth observation based approach to detect aquaculture ponds in coastal areas with dense time series of high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 SAR data. Aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing animal food production sectors worldwide, contributes more than half of the total volume of aquatic foods in human consumption, and offers a great potential for global food security. The key advantages of SAR instruments for aquaculture mapping are their all-weather, day and night imaging capabilities which apply particularly to cloud-prone coastal regions. The different backscatter responses of the pond components (dikes and enclosed water surface) and aquaculture's distinct rectangular structure allow for separation of aquaculture areas from other natural water bodies. We analyzed the large volume of free and open Sentinel-1 data to derive and map aquaculture pond objects for four study sites covering major river deltas in China and Vietnam. SAR image data were processed to obtain temporally smoothed time series. Terrain information derived from DEM data and accurate coastline data were utilized to identify and mask potential aquaculture areas. An open source segmentation algorithm supported the extraction of aquaculture ponds based on backscatter intensity, size and shape features. We were able to efficiently map aquaculture ponds in coastal areas with an overall accuracy of 0.83 for the four study sites. The approach presented is easily transferable in time and space, and thus holds the potential for continental and global mapping.

TI  - MODELLING SPATIAL CHANGES IN COASTAL AREAS OF SAMSUN (TURKEY) USING A CELLULAR AUTOMATA-MARKOV CHAIN METHOD
T2  - TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of cities over a specific time period and the determination of relevant trends are important to simulate for the proper development and planning of a city. In particular, coastal areas experience intense pressure from developers with respect to settlements, tourism, trade and industry, and built-up areas are being observed near coasts. The inability to direct development and control growth is destroying natural resources in coastal areas at a rapid pace. Thus, determining these trends is the key component for ensuring the protection of natural resources and planned growth. Because a complete estimation of urban expansion is not possible, likely changes can be determined using simulations. In this study, a 30-year urban expansion simulation (2004-2034) was obtained using land use/land cover (LU/LC) data for 1987 and 2004 at Samsun (Turkey) coastal areas and using the Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-Markov) method. To verify the method, urban expansion simulation for the year 2014 was compared with real LU/LC data for the same year, and the kappa value was found to be 0,82. To determine LU/LC, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI satellite images were used, and the analyses were realised in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. As a result of the study, the CA-Markov Chain approach integrated with GIS and remote sensing was shown to be effective in the study of urban growth dynamics. Using the simulation for the year 2034, probable urban expansion in the 20142034 period was estimated as approximately 3683 ha and the probable destructions of absolute agricultural lands, forests and pastures were predicted as approximately 968 ha, 228 ha and 24 ha, respectively.

TI  - Revisiting the collision risk with cataloged objects for the Iridium and COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellations
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - After two decades of slightly declining growth rate, the population of cataloged objects around the Earth increased by more than 56% in just a couple of years, from January 2007 to February 2009, due to two collisions in space involving the catastrophic destruction of three intact satellites (Fengyun 1C, Cosmos 2251 and Iridium 33) in high inclination orbits. Both events had occurred in the altitude range already most affected by previous launch activity and breakups. In 2011 a detailed analysis had been carried out to analyze the consequences of these fragmentations, in particular concerning the evolution of the collision risk for the Iridium and COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellations. Five years after such first assessment, the cataloged objects environment affecting the two constellations was revisited to evaluate how the situation had evolved due to the varying contribution of the above mentioned breakup fragments and the space activities carried out in the meantime. Being distributed, at 778 km, over six nearly polar orbit planes separated by just 30 at the equator, the Iridium satellites represent a very good gauge for checking the evolution of the environment in the most critical low Earth region. In approximately five years, from May 2011 to June 2016, the average flux of cataloged objects on the Iridium satellites increased by about 14%, to 1.59x10(-5) m(-2) per year. The cataloged fragments of Fengyun 1C, Cosmos 2251 and Iridium 33 still accounted for, on average, 54% of the total flux. More than 39% of the latter was associated with the Fengyun 1C fragments, about 11% with the Cosmos 2251 fragments and less than 4% with the Iridium 33 fragments. Specifically concerning the mutual interaction among the Iridium 33 debris and the parent constellation, the progressive dispersion and rather fast decay of the fragments below the Iridium operational altitude, coupled with a slow differential plane precession and low average relative velocities with respect to four of the six constellation planes, determined in five years, on average, a decline of the flux by about 31%, i.e. to about 5.75x10(-7) m(-2) per year. The decrease occurred in each constellation plane, even though with different rates and percentages, due to the varying relative orbit geometry. From May 2011 to June 2016, the mean flux of cataloged objects on the COSMO-SkyMed satellites, at 623 km, increased by about 26%, to 7.24x10(-6) m(-2) per year. The Fengyun 1C, Cosmos 2251 and Iridium 33 cataloged fragments accounted for, on average, about 1/4 of the total, with 12% due to Fengyun 1C, 8% to Cosmos 2251 and 4% to Iridium 33.

TI  - Drought monitoring using high resolution soil moisture through multi-sensor satellite data fusion over the Korean peninsula
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts, typically caused by the deficiencies of precipitation and soil moisture, affect water resources and agriculture. As soil moisture is of key importance in understanding the interaction between the atmosphere and Earth's surface, it can be used to monitor droughts. In this study, a High resolution Soil Moisture Drought Index (HSMDI) was proposed and evaluated for meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts. HSMDI was developed using the 1 km downscaled soil moisture data produced from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) from 2003 to 2011 (March to November) over the Korean peninsula. Seven products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite sensors were used to downscale AMSR-E soil moisture based on random forest machine learning. The downscaled 1 km soil moisture was correlated well with both in situ and AMSR-E soil moisture with the mean coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.29 and 0.59, respectively. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) with time scales from I to 12 months, crop yields (for sesame, highland radish, and highland napa cabbage) and streamflow data were used to validate HSMDI for various types of droughts. The results showed that HSMDI depicted meteorological drought well, especially during the dry season, with a similar pattern with the 3-month SPI. However, the performance fluctuated a bit during the wet season possibly due to the limited availability of optical sensor data and heterogeneous land covers around the stations. HSMDI also showed high correlation with crop yield data, in particular the highland radish and napa cabbage cultivated in non-irrigated regions with a mean R-2 of 0.77. However, HSMDI did not monitor streamflow well for hydrological drought presenting a various range of correlations with streamflow data (from 0.03 to 0.83). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Downscaling GLDAS Soil Moisture Data in East Asia through Fusion of Multi-Sensors by Optimizing Modified Regression Trees
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soilmoisture is a key part of Earth's climate systems, including agricultural and hydrological cycles. Soil moisture data from satellite and numerical models is typically provided at a global scale with coarse spatial resolution, which is not enough for local and regional applications. In this study, a soil moisture downscaling model was developed using satellite-derived variables targeting Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture as a reference dataset in East Asia based on the optimization of a modified regression tree. A total of six variables, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture products, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, including Land Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and land cover, were used as input variables. The optimization was conducted through a pruning approach for operational use, and finally 59 rules were extracted based on root mean square errors (RMSEs) and correlation coefficients (r). The developed downscaling model showed a good modeling performance (r = 0.79, RMSE = 0.056 m(3)center dot m(3), and slope = 0.74). The 1 km downscaled soil moisture showed similar time series patterns with both GLDAS and ground soil moisture and good correlation with ground soil moisture (average r = 0.47, average RMSD = 0.038 m(3)center dot m(3)) at 14 ground stations. The spatial distribution of 1 km downscaled soil moisture reflected seasonal and regional characteristics well, although the model did not result in good performance over a few areas such as Southern China due to very high cloud cover rates. The results of this study are expected to be helpful in operational use to monitor soil moisture throughout East Asia since the downscaling model produces daily high resolution (1 km) real time soil moisture with a low computational demand. This study yielded a promising result to operationally produce daily high resolution soil moisture data from multiple satellite sources, although there are yet several limitations. In future research, more variables including Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture, and other vegetation indices will be integrated to improve the performance of the proposed soil moisture downscaling model.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced dual mode imaging: photoacoustic imaging plus more.
T2  - Biomedical engineering letters
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Conventional biomedical imaging modalities in wide clinical use, such as ultrasound imaging, X-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography, can provide morphological, anatomical, and functional information about biological tissues. However, single mode imaging in conventional medicine provides only limited information for definitive diagnoses. Thus, combinational diagnosis using multiple imaging modalities has become increasingly important. Recently, photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has gained significant attention, and several PAI prototypes have been used in clinical trials. At the same time, PAI has been tested in combination with conventional imaging modalities. For all these imaging modalities, various contrast-enhancing agents have been developed for various purposes. In this review article, we will focus on recent progress in developing dual mode contrast agents for PAI in combination with other conventional imaging modalities.

TI  - Mapping Dynamic Water Fraction under the Tropical Rain Forests of the Amazonian Basin from SMOS Brightness Temperatures
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland surface waters in tropical environments play a major role in the water and carbon cycle. Remote sensing techniques based on passive, active microwave or optical wavelengths are commonly used to provide quantitative estimates of surface water extent from regional to global scales. However, some of these estimates are unable to detect water under dense vegetation and/or in the presence of cloud coverage. To overcome these limitations, the brightness temperature data at L-band frequency from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission are used here to estimate flood extent in a contextual radiative transfer model over the Amazon Basin. At this frequency, the signal is highly sensitive to the standing water above the ground, and the signal provides information from deeper vegetation density than higher-frequencies. Three-day and (25 km x 25 km) resolution maps of water fraction extent are produced from 2010 to 2015. The dynamic water surface extent estimates are compared to altimeter data (Jason-2), land cover classification maps (IGBP, GlobeCover and ESA CCI) and the dynamic water surface product (GIEMS). The relationships between the water surfaces, precipitation and in situ discharge data are examined. The results show a high correlation between water fraction estimated by SMOS and water levels from Jason-2 (R > 0.98). Good spatial agreements for the land cover classifications and the water cycle are obtained.

T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - It is well established that organs of future metastasis are not passive receivers of circulating tumour cells, but are instead selectively and actively modified by the primary tumour before metastatic spread has even occurred. Sowing the 'seeds' of metastasis requires the action of tumour-secreted factors and tumour-shed extracellular vesicles that enable the 'soil' at distant metastatic sites to encourage the outgrowth of incoming cancer cells. In this Review, we summarize the main processes and new mechanisms involved in the formation of the pre-metastatic niche.

TI  - Comparison of Multiple Linear Regression, Cubist Regression, and Random Forest Algorithms to Estimate Daily Air Surface Temperature from Dynamic Combinations of MODIS LST Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, several methods have been introduced and applied to estimate daily air surface temperature (T-a) using MODIS land surface temperature data (MODIS LST). Among these methods, the most common used method is statistical modeling, and the most applied algorithms are linear/multiple linear regression models (LM). There are only a handful of studies using machine learning algorithm models such as random forest (RF) or cubist regression (CB). In particular, there is no study comparing different combinations of four MODIS LST datasets with or without auxiliary data using different algorithms such as multiple linear regression, random forest, and cubist regression for daily Ta-max, Ta-min, and Ta-mean estimation. Our study examines the mentioned combinations of four MODIS-LST datasets and shows that different combinations and differently applied algorithms produce various T-a estimation accuracies. Additional analysis of daily data from three climate stations in the mountain area of North West of Vietnam for the period of five years (2009 to 2013) with four MODIS LST datasets (AQUA daytime, AQUA nighttime, TERRA daytime, and TERRA nighttime) and two additional auxiliary datasets (elevation and Julian day) shows that CB and LM should be applied if MODIS LST data is used solely. If MODIS LST is used together with auxiliary data, especially in mountainous areas, CB or RF is highly recommended. This study proved that the very high accuracy of T-a estimation (R-2 > 0.93/0.80/0.89 and RMSE similar to 1.5/2.0/1.6 degrees C of Ta-max, Ta-min, and T-a-mean, respectively) could be achieved with a simple combination of four LST data, elevation, and Julian day data using a suitable algorithm.

TI  - Determining the spatial resolution of multispectral satellite images optimal to detect dead trees in forest areas
T2  - SYLWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The mainstream of remotely sensed methodology for identifying the tree stand condition is based on spectral responses registered by a multispectral sensor as a digital image. The changes in spectral properties are caused by dying leaves, needles or whole trees. In further steps, the relationship between the spectral values (radiometry) registered in a multispectral satellite image and the health condition of trees should be determined. The most frequent situation includes the one whem dying stand (sensu single tree) occupies the area of <5 m(2). Therefore the remotely sensed data for determining sanitary conditions of trees must be of a very high spatial resolution (e.g. WorldView2 or 3, GeoEye-1, Pleiades) on one hand and at the same time favourable for the vegetation studies, i.e. utilizing suitable spectral bands and be of low acquisition cost (e.g. RapidEye, LANDSAT-7, ETM +, LANDSAT-8 OLI). Thus a compromise between spatial and spectral resolution should be found to answer the question at what resolution it is possible to clearly separate the damaged tree. The scope of the research included testing of selected methods of satellite image processing and analysis in terms of defining the optimal spatial resolution, which was performed on simulated images obtained for the area of the Beskidy Mountains (S Poland). Pixel size on simulated images was downgraded to the size corresponding to the currently functioning satellite systems. Consequently the obtained material for comparison was free from influence of external factors such as the differences in: time and weather conditions, the geometry of satellite image acquisition, light at the surface of the treetops and phenological vegetation. For each image we used vegetation indices (NDVI and GDVI) and supervised classification. These tests and the obtained results allowed to draw conclusions about the optimal satellite image resolution that can be used to detect damaged or dead stands.

TI  - Potential environmental drivers of a regional blue mussel mass mortality event (winter of 2014, Breton Sound, France)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global change, increasing mariculture production has raised particular concerns regarding its environmental impact and sustainability. Molluscs and particularly blue mussel account for a significant part of this total production. Although blue mussels are considered to be pretty resilient to environmental disturbances, we report in this study an unprecedented mussel mortality event that occurred during the winter of 2014 in the Bret-on Sound. 9000 metric tonnes of mussels were lost and mortality rates up to 100% were recorded at some farming areas. Through a coupling approach, the present work aims to better understand the potential environmental drivers associated with those mortalities. Firstly, we analysed long-term in situ and satellite data from environmental monitoring networks (available since 1998) to characterize the variability of seawater masses of the sound during the winter of 2014. Secondly, we used modelling simulations to study the possible relationship between seawater hydrodynamics and observed spatio-temporal patterns of mussel mortalities. From January to April 2014 at the long-line culture site where mortalities started, seawater temperatures ranged from 8.3 to 13.3 degrees C (10.2 +/- 0.8 degrees C). Salinity and turbidity values showed successive and short drops (below 16; 29.3 +/- 23) and numerous peaks (above 70 NTU; 17.4 +/- 13.4 NTU) respectively. Winter conditions of 2014 were encountered along the entire French Atlantic coastline and linked to the sixth highest positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO +) index recorded since 1865. These particular environmental variations characterized the winter of 2014 but also others whereas no comparable mussel mortality rates were reported. Exact causes of the 2014 mortality event are still unknown but we showed these environmental variations could not alone be responsible. These have likely affected the sensitivity of the blue mussel populations that were already weakened by early spawning. Meanwhile, these may have facilitated the apparition of a pathogenic strain of Vibrio splendidus isolated on moribund mussels at that time. Our modelling simulations suggested that this pathogenic strain could spread through hydrodynamic patterns and drive the observed mussel mortalities. If this pathogenic strain recurs in future years, particularly with the added stress associated with climate change, mussel mass mortality events may exceed the resilience of this species.

TI  - Development of the crop residue and rangeland burning in the 2014 National Emissions Inventory using information from multiple sources
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning has been identified as an important contributor to the degradation of air quality because of its impact on ozone and particulate matter. One component of the biomass burning inventory, crop residue burning, has been poorly characterized in the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). In the 2011 NEI, wildland fires, prescribed fires, and crop residue burning collectively were the largest source of PM2.5. This paper summarizes our 2014 NEI method to estimate crop residue burning emissions and grass/pasture burning emissions using remote sensing data and field information and literature-based, crop-specific emission factors. We focus on both the postharvest and pre-harvest burning that takes place with bluegrass, corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, sugarcane and wheat. Estimates for 2014 indicate that over the continental United States (CONUS), crop residue burning excluding all areas identified as Pasture/Grass, Grassland Herbaceous, and Pasture/Hay occurred over approximately 1.5 million acres of land and produced 19,600 short tons of PM2.5. For areas identified as Pasture/Grass, Grassland Herbaceous, and Pasture/Hay, biomass burning emissions occurred over approximately 1.6 million acres of land and produced 30,000 short tons of PM2.5. This estimate compares with the 2011 NEI and 2008 NEI as follows: 2008: 49,650 short tons and 2011: 141,180 short tons. Note that in the previous two NEIs rangeland burning was not well defined and so the comparison is not exact. The remote sensing data also provided verification of our existing diurnal profile for crop residue burning emissions used in chemical transport modeling. In addition, the entire database used to estimate this sector of emissions is available on EPA's Clearinghouse for Inventories and Emission Factors (CHIEF, http://www3.epa.gov/ttn/chief/index.html).

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Divergent differentiation or metaplastic change is a rare feature exhibited occasionally in malignant melanoma (MM), which is characterized by the development of morphologically, immunochemically, and/or ultrastructurally nonmelanocytic cells within the tumor. Smooth muscle differentiation in MM is an exceedingly rare phenomenon reported only in a few cases in the literature. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman who presented with a pure dermal amelanotic MM with smooth muscle cell differentiation and an area of rhabdoid morphology, which made the accurate histopathologic diagnostic of MM challenging.

TI  - Greater phenological sensitivity on the higher Tibetan Plateau: new insights from weekly 5 km EVI2 datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plateau vegetation is considered to be highly sensitive to climate change, especially at higher altitudes. Although the Tibetan Plateau has experienced intensive warming over the past few decades, there is much contradictory evidence regarding its phenological variations and the impact of climatic change. In this study, we explored vegetation phenology through the inflexion point-based method with the weekly 0.05A degrees EVI2 datasets from 1982 to 2010. We observed complex spatiotemporal variations in vegetation phenology on the higher Tibetan Plateau from three aspects. From a spatial aspect, the altitudinal gradients of phenological dates, as well as their directions, varied among different altitudes over the past three decades. Compared with delaying with elevation at altitudes below 5000 m, the phenological parameters at altitudes above 5000 m significantly advanced with increasing altitudes. At higher altitudes, much stronger altitudinal gradients (slope) of phenological dates were observed in the 2000s than in the 1980s and 1990s, i.e., 2.19, 3.47, and 3.68 days' advance for start, maximum, and end dates, respectively, compared to less than 1 day's change per 100 m increase in altitude. From a temporal dynamic aspect, when analyzed at different altitudinal bands, the dynamic trends in phenological dates were generally not significant except the advancing trends in the maximum dates at altitudes above 5000 m and the delaying trend in the end dates at altitudes of 4500-5000 m in the twenty-first century. Remarkable elevation dependency was also observed at the pixel level: increasing amplitudes of phenological dynamic trends were observed at higher altitudes when obtaining their minimum around 5000 m. These spatiotemporal variations of vegetation phenology were due to combined effects from both temperature and precipitation: more abundant rainfall and greater magnitudes of dynamic trends were observed in the average daily minimum temperature (slope = 0.08 A degrees C/year) and annual precipitation (slope = 2.17 mm/year) at higher altitudes.

TI  - Annual and Seasonal Glacier-Wide Surface Mass Balance Quantified from Changes in Glacier Surface State: A Review on Existing Methods Using Optical Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Glaciers are one of the terrestrial essential climate variables (ECVs) as they respond very sensitively to climate change. A key driver of their response is the glacier surface mass balance that is typically derived from field measurements. It deserves to be quantified over long time scales to better understand the accumulation and ablation processes at the glacier surface and their relationships with inter-annual changes in meteorological conditions and long-term climate changes. Glaciers with in situ monitoring of surface mass balance are scarce at the global scale, and satellite remote sensing provides a powerful tool to increase the number of monitored glaciers. In this study, we present a review of three optical remote sensing methods developed to quantify seasonal and annual glacier surface mass balances. These methodologies rely on the multitemporal monitoring of the end-of-summer snow line for the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) method, the annual cycle of glacier surface albedo for the albedo method and the mapping of the regional snow cover at the seasonal scale for the snow-map method. Together with a presentation of each method, an application is illustrated. The ELA method shows promising results to quantify annual surface mass balance and to reconstruct multi-decadal time series. The other two methods currently need a calibration on the basis of existing in situ data; however, a generalization of these methods (without calibration) could be achieved. The two latter methods show satisfying results at the annual and seasonal scales, particularly for the summer surface mass balance in the case of the albedo method and for the winter surface mass balance in the case of the snow-map method. The limits of each method (e.g., cloud coverage, debris-covered glaciers, monsoon-regime and cold glaciers), their complementarities and the future challenges (e.g., automating of the satellite images processing, generalization of the methods needing calibration) are also discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of the influenza sentinel surveillance system in Madagascar, 2009-2014
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem Evaluation of influenza surveillance systems is poor, especially in Africa.Approach In 2007, the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar and the Malagasy Ministry of Public Health implemented a countrywide system for the prospective syndromic and virological surveillance of influenza-like illnesses. In assessing this system's performance, we identified gaps and ways to promote the best use of resources. We investigated acceptability, data quality, flexibility, representativeness, simplicity, stability, timeliness and usefulness and developed qualitative and/or quantitative indicators for each of these attributes.Local setting Until 2007, the influenza surveillance system in Madagascar was only operational in Antananarivo and the observations made could not be extrapolated to the entire country.Relevant changes By 2014, the system covered 34 sentinel sites across the country. At 12 sites, nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal samples were collected and tested for influenza virus. Between 2009 and 2014, 177718 fever cases were detected, 25 809 (14.5%) of these fever cases were classified as cases of influenza-like illness. Of the 9192 samples from patients with influenza-like illness that were tested for influenza viruses, 3573 (38.9%) tested positive. Data quality for all evaluated indicators was categorized as above 90% and the system also appeared to be strong in terms of its acceptability, simplicity and stability. However, sample collection needed improvement.Lessons learnt The influenza surveillance system in Madagascar performed well and provided reliable and timely data for public health interventions. Given its flexibility and overall moderate cost, this system may become a useful platform for syndromic and laboratory-based surveillance in other low-resource settings.

TI  - Comparing External Ventricular Drains-Related Ventriculitis Surveillance Definitions
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To evaluate the agreement between the current National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definition for ventriculitis and others found in the literature among patients with an external ventricular drain (EVD)DESIGN Retrospective cohort study from January 2009 to December 2014SETTING Neurology and neurosurgery intensive care unit of a large tertiary-care centerPATIENTS Patients with an EVD were included. Patients with an infection prior to EVD placement or a permanent ventricular shunt were excluded.METHODS We reviewed the charts of patients with positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures and/or abnormal CSF results while they had an EVD in place and applied various ventriculitis definitions.RESULTS We identified 48 patients with a total of 52 cases of ventriculitis (41 CSF culture-positive cases and 11 cases based on abnormal CSF test results) using the NHSN definition. The most common organisms causing ventriculitis were gram-positive commensals (79.2%); however, 45% showed growth of only 1 colony on 1 piece of media. Approximately 60% of the ventriculitis cases by the NHSN definition met the Honda criteria, approximately 56% met the Gozal criteria, and 23% met Citerio's definition. Cases defined using Honda versus Gozal definitions had a moderate agreement (=0.528; P<.05) whereas comparisons of Honda versus Citerio definitions (=0.338; P<.05) and Citerio versus Gozal definitions (=0.384; P<.05) had only fair agreements.CONCLUSIONS The agreement between published ventriculostomy-associated infection (VAI) definitions in this cohort was moderate to fair. A VAI surveillance definition that better defines contaminants is needed for more homogenous application of surveillance definitions between institutions and better comparison of rates.

TI  - Meteorological drought forecasting for ungauged areas based on machine learning: Using long-range climate forecast and remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A high-resolution drought forecast model for ungauged areas was developed in this study. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time scales were forecasted with 1-6-month lead times at 0.05 x 0.05 degrees resolution. The use of long-range climate forecast data was compared to the use of climatological data for periods with no observation data. Machine learning models utilizing drought-related variables based on remote sensing data were compared to the spatial interpolation of Kriging. Two performance measures were used; one is producer's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in extreme, severe, and moderate drought classes over the total number of samples in those classes, and the other is user's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in drought classes over the total number of samples classified to those classes. One of the machine learning models, extremely randomized trees, performed the best in most cases in terms of producer's accuracy reaching up to 64%, while spatial interpolation performed better in terms of user's accuracy up to 44%. The contribution of long-range climate forecast data was not significant under the conditions used in this study, but further improvement is expected if forecast skill is improved or a more sophisticated downscaling method is used. Simulated decreases of forecast error in precipitation and mean temperature were tested: the simulated decrease of forecast error in precipitation improves drought forecast while the decrease of forecast error in mean temperature does not contribute much. Although there is still some room for improvement, the developed model can be used for drought-related decision making in ungauged areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - An evolutionary approach of worldviews to think the transformations of agriculture
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the coming years, agriculture will have to face unprecedented challenges and to transform itself radically. Today already, contrasted solutions are emerging, from 3.0. agriculture to permaculture. In this context, this paper aims to show the interest of an evolutionary approach of worldviews to think the transformations of agriculture. In the first part, a worldview is defined as a structuring system of meaning, informing how humans interpret and co-create reality. Four major types of worldviews have been identified in literature: Traditional; Modern; Postmodern; Integral. Following an evolution approach, these four types can be seen as successive stages of individual and collective development, although no type can be considered as intrinsically "better" than another. In the second part of the paper, I propose an application of the four types to the agricultural domain. Modern and Postmodern worldviews put an emphasis rather on food security for the first one, and on food sovereignty for the second. The Integral worldview, still very uncommon nowadays, integrates both scientific and spiritual dimensions. The evolutionary approach enables to think differently about agricultural systems technical and organizational transformations, as coevolving with worldviews. It can also be useful to develop self-reflexivity on our own vision, better integrate those of others and engage in mutual transformations. Finally, agricultural systems coexistence can be considered in a constructive, benevolent and committed way.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: We examined the value of monitoring patients with multiple nevi using sequential digital dermatoscopy imaging at a tertiary referral center.Patients and methods: This is a retrospective cohort study including 2,824 patients and 23,241 monitored lesions. We calculated trends in key parameters such as the number of melanomas and nevi monitored and excised.Results: During follow-up, we excised 1,266 lesions in 709 patients, including 146 (11.5 %) melanomas. The percentage of in situ melanomas detected at follow-up was significantly higher than at baseline (46.6 % versus 23.4 %, p <= 0.001). The risk of detecting a melanoma during follow-up was higher for patients with a melanoma at baseline, compared to those without (relative risk: 3.59, 95 % CI: 2.15 to 6.00). The number of documented lesions showed a positive correlation with the benign/malignant ratio, and excisions at baseline decreased significantly over the course of the study period.Conclusion: Digital dermatoscopy monitoring improves the detection of thin melanomas in patients with multiple nevi. Patients with a melanoma at baseline are at an increased risk of developing a melanoma during follow-up and should therefore be a target group for sequential dermatoscopy imaging.

TI  - Irrigated land expansion since 1985 in Southern Tunisia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The causes of agricultural land expansion and its impacts on dryland ecosystems such as the oasis regions of Southern Tunisia, are fundamental problems challenging the sustainability of irrigated agriculture on water limited ecosystems. Consequently, a thorough understanding of this phenomenon is necessary to avoid future problems. With the objective of identifying irrigated land expansion dynamics and the primary drivers, two representative oasis regions in Southern Tunisia, Mareth and Fatnassa, were selected. Changes in irrigated lands in both regions between 1985 and 2011 were analyzed, and the land uses from which expansion occurred were identified using Landsat images from different years (1985, 1996 and 2011). The results indicate that the surface occupied by irrigation agriculture has doubled in Mareth, while in Fatnassa, it has increased fourfold. During that period, there was a simultaneous increase in total population, as consequence of human migration that came along with an increase in income. Thus, we could identify human migration and economic development as potential drivers of irrigated agriculture expansion, though further research is warranted to ascertain a quantification that would assist in obtaining the sustainability of these regions.

TI  - The Role of Emissivity in the Detection of Arctic Night Clouds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of clouds over polar areas from satellite radiometric measurements in the visible and IR atmospheric window region is rather difficult because of the high albedo of snow, possible ice covered surfaces, very low humidity, and the usual presence of atmospheric temperature inversion. Cold and highly reflective polar surfaces provide little thermal and visible contrast between clouds and the background surface. Moreover, due to the presence of temperature inversion, clouds are not always identifiable as being colder than the background. In addition, low humidity often causes polar clouds to be optically thin. Finally, polar clouds are usually composed of a mixture of ice and water, which leads to an unclear spectral signature. Single and bi-spectral threshold methods are sometimes inappropriate due to a large variability of surface emissivity and cloud conditions. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the crucial role played by surface emissivity in the detection of polar winter clouds and the potential improvement offered by infrared hyperspectral observations, such as from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). In this paper a new approach for cloud detection is proposed and validated exploiting active measurements from satellite sensors, i.e., the CloudSat cloud profiling radar (CPR) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). For a homogenous IASI field of view (FOVs), the proposed cloud detection scheme tallies with the combined CPR and CALIOP product in classifying 98.11% of the FOVs as cloudy and also classifies 97.54% of the FOVs as clear. The Hansen Kuipers discriminant reaches 0.95.

TI  - Subpixel Mapping of Urban Areas Using EnMAP Data and Multioutput Support Vector Regression
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing data offer the opportunity to map urban characteristics in detail. Though, adequate algorithms need to cope with increasing data dimensionality, high redundancy between individual bands, and often spectrally complex urban landscapes. The study focuses on subpixel quantification of urban land cover compositions using simulated environmental mapping and analysis program (EnMAP) data acquired over the city of Berlin, utilizing both machine learning regression and classification algorithms, i.e., multioutput support vector regression (MSVR), standard support vector regression (SVR), import vector machine classifier (IVM), and support vector classifier (SVC). The experimental setup incorporates a spectral library and a reference land cover fraction map used for validation purposes. The library spectra were synthetically mixed to derive quantitative training data for the classes vegetation, impervious surface, soil, and water. MSVR and SVR models were trained directly using the synthetic mixtures. For IVM and SVC, a modified hyperparameter selection approach is conducted to improve the description of urban land cover fractions by means of probability outputs. Validation results demonstrate the high potential of the MSVR for subpixel mapping in the urban context. MSVR outperforms SVR in terms of both accuracy and computational time. IVM and SVC work similarly well, yet with lower accuracies of subpixel fraction estimates compared to both regression approaches.

AB  - IMPORTANCE The incidence of melanoma is increasing, with 76 380 new cases of invasive melanoma and 68 480 new cases of melanoma in situ expected in 2016.OBJECTIVE To review the contemporary management of early-stage melanoma.EVIDENCE REVIEW We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases from January 1, 2011, to May 1, 2016, yielding 966 articles. We focused our search on early-stage (melanoma in situ, stage I, and stage II) cutaneous melanoma. After excluding articles, 41 articles were manually reviewed. A review of the bibliographies of selected articles generated additional references.FINDINGS While the majority of recent advances have been in the treatment of advanced melanoma, surgical excision with margins based on the presence and depth of invasion continues to be the cornerstone of management. Sentinel lymph node biopsy plays a central role in the staging and treatment of melanoma.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Accurate diagnosis and adequate surgical excision are critical in reducing local recurrences and improving outcomes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is useful in staging the regional nodal basin and guiding treatment in appropriately selected patients.

TI  - Glacier Surface Velocity Retrieval Using D-InSAR and Offset Tracking Techniques Applied to Ascending and Descending Passes of Sentinel-1 Data for Southern Ellesmere Ice Caps, Canadian Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) acquisition mode of the Sentinel-1 mission provides a wide coverage per acquisition with resolutions of 5min range and 20m in azimuth, which makes this acquisition mode attractive for glacier velocity monitoring. Here, we retrieve surface velocities from the southern Ellesmere Island ice caps (Canadian Arctic) using both offset tracking and Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) techniques and combining ascending and descending passes. We optimise the offset tracking technique by omitting the azimuth offsets. By doing so, we are able to improve the final resolution of the velocity product, as Sentinel-1 shows a lower resolution in the azimuth direction. Simultaneously, we avoid the undesired ionospheric effect manifested in the data as azimuth streaks. The D-InSAR technique shows its merits when applied to slow-moving areas, while offset tracking is more suitable for fast-moving areas. This research shows that the methods used here are complementary and the use of both to determine glacier velocities is better than only using one or the other. We observe glacier surface velocities of up to 1200 m year(-1) for the fastest tidewater glaciers. The land-terminating glaciers show typical velocities between 12 and 33 m year(-1), though with peaks up to 150 m year(-1) in narrowing zones of the confining valleys.

TI  - Water body extraction and change detection using time series: A case study of Lake Burdur, Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF TAIBAH UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, spatiotemporal changes in Lake Burdur from 1987 to 2011 were evaluated using multi-temporal Landsat TM and ETM+ images. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification and spectral water indexing, including the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI) and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), were used for extraction of surface water from image data. The spectral and spatial performance of each classifier was compared using Pearson's r, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The accuracies of the SVM and satellite derived indexes were tested using the RMSE. Overall, SVM followed by the MNDWI, NDWI and AWEI yielded the best result among all the techniques in terms of their spectral and spatial quality.Spatiotemporal changes of the lake based on the applied method reveal an intense decreasing trend in surface area between 1987 and 2011, especially from 1987 to 2000, when the lake lost approximately one fifth of its surface area compared to that in 1987. The results show the effectiveness of SVM and MNDWI-based surface water change detection, particularly in identifying changes between specified time intervals. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Three decades of Landsat-derived spring surface water dynamics in an agricultural wetland mosaic; Implications for migratory shorebirds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite measurements of surface water offer promise for understanding wetland habitat availability at broad spatial and temporal scales; reliable habitat is crucial for the persistence of migratory shorebirds that depend on wetland networks. We analyzed water extent dynamics within wetland habitats at a globally important shorebird stopover site for a 1983-2015 Landsat time series, and evaluated the effect of climate on water extent. A range of methods can detect open water from imagery, including supervised classification approaches and thresholds for spectral bands and indices. Thresholds provide a time advantage; however, there is no universally superior index, nor single best threshold for all instances. We used random forest to model the presence or absence of water from >6200 reference pixels, and derived an optimal water probability threshold for our study area using receiver operating characteristic curves. An optimized mid-infrared (1.5-1.7 mu m) threshold identified open water in the Sacramento Valley of California at 30-m resolution with an average of 90% producer's accuracy, comparable to approaches that require more intensive user input. SLC-off Landsat 7 imagery was integrated by applying a customized interpolation that mapped water in missing data gaps with 99% user's accuracy. On average we detected open water on-26000 ha (similar to 3% of the study area) in early April at the peak of shorebird migration, while water extent increased five-fold after the migration rush. Over the last three decades, late March water extent declined by similar to 1300 ha per year, primarily due to changes in the extent and timing of agricultural flood-irrigation. Water within shorebird habitats was significantly associated with an index of water availability at the peak of migration. Our approach can be used to optimize thresholds for time series analysis and near-realtime mapping in other regions, and requires only marginally more time than generating a confusion matrix.

TI  - Continuous monitoring of snowpack dynamics in alpine terrain by aboveground neutron sensing
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of an aboveground cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS) are evaluated for monitoring a mountain snowpack in the Austrian Alps from March 2014 to June 2016. Neutron counts were compared to continuous point-scale snow depth (SD) and snow-water-equivalent (SWE) measurements from an automatic weather station with a maximum SWE of 600 mm (April 2014). Several spatially distributed Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS)-based SD and SWE maps were additionally used. A strong nonlinear correlation is found for both SD and SWE. The representative footprint of the CRNS is in the range of 230-270 m. In contrast to previous studies suggesting signal saturation at around 100 mm of SWE, no complete signal saturation was observed. These results imply that CRNS could be transferred into an unprecedented method for continuous detection of spatially averaged SD and SWE for alpine snowpacks, though with sensitivity decreasing with increasing SWE. While initially different functions were found for accumulation and melting season conditions, this could be resolved by accounting for a limited measurement depth. This depth limit is in the range of 200 mm of SWE for dense snowpacks with high liquid water contents and associated snow density values around 450 kg m(-3) and above. In contrast to prior studies with shallow snowpacks, interannual transferability of the results is very high regardless of presnowfall soil moisture conditions. This underlines the unexpectedly high potential of CRNS to close the gap between point-scale measurements, hydrological models, and remote sensing of the cryosphere in alpine terrain.

TI  - Observing Sea/Ice Transition Using Radar Images Generated From TechDemoSat-1 Delay Doppler Maps
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) delay Doppler maps (DDMs) acquired by the U.K. TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) mission are analyzed to identify sea ice infesting waters in circumpolar areas. First, the sensitivity of actual DDM to sea ice is investigated using reference information provided by a Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery and a Special Sensor Microwave/Imager based sea-ice concentration map. Then, a new product is proposed that consists of normalized radar cross section measurements derived from actual DDMs and arranged in gridded format. This product is shown to provide spatial information on the sea ice transition that cannot be obtained exploiting the conventional DDM product. Hence, this new product can be used to improve/complement conventional remote sensing techniques for sea ice observation.

TI  - Phenology-Based Biomass Estimation to Support Rangeland Management in Semi-Arid Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock plays an important economic role in Niger, especially in the semi-arid regions, while being highly vulnerable as a result of the large inter-annual variability of precipitation and, hence, rangeland production. This study aims to support effective rangeland management by developing an approach for mapping rangeland biomass production. The observed spatiotemporal variability of biomass production is utilised to build a model based on ground and remote sensing data for the period 2001 to 2015. Once established, the model can also be used to estimate herbaceous biomass for the current year at the end of the season without the need for new ground data. The phenology-based seasonal cumulative Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (cNDVI), computed from 10-day image composites of the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data, was used as proxy for biomass production. A linear regression model was fitted with multi-annual field measurements of herbaceous biomass at the end of the growing season. In addition to a general model utilising all available sites for calibration, different aggregation schemes (i.e., grouping of sites into calibration units) of the study area with a varying number of calibration units and different biophysical meaning were tested. The sampling sites belonging to a specific calibration unit of a selected scheme were aggregated to compute the regression. The different aggregation schemes were evaluated with respect to their predictive power. The results gathered at the different aggregation levels were subjected to cross-validation (cv), applying a jackknife technique (leaving out one year at a time). In general, the model performance increased with increasing model parameterization, indicating the importance of additional unobserved and spatially heterogeneous agro-ecological effects (which might relate to grazing, species composition, optical soil properties, etc.) in modifying the relationship between cNDVI and herbaceous biomass at the end of the season. The biophysical aggregation scheme, the calibration units for which were derived from an unsupervised ISODATA classification utilising 10-day NDVI images taken between January 2001 and December 2015, showed the best performance in respect to the predictive power (R-2 (cv) = 0.47) and the cross-validated root-mean-square error (398 kg (.) ha(-1)) values, although it was not the model with the highest number of calibration units. The proposed approach can be applied for the timely production of maps of estimated biomass at the end of the growing season before field measurements are made available. These maps can be used for the improved management of rangeland resources, for decisions on fire prevention and aid allocation, and for the planning of more in-depth field missions.

TI  - Is pelvic sentinel node biopsy necessary for lower extremity and trunk melanomas?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: There is currently no consensus regarding how to address pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (PSLNs) in melanoma. Thus, our objectives were to identify the incidence and clinical impact of PSLNs.Methods: Retrospective review of a prospectively collected multi-institutional melanoma database.Results: Of 2476 cases of lower extremity and trunk melanomas, 227 (9%) drained to PSLNs (181 to both PSLNs and superficial (inguinal or femoral) sentinel lymph nodes (SSLN) and 46 to PSLNs alone). Seventeen (7.5%) of 227 PSLN cases were positive for nodal metastasis, 8 of which drained to PSLNs only while 9 drained to both PSLNs and SSLNs. Complication rates between PSLN and SSLN biopsy were similar (15% vs. 14% respectively). In 181 cases with drainage to both SSLNs and PSLNs, PSLN biopsy upstaged one patient (0.6%), and completion dissection based on a positive PSLN did not upstage any.Conclusions: PSLN biopsy is safe, however in the setting of negative SSLNs there is minimal clinical impact. We therefore recommend PSLN biopsy when the SSLNs are positive or when the tumor drains to PSLNs alone. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nonvisualized sentinel lymph nodes on lymphoscintigraphy in melanoma: predictive factors and surgical outcomes
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposePreoperative lymphoscintigraphy is the standard for the identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in melanoma. The impact of negative scintigraphy [nonvisualization (NV) of the SLN] on surgical outcomes is inadequately reported in the literature. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence, predictive factors, and surgical outcomes of NV in clinically node-negative melanoma patients.Patients and methodsA retrospective review of a prospective, Institutional Review Board approved, melanoma sentinel node database from January 2005 to August 2015 was performed.ResultsTwenty-seven of the 897 (3%) patients had negative scintigraphy. Single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography was performed in addition to planar imaging in four patients and failed to locate the SLN in all cases. NV was associated with older age (71 vs. 59 years, P<0.001), head and neck primaries (41%), and previous operations adjacent to the primary tumor or nodal beds (37%). NV was not associated with sex, BMI, or T stage. Despite a negative scintigram, the SLN was still found at operation in 10 of the 27 (37%) patients using the hand-held gamma probe, with one (10%) patient having nodal metastasis. Two patients with NV had nodal recurrence, with a mean follow-up of 3 years.DiscussionPreoperative lymphoscintigraphy in clinically node-negative melanoma patients is associated with a low NV rate. Predictors for NV include age, head and neck location, and previous operations at adjacent sites. NV should not preclude surgical exploration as the SLN can still be found at operation in over one-third of patients.

TI  - Challenges in developing drugs for primary headaches
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This review considers the history of drug development in primary headaches and discusses challenges to the discovery of innovative headache therapeutics. Advances in headache genetics have yet to translate to new classes of therapeutics and there are currently no clear predictive human biomarkers for any of the primary headaches that can guide preventative drug discovery and development. Primary headache disorder subtypes despite common phenotypic presentation are undoubtedly heterogeneous in their pathophysiology as judged by the variability of response to headache medicines. Sub-classification of headache subtypes into more homogenous and specific phenotypes groups may facilitate genotyping and provide sentinel patient groups that can be used in a mechanism specific manner to test new and more personalized treatment strategies in headache medicine. The development of the triptan class of serotonin 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptor agonists has advanced our understanding of the neurobiology of migraine pain, which subsequently resulted in the development of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) modulators that are now showing promise as acute and preventative anti-migraine agents. Despite these successes, there have been many near misses and failures in the discovery and development of headache therapeutics. Glutamate receptor antagonism whilst efficacious has central side effects and some approaches such as nitric oxide synthase inhibition, substance P antagonism and cortical spreading depression blockade, despitehaving promising effects inbasic painmodels, havenot delivered efficacy in the clinic. Future efforts may triage novel physiological mediators using human experimental models of headache pain to support drug discovery strategies that target active pathways pharmacologically.

TI  - University Hospital Waterford: 5-year experience of cutaneous melanoma
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The incidence of cutaneous melanoma (CM) continues to rise in Ireland. Despite significant advances in melanoma molecular therapy, surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for CM. The University Hospital Waterford (UHW) prospectively maintained CM registry was established in 2010.To summarize 5-year experience (2010-2015) of primary CM presenting to UHW.Data were retrospectively obtained from a central electronic pathology and radiology repository augmented by HIPE data and theatre logs. Data collected included patient demographics and clinico-pathological characteristics, specimen number, size, anatomical location, melanoma subtype, Breslow thickness, Clark's level, ulceration, and mitosis.592 CMs were managed in UHW during the study period. Overall, females comprised the majority of cases with mean age at presentation 60.78 +/- 18.29 years. The most commonly affected anatomical location was the lower limb (26.7%) followed by the back (15.1%), upper limb (15.07%), and face (14.40%). Superficial spreading and lentigo maligna were the most common histological subtype accounting for 19.8 and 20%, respectively. Overall, the mean Breslow depth was 2.4 +/- 3.7 mm with corresponding Clark's Level III. Sentinel lymph node positivity was 39/103 (37.89%) most commonly located in the axilla (53.8%) and groin (30.7%).There has been a steady increase in the number of cutaneous melanoma presentations over the past 5-years to the South East Cancer Centre. Patients are managed best by prompt surgical excision and multidisciplinary management. Our results are in keeping with international standards and work continues in determining overall 5-year survival and recurrence rates.

TI  - A spatio-temporal analysis of forest loss related to cocaine trafficking in Central America
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that criminal activities associated with drug trafficking networks are a progressively important driver of forest loss in Central America. However, the scale at which drug trafficking represents a driver of forest loss is not presently known. We estimated the degree to which narcotics trafficking may contribute to forest loss using an unsupervised spatial clustering of 15 spatial and temporal forest loss patch metrics developed from global forest change data. We distinguished anomalous forest loss from background loss patches for each country exhibiting potential 'narco-capitalized' signatures which showed a statistically significant dissimilarity from other patches in terms of size, timing, and rate of forest loss. We also compared annual anomalous forest loss with the number of cocaine shipments and volume of cocaine seized, lost, or delivered at country-and department-level. For Honduras, results from linear mixed effects models showed a highly significant relationship between anomalous forest loss and the timing of increased drug trafficking (F = 9.90, p = 0.009) that also differed significantly from temporal patterns of background forest loss (t-ratio = 2.98, p = 0.004). Other locations of high forest loss in Central America showed mixed results. The timing of increased trafficking was not significantly related to anomalous forest loss in Guatemala and Nicaragua, but significantly differed in patch size compared to background losses. We estimated that cocaine trafficking could account for between 15% and 30% of annual national forest loss in these three countries over the past decade, and 30% to 60% of loss occurred within nationally and internationally designated protected areas. Cocaine trafficking is likely to have severe and lasting consequences in terms of maintaining moist tropical forest cover in Central America. Addressing forest loss in these and other tropical locations will require a stronger linkage between national and international drug interdiction and conservation policies.

TI  - Assessing and characterizing oilseed rape freezing injury based on MODIS and MERIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The oilseed rape growing in the lower reaches of Yangtze River in China belongs to winter varieties and suffers the risk of freezing injury. In this research, a typical freezing injury event occurred in Anhui Province was taken as a case study, the freezing damage degree of oilseed rape was assessed, and its development characteristics based on the vegetation metrics derived from MODIS and MERIS data were investigated. The oilseed rape was mapped according to the decline of greenness from bud stage to full-bloom period, with the phenological phases identified adopting time-series analyses. NDVI was more sensitive to freezing injury compared with other commonly used vegetation indices (VIs) calculated using MODIS bands, e.g., EVI, GNDVI and SAVI. The freezing damage degree employing the difference between post-freeze growth and the baseline level in adjacent damage-free growing seasons was determined. The remote sensing-derived damage levels were supported by their correlation with the cold accumulated temperatures at the county level. The performance of several remote sensing indicators of plant biophysical and biochemical parameters was also investigated, i.e., the photosynthetic rate, canopy water status, canopy chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI) and the red edge position (REP), in response to the advance of the freezing damage. It was found that the photosynthetic rate indicator-Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) responded strongly to freezing stress. Freezing injury caused canopy water loss, which could be detected though the magnitude was not very large. MERIS-LAI showed a slow and lagging response to low temperature and restored rapidly in the recovery phase; additionally, REP and the indicator of canopy chlorophyll content-MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI), did not appear to be influenced by freezing injury. It was concluded that the physiological functions, canopy structure, and organic content metrics showed a descending order of vulnerabilities to freezing injury.

TI  - The Latest Advancements in Selective Neck Dissection for Early Stage Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The management of cervical lymph node metastasis remains a crucial component of the treatment of head and neck cancers. However, the proper management of clinical N-0 cases with early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains undefined. In the advent of minimally invasive techniques in the 1980s, these techniques have gained popularity among numerous surgeons in all fields of surgery. Although there are no randomized controlled trial data comparing the outcomes of minimally invasive techniques (endoscopically assisted selective neck dissection (SND), robot-assisted SND) with conventional techniques, encouraging evidence from several studies suggests that both endoscopically assisted SND and robot-assisted SND are safe, minimally invasive techniques with achieved short-term oncologic outcomes and can reach a better cosmetic outcome than conventional SND. In this review, we also compare the indications, surgical approaches, and relative advantages and disadvantages of conventional SND, endoscopically assisted SND, and robot-assisted SND to provide surgeons with a means to better consider these techniques for the treatment of early-stage OSCC.

TI  - Satellite-Based Nowcasting of Extreme Rainfall Events Over Western Himalayan Region
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Western Himalayan (WH) region is considered to be one of the most vulnerable spots for flash flooding-related natural disasters in the world. The confluence of moist air advected from Arabian sea with complex terrain has produced a series of extreme rainfall triggered disasters in recent past. However, the causal events leading to these enhanced episodes of precipitation lack clarity and thus flash flood forecasting still remains a big challenge. In this paper, we address the problem by studying cloud development over this region and its relationship with the underlying topography. Our results demonstrate that WH region is mostly inhabited by low-medium level clouds and governed by warm rain processes. Satellite-based analysis shows that in comparison to cloud top temperature, cloud top cooling rate (CTCR) is a better indicator for extreme rain producing events over this region. A model for nowcasting of extreme orographic rain events has thus been developed using the spatial characteristics of CTCR to predict potential locations for orographically induced severe precipitation events. The heavy rainfall nowcasts produced by this methodology, when compared with global precipitation fields, show very encouraging results. The probability of positive identification of a heavy rainfall event is 82.8%, with a false alarm rate of 29.7% and average lead time of 2-3 h. The insights provided by this study will give an impetus to the flash flood advance warning over WH region bringing about a significant beneficial societal impact.

TI  - Detection of Local Site Conditions in Tripura and Mizoram Using the Topographic Gradient Extracted from Remote Sensing Data and GIS Techniques
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques to estimate the surface level seismic hazard was investigated using topographic gradient maps in the states of Tripura and Mizoram. This paper addresses a vital issue on the estimation of the seismic hazards of Northeast (NE) India, where the hazards are high and the risk is also high. In developing site response maps or seismic hazard (surface acceleration) maps, it is difficult to obtain near-surface soil data (site-specific data) through geophysical/geotechnical field investigations at a smaller resolution scale (a state/region or country level). The topographic slope provides a reliable proxy because the rocky materials maintain a steep gradient/slope compared to soft soil deposits. In this paper, peak ground acceleration (PGA) at the bedrock for the states of Tripura and Mizoram in NE India has been estimated using probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), which considers linear sources and events (from 1731 to 2010) with appropriate ground motion prediction equations applicable for NE India. Further, the authors have adopted the square root impedance model to estimate the spectral amplification of the study area to bring the hazard from bedrock level to surface. Authors have classified the entire study area as site classes B, C, and D categories and thereafter estimated spectral amplifications for the site periods (0.40, 0.21, 0.11, and 0.01s). The surface level PGA (g) and amplification maps have been developed using a probabilistic approach considering PGA at the bedrock level. The results indicate that this area is highly sensitive to spectral responses, such as spectral acceleration or spectral amplification rather than PGA. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - An innovative method for determining hydrological calibration parameters for the WRF-Hydro model in arid regions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The techniques presented herein allow to directly determine certain crucial calibration parameters for the WRF-Hydro flood forecasting model. Typically, calibrations are chosen by an iterative, empirical, trial and error procedure. We suggest a more systematic methodology to arrive at a usable calibration. Our method is based on physical soil properties and does not depend on observed runoff from certain basins during specific storm events. Three specific calibration variables that most strongly affect the runoff predictions are addressed: topographic slope, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and infiltration. We outline a procedure for creating spatially distributed values for each of the three variables. Simulation runs are performed covering several storm events with calculated calibrations, with default values, and with an expert calibration. We show that our calibration, derived solely from soil physical properties, achieves forecast skill better than the default calibration and at least as good as an expert based calibration.

TI  - Estimating Wheat Yield in China at the Field and District Scale from the Assimilation of Satellite Data into the Aquacrop and Simple Algorithm for Yield (SAFY) Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate yield estimation at the field scale is essential for the development of precision agriculture management, whereas at the district level it can provide valuable information for supply chain management. In this paper, Huan Jing (HJ) satellite HJ1A/B and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were employed to retrieve leaf area index (LAI) and canopy cover (CC) in the Yangling area (Central China). These variables were then assimilated into two crop models, Aquacrop and simple algorithm for yield (SAFY), in order to compare their performances and practicalities. Due to the models' specificities and computational constraints, different assimilation methods were used. For SAFY, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was applied using LAI as the observed variable, while for Aquacrop, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used, using canopy cover (CC). These techniques were applied and validated both at the field and at the district scale. In the field application, the lowest relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) value of 18% was obtained using EnKF with SAFY. On a district scale, both methods were able to provide production estimates in agreement with data provided by the official statistical offices. From an operational point of view, SAFY with the EnKF method was more suitable than Aquacrop with PSO, in a data assimilation context.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal trends using in situ sunshine duration (SD) and satellite, incoming shortwave solar radiation (SIS) data for South Africa over a period up to six decades were investigated. Trend analysis was applied to SD data of 22 sunshine-recording stations from the South African Weather Service that cover the length and breadth of South Africa. Satellite application facility on climate monitoring provided the high-resolution derived SIS for the period 1983-2013. A number of stations show a statistically significant decreasing trend in SD in all four seasons on a seasonal scale. Declines (number of stations showing significant trend) in SD at 17(7), 8(3), 7(3) and 3(0) stations, were observed for summer, autumn, winter and spring, respectively. The SIS has also shown a decreasing trend over South Africa in most of the regions during the summer season followed by autumn. The results indicated a general tendency of decrease in incoming solar radiation mostly during summer which could be of some concern for solar energy applications.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of Pai forest vegetation in Pakistan assessed by RS and GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Pai, an arid forest in Sindh Province of Pakistan, is important for the environmental, social, economic development and conservation of ecosystems of the province. Considering the significance of the forest for Sindh and the calls from the local population for its deforestation, we quantified the spatial and temporal variation in the vegetation of the forest and land surface temperature (LST) using optical and thermal Landsat satellite data. Our analysis of temporal (1987-2014) images with ArcGIS 10.1 revealed that the dense forest area was greatest at 725 ha (37 % of the total forest area) during 2013 while it was smallest at 217 ha (11 %) in 1992. The sparse forest area peaked during 1987 at 1115 ha (58 %) under shrubs whereas it was smallest at 840 ha (43 %) in 1992, and the maximum deforestation of Pai forest occurred during 1992. Spatial change in vegetation over a period of about 27 years (1987-2014) revealed that vegetation increased on an area of 735 ha (37 %), decreased on 427 ha (22 %), and there was no change on 808 ha (41 %) of the forest. Variation in temperature between shaded (dense forest) and unshaded areas (bare land) of the forest was from 6 to 10 A degrees C. While the temperature difference between areas with sparse forest and bare land ranged from 4 to 6 A degrees C. An inverse relationship between LST and NDVI of Pai forest with coefficients of determination of 0.944 and 0.917 was observed when NDVI was plotted against minimum and maximum LST, respectively. The vegetation in the forest increased with time and the areas of more dense Pai forest supported lower surface temperature and thus air temperature.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node assessment in endometrial cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the staging of endometrial cancer, controversy remains regarding the role of sentinel lymph node mapping compared with other nodal assessment strategies.OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of sentinel lymph node mapping in the management of endometrial cancer.DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled trials for studies published in English before March 25, 2016 (PROSPERO CRD42016036503).STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies were included if they contained 10 or more women with endometrial cancer and reported on the detection rate, sensitivity, and/or impact on treatment or survival of sentinel lymph node mapping.STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Two authors independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles for inclusion and assessed study quality. The detection rate, sensitivity, and factors associated with successful mapping (study size, body mass index, tumor histology and grade, injection site, dye type) were synthesized through random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression.RESULTS: We identified 55 eligible studies, which included 4915 women. The overall detection rate of sentinel lymph node mapping was 81% (95% confidence interval, 77-84) with a 50% (95% confidence interval, 44-56) bilateral pelvic node detection rate and 17% (95% confidence interval, 11-23) paraaortic detection rate. There was no difference in detection rates by patient body mass index or tumor histology and grade. Use of indocyanine green increased the bilateral detection rate compared with blue dye. Additionally, cervical injection increased the bilateral sentinel lymph node detection rate but decreased the paraaortic detection rate compared with alternative injection techniques. Intraoperative sentinel lymph node frozen section increased the overall and bilateral detection rates. The sensitivity of sentinel node mapping to detect metastases was 96% (95% confidence interval, 91-98); ultrastaging did not improve sensitivity. Compared with women staged with complete lymphadenectomy, women staged with sentinel lymph node mapping were more likely to receive adjuvant treatment.CONCLUSION: Sentinel lymph node mapping is feasible and accurately predicts nodal status in women with endometrial cancer. The current data favors the use of cervical injection techniques with indocyanine green. Sentinel lymph mapping may be considered an alternative standard of care in the staging of women with endometrial cancer.

TI  - Sentinel Lymphadenectomy in Vulvar Cancer Using Near-Infrared Fluorescence From Indocyanine Green Compared With Technetium 99m Nanocolloid
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Nowadays, sentinel diagnostic is performed using technetium 99m (Tc-99m) nanocolloid as a radioactive marker and sometimes patent blue. In the last years, indocyanine green has been evaluated for sentinel diagnostic in different tumor entities. Indocyanine green is a fluorescent molecule that emits a light signal in the near-infrared band after excitation. Our study aimed to evaluate indocyanine green compared with the criterion-standard Tc-99m-nanocolloid.Methods We included patients with primary, unifocal vulvar cancer of less than 4 cm with clinically node-negative groins in this prospective trial. Sentinel diagnostic was carried out using Tc-99m-nanocolloid, indocyanine green, and patent blue. We examined each groin for light signals from the near-infrared band, for radioactivity, and for blue staining. A sentinel lymph node was defined as a Tc-99m-nanocolloid-positive lymph node. All sentinel lymph nodes and all additional blue or fluorescent lymph nodes were excised and tested and then sent for histologic examination.Results In all, 27 patients were included in whom we found 91 sentinel lymph nodes in 52 groins. All these lymph nodes were positive for indocyanine green, also giving a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.0%-100%) compared with Tc-99m-nanocolloid. Eight additional lymph nodes showed indocyanine green fluorescence but no Tc-99m positivity, so that the positive predictive value was 91.9% (95% confidence interval, 84.6%-96.5%). In 1 patient, a false-negative sentinel missed by all 3 modalities was found.Conclusions Our results show that indocyanine green is a promising approach for inguinal sentinel identification in vulvar cancer with a similar sensitivity as radioactive Tc-99m-nanocolloid and worth to be evaluated in further studies.

TI  - Spatial Prediction of Soil Organic Matter Using a Hybrid Geostatistical Model of an Extreme Learning Machine and Ordinary Kriging
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of soil organic matter (SOM) content for spatial non-point prediction is an important driving force for the agricultural carbon cycle and sustainable productivity. This study proposed a hybrid geostatistical method of extreme learning machine-ordinary kriging (ELMOK), to predict the spatial variability of the SOM content. To assess the feasibility of ELMOK, a case study was conducted in a regional scale study area in Shaanxi Province, China. A total of 472 topsoil (0-20 cm) samples were collected. A total of 14 auxiliary variables (predictors) were obtained from remote sensing data and environmental factors. The proposed method was compared with the ability of traditional geostatistical methods such as simple kriging (SK) and ordinary kriging (OK), in addition to hybrid geostatistical methods such as regression-ordinary kriging (ROK) and artificial neural network-ordinary kriging (ANNOK). The results showed that the extreme learning machines (ELM) model used principal components (PCs) as input variables, and performed better than both multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Compared with geostatistical and hybrid geostatistical prediction methods of SOM spatial distribution, the ELMOK model had the highest coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.671) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD = 2.05), as well as the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 1.402 g kg(-1)). In conclusion, the application of remote sensing imagery and environmental factors has a deeper driven significance of a non-linear and multi-dimensional hierarchy relationship for explaining the spatial variability of SOM, tracing local carbon sink and high quality SOM maps. More importantly, it is possibly concluded that the sustainable monitoring of SOM is a significant process through the pixel-based revisit sampling, an analysis of the mapping results of SOM, and methodological integration, which is the primary step in spatial variations and time series. The proposed ELMOK methodology is a promising and effective approach which can play a vital role in predicting the spatial variability of SOM at a regional scale.

TI  - Tree senescence as a direct measure of habitat quality: Linking red-edge Vegetation Indices to space use by Magellanic woodpeckers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of the quality and quantity of remnant habitats is critical for planning management activities for the conservation of threatened species. Although habitat quality usually is understood from a multidimensional niche space approach, the availability of foraging substrates can be a suitable and more proximate index of habitat quality for species with specialized habitat requirements, like woodpeckers that feed almost exclusively on larvae of wood-boring beetles in the trunks and branches of infested trees. Recent approaches use simple mathematical algorithms on spectral bands called Vegetation Indices (VI) to identify infestations, providing a new opportunity to assess habitat quality for woodpeckers. In this paper, we tested the ability of 102 VI to estimate tree attributes explaining habitat quality for Magellanic woodpeckers for its usage as a reliable foraging habitat quality estimator. We hypothesized that space use of Magellanic woodpeckers is positively associated with the spatial distribution of decayed trees in the landscape. We developed a methodological framework based on high-resolution, multispectral imagery with three basic steps. First, we mapped individual Nothofagus trees based on estimates of species composition from a supervised classification procedure, VI estimates and image segmentation. Second, we selected the best VI predicting the tree quality for Magellanic woodpeckers. Third, we tested these habitat quality predictors, the species composition and tree age, by using two Synoptic Models of Space Use (SMSU) of Magellanic woodpeckers based on very high-frequency (VHF) radio-telemetry and global positioning system (GPS) telemetry data.Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) showed that the VI that best predicted habitat quality at the tree-scale was the Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI, computed as [Red-Blue]/Red-edge), included in almost all the most parsimonious models. The most parsimonious SMSU included only PSRI as an independent covariate, with a strong positive relation. Although coefficient differences were found between telemetry data (VHF vs. GPS data) both showed a positive overall response. Consequently, Red-edge based PSRI can be considered a reliable estimator of tree-scale foraging habitat quality at landscape extents for future research and management activities including Magellanic woodpeckers living on heterogeneous Nothofagus forests.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this research it was studied a pluvi-fluviometric characterization and the flow rates changes of Femeas River basin located in Sao Desidorio (BA), considering the presence of a PCH and the cover soil alterations. Therefore the network stations of the Agencia Nacional de Aguas were selected to analyze the rainfalls and flows historical data (from 1985 to 2013); LandSat 5 and IRS-P6 (RESOURCESAT-1) satellite images of 1985, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2012 years were used for land cover classification in two classes: natural; and areas with anthropic influence, in whose regions there was some kind of use; and the changes in the median and average annual flows before and after the PCH installation were evaluated. The results of this research showed that the annual average flow data over the study period reduced in a magnitude higher than the annual average rainfall data. In relation to the soil land use, the anthropic area increased over time. With this study it was found that the presence of the PCH reservoir allowed a reduction in the maximum and minimum flow rates peak. It was observed that in the post-PCH period both average and median flow rate data were lower than that those measured in the pre-PCH period. Nevertheless, these results were influenced by the combination of the human activities that increased over time and the annual average rainfall data variation in the basin.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential of very high spatial resolution (VHSR) optical WorldView-2 (WV-2) and single-polarized TerraSAR-X (TSX) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data for an automated detection of different dwelling types in a refugee camp by means of object-based image analysis (OBIA). First, the optical data and SAR data are analyzed independently, and then a fusion of both data sets is performed applying two different approaches: 1) an overlay operation-based procedure integrating the independent results of the optical-and SAR-based dwelling detection, and 2) a feature-based analysis approach taking advantage of the conjoint analysis of both data sets. The results of the single-sensor and the data fusion approaches are evaluated in detail on the basis of object-based and area-based accuracy assessments. Advantages and limitations of the analysis approaches are discussed. The accuracy rates reveal that the use of optical satellite data shows promising results regardless of the dwelling material, while the SAR data are suitable for the detection of metal sheet dwellings only. In complex camp areas, with closely spaced containers, the results of the independent analyses can be improved significantly by the proposed fusion approaches. The combination of SAR and optical data allows for the separation of contiguous dwellings in cases this was not possible by the optical sensor information

T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance: Endometrial cancer (EMCA) is the most common gynecologic malignancy, with an estimated 54,000 new cases and 10,000 deaths in the United States in 2015. Lymph node metastasis is the most significant prognostic factor in EMCA. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has become a well-accepted procedure in surgical oncology and may strike a balance between the risks and benefits of lymphadenectomy.Objective: The aim of this study was to review the current literature regarding the history, techniques, and clinical application of SLN mapping in EMCA.Evidence Acquisition: Evidence was obtained through systematic literature review through PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov.Conclusions: Sentinel lymph node biopsy for EMCA is an accepted approach to the staging of this cancer; however, a consensus approach to the SLN biopsy technique and pathologic assessment is needed. Surgeons newly adopting the technique should proceed with caution and care to monitor outcomes.Target Audience: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physiciansLearning Objectives: After completing this activity, the learner should be better able to describe the importance of lymph node metastasis in EMCA prognosis, recognize the various techniques for SLN biopsy, describe the history of the SLN, and recognize the potential clinical application for SLN biopsy in the treatment of EMCA.

TI  - Implications of Sentinel Lymph Node Drainage to Multiple Basins in Head and Neck Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for head and neck melanoma is challenging due to unpredictable drainage. We sought to determine the frequency of drainage to multiple lymphatic basins and asked if this was associated with prognosis in a large, single-center cohort.We queried patients diagnosed with head and neck melanomas who had a SLNB performed from January 1998 to April 2016. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared using Student's t test, Pearson chi-square analysis, log-rank test, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, and Kaplan-Meier curves.We identified 269 patients with head and neck melanoma that had SLNBs performed in the following locations: 223 neck, 92 parotid/preauricular, 29 occipital/posterior auricular, 1 axilla. There were 68 (25%) patients who had drainage to multiple basins. These patients were similar to those with single basin drainage in age, gender distribution, Breslow depth, and percent with a positive SLNB (all p > 0.05). Fewer patients with drainage to multiple basins had a completion lymph node dissection (CLND, p = 0.03). A trend toward increased 3-year locoregional recurrence was seen for patients with drainage to multiple basins in univariate analysis (27% vs. 18%, p = 0.10) but was lost in multivariate analysis (p = 0.49), possibly because of higher recurrence rates in patients with positive nodes but no CLND (p = 0.02). No difference was detected for distant recurrence or overall survival based on SLN drainage.Head and neck melanoma SLNB drainage to multiple basins is common. Drainage to multiple basins does not seem to be associated with increased sentinel lymph node positivity, locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, or survival.

TI  - FY2015 Technical Report: Lost River Sucker Fry Sentinel Survival in Upper Klamath Lake (July - September 2015).
T2  - Arcata Fisheries Technical Report
M3  - Article
AB  - Survival and tissue responses were evaluated in 10 sentinel groups of Lost River sucker fry (Deltistes luxatus) exposed at 4 locations (North Lake, Hank's Marsh, Sucker Springs and South Lake) in Upper Klamath Lake 14July - 22September 2015. Triplicate sentinel net pens were sampled every 7 days. Throughout the study, 18 - 36 mm sentinel fry had high survival after mock transport and 7d confinement in a net pen held within a wetlab tank. A low overall cumulative mortality of 16% was observed amongst all exposure groups (369/2380). Seven of the forty groups had cumulative mortality >= 25% with hypoxia associated with one of the affected groups. No parasites were observed in histological sections of sentinel survivors, however, some fry had liver abnormalities suggestive of hepatotoxin exposure. A Bayesian generalized linear mixed effects model indicated that increased temperatures decrease the probability of survival, with each 2.5 [degree]C increase in temperature decreasing survival by 47%. Additionally, the model indicated that each day over pH10 decreases survival by 38%. Warm alkaline conditions are typical of Upper Klamath Lake during the summer and are associated with cyanobacteria blooms. The effects of pH and temperature are likely correlative to mortality but not causal.

TI  - Increasing dissolved organic carbon concentrations in northern boreal lakes: Implications for lake water transparency and thermal structure
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated trends in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and associated changes in water transparency and epilimnion thickness to better understand the implications of regional increases in DOC concentration in lakes. Long-term monitoring of a suite of physical, chemical, and biological data from six to 12 lakes in Acadia National Park in Maine was paired with high-frequency sensor monitoring of one lake as a model system. Water transparency declined across study sites since 1995 as DOC increased and chlorophyll remained stable, suggesting that this was not a signal of increased eutrophication. As clarity declined, some lakes experienced reduced epilimnion thickness. The degree to which transparency changed across the lakes was dependent on DOC concentration, with a larger decline in transparency occurring in clear water lakes (-0.3myr(-1)) than brown water lakes (-0.1myr(-1)). DOC concentration was an important explanatory variable for reduced epilimnion thickness in short-term sensor measurements. A regional decline in water transparency across all lakes and reduction in epilimnion thickness in a limited number of systems appeared to be acting as a sentinel for changes in atmospheric deposition and regional weather that modified the delivery of DOC from the watershed.

TI  - Variability of Cloudiness over Mountain Terrain in the Western United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the spatial and temporal variability of cloudiness across mountain zones in the western United States. Daily average cloud albedo is derived from a 19-yr series (1996-2014) of half-hourly Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) images. During springtime when incident radiation is active in driving snowmelt-runoff processes, the magnitude of daily cloud variations can exceed 50% of long-term averages. Even when aggregated over 3-month periods, cloud albedo varies by +/- 10% of long-term averages in many locations. Rotated empirical orthogonal functions (REOFs) of daily cloud albedo anomalies over high-elevation regions of the western conterminous United States identify distinct regional patterns, wherein the first five REOFs account for; similar to 67% of the total variance. REOF1 is centered over Northern California and Oregon and is pronounced between November and March. REOF2 is centered over the interior northwest and is accentuated between March and July. Each of the REOF/rotated principal components (RPC) modes associates with anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and one or more large-scale teleconnection indices (Arctic Oscillation, Nino-3.4, and Pacific-North American), which helps to explain why anomalous cloudiness patterns take on regional spatial scales and contain substantial variability over seasonal time scales.

TI  - Quantifying Sub-Pixel Surface Water Coverage in Urban Environments Using Low-Albedo Fraction from Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of mixed pixels negatively affects the delineation of accurate surface water in Landsat Imagery. Linear spectral unmixing has been demonstrated to be a powerful technique for extracting surface materials at a sub-pixel scale. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an innovative low albedo fraction (LAF) method based on the idea of unconstrained linear spectral unmixing. The LAF stands on the "High Albedo-Low Albedo-Vegetation" model of spectral unmixing analysis in urban environments, and investigates the urban surface water extraction problem with the low albedo fraction map. Three experiments are carefully designed using Landsat TM/ETM+ images on the three metropolises of Wuhan, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in China, and per-pixel and sub-pixel accuracies are estimated. The results are compared against extraction accuracies from three popular water extraction methods including the normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and automated water extraction index (AWEI). Experimental results show that LAF achieves a better accuracy when extracting urban surface water than both MNDWI and AWEI do, especially in boundary mixed pixels. Moreover, the LAF has the smallest threshold variations among the three methods, and the fraction threshold of 1 is a proper choice for LAF to obtain good extraction results. Therefore, the LAF is a promising approach for extracting urban surface water coverage.

TI  - Novel bright-emission small-molecule NIR-II fluorophores for <i>in vivo</i> tumor imaging and image-guided surgery
T2  - CHEMICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Though high brightness and biocompatible small NIR-II dyes are highly desirable in clinical or translational cancer research, their fluorescent cores are relatively limited and their synthetic processes are somewhat complicated. Herein, we have explored the design and synthesis of novel NIR-II fluorescent materials (H1) without tedious chromatographic isolation with improved fluorescence performance (QY approximate to 2%) by introducing 2-amino 9,9-dialkyl-substituted fluorene as a donor into the backbone. Several types of water-soluble and biocompatible NIR-II probes: SXH, SDH, and H1 NPs were constructed via different chemical strategies based on H1, and then their potential to be used in in vivo tumor imaging and image-guided surgery in the NIR-II region was explored. High levels of uptake were obtained for both passive and active tumor targeting probes SXH and SDH. Furthermore, high resolution imaging of blood vessels on tumors and the whole body of living mice using H1 NPs for the first time has demonstrated precise NIR-II image-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery.

TI  - Role of infectious disease information system and risk assessment in control of livestock diseases in Indian perspectives: A review
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many livestock diseases have a severe impact on the country's economic status. Diseases cause highly destructive epidemics. It imposes severe consequences, especially in the areas of densely populated livestock. Infectious Disease Informatics, an emerging field of study, involves information management in a systematic way and analysis of issues related to infectious disease detection, prevention and management. Surveillance and awareness are the two essential phenomenon to be adapted, so that the early detection of disease outbreaks is possible and rapid control measures are schemed to prevent further spread of the disease. Recent advances in disease surveillance system, information technology and epidemiological modelling have raised the expectations on the early warning systems as they are not only sensible but also necessary tools to combat the re-occurrence and spread of infectious diseases. The evolution of remote sensing instrumentation, GIS technology and their application and evaluation of satellite data to the issues of disease risk prediction are reviewed and discussed. The importance of risk assessment and disease risk prediction in livestock epidemiology has been illustrated with example case studies. An overview of the types of epidemiological studies, various sampling techniques and the role of meta-analysis in livestock disease informatics has been specified. The paper also focuses on the techniques being developed for infectious disease risk prediction in both space and time.

TI  - Mapping of heavy metal pollution in river water at daily time-scale using spatio-temporal fusion of MODIS-aqua and Landsat satellite imageries
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For river water quality monitoring at 30m x 1-day spatio-temporal scales, a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is developed for estimating turbidity (T-u), total suspended solid (TSS), and six heavy metals (HV) of iron, zinc, copper, chromium, lead and cadmium, by blending the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat (L-s) spectral bands. A combination of regression analysis and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques are applied to develop spectral relationships between Tu-L5, TSS-T,, and each HV-TSS. The STARFM algorithm and all the developed relationship models are evaluated satisfactorily by various performance evaluation measures to develop heavy metal pollution index-based vulnerability maps at 1-km resolution in the Brahmani River in eastern India. The Monte-Carlo simulation based analysis of the developed formulations reveals that the uncertainty in estimating Zn and Cd is the minimum (1.04%) and the maximum (5.05%), respectively. Hence, the remote sensing based approach developed herein can effectively be used in many world rivers for real-time monitoring of heavy metal pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-temporal Forest Cover Change and Forest Density Trend Detection in a Mediterranean Environment
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of forests along with the various types of shrubs in the Mediterranean region is seen as an important driver of climate change and has been repeatedly related with the observed land degradation and desertification in the region. Nevertheless, the extent of woody perennial vegetation cover (WPVC) and its density remain largely unclear. Here, we apply a series of algorithms and methods operationally used in Australia for large-scale WPVC mapping and monitoring and demonstrate their applicability in the Mediterranean region using a Spanish area as the trial site. Five Landsat TM and ETM+ images from various dates spanning 14years are used to map changes in the extent of WPVC and to identify areas with a declining, stabilising or recovering trend. Results show that the applied methodology, which incorporates (i) pre-processing of the Landsat imagery, (ii) a canonical variate analysis to spectrally discriminate between woody and non-woody land cover types, (iii) a conditional probability network and (iv) spectral indices for mapping woody cover and density trend, is highly successful and well suited for use in Mediterranean environments. A rigorous accuracy assessment is undertaken producing overall accuracies above 97% for both woody and non-woody cover types and all dates. Results also show that in the area of study, the majority of WPVC disturbances were due to forest fires, which represent the region's most frequent natural and anthropogenic disturbance. This raises significant concerns about the future of the area's WPVC. Regeneration compensated to some degree for the high disturbance rates. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Precipitation Identification with Bispectral Satellite Information Using Deep Learning Approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the development of a satellite-based precipitation product, two important aspects are sufficient precipitation information in the satellite-input data and proper methodologies, which are used to extract such information and connect it to precipitation estimates. In this study, the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) approaches to extract useful features from bispectral satellite information, infrared (IR), and water vapor (WV) channels, and to produce rain/no-rain (R/NR) detection is explored. To verify the methodologies, two models are designed and evaluated: the first model, referred to as the DL-IR only method, applies deep learning approaches to the IR data only; the second model, referred to as the DL-IR1WV method, incorporates WV data to further improve the precipitation identification performance. The radar stage IV data are the reference data used as ground observation. The operational product, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS), serves as a baseline model with which to compare the performances. The experiments show significant improvement for both models in R/NR detection. The overall performance gains in the critical success index (CSI) are 21.60% and 43.66% over the verification periods for the DL-IR only model and the DL-IR1WV model compared to PERSIANN-CCS, respectively. In particular, the performance gains in CSI are as high as 46.51% and 94.57% for the models for the winter season. Moreover, specific case studies show that the deep learning techniques and the WV channel information effectively help recover a large number of missing precipitation pixels under warm clouds while reducing false alarms under cold clouds.

TI  - Antiemetic use among pregnant women in the United States: the escalating use of ondansetron
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo examine ondansetron use in pregnancy in the context of other antiemetic use among a large insured United States population of women delivering live births.MethodsWe assessed ondansetron and other antiemetic use among pregnant women delivering live births between 2001 and 2015 in 15 data partners contributing data to the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database. We identified live birth pregnancies using a validated algorithm, and all forms of ondansetron and other available antiemetics were identified using National Drug Codes or procedure codes. We assessed the prevalence of antiemetic use by trimester, calendar year, and formulation.ResultsIn over 2.3 million pregnancies, the prevalence of ondansetron, promethazine, metoclopramide, or doxylamine/pyridoxine use anytime in pregnancy was 15.2, 10.3, 4.0, and 0.4%, respectively. Ondansetron use increased from <1% of pregnancies in 2001 to 22.2% in 2014, with much of the increase attributable to oral ondansetron beginning in 2006. Promethazine and metoclopramide use increased modestly between 2001 (13.8%, 3.2%) and 2006 (16.0%, 6.0%) but decreased annually through 2014 (8.0%, 3.2%). Doxylamine/pyridoxine, approved for management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy in 2013, was used in 1.8% of pregnancies in 2014. For all antiemetics, use was highest in the first trimester.ConclusionsWe observed a marked increase in ondansetron use by study year, prescribed to nearly one-quarter of insured pregnant women in 2014, occurring in conjunction with decreased use of promethazine and metoclopramide. Given the widespread use of ondansetron in pregnancy, data establishing product efficacy and methodologically rigorous evaluation of post-marketing safety are needed. Published 2017.

TI  - Breast conserving surgery and locoregional control after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - The management of breast malignancy and the role of neoadjuvant systemic therapy has continued to evolve over the past 50 years. Survival equivalence with adjuvant systemic therapy is well accepted and demonstrated in several clinical trials. However, strong association with survival outcome and pathologic complete response emerged. Assessment of tumor response, as a surrogate for outcome, continues to be a driver for neoadjuvant therapy with increased applicability in the setting of sophisticated understanding and implications of breast tumor biology and molecular subtype. Furthermore, tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy can significantly impact local regional therapy decision-making by down-staging disease without compromising local regional control. This includes facilitation of breast conserving surgery and increased eligibility for limited axillary surgery in selected patients. Furthermore, the omission of surgery in the setting of exceptional response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the ultimate breast conserving strategy, is being actively studied. With further refinement of systemic and targeted therapies, neoadjuvant systemic therapy continues to provide a robust mechanism for innovation in local regional management paradigms with increased attention to individualized breast oncologic care.

TI  - Mapping Thermokarst Lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Using Nonlocal Active Contours in Chinese GaoFen-2 Multispectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to monitor the response of thermokarst lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) to rapid climatic changes and human activities, an automated method for extracting shorelines from Chinese GaoFen-2 (GF-2) imagery is proposed. First, the water index (WI) images and the potential lake areas are calculated from the preprocessed multispectral imagery and digital elevation model data, respectively. Second, the initial segmentation obtained by global thresholding of theWI images and masking in the potential lake areas are used to implement the contour initialization of active contours models efficiently. Finally, the nonlocal active contours (NLAC) approach is applied to refine the initial segmentation of the WI images, and the final shoreline vector files are produced by some simple and automatic postprocessing steps. Experiments on theGF-2 imagery demonstrate that 1) by exploiting the capability ofWI to locate the approximate shoreline effectively around the evolving contour, the processing time of the proposed method can be saved significantly; 2) the NLAC approach can efficiently identify the shoreline by integrating the nonlocal interactions between pairs of patches inside and outside the lake; and 3) the proposed method can conveniently adapt to the multitemporal and multifeature image analysis. Using the manual digitized shorelines as the reference data, an average error of less than one pixel with standard deviation of 0.1320 can be obtained. These results prove that the proposed method is feasible for the identification and monitoring of thermokarst lakes on the QTP.

TI  - Detecting Damaged Building Regions Based on Semantic Scene Change from Multi-Temporal High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of damaged building regions is crucial to emergency response actions and rescue work after a disaster. Change detection methods using multi-temporal remote sensing images are widely used for this purpose. Differing from traditional methods based on change detection for damaged building regions, semantic scene change can provide a new point of view since it can indicate the land-use variation at the semantic level. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for detecting damaged building regions based on semantic scene change in a visual Bag-of-Words model. Pre- and post-disaster scene change in building regions are represented by a uniform visual codebook frequency. The scene change of damaged and non-damaged building regions is discriminated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. An evaluation of experimental results, for a selected study site of the Longtou hill town of Yunnan, China, which was heavily damaged in the Ludian earthquake of 14 March 2013, shows that this method is feasible and effective for detecting damaged building regions. For the experiments, WorldView-2 optical imagery and aerial imagery is used.

TI  - Identifying the Lambertian Property of Ground Surfaces in the Thermal Infrared Region via Field Experiments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lambertian surfaces represent an important assumption when constructing thermal radiance transfer equations for remote sensing observations of ground surface temperatures. We identify the properties of ground surfaces in thermal infrared regions as Lambertian surfaces via field experiments. Because Lambertian surfaces present homogeneous thermal emissions levels in hemispheric directions for a specific ground surface under specific kinetic temperatures and emissions, we conducted a series of field experiments to illustrate the properties of such ground surfaces. Four typical ground surfaces were selected for the experiments to observe thermal emissions: bare soil, grass, water, and concrete. Radiance thermometers were used to observe ground emissions from seven directions: 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, 135 degrees, and 150 degrees. Solar zenith angles were considered for the observation of ground emissions. Experiments were conducted in five different regions of China (Beijing, Nanjing, Xilinguole, Yongzhou, and Jiangmen) during both daytime and nighttime. To determine whether different observation angles have significantly different effects on radiance, statistical analyses (ANOVA and Friedman test) were conducted. Post hoc multiple comparison tests and pairwise multiple comparisons were also conducted to examine the various pairings of observation angles and to measure the radiance differences. Roughly half of the radiance groups of all observed sites were tested via an ANOVA, and the remaining groups with unequal variances were subjected to the Friedman test. The results indicate that statistically significant differences in the radiance levels occurred among the seven angles for almost all of the sites (39 of the 40 groups). The results of our experiments indicate that the selected ground surfaces, especially the grass and the bare soil, may not behave with Lambertian properties in the thermal infrared region. This is probably attributed to the roughness of the selected surface, because we found that roughness is an important factor affecting the observed magnitude of thermal emission from different directions of the ground surface under study. Therefore, whether or not a terrestrial surface can be assumed to be a Lambertian surface should be based on their geometric structure. When the surface is relatively smooth, we can say that it is close to the Lambertian property in thermal emission.

TI  - Does Axillary Reverse Mapping Prevent Lymphedema After Lymphadenectomy?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We hypothesized that disconcerting lymphedema rates in both sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may be because of unrecognized vunerable variations in arm lymphatic drainage within the axilla. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) facilitates identification and avoidance of arm lymphatics within the axilla and its use may reduce lymphedema.Methods: This institutional review board-approved study from June 2007 to December 2013 involved patients undergoing SLNB with or without ALND, or ALND alone. Technetium is injected subareolarly for localization of the breast SLN and isosulfan blue dye (5 mL) is injected in the ipsilateral upper arm for localization of nonbreast lymphatics. Data were collected on identification and preservation of arm lymphatics, crossover rates, blue node metastases, axillary recurrence, and lymphedema as measured by volume displacement.Results: A total of 654 patients prospectively underwent 685 ARM procedures with a SLNB and/or ALND. Objective lymphedema rates for SLNB and ALND were 0.8% and 6.5% respectively, with 26-month median follow up. Blue lymphatics were identified in 29.2% (138/472) of SLNB and 71.8% (153/213) of ALND. Crossover was seen in 3.8% (18/472) of SLNB and 5.6% (12/213) of ALND. Blue node metastases rate was 4.5% (2/44). Axillary recurrence rate was 0.2% and 1.4% for SLNB and ALND, respectively.Conclusions: ARM allows frequent identification of arm lymphatics in the axilla, which would have been transected during routine surgery. Rates of metastases in noncrossover nodes and axillary recurrences are low. Lymphedema rates are dramatically reduced using ARM when compared with accepted standards.

TI  - Circulation of Zoonotic Arboviruses in Equine Populations of Mallorca Island (Spain)
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of major arbovirus vector species, climate change that promotes the expansion and increase of their populations, and potential animal reservoirs mean that vector-borne diseases represent a significant health risk for Mallorca's inhabitants. Microbiological monitoring of circulating arboviruses, particularly flaviviruses causing encephalitis, was initiated using domestic horses from localities near wetlands as sentinel hosts. A total of 291 blood samples were taken from 172 horses between 2011 and 2012, using paired samples to highlight seroconversion events. A multiplex immunoassay and confirmatory reference serological assays were used to screen sera for immunoglobulin G antibodies against West Nile (WNV), Usutu (USUV), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses. The seroprevalence was 6.4% (confidence interval [95% CI] 3.2%-11.0%) for WNV, 1.2% (95% CI 0.1%-4.1%) for USUV, and 0.6% (95% CI 0.0%-3.2%) for TBEV. In addition, eight horses (4.6%; 95% CI 2.0%-8.9%) were found positive for unidentified flaviviruses. Seroconversion events were detected for WNV and USUV, reflecting recent arboviral infections. These results highlight the active transmission of zoonotic arboviruses in Mallorca wetlands.

TI  - Control of Mosquito-Borne Diseases in Northwestern Italy: Preparedness from One Season to the Next
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) are spreading worldwide due to globalization and climate change, representing a threat for both humans and animals. Of great concern are the infections caused by viruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus as West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) transmitted by Culex sp. or Dengue virus and Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes sp. This work describes the surveillance protocol enforced in Piedmont (Northwestern Italy) to control MBDs spread, focusing on the activities performed on mosquitoes during the 2015 vector season. Materials and Methods: From July to October, mosquitoes were fortnightly sampled in 50 selected sites according to risk factors with CDC dry ice-baited traps and BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure and dry ice. Adults were counted, identified to species level, pooled, and screened for flaviviruses using different reverse transcription-PCR protocols and sequencing. Finally, phylogenetic analysis was performed on a dataset including 2014 and 2015 WNV sequences and reference sequences retrieved from GenBank. Results and Discussion: A total of 17,000 mosquitoes, grouped in 730 pools, were tested. Five pools of Culex pipiens were positive for WNV Lineage 2 in Novara, Alessandria, Vercelli, and Torino Provinces. One pool of C. pipiens and one pool of Anopheles maculipennis s.l. were positive for USUV in Vercelli and Alessandria Provinces. In Vercelli Province one pool of C. pipiens resulted positive both for WNV and USUV. Control measures were quickly implemented. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the WNV Lin 2 sequences from Piedmont region cluster with those circulating in Northeastern Italy in the previous years. Given the positive trend in WNV activity compared to 2014 and the emergence caused by other flavivirus as ZIKV, the level of attention for the 2016 vector season may be increased and this surveillance protocol could represent an important tool for public health authorities.

TI  - Evaluation of CLASS Snow Simulation over Eastern Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS), version 3.6.1, was run offline for the period 1990-2011 over a domain centered on eastern Canada, driven by atmospheric forcing data dynamically downscaled from ERA-Interim using the Canadian Regional Climate Model. The precipitation inputs were adjusted to replicate the monthly average precipitation reported in the CRU observational database. The simulated fractional snow cover and the surface albedo were evaluated using NOAA Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System and MODIS data, and the snow water equivalent was evaluated using CMC, Global Snow Monitoring for Climate Research (GlobSnow), and Hydro-Quebec products. The modeled fractional snow cover agreed well with the observational estimates. The albedo of snow-covered areas showed a bias of up to -0.15 in boreal forest regions, owing to neglect of subgrid-scale lakes in the simulation. In June, conversely, there was a positive albedo bias in the remaining snow-covered areas, likely caused by neglect of impurities in the snow. The validation of the snow water equivalent was complicated by the fact that the three observation-based datasets differed widely. Also, the downward adjustment of the forcing precipitation clearly resulted in a low snow bias in some regions. However, where the density of the observations was high, the CLASS snow model was deemed to have performed well. Sensitivity tests confirmed the satisfactory behavior of the current parameterizations of snow thermal conductivity, snow albedo refreshment threshold, and limiting snow depth and underlined the importance of snow interception by vegetation. Overall, the study demonstrated the necessity of using a wide variety of observation-based datasets for model validation.

TI  - Surface movement above old coal longwalls after mine closure
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although most subsidence occurs in the months and years after mining by the longwall method, surface movement is still occurring many decades after the mining. The aim of the study is to quantify the long term behavior. Satellite data (radar-interferometry) were analyzed to study an area of about 2 km(2) during the 18 years following the closure of the underground infrastructure and the flooding of the underground workings and rock mass. It was observed that, on average, a residual downward movement took place till 7-12 years after the closure, followed by a clear uplift. However, the first signs of an uplift occurred in certain sub-areas 3-4 years after the closure. Zones within the area studied were identified with either larger or smaller movements. However, the spatial variation of the surface subsidence or uplift could not be directly explained by the characteristics of mining.

TI  - Impact of treatments for recycled broiler litter on the viability and infectivity of microorganisms
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The microbiological risk of recycled litter depends on the efficacy of the management system applied to inactivate residual microorganisms and preserve the health of the successive broiler flock. This study aimed to assess the viability and infectivity of the Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV) and Salmonella Heidelberg in recycled litter exposed to different treatments. The litter was contaminated with microorganisms and submitted to the treatments (T): T1 : shallow fermentation; T2: quicklime (calcium oxide); T3: shallow fermentation followed by addition of quicklime; T4: no treatment. Sentinel chicks housed on the treated litter showed that T1 and T3 inactivated residual IBDV. Analysis of the litter subjected to T1 also showed reduced levels of total enterobacteria. T2 was not able to reduce the microorganisms assessed and its association with T1 (T3) failed to enhance the effect of the treatment. NDV did not survive in the broiler litter, regardless of the treatment applied, and it was also not detected in the sentinel chicks. S. Heidelberg remained viable in the litter submitted to all studied treatments, being isolated from the sentinel chicks of all the experimental groups. The antimicrobial activity of T1 and T3 was associated to higher ammonia contents in the broiler litter. The results indicate that the shallow fermentation treatment is efficient for controlling residual IBDV and total enterobacteria in the recycled litter. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a novel methodology for generating 15-day, smoothed and gap-filled time series of high spatial resolution data. The approach is based on templates from high quality observations to fill data gaps that are subsequently filtered. We tested our method for one large contiguous area (Bavaria, Germany) and for nine smaller test sites in different ecoregions of Europe using Landsat data. Overall, our results match the validation dataset to a high degree of accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 for visible bands, 0.03 for near-infrared and 0.02 for short-wave-infrared. Occasionally, the reconstructed time series are affected by artefacts due to undetected clouds. Less frequently, larger uncertainties occur as a result of extended periods of missing data. Reliable cloud masks are highly warranted for making full use of time series. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Remotely Sensed Evapotranspiration to Infer Information about Hydrological Behaviour in a Data-Scarce Region
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the hydrological behaviour of a river basin prior to setting up, calibrating and validating a distributed hydrological model requires extensive datasets that are hardly available for many parts of the world due to insufficient monitoring networks. In this study, the focus was on prevailing spatio-temporal patterns of remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) that enabled conclusions to be drawn about the hydrological behaviour and spatial peculiarities of a river basin at rather high spatial resolution. The prevailing spatio-temporal patterns of ET were identified using a principal component analysis of a time series of 644 images of MODIS ET covering the Wami River basin (Tanzania) between the years 2000 and 2013. The time series of the loadings on the principal components were analysed for seasonality and significant long-term trends. The spatial patterns of principal component scores were tested for significant correlation with elevations and slopes, and for differences between different soil texture and land use classes. The results inferred that the temporal and spatial patterns of ET were related to those of preceding rainfalls. At the end of the dry season, high ET was maintained only in areas of shallow groundwater and in cloud forest nature reserves. A region of clear reduction of ET in the long-term was related to massive land use change. The results also confirmed that most soil texture and land use classes differed significantly. Moreover, ET was exceptionally high in natural forests and loam soil, and very low in bushland and sandy-loam soil. Clearly, this approach has shown great potential of publicly available remote sensing data in providing a sound basis for water resources management as well as for distributed hydrological models in data-scarce river basins at lower latitudes.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is a crop of global importance. To predict the area of paddy rice and thus its production, it draws great attraction of using data mining approaches on remote sensing data, which are well accepted. Many approaches based on supervised and unsupervised learning techniques have been developed over the years. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm with a clustering technique is one of the most popular swarm-based algorithms. In this study, ABC algorithm is used to perform the rice image classification based on remote sensing imagery. This study comprises two stages. In the first part of the study, the ancillary information composed from the original spectra is applied to increase the performance of classification. As the other parts of the study, an efficient unsupervised classifier is developed to evaluate the performance of the incorporated ancillary information. This study integrates the ABC algorithm into a clustering process to build a land cover classifier system. On the other hand, a parallel approach using ant colony optimization (ACO) is studied for comparison. Two significant contributions are presented in this study: (1) a paddy rice image classifier is built with ABC algorithm and (2) the outcome of classifier using ABC algorithm outperforms that using ACO algorithm.

TI  - Impacts of wildfires on interannual trends in land surface phenology: an investigation of the Hayman Fire
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) derived from satellite data has been widely associated with recent global climate change. However, LSP is frequently influenced by land disturbances, which significantly limits our understanding of the phenological trends driven by climate change. Because wildfire is one of the most significant disturbance agents, we investigated the influences of wildfire on the start of growing season (SOS) and the interannual trends of SOS in the Hayman Fire area that occurred in 2002 in Colorado using time series of daily MODIS data (2001-2014). Results show that the Hayman Fire advanced the area-integrated SOS by 15.2 d and converted SOS from a delaying trend of 3.9 d/decade to an advancing trend of -1.9 d/decade during 2001-2014. The fire impacts on SOS increased from low burn severity to high burn severity. Moreover, the rate of increase of annual maximum and minimum EVI2 from 2003-2014 reflects that vegetation greenness could recover to pre-fire status in 2022 and 2053, respectively, which suggests that the fire impacts on the satellite-derived SOS variability and the interannual trends should continue in the next few decades.

TI  - Little impact of the Three Gorges Dam on recent decadal lake decline across China's Yangtze Plain
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ubiquitous lakes across China's Yangtze Plain (YP) are indispensable freshwater resources sustaining ecosystems and socioeconomics for nearly half a billion people. Our recent survey revealed a widespread net decline in the total YP lake inundation area during 2000-2011 (a cumulative decrease of approximate to 10%), yet its mechanism remained contentious. Here we uncover the impacts of climate variability and anthropogenic activities including (i) Yangtze flow and sediment alterations by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and (ii) human water consumption in agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors throughout the downstream Yangtze Basin. Results suggest that climate variability is the dominant driver of this decadal lake decline, whereas studied human activities, despite varying seasonal impacts that peak in fall, contribute marginal fraction (approximate to 10-20% or less) to the interannual lake area decrease. Given that the TGD impacts on the total YP lake area and its seasonal variation are both under approximate to 5%, we also dismiss the speculation that the TGD might be responsible for evident downstream climate change by altering lake surface extent and thus open water evaporation. Nevertheless, anthropogenic impacts exhibited a strengthening trend during the past decade. Although the TGD has reached its full-capacity water regulation, the negative impacts of human water consumption and TGD-induced net channel erosion, which are already comparable to that of TGD's flow regulation, may continue to grow as crucial anthropogenic factors to future YP lake conservation.

TI  - Assessing Re-Composition of Xing'an Larch in Boreal Forests after the 1987 Fire, Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Xing'an larch, a deciduous coniferous species, is the zonal tree of the Greater Xing'an Mountains in Northeast China. In May 1987, a catastrophic fire broke out in the mountains and burned 1.3 million hectares of forests in 26 days. While studies have shown that forest greenness has come back to normal in certain years, the re-composition of this zonal species has not been studied after the 1987 fire. With a series of Landsat 8 OLI images acquired in 2013-2015, this study builds the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Vegetation Index (GVI) time series in a complete growing cycle. A decision tree is developed to classify tree species with an overall accuracy of 86.16% and Kappa coefficient of 0.80. The re-composition of Xing'an larch after the 1987 fire is extracted, and its variations in areas under different fire intensities are statistically analyzed. Results show that Xing'an larch comprises 17.52%, 26.20% and 33.19% of forests in burned areas with high, medium and low fire intensities, respectively. Even around 30 years after the 1987 fire, the composition of this zonal species in boreal forest has not been fully recovered in the Greater Xing'an Mountains. The Xing'an larch map extracted in this study could serve as base information for ecological and environmental studies in this south end of the boreal Eurasia.

TI  - Quantifying Changes of Villages in the Urbanizing Beijing Metropolitan Region: Integrating Remote Sensing and GIS Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has resulted in great changes in rural landscapes globally. Using remote sensing data to quantify the distribution of rural settlements and their changes has received increasing attention in the past three decades, but remains a challenge. Previous studies mostly focused on the residential changes within a grid or administrative boundary, but not at the individual village level. This paper presents a new change detection approach for rural residential settlements, which can identify different types of rural settlement changes at the individual village level by integrating remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) analyses. Using multi-temporal Landsat TM image data, this approach classifies villages into five types: "no change", "totally lost", "shrinking", "expanding", and "merged", in contrast to the commonly used "increase" and "decrease". This approach was tested in the Beijing metropolitan area from 1984 to 2010. Additionally, the drivers of such changes were investigated using multinomial logistic regression models. The results revealed that: (1) 36% of the villages were lost, but the total area of developed lands in existing villages increased by 34%; (2) Changes were dominated by the type of 'expansion' in 1984-1990 (accounted for 43.42%) and 1990-2000 (56.21%). However, from 2000 to 2010, 49.73% of the villages remained unchanged; (3) Both topographical factors and distance factors had significant effects on whether the villages changed or not, but their impacts changed through time. The topographical driving factors showed decreasing effects on the loss of rural settlements, while distance factors had increasing impacts on settlement expansion and merging. This approach provides a useful tool for better understanding the changes in rural residential settlements and their associations with urbanization.

TI  - Evaluation of the Latest MODIS GPP Products across Multiple Biomes Using Global Eddy Covariance Flux Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest MODIS GPP (gross primary productivity) product, MOD17A2H, has great advantages over the previous version, MOD17A2, because the resolution increased from 1000 m to 500 m. In this study, MOD17A2H GPP was assessed using the latest eddy covariance (EC) flux data (FLUXNET2015 Dataset) at eighteen sites in six ecosystems across the globe. The sensitivity of MOD17A2H GPP to the meteorology dataset and the fractional photosynthetically-active radiation (FPAR) product was explored by introducing site meteorology observations and improved Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) products. The results showed that MOD17A2H GPP underestimated flux-derived GPP at most sites. Its performance in estimating annual GPP was poor (R-2 = 0.62) and even worse over eight days (R-2 = 0.52). For the MOD17A2H algorithm, replacing the reanalysis meteorological datasets with the site meteorological measurements failed to improve the estimation accuracies. However, great improvements in estimating the site-based GPP were gained by replacing MODIS FPAR with GLASS FPAR. This indicated that in the existing MOD17A2H product, the errors were originated more from FPAR than the meteorological data. We further examined the potential error contributions from land cover classification and maximum light use efficiency (epsilon(max)). It was found that the current land cover classification scheme exhibited frequent misclassification errors. Moreover, the epsilon(max) value assigned in MOD17A2H was much smaller than the inferred epsilon(max) value. Therefore, the qualities of FPAR and land cover classification datasets should be upgraded, and the epsilon(max) value needs to be adjusted to provide more accurate GPP estimates using MOD17A2H for global ecosystems.

TI  - Multi-scale modeling of Earth's gravity field in space and time
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2002, the GRACE mission has been providing an unprecedented view of the Earth's gravity field spatial and temporal variations. The gravity field models built from these satellite data are essential in order to study the mass redistributions within the Earth system. Often, they are modelled using spatial functions, such as spherical harmonics, averaged over a fixed time window. However, the satellite sampling naturally leads to a trade-off between the achievable spatial and temporal resolutions. In addition, the gravity variations are made of local components in space and time, reflecting the superimposition of sources. With the final aim to better estimate gravity variations related to local processes at different spatial and temporal scales, and adapt the temporal resolution of the model to its spatial resolution, we present an attempt at 4D gravity field modelling using localized functions in space and time. For that, we develop a four-dimensional wavelet basis, well localized in space and time and orthogonal in time. We then analyze the inverse problem of 4D gravity field estimation from GRACE synthetic inter-satellites potential differences along the orbit, and its regularization in a Bayesian framework, using a prior knowledge on the mass sources. We then test our approach in a simplified synthetic test setting, where only one mass source is present: hydrological mass variations over Africa during the year 2005. Applying a purely regional approach, we are able to reconstruct, regionally, the water height signal with a approximate to 2.5 cm accuracy at 450 km, 21 days resolution. We test the influence of the geophysical prior on, this result, and conclude that it cannot explain alone the residuals between original and reconstructedmass signal. redln contrast, an ideal test case with a perfect adequacy between the 4D basis and the synthetic data, without approximations nor regularization in solving the normal system, leads to a significantly improved reconstruction of large-scale, seasonal water variations, at the millimetric level of a few % of relative accuracy. The performances of the regional test are likely significantly limited by the block-diagonal approximation of the normal system and the scales selection in the regional 4D basis.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of snow cover retrieved from NOAA-AVHRR LTDR: a case study in the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays an important role in hydrological processes and seasonal water balance. Especially in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), snow cover is an important source of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Lancang River (SRYYL), which greatly influences regional water balance. In this study, we quantified the temporal trend and spatial variation of snow cover across the TP by calibrating and developing the Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Long Term Data Record (LTDR)-derived snow cover products during 1982-2011. We also examined the relationship of snow cover with temperature and precipitation over the TP during 1982-2011. The results indicate that seasonal snow cover generally starts to accumulate from central plateau in October, while significant melting starts to occur from the southeastern plateau in May of following year. The long-term variability of snow cover is characterized by the tendency for a slight decrease in the mean snow coverage during the period of hydrological year (HY) 1982-1993 and a slight increase from HY2001 to 2011, but the total snow cover area remains relatively stable over the past 30 years. The results also show that temperature plays a critical role in controlling the snow cover days.

TI  - Validation of VIIRS AOD through a Comparison with a Sun Photometer and MODIS AODs over Wuhan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a next-generation polar-orbiting operational environmental sensor with a capability for global aerosol observations. A comprehensive validation of VIIRS products is significant for improving product quality, assessing environment quality for human life, and studying regional climate change. In this study, three-year (from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016) records of VIIRS Intermediate Product (IP) data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals on aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm were evaluated by comparing them to ground sun photometer measurements over Wuhan. Results indicated that VIIRS IP retrievals were underestimated by 5% for the city. A comparison of VIIRS IP retrievals and ground sun photometer measurements showed a lower R-2 of 0.55 (0.79 for Terra-MODIS and 0.76 for Aqua-MODIS), with only 52% of retrievals falling within the expected error range established by MODIS over land (i.e., +/-(0.05 + 0.15AOD)). Bias analyses with different angstrom ngstrom exponents (AE) demonstrated that land aerosol model selection of the VIIRS retrieval over Wuhan was appropriate. However, the larger standard deviations (i.e., uncertainty) of VIIRS AODs than MODIS AODs could be attributed to the less robust retrieval algorithm. Monthly variations displayed largely underestimated AODs of VIIRS in winter, which could be caused by a large positive bias in surface reflectance estimation due to the sparse vegetation and greater surface brightness of Wuhan in this season. The spatial distribution of VIIRS and MODIS AOD observations revealed that the VIIRS IP AODs over high-pollution areas (AOD > 0.8) with sparse vegetation were underestimated by more than 20% in Wuhan, and 40% in several regions. Analysis of several clear rural areas (AOD < 0.2) with native vegetation indicated an overestimation of about 20% in the northeastern region of the city. These findings showed that the VIIRS IP AOD at 550 nm can provide a solid dataset with a high resolution (750 m) for quantitative scientific investigations and environmental monitoring over Wuhan. However, the performance of dark target algorithms in VIIRS was associated with aerosol types and ground vegetation conditions.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Variation of Tree Cover in the Loess Plateau of China after the 'Grain for Green' Project
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing spatiotemporal variation of tree cover could enhance understanding of the environment and promote a sustainable resource use of ecosystems. This study investigated the variation in tree cover in the Loess Plateau after an ecological restoration effort called the 'Grain for Green Project' (GGP). The results show that the proportion of tree covered area in the Loess Plateau changed from 73% to 88%, with the cumulative tree cover fluctuating from approximately 7% to 11%, and the average annual tree cover increased from 10% in 2000 to 12% in 2014. Based on tree cover values over the course of 15 years, the study area was classified into five regions, which provide much more information for spatial assessment of tree cover change in the Loess Plateau spatially. The increase in tree cover value was mainly in the core part of Loess Plateau, the mountains, and the edge of the mountain areas; whereas the values were stable in 36.21% of the area, and a decrease was noted in 5.63% of the area, primarily located in the low plain areas. Approximately 26.36% of the Loess Plateau will show a sustained increase in tree cover in the future. The results of this study will facilitate us to understand the current conditions and development of the GGP's effects, and offer a valuable reference for future detection of tree cover change through geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) tools.

TI  - Glacier Changes in the Susitna Basin, Alaska, USA, (1951-2015) using GIS and Remote Sensing Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Susitna River draining from the highly glacierized Central Alaska Range has repeatedly been considered a potential hydro-power source in recent decades, raising questions about the effect of glacier changes on the basin's river runoff. We determine changes in the glacier area (1951-2010), elevation (1951-2010, 1951-2005 and 2005-2010), equilibrium line altitude (ELA, 1999-2015), and accumulation area ratio (AAR, 1999-2015) of the basin's five largest glaciers covering 587 km(2) (2010). We use the Landsat time series, as well as digital elevation models (DEMs) from 1951 (United States Geological Survey (USGS) aerial imagery), 2005 (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, ASTER), and 2010 (airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar, IfSAR). The glaciers lost an area of 128 +/- 15 km(2) (16%) between 1951 and 2010. The mean ELA was located at 1745 +/- 88 m a.s.l. during 1999-2015. The glacier's annual ELAs do not show any significant trends. We found a glacier-wide elevation change of 0.41 +/- 0.07 m yr(-1) for the period 1951-2005 and -1.20 +/- 0.25 m yr(-1) for 2005-2010. The results indicate that the glaciers are in a state of retreat and thinning, and have been losing mass at an accelerated rate in recent years. The interpretation of the thickness changes is complicated by the glaciers' surge cycles.

TI  - Estimation and Mapping of Winter Oilseed Rape LAI from High Spatial Resolution Satellite Data Based on a Hybrid Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key input in models describing biosphere processes and has widely been used in monitoring crop growth and in yield estimation. In this study, a hybrid inversion method is developed to estimate LAI values of winter oilseed rape during growth using high spatial resolution optical satellite data covering a test site located in southeast China. Based on PROSAIL (coupling of PROSPECT and SAIL) simulation datasets, nine vegetation indices (VIs) were analyzed to identify the optimal independent variables for estimating LAI values. The optimal VIs were selected using curve fitting methods and the random forest algorithm. Hybrid inversion models were then built to determine the relationships between optimal simulated VIs and LAI values (generated by the PROSAIL model) using modeling methods, including curve fitting, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and random forest regression (RFR). Finally, the mapping and estimation of winter oilseed rape LAI using reflectance obtained from Pleiades-1A, WorldView-3, SPOT-6, and WorldView-2 were implemented using the inversion method and the LAI estimation accuracy was validated using ground-measured datasets acquired during the 2014-2015 growing season. Our study indicates that based on the estimation results derived from different datasets, RFR is the optimal modeling algorithm amidst curve fitting and kNN with R-2 > 0.954 and RMSE < 0.218. Using the optimal VIs, the remote sensing-based mapping of winter oilseed rape LAI yielded an accuracy of R-2 = 0.520 and RMSE = 0.923 (RRMSE = 93.7%). These results have demonstrated the potential operational applicability of the hybrid method proposed in this study for the mapping and retrieval of winter oilseed rape LAI values at field scales using multi-source and high spatial resolution optical remote sensing datasets. Details provided by this high resolution mapping cannot be easily discerned at coarser mapping scales and over larger spatial extents that usually employ lower resolution satellite images. Our study therefore has significant implications for field crop monitoring at local scales, providing relevant data for agronomic practices and precision agriculture.

TI  - Location and source characteristics of the 2016 January 6 North Korean nuclear test constrained by InSAR
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ALOS-2 satellite show possible deformation associated with the 2016 January 6 North Korean nuclear test whereas the European Space Agency Sentinel-1A data are decor-related. This is the first time that deformation related to a nuclear test has been measured since 1992. Here, I present two interpretations of the observed deformation: First, the deformation can be explained by a triggered landslide on the western slope of Mt Mantap, with a displacement of up to 10 cm across a patch of 1 km(2). Second, the observation may be from uplift created by the nuclear explosion. In the second interpretation, the location, depth and cavity size can be estimated from a topography-corrected homogenous half-space model (Mogi). The preferred location of the 2016 January 6 event is 41.2993 degrees N 129.0715 degrees E, with an uncertainty of 100 m. The estimated depth is 420-700 m and the cavity radius is 23-27 m. Based on empirical data and the assumption of granite as the host rock, the yield is estimated to be 11.6-24.4 kilotons of TNT, which is consistent with previous results based on seismic data. With these two interpretations, I demonstrate that InSAR data provide an independent tool to locate and estimate source characteristics of nuclear tests in North Korea. The ambiguity of interpretation is mainly due to the limited InSAR data acquisition. Future frequent data collection by current and upcoming InSAR satellites will allow full use of InSAR for nuclear monitoring and characterization in North Korea and around the world.

TI  - A global study of GPP focusing on light-use efficiency in a random forest regression model
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Light-use efficiency (LUE) is at the core of mechanistic modeling of global gross primary production (GPP). However, most LUE estimates in global models are satellite based and coarsely measured with emphasis on environmental variables. Others are from eddy covariance towers with much greater spatial and temporal data quality and emphasis on mechanistic processes, but in a limited number of sites. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive global study of tower-based LUE from 237 FLUXNET towers, and scaled up LUEs from in situ tower level to global biome level. We integrated the tower-based LUE estimates with key environmental and biological variables at 0.5 degrees 9 0.5 degrees grid-cell resolutions, using a random forest regression (RFR) approach. Then, we developed a RFR-LUE-GPP model using the grid-cell LUE data. In order to calibrate the LUE model, we developed a data-driven RFR-GPP model using RFR method only. Our results showed LUE varies largely with latitude. We estimated a global area-weighted average of LUE at 1.23 +/- 0.03 g C. m(- 2) .MJ(-1) APAR, which led to an estimate of global GPP of 107.5 +/- 2.5 Gt C/yr from 2001 to 2005. Large uncertainties existed in GPP estimations over sparsely vegetated areas covered by savannas and woody savannas at middle to low latitude (i. e., 20 degrees S-40 degrees S and 5 degrees N-40 degrees N) due to the lack of available data. Model results were improved by incorporating Koppen climate types to represent climate/meteorological information in machine-learning modeling. This brought a new understanding to the recognized problem of climate dependence of spring onset of photosynthesis and the challenges in accurately modeling the biome GPP of evergreen broadleaf forests (EBF). The divergent responses of GPP to temperature and precipitation at middle to high latitudes and at middle to low latitudes echo the necessity of modeling GPP separately by latitudes.

TI  - Magmatic degassing, lava dome extrusion, and explosions from Mount Cleveland volcano, Alaska, 2011-2015: Insight into the continuous nature of volcanic activity over multi-year timescales
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mount Cleveland volcano (1730 m) is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc, Alaska, but heightened activity is rarely accompanied by geophysical signals, which makes interpretation of the activity difficult. In this study, we combine volcanic gas emissions measured for the first time in August 2015 with longer-term measurements of thermal output and lava extrusion rates between 2011 and 2015 calculated from MODIS satellite data with the aim to develop a better understanding of the nature of volcanic activity at Mount Cleveland. Degassing measurements were made in the month following two explosive events (21 July and 7 August 2015) and during a period of new dome growth in the summit crater. SO2 emission rates ranged from 400 to 860 t d(-1) and CO2/SO2 ratios were <3, consistent with the presence of shallow magma in the conduit and the observed growth of a new lava dome. Thermal anomalies derived from MODIS data from 2011 to 2015 had an average repose time of only 4 days, pointing to the continuous nature of volcanic activity at this volcano. Rapid increases in the cumulative thermal output were often coincident with visual confirmation of dome growth or accumulations of tephra in the crater. The average rate of lava extrusion calculated for 9 periods of rapid increase in thermal output was 0.28 m(3) s(-1), and the total volume extruded from 2011 to 2015 was 1.9-5.8 Mm(3). The thermal output from the lava extrusion events only accounts for roughly half of the thermal budget, suggesting a continued presence of shallow magma in the upper conduit, likely driven by convection. Axisymmetric dome morphology and occasional drain back of lava into the conduit suggests low-viscosity magmas drive volcanism at Mount Cleveland. It follows also that only small overpressures can be maintained given the small domes and fluid magmas, which is consistent with the low explosivity of most of Mount Cleveland's eruptions. Changes between phases of dome growth and explosive activity are somewhat unpredictable and likely result from plugs that are related to the dome obtaining a critical dimension, or from small variations in the magma ascent rate that lead to crystallization -induced blockages in the upper conduit, thereby reducing the ability of magma to degas. We suggest the small magma volumes, slow ascent rates, and low magma viscosity lead to the overall lack of anomalous geophysical signals prior to eruptions, and that more continuous volcanic degassing measurements might lead to more successful eruption forecasting at this continuously-active open-vent volcano.

TI  - A surgical perspective report on melanoma management.
T2  - Melanoma management
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Management of melanoma includes wide excision with adequate margins and lymph node biopsy depending on the depth of the lesion, with subsequent completion lymphadenectomy for positive sentinel node. Locally advanced disease can be approached in several different ways depending on a variety of patient and disease-specific factors. These include surgical resection, isolated limb perfusion and infusion and intralesional injection therapy such as talimogene laherparepvec, IL-2 and Bacille Calmette-Guerin. Ongoing controversy exists regarding the utility of completion lymphadenectomy, and trials such as MSLT-2 will attempt to shed light on this issue. The future of melanoma management will likely focus on expanding the use of immunotherapy, allowing for narrower surgical margins, particularly in sensitive anatomic areas, and limiting the number of completion lymphadenectomies.

T2  - NOVA RELIGIO-JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND EMERGENT RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the history and purpose of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), a group co-founded in 1969 by the Church of Scientology to educate the public on the alleged abuses of psychologists and psychiatrists and advocate for legal reform. Its other founder was Thomas Szasz, a non-Scientologist professionally trained as a psychiatrist who came to disagree with much of his field's practices and methodologies. Until his death in 2012, Szasz remained supportive of CCHR and its crusade against "coercive psychiatry," though the atheism, materialism, and libertarianism of his anti-psychiatric worldview remained at odds with Scientology's anti-psychiatric theology. I examine L. Ron Hubbard's evolving views on psychiatry and psychology in order to contextualize and outline this theology as it relates to the mission of CCHR as a non-profit organization heavily staffed and supported by Scientologists yet separate from the Church of Scientology International.

TI  - Faecal immunochemical tests to triage patients with lower abdominal symptoms for suspected colorectal cancer referrals in primary care: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis
T2  - HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the UK. Presenting symptoms that can be associated with CRC usually have another explanation. Faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) detect blood that is not visible to the naked eye and may help to select patients who are likely to benefit from further investigation.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of FITs [OC-Sensor (Eiken Chemical Co./MAST Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan), HM-JACKarc (Kyowa Medex/Alpha Laboratories Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), FOB Gold (Sentinel/Sysmex, Sentinel Diagnostics, Milan, Italy), RIDASCREEN Hb or RIDASCREEN Hb/Hp complex (R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany)] for primary care triage of people with low-risk symptoms.Methods: Twenty-four resources were searched to March 2016. Review methods followed published guidelines. Summary estimates were calculated using a bivariate model or a random-effects logistic regression model. The cost-effectiveness analysis considered long-term costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) that were associated with different faecal occult blood tests and direct colonoscopy referral. Modelling comprised a diagnostic decision model, a Markov model for long-term costs and QALYs that were associated with CRC treatment and progression, and a Markov model for QALYs that were associated with no CRC.Results: We included 10 studies. Using a single sample and 10 aeg Hb/g faeces threshold, sensitivity estimates for OC-Sensor [92.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 86.9% to 95.3%] and HM-JACKarc (100%, 95% CI 71.5% to 100%) indicated that both may be useful to rule out CRC. Specificity estimates were 85.8% (95% CI 78.3% to 91.0%) and 76.6% (95% CI 72.6% to 80.3%). Triage using FITs could rule out CRC and avoid colonoscopy in approximately 75% of symptomatic patients. Data from our systematic review suggest that 22.5-93% of patients with a positive FIT and no CRC have other significant bowel pathologies. The results of the base-case analysis suggested minimal difference in QALYs between all of the strategies; no triage (referral straight to colonoscopy) is the most expensive. Faecal immunochemical testing was cost-effective (cheaper and more, or only slightly less, effective) compared with no triage. Faecal immunochemical testing was more effective and costly than guaiac faecal occult blood testing, but remained cost-effective at a threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of  pound 30,000. The results of scenario analyses did not differ substantively from the base-case. Results were better for faecal immunochemical testing when accuracy of the guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) was based on studies that were more representative of the correct population.Limitations: Only one included study evaluated faecal immunochemical testing in primary care; however, all of the other studies evaluated faecal immunochemical testing at the point of referral. Further, validation data for the Faecal haemoglobin, Age and Sex Test (FAST) score, which includes faecal immunochemical testing, showed no significant difference in performance between primary and secondary care. There were insufficient data to adequately assess FOB Gold, RIDASCREEN Hb or RIDASCREEN Hb/Hp complex. No study compared FIT assays, or FIT assays versus gFOBT; all of the data included in this assessment refer to the clinical effectiveness of individual FIT methods and not their comparative effectiveness.Conclusions: Faecal immunochemical testing is likely to be a clinically effective and cost-effective strategy for triaging people who are presenting, in primary care settings, with lower abdominal symptoms and who are at low risk for CRC. Further research is required to confirm the effectiveness of faecal immunochemical testing in primary care practice and to compare the performance of different FIT assays.

TI  - Assessing the frequency and drivers of early-greening in broad-leaved woodlands along a latitudinal gradient in southern Africa
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannas are the only deciduous system where new leaf flush pre-empts the onset of suitable conditions for growth, a phenological phenomenon known as early-greening. Limited understanding of the frequency and drivers of the occurrence of early-greening in southern African savanna trees exists. We aimed to estimate the frequency of early-greening events across southern Africa and investigated potential environmental drivers of green-up. We selected and compared seven broad-leaved woodland sites where Burkea africana was a dominant species using remotely sensed data along a latitudinal gradient from South Africa to Zambia. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery at each site from January 2002 to June 2014. Using an austral year (July 1st-June 30th), early-greening was recorded if the green-up start date occurred prior to the onset date of seasonal rainfall. A latitudinal gradient of early-green-up was detected across southern Africa (R-2 = 0.74) with the two most northerly (Zambian) sites showing the earliest and most consistent green-up start dates (3 October +/- 5.34days). A strong latitudinal gradient was observed between the variability in the amount of rainfall in the first 6months of green-up and the green-up start dates across southern Africa (R-2 = 0.92). Photoperiod appeared to play a role in areas where the onset of rainfall commenced late into the austral year. Mean maximum temperatures recorded 10days prior to green-up start dates suggested a potential threshold of about 35 degrees C, which could drive early-greening in the absence of rainfall. Correlations between the proportion of early-greening years and the above mentioned environmental factors indicated that rainfall variability had the strongest influence over the observed phenological gradient (R-2 = 0.96). Understanding early-greening in complex savanna systems is a vital step in furthering predictive phenological models under changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Keeping it simple: Monitoring flood extent in large data-poor wetlands using MODIS SWIR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterising inundation conditions for flood-pulsed wetlands is a critical first step towards assessment of flood risk as well as towards understanding hydrological dynamics that underlay their ecology and functioning. In this paper, we develop a series of inundation maps for the Okavango Delta, Botswana, based on the thresholding of the SWIR band (b7) MODIS MCD43A4 product. We show that in the Okavango Delta, SWIR is superior to other spectral bands or derived indices, and illustrate an innovative way of defining the spectral threshold used to separate inundated from dry land. The threshold is determined dynamically for each scene based on reflectances of training areas capturing end-members of the inundation spectrum. The method provides a very good accuracy and is suitable for automated processing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The power of runoff
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the potential energy of surface water is a small part of Earth's energy budget, this highly variable physical property is a key component in the terrestrial hydrologic cycle empowering geomorphological and hydrological processes throughout the hydrosphere. By downscaling of the daily hydrometeorological data acquired in Sweden over the last half-century this study quantifies the spatial and temporal distribution of the dominating energy components in terrestrial hydrology, including the frictional resistance in surface water and groundwater as well as hydropower. The energy consumed in groundwater circulation was found to be 34.6 TWh/fy or a heat production of approximately 13% of the geothermal heat flux. Significant climate driven, periodic fluctuations in the power of runoff, stream flows and groundwater circulation were revealed that have not previously been documented. We found that the runoff power ranged from 173 to 260 TWh/y even when averaged over the entire surface of Sweden in a five-year moving window. We separated short-term fluctuations in runoff due to precipitation filtered through the watershed from longer-term seasonal and climate driven modes. Strong climate driven correlations between the power of runoff and climate indices, wind and solar intensity were found over periods of 3.6 and 8 years. The high covariance that we found between the potential energy of surface water and wind energy implies significant challenges for the combination of these renewable energy sources.

TI  - VIP-BP model for retrieving chlorophyll a concentration in the river by using remote sensing data
T2  - WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll a (Chla) is an important indicator of phytoplankton biomass in waters, and its concentration can reflect the degree of eutrophication. This paper is aimed to develop a highly accurate and universally applicable retrieval model for the concentration of Chla in rivers using remote sensing data. Taking the middle and lower reaches of the Han River as the study area, the Chla retrieval model (VIP-BP model) is established by combining the Variable Importance Projection Index and BP neural algorithm and then calibrated by the measured data from 2012 to 2013. This model uses the VIP index for selection of the appropriate spectrum transformation form and input bands. Then, the BP neural network algorithm is integrated to estimate Chla concentration. After validation and comparison with the three-band model, the results suggest that the VIP-BP model could more accurately and really reflect the changes in Chla concentration than the three-band model in the study area. When Chla concentration decreases, the retrieval error of both models increases, while the error of the VIP-BP model is significantly lower than that of the three-band model, which indicates that the VIP-BP model is more stable and preferred.

TI  - Revealing Implicit Assumptions of the Component Substitution Pansharpening Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The component substitution (CS) pansharpening methods have been developed for almost three decades and have become better understood recently by generalizing them into one framework. However, few studies focus on the statistical assumptions implicit in the CS methods. This paper reveals their implicit statistical assumptions from a Bayesian data fusion framework and suggests best practices for histogram matching of the panchromatic image to the intensity image, a weighted summation of the multispectral images, to better satisfy these assumptions. The purpose of histogram matching was found to make the difference between the high-resolution panchromatic and intensity images as small as possible, as one implicit assumption claims their negligible difference. The statistical relationship between the high-resolution panchromatic and intensity images and the relationship between their corresponding low-resolution images are the same, as long as the low resolution panchromatic image is derived by considering the modulation transfer functions of the multispectral sensors. Hence, the histogram-matching equation should be derived from the low-resolution panchromatic and intensity images, but not derived from the high-resolution panchromatic and expanded low-resolution intensity images. Experiments using three example CS methods, each using the two different histogram-matching equations, was conducted on the four-band QuickBird and eight-bandWorldView-2 top-of-atmosphere reflectance data. The results verified the best practices and showed that the histogram-matching equation derived from the high-resolution panchromatic and expanded low-resolution intensity images provides more-blurred histogram-matched panchromatic image and, hence less-sharpened pansharpened images than that derived from the low-resolution image pair. The usefulness of the assumptions revealed in this study for method developers is discussed. For example, the CS methods can be improved by satisfying the assumptions better, e.g., classifying the images into homogenous areas before pansharpening, and by changing the assumptions to be more general to address their deficiencies.

TI  - Altitude-dependent influence of snow cover on alpine land surface phenology
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover impacts alpine land surface phenology in various ways, but our knowledge about the effect of snow cover on alpine land surface phenology is still limited. We studied this relationship in the European Alps using satellite-derived metrics of snow cover phenology (SCP), namely, first snow fall, last snow day, and snow cover duration (SCD), in combination with land surface phenology (LSP), namely, start of season (SOS), end of season, and length of season (LOS) for the period of 2003-2014. We tested the dependency of interannual differences () of SCP and LSP metrics with altitude (up to 3000m above sea level) for seven natural vegetation types, four main climatic subregions, and four terrain expositions. We found that 25.3% of all pixels showed significant (p<0.05) correlation between SCD and SOS and 15.3% between SCD and LOS across the entire study area. Correlations between SCD and SOS as well as SCD and LOS are more pronounced in the northern subregions of the Alps, at high altitudes, and on north and west facing terrainor more generally, in regions with longer SCD. We conclude that snow cover has a greater effect on alpine phenology at higher than at lower altitudes, which may be attributed to the coupled influence of snow cover with underground conditions and air temperature. Alpine ecosystems may therefore be particularly sensitive to future change of snow cover at high altitudes under climate warming scenarios.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability of sea ice deformation rates in the Arctic Ocean observed by RADARSAT-1
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice deformation parameters are important for elucidation of the properties and characteristics of ice-ocean models. Observations of sea ice motion over 11.5 year period (November 1996-April 2008) are used to calculate ice motion divergence and shear rates, and thus, to construct total deformation rate (TDR) estimates with respect to spatial and temporal variability in the Arctic Ocean. Strong sea ice deformation signal (SDS) rates are identified when TDR > 0.01 day(aEuro'1), and very strong SDS events, when TDR > 0.05 day(aEuro'1). These calculations are based on measurements made by the RADARSAT(-1) Geophysical Processer System (RGPS). Statistical analysis of the SDS data suggest the following features: (1) Mean SDS and the SDS probability distributions are larger in "low latitudes" of the Arctic Ocean (less than 80A degrees N) than in "high latitudes" (above 80A degrees N), in both summer and winter; (2) very high SDS probabilities distributions and mean SDS values occur in coastal areas, e.g. the East Siberian Sea, Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea; (3) areas with relatively low TDR values, in the range from 0.01 day(aEuro'1) to 0.05 day(aEuro'1), cover much of the Arctic Ocean, in summer and winter; (4) of the entire TDR dataset, 45.89% belong to SDS, with summer the SDS percentage, 59.06%, and the winter SDS percentage, 40.50%. Statistically, the summer mean SDS, SDS percentage and very strong SDS are larger than corresponding values in the winter for each year, and show slight increasing tendencies during the years from 1997 to 2007. These results suggest important constraints for accurate simulations of very strong SDS in ice-ocean models.

TI  - Modeling forest carbon cycle using long-term carbon stock field measurement in the Delaware River Basin
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Process-based models are a powerful approach to test our understanding of biogeochemical processes, to extrapolate ground survey data from limited plots to the landscape scale, and to simulate the effects of climate change, nitrogen deposition, elevated atmospheric CO2, increasing natural disturbances, and land-use change on ecological processes. However, in most studies, the models are calibrated using ground measurements from only a few sites, though they may be extrapolated to much larger areas. Estimation accuracy can be improved if the models are parameterized using long-term carbon (C) stock data from multiple sites representative of the simulated region. In this study, forest biomass C stocks measured in 61 forested plots located in three research sites in the Delaware River Basin (DRB) were used to modify the PnET-CN model in three ways: (1) Field-measured mortality rates in each forest type were used to parameterize the wood turnover rate; (2) a numerical approach was used to calibrate the relationship between foliage N and maximum photosynthesis rate; and (3) stand age was incorporated into the model as an input variable, which determines the year of the last disturbance. The results showed that these model modifications improved model performance in capturing the spatial variation of forest C dynamics in the DRB forests. The spatial distribution of forest C pools and fluxes in the three sites was mapped using the modified model. The modified model was also used in experimental scenarios, which predicted that 39% of forest C sequestered over the past decade could be attributed to the combined effects of elevated CO2 and N deposition. This study demonstrated an effective method for using long-term biometric measurements of forest biomass C stocks to constrain and improve a process-based ecosystem model at a regional scale. Further research should target improving model parameters that are sensitive to the spatial variation of forest C dynamics.

TI  - Early detection of circulating DNA of <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i> in sentinel mice models
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently in China, the schistosomiasis control program has shifted its focus from transmission control to the elimination of the disease. Effective forecast and surveillance systems of schistiosomiasis are of great importance for issuing timely and early warnings on risk of infection, and therefore implementing preventive measures to avoid infection. There is great demand in more sensitive and specific methods to improve the surveillance system for early detection of S. japonicum infection in sentinel mice. In this study, we reported a sensitive nested-PCR assay targeting a 303-bp fragment from highly repetitive retrotransposon SjCHGCSI9 to detect the S. japonicum DNA in sera of experimental mice. Meanwhile, detection efficacy of the nested-PCR was compared with two conventional methods for field monitoring schistosomiasis such as ELISA and IHA. The nested-PCR assay could detect the specific DNA at 3-day post infection in sera of mice with 5 cercariae infection, while for ELISA and IHA, both show negative results even after 2 weeks post-infection in mice with 20 cercariae infection. Our results demonstrated the DNA based assay was more sensitive to make early diagnosis of S. japonicum infection in sentinel mice models, which will improve the early-warning ability of schistosomiasis surveillance system.

TI  - Using pan-sharpened high resolution satellite data to improve impervious surfaces estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface is an important environmental and socio-economic indicator for numerous urban studies. While a large number of researches have been conducted to estimate the area and distribution of impervious surface from satellite data, the accuracy for impervious surface estimation (ISE) is insufficient due to high diversity of urban land cover types. This study evaluated the use of panchrbmatic (PAN) data in very high resolution satellite image for improving the accuracy of ISE by various pan-sharpening approaches, with a further comprehensive analysis of its scale effects. Three benchmark pan-sharpening approaches, Gram-Schmidt (GS), PANSHARP and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to WorldView-2 in three spots of Hong Kong. The onscreen digitization Were carried out based on Google Map and the results were viewed as referenced impervious surfaces. The referenced impervious surfaces and the ISE results were then re-scaled to various spatial resolutions to obtain the percentage of impervious surfaces. The correlation coefficient (CC) and root mean square error (RMSE) we're adopted as the quantitative indicator to assess the accuracy. The accuracy differences between three research areas were further illustrated by the average local variance (ALV) which was used for landscape pattern analysis. The experimental results suggested that 1) three research regions have various landscape patterns; 2) ISE accuracy extracted from pan-sharpened data was better than ISE from original multispectral (MS) data; and 3) this improvement has a noticeable scale effects with various resolutions. The improvement was reduced slightly as the resolution became coarser. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Major advances in geostationary fire radiative power (FRP) retrieval over Asia and Australia stemming from use of Himarawi-8 AHI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterising the highly variable temporal dynamics of landscape-scale fire activity is best achieved using geostationary satellites, and the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) now provides views of Asian and Australian fires at an unprecedented 10 min temporal resolution and 2 km nadir thermal channel spatial resolution. We here develop the first processing system to identify active fires and retrieve their fire radiative power (FRP) from AHI data, based on the geostationary Fire Thermal Anomaly (FTA) algorithm and FRP retrieval method originally developed for use with Meteosat SEVIRI over Africa and Europe. This scheme detects active fires covering as little as 10(-3) to 10(-4) of an AHI pixel, and we compare performance to the same scheme applied to data from the forerunner geostationary MTSAT imager and the FengYun-2 (FY-2) Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (S-VISSR), and also to 1 km (at nadir) polar-orbiting MODIS active fire data. We find major benefits of Himawari-8 AHI over both MTSAT and FY-2, being able to detect a substantially greater proportion of fire activity and with little impact from sensor saturation. AHI-derived FRP retrievals of detected fires show a very strong agreement and a low (3 MW) bias with respect to near-simultaneous MODIS retrievals, though fires having FRP 5 40 MW are undercounted by AHI due to its 4x larger pixel area (at nadir) than MODIS. Large parts of Asia are characterised by smaller/lower FRP fires associated with e.g. agricultural residue burning, meaning many are at or below this AHI minimum FRP detection limit, and during June 2015 AHI fails to detect around 66% of the hotspots that MODIS detects when both sensors view the same area simultaneously. However, AHI provides 144 observation opportunities per day compared to 4 typical observations from MODIS, and shows a low (8%) active fire detection error of commission. We demonstrate the unique value of the geostationary FRP retrievals made from AHI data for full fire diurnal cycle assessment and for Fire Radiative Energy (FRE) calculations. We conclude that these FRP data demonstrate major benefits for studies of active fires over Asia and Australia, and expect them to become an important component of the global geostationary active fire observation system.

TI  - Geochemical analysis of sediments from a semi-enclosed bay (Dongshan Bay, southeast China) to determine the anthropogenic impact and source
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The geochemical compositions of sediments in the Dongshan Bay, a semi-enclosed bay on the southeast coast of China, were obtained to identify pollutant sources and evaluate the anthropogenic impacts over the last 100 years. The results indicated that the metal flux had been increasing since the 1980s. Enrichment factor values (Pb, Zn and Cu) suggested only slight enrichment. The proportion of anthropogenic Pb changed from 9% to 15% during 2000-2014. Coal combustion might be an important contamination source in the Dongshan Bay. The historical variation in the metal flux reflected the economic development and urbanization in the Zhangjiang drainage area in the past 30 years. According to the Landsat satellite remote sensing data, the urbanization area expanded approximately three times from 1995 to 2010. The delta C-13 values (-21%o to 23%o) of the organic matter (OM) in the sediments indicated that the OM was primarily sourced from aquatic, terrigenous and marsh C-3 plants. Nitrogen was mainly derived from aquatic plants and terrigenous erosion before the 1980s. However, the total organic carbon (TOC) contents, total nitrogen (TN) contents and delta N-15 had been increasing since the 1980s, which suggested that the sources of nitrogen were soil erosion, fertilizer and sewage. In addition, the TOC and TN fluxes in the Dongshan Bay had significantly increased since the 1980s, which reflected the use of N fertilizer. However, the TOC and TN fluxes significantly decreased in the past decade because environmental awareness increased and environmental protection policies were implemented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Effect of Urban Green Spaces on the Urban Thermal Environment and Its Seasonal Variations
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces have been shown to decrease land surface temperature (LST) significantly. However, few studies have explored the relationships between urban green spaces and LST across different seasons at different spatial scales. In this study, using Changchun, China as a case study, landscape ecology and comparative approaches were employed quantitatively to investigate the effects of the composition and configuration of urban green spaces on the urban thermal environments. LST maps were retrieved from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data acquired on four dates that represented four different seasons, and detailed information of urban green spaces was extracted from high resolution imagery GF-1. Normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and six landscape metrics at patch, class, and landscape level were used to characterize the spatial patterns of urban green spaces. The results showed that urban green spaces did have significant cooling effects in all seasons, except for winter, but the effects varied considerably across the different seasons and green types, and seemed to depend on the NDVI and size of urban green spaces. Compared to shape metrics, the negative relationships between the LST and the area and the NDVI of urban green spaces were more significant. Both the composition and configuration of urban green spaces can affect the distribution of LST. Based on findings with one city, given a fixed area of urban green spaces, the number of green patches can positively or negatively affect the LST, depending on if the number is larger than a threshold or not, and the threshold varies according to the given area. These findings provide new perspectives, and further research is also suggested, to generate a better understanding of how urban green spaces affect the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS Land Surface Temperature Data to Estimate Near-Surface Air Temperature in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (T-air) near the ground surface is a fundamental descriptor of terrestrial environment conditions and one of the most widely used climatic variables in global change studies. The main objective of this study was to explore the possibility of retrieving high-resolution T-air from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) products, covering complex terrain in Northeast China. The All Subsets Regression (ASR) method was adopted to select the predictors and build optimal multiple linear regression models for estimating maximum (T-max), minimum (T-min), and mean (T-mean) air temperatures. The relative importance of predictors in these models was evaluated via the Standardized Regression Coefficients (SRCs) method. The results indicated that the optimal models could estimate the T-max, T-min, and T-mean with relatively high accuracies (Model Efficiency >= 0.90). Both LST and day length (DL) predictors were important in estimating T-max (SRCs: daytime LST = 0.53, DL = 0.35), T-min (SRCs: nighttime LST = 0.74, DL = 0.23), and T-mean (SRCs: nighttime LST = 0.72, DL = 0.28). Models predicting T-min and T-mean had better performance than the one predicting T-max. Nighttime LST was better at predicting T-min and T-mean than daytime LST data at predicting T-max. Land covers had noticeable influences on estimating T-air, and even seasonal vegetation greening could result in temporal variations of model performance. Air temperature could be accurately estimated using remote sensing, but the model performance was varied across different spatial and temporal scales. More predictors should be incorporated for the purpose of improving the estimation of near surface T-air from the MODIS LST production.

TI  - Assessing the spatiotemporal dynamic of global grassland carbon use efficiency in response to climate change from 2000 to 2013
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon use efficiency (CUE) of grassland, a ratio of net primary production (NPP) to gross primary productivity (GPP), is an important index representing the capacity of plants to transfer carbon from the atmosphere to terrestrial biomass. In this study, we used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectror-adiometer (MODIS) data to calculate the global grassland CUE, and explore the spatiotemporal dynamic of global grassland CUE from 2000 to 2013 to discuss the response to climate variations. The results showed that the average annual CUE of different grassland types follows an order of: open shrublands > non-woody grasslands > closed shrublands > woody savannas > savannas. The higher grassland CUE mainly occurred in the regions with cold and dry climate. By contrast, the regions with the lower grassland CUE were mostly in warm and wet environments. Moreover, the CUE exhibited a globally positive correlation with precipitation and a negative correlation with temperature. Therefore, the grassland CUE has considerable spatial variation associated with grassland type, geographical location and climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment and Inter-Comparison of Eight Medium Resolution Forest Products on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play an important role in maintaining ecosystem services, especially in ecologically fragile areas such as the Loess Plateau (LP) in China. However, there is still great uncertainty in the spatial extent and distribution of forests in such a fragmented region. In order to examine the advantages and disadvantages of existing forest mapping products, we conducted a thorough accuracy assessment on the eight recent, medium resolution (30-50 m) products by using the LP in 2010 as the region of interest. These mapping products include Landsat and/or PALSAR images, including the forest products from GlobeLand30, FROM-GLC, Hansen, ChinaCover, NLCD-China, GLCF VCF, OU-FDL, and JAXA. The same validation data were used to assess and rank the accuracy of each product. Additionally, the spatial consistency of the different forest products and their dependence on the terrain were analyzed. The results showed that the overall accuracies of the eight forest products on the LP in 2010 were between 0.93 +/- 0.003 and 0.97 +/- 0.002 with a 95% confidence interval, and GlobeLand30 presented the highest overall accuracy (0.97 +/- 0.002). Among them, the PALSAR-based products (OU-FDL and JAXA) indicated relatively high accuracies, while the six Landsat-based products showed a large diversity in the accuracy. According to the eight products, the total estimated forest area of the LP varied from 7.627 +/- 0.077 to 10.196 +/- 0.1 million ha with a 95% confidence interval. We also found that the consistency in the spatial distribution of forests between these maps: (1) increased substantially with increasing elevation until 2000m, but then decreased at higher elevations, and (2) showed mild variation along increasing slope, but had a slight rate of increase. Our findings implied that future forest mapping studies should consider topographical attributes such as elevation and slope in their final products. Our results are fundamental in guiding future applications of these existing forest maps.

TI  - Modeling spatiotemporal distribution of PM<sub>10</sub> using HJ-1 CCD data in Luoyang, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have proved that the statistical models between satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground-level PM10 provide a feasible and effective way to obtain the extensive and continuous spatial distribution of ground-level PM10. The two-year annual mean PM10 was 119.9 +/- 66.5 mu g/ m(3) from 2014 to 2015, which significantly exceeded the annual WHO IT-1 standard for PM10 (70 mg/ m3), and the mean AOD was 0.56 +/- 0.21 in Luoyang. Statistical models were proposed using a combination of HJ-1 (Environment Satellite 1) CCD (charge-coupled device) AOD and PM10 acquired at monitoring sites. The fitting analysis of PM10 and AOD shows that PM10 agrees well with AOD, and the linear regression model is the most accurate one. By the land-use function analysis of PM10 hotspots using Google Earth, it is apparent that the prevalence of industrial or bare soil areas is the key factor in determining anthropogenic pollutant emissions. In view of the small HJ-1 data available for analyzing and the limitation of dark target algorithm in the season with sparse vegetation cover, further investigation should be conducted for a more accurate understanding of the PM10 monitoring. Despite the limitations of this work, the results prove the feasibility of retrieving remote sensing images for monitoring regional aerosol pollution, together with ground-level data. The combination of satellite images, ground monitoring and Google earth can help to better understand the spatial distributions and sources of PM on a regional scale.

TI  - Robust Registration of Multimodal Remote Sensing Images Based on Structural Similarity
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic registration of multimodal remote sensing data [e.g., optical, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)] is a challenging task due to the significant nonlinear radiometric differences between these data. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel feature descriptor named the histogram of orientated phase congruency (HOPC), which is based on the structural properties of images. Furthermore, a similarity metric named HOPCncc is defined, which uses the normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) of the HOPC descriptors for multimodal registration. In the definition of the proposed similarity metric, we first extend the phase congruency model to generate its orientation representation and use the extended model to build HOPCncc. Then, a fast template matching scheme for this metric is designed to detect the control points between images. The proposed HOPCncc aims to capture the structural similarity between images and has been tested with a variety of optical, LiDAR, SAR, and map data. The results show that HOPCncc is robust against complex nonlinear radiometric differences and outperforms the state-ofthe- art similarities metrics (i.e., NCC and mutual information) in matching performance. Moreover, a robust registration method is also proposed in this paper based on HOPCncc, which is evaluated using six pairs of multimodal remote sensing images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for multimodal image registration.

TI  - Impacts of Land Change on Ecosystem Services in the San Antonio River Basin, Texas, from 1984 to 2010
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The San Antonio River Basin (SARB) is an ecologically diverse region in South Texas. The city of San Antonio is located within the basin and is the hub of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). San Antonio, together with other major metropolitan centers in Texas, has experienced rapid population and economic growth over the last thirty years, which accelerated after the implementation of NAFTA in 1994. To assess the environmental implications of this growth in the SARB, we first conducted a land-change analysis using Landsat images from 1984, 1995, and 2010. Then, we analyzed spatiotemporal changes in ecosystem services across the SARB and within three watersheds in Bexar County where the city of San Antonio is located. To estimate changes in ecosystem service values (ESV) during this period, we combined the results of the land-change analysis with a benefit transfer approach using two sets of widely cited ecosystem-service valuation coefficients published in 1997 and 2014 but we modified the urban coefficient from the 2014 publication for low-density and high-density urban areas. When 1997 coefficients were applied, the ESV in the SARB decreased, on average, by $1.2 million/year during 1984-1995 and by $1.8 million/year during 1995-2010. The ESV in Bexar County decreased, on average, by $0.5 million/year and $0.7 million/year during the first and second periods, respectively. When the 2014 coefficients and modified urban value coefficients were applied, the ESV in the SARB decreased, on average, by a 27% more during the first period than when the 1997 coefficients were applied, while, ESV increased during the second period by an average of $2.2 million/year. This temporally opposite trend in ESV change did not occur in Bexar County, however. Using the 2014 coefficients, ESV in Bexar County decreased 5 times more during the first period and decreased 2.5 times more during the second period than when 1997 coefficients were applied. The differences in ESV trends resulting from the two sets of coefficients can be explained primarily by the different coefficients assigned to urban spaces ($0/ha/year in the 1997 study and $7005/ha/year in the 2014 study). Our results suggest that the value placed on urban areas in the 2014 publication, taken from a single case study and intended primarily for large urban parks, substantially overestimates the ESV of urban space. In our study areas, applying this value, even only to urban green space, led to the improbable conclusion that urbanization had a positive overall effect on the delivery of ecosystem services. While open spaces in urban areas do provide valuable ecosystem services, it is highly unlikely that their value exceeds those provided by less modified ecosystems. The ability to confidently use value coefficients when applying benefit transfer methods to estimate ESVs demands rigorous assessments of their broad applicability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Multisensor Coupled Spectral Unmixing for Time-Series Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new framework, called multisensor coupled spectral unmixing (MuCSUn), that solves unmixing problems involving a set of multisensor time-series spectral images in order to understand dynamic changes of the surface at a subpixel scale. The proposed methodology couples multiple unmixing problems based on regularization on graphs between the timeseries data to obtain robust and stable unmixing solutions beyond data modalities due to different sensor characteristics and the effects of nonoptimal atmospheric correction. Atmospheric normalization and cross calibration of spectral response functions are integrated into the framework as a preprocessing step. The proposed methodology is quantitatively validated using a synthetic data set that includes seasonal and trend changes on the surface and the residuals of nonoptimal atmospheric correction. The experiments on the synthetic data set clearly demonstrate the efficacy of MuCSUn and the importance of the preprocessing step. We further apply our methodology to a real time-series data set composed of 11 Hyperion and 22 Landsat-8 images taken over Fukushima, Japan, from 2011 to 2015. The proposed methodology successfully obtains robust and stable unmixing results and clearly visualizes class-specific changes at a subpixel scale in the considered study area.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to estimate the benefits of ecosystem services for prioritization of land use conservation and to highlight the importance of ecosystem services by comparison between ecosystem service value and green GDP accounting. Based on land use pattern and benefit transfer method, this research estimated value of ecosystem services in Taiwan. Scientific information of land use and land cover change is accessed through multi-year satellite imagery moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and geographic information system (GIS) technology. Combined with benefit transfer method, this research estimated the ecosystem service valuation of forest, grassland, cropland, wetland, water, and urban for the period of 2000 to 2015 in Taiwan. It is found that forest made the greatest contribution and the significant increasing area of wetland has huge potential benefit for environmental conservation in Taiwan. We recommend placing maintaining wetland ecosystem in Taiwan with higher priority. This research also compared ecosystem service value with natural capital consumption which would essentially facilitate policy makers to understand the relationship between benefits gained from natural capital and the loss from human-made capital.

TI  - Hyperspectral Image Superresolution by Transfer Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image superresolution is a highly attractive topic in computer vision and has attracted many researchers' attention. However, nearly all the existing methods assume that multiple observations of the same scene are required with the observed low-resolution hyperspectral image. This limits the application of superresolution. In this paper, we propose a new framework to enhance the resolution of hyperspectral images by exploiting the knowledge from natural images: The relationship between low/high-resolution images is the same as that between low/high-resolution hyperspectral images. In the proposed framework, the mapping between low-and high-resolution images can be learned by deep convolutional neural network and be transferred to hyperspectral image by borrowing the idea of transfer learning. In addition, to study the spectral characteristic between low-and high-resolution hyperspectral image, collaborative nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) is proposed to enforce collaborations between the low-and high-resolution hyperspectral images, which encourages the estimated solution to extract the same endmembers with low-resolution hyperspectral image. The experimental results on ground based and remote sensing data suggest that the proposed method achieves comparable performance without requiring any auxiliary images of the same scene.

TI  - The brightness temperature adjusted dust index: An improved approach to detect dust storms using MODIS imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery provides a good data source for timely and accurate monitoring of dust storms. However, effective MODIS-based dust indices are inadequate. In this study, we proposed an improved brightness temperature adjusted dust index (BADI) by integrating the brightness temperatures of three thermal infrared MODIS bands: band(20) (3.66-3.84 mu m), band(31) (10.78-11.28 mu m) and band(32) (11.77-12.27 mu m). We used the BADI to monitor several representative dust storms over the Northeast Asia between 2000 and 2011. When compared to commonly used MODISbased dust indices, such as the brightness temperature difference index in band(32) and band(31) (BTD32-31) and the normalized difference dust index (NDDI), the BADI captured the spatial extent and density of dust storms more accurately. The BADI detected dust storm extent with an overall accuracy >90%, which was 7% and 29% higher than the results derived from BTD32-31 and NDDI, respectively. The BADI also demonstrated good agreement with the density indicator of MODIS Deep Blue Aerosol Optical Depth (R-2=0.59, P <0.01). We suggest that the BADI is an effective tool to monitor large-scale dust storms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determining Rice Growth Stage with X-Band SAR: A Metamodel Based Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice crops are important in the global food economy, and new techniques are being implemented for their effective management. These techniques rely mainly on the changes in the phenological cycle, which can be investigated by remote sensing systems. High frequency and high spatial resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors have great potential in all-weather conditions for detecting temporal phenological changes. This study focuses on a novel approach for growth stage determination of rice fields from SAR data using a parameter space search algorithm. The method employs an inversion scheme for a morphology-based electromagnetic backscattering model. Since such a morphology-based model is complicated and computationally expensive, a surrogate metamodel-based inversion algorithm is proposed for the growth stage estimation. The approach is designed to provide estimates of crop morphology and corresponding growth stage from a continuous growth scale. The accuracy of the proposed method is tested with ground measurements from Turkey and Spain using the images acquired by the TerraSAR-X (TSX) sensor during a full growth cycle of rice crops. The analysis shows good agreement for both datasets. The results of the proposed method emphasize the effectiveness of X-band PolSAR data for morphology-based growth stage determination of rice crops.

TI  - Texture Analysis and Land Cover Classification of Tehran Using Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification of built-up and bare land areas in arid or semi-arid regions from multi-spectral optical images is not simple, due to the similarity of the spectral characteristics of the ground and building materials. However, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images could overcome this issue because of the backscattering dependency on the material and the geometry of different surface objects. Therefore, in this paper, dual-polarized data from ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (HH, HV) and Sentinel-1 C-SAR (VV, VH) were used to classify the land cover of Tehran city, Iran, which has grown rapidly in recent years. In addition, texture analysis was adopted to improve the land cover classification accuracy. In total, eight texture measures were calculated from SAR data. Then, principal component analysis was applied, and the first three components were selected for combination with the backscattering polarized images. Additionally, two supervised classification algorithms, support vector machine and maximum likelihood, were used to detect bare land, vegetation, and three different built-up classes. The results indicate that land cover classification obtained from backscatter values has better performance than that obtained from optical images. Furthermore, the layer stacking of texture features and backscatter values significantly increases the overall accuracy.

TI  - Production Characteristics of Bacteria and Phytoplankton in the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea during Spring-Summer
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Production parameters for bacterioplankton were assessed during the spring-summer period in the western parts of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, as well as in northwestern Pacific Ocean. The lowest values of bacterial production were observed in early June during the spring phytoplankton bloom (0.08 mg C day(-1) m(-3)), while the maximum values (up to 55 mg C day(-1) m(-3)) occurred in late July-early August, 1.5 to 2 months after the bloom. The concentration of dissolved organic matter, the substrate for bacterioplankton, was assessed using satellite data. The ratio between bacterial and primary production in the surface samples varied from 0.5% at the peak of phytoplankton bloom to 180% at the peak of bacterioplankton development.

TI  - Swedish prospective multicenter trial on the accuracy and clinical relevance of sentinel lymph node biopsy before neoadjuvant systemic therapy in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the context of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) in breast cancer is still controversial. SLNB before NAST has been evaluated in few single-institution studies in which axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), however, was commonly not performed in case of a negative SLNB. We investigated the potential clinical relevance of SLNB before NAST by performing ALND in all patients after NAST.This national multicenter trial prospectively enrolled clinically node-negative breast cancer patients planned for NAST at 13 recruiting Swedish hospitals between October 2010 and December 2015. SLNB before NAST was followed by ALND after NAST in all individuals. Repeat SLNB after NAST was encouraged but not mandatory.SLNB before NAST was performed in 224 patients. The identification rate was 100% (224/224). The proportion of patients with a negative SLNB before NAST but positive axillary lymph nodes after NAST was 7.4% (nine of 121 patients, 95% CI 4.0-13.5). Among those with a positive SLNB before NAST, 23.2% (86/112) had further positive lymph nodes after NAST.In clinically node-negative patients, SLNB before NAST is highly reliable. With this sequence, ALND and regional radiotherapy can be safely omitted in patients with a negative SLNB provided good clinical response to NAST. Additionally, SLNB-positive patients upfront will receive correct nodal staging unaffected by NAST and be consequently offered adjuvant locoregional treatment according to current guidelines pending the results of ongoing randomized trials.

TI  - Swedish prospective multicenter trial evaluating sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant systemic therapy in clinically node-positive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer planned for neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) may draw advantages from the nodal downstaging effect and reduce the extent of axillary surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) performed after NAST. Since there are concerns about lower sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection and higher false-negative rates (FNR) in this setting, our aim was to define the accuracy of SLNB after NAST.This Swedish national multicenter trial prospectively recruited 195 breast cancer patients from ten hospitals with T1-T4d biopsy-proven node-positive disease planned for NAST between October 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. Clinically node-negative axillary status after NAST was not mandatory. SLNB was always attempted and followed by a completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).The SLN identification rate was 77.9% (152/195) but improved to 80.7% (138/171) with dual mapping. The median number of SLNs was two (range 1-5). A positive SLNB was found in 52% (79/152), almost 66% (52/79) of whom had additional positive non-sentinel lymph nodes. The overall pathologic nodal response rate was 33.3% (66/195). The overall FNR was 14.1% (13/92) but decreased to 4% (2/50) when only patients with two or more sentinel nodes were analyzed.In biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer, SLNB after NAST is feasible even though the identification rate is lower than in clinically node-negative patients. Since the overall FNR is unacceptably high, the omission of ALND should only be considered if two or more SLNs are identified.

TI  - Laparoscopic Technique for Serial Collection of Liver and Mesenteric Lymph Nodes in Macaques
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and the liver are exposed to microbes and microbial products from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, making them immunologically unique. The GI tract and associated MLN are sites of early viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the MLN are likely important reservoir sites that harbor latently-infected cells even after prolonged antiretroviral therapy (ART). The liver has been shown to play a significant role in immune responses to lentiviruses and appears to play a significant role in clearance of virus from circulation. Nonhuman primate (NHP) models for HIV and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) closely mimic these aspects of HIV infection and serial longitudinal sampling of primary sites of viral replication and the associated immune responses in this model will help to elucidate critical events in infection, pathogenesis, and the impact of various intervention strategies on these events. Current published techniques to sample liver and MLN together involve major surgery and/or necropsy, which limits the ability to investigate these important sites in a serial fashion in the same animal. We have previously described a laparoscopic technique for collection of MLN. Here, we describe a minimally invasive laparoscopic technique for serial longitudinal sampling of liver and MLN through the same two port locations required for the collection of MLN. The use of the same two ports minimizes the impact to the animals as no additional incisions are required. This technique can be used with increased sampling frequency compared to major abdominal surgery and reduces the potential for surgical complications and associated local and systemic inflammatory responses that could complicate interpretation of results. This procedure has potential to facilitate studies involving NHP models while improving animal welfare.

TI  - Applying time series Landsat data for vegetation change analysis in the Florida Everglades Water Conservation Area 2A during 1996-2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping plant communities and documenting their changes is critical to the on-going Florida Everglades restoration project. In this study, a framework was designed to map dominant vegetation communities and inventory their changes in the Florida Everglades Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A) using time series Landsat images spanning 1996-2016. The object-based change analysis technique was combined in the framework. A hybrid pixel/object-based change detection approach was developed to effectively collect training samples for historical images with sparse reference data. An object-based quantification approach was also developed to assess the expansion/reduction of a specific class such as cattail (an invasive species in the Everglades) from the object-based classifications of two dates of imagery. The study confirmed the results in the literature that cattail was largely expanded during 1996-2007. It also revealed that cattail expansion was constrained after 2007. Application of time series Landsat data is valuable to document vegetation changes for the WCA-2A impoundment. The digital techniques developed will benefit global wetland mapping and change analysis in general, and the Florida Everglades WCA-2A in particular. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Upscaling of Surface Soil Moisture Using a Deep Learning Model with VIIRS RDR
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In current upscaling of in situ surface soil moisture practices, commonly used novel statistical or machine learning-based regression models combined with remote sensing data show some advantages in accurately capturing the satellite footprint scale of specific local or regional surface soil moisture. However, the performance of most models is largely determined by the size of the training data and the limited generalization ability to accomplish correlation extraction in regression models, which are unsuitable for larger scale practices. In this paper, a deep learning model was proposed to estimate soil moisture on a national scale. The deep learning model has the advantage of representing nonlinearities and modeling complex relationships from large-scale data. To illustrate the deep learning model for soil moisture estimation, the croplands of China were selected as the study area, and four years of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) raw data records (RDR) were used as input parameters, then the models were trained and soil moisture estimates were obtained. Results demonstrate that the estimated models captured the complex relationship between the remote sensing variables and in situ surface soil moisture with an adjusted coefficient of determination of (R) over bar (2) = 0.9875 and a root mean square error ( RMSE) of 0.0084 in China. These results were more accurate than the Soil Moisture Active Passive ( SMAP) active radar soil moisture products and the Global Land data assimilation system (GLDAS) 0-10 cm depth soil moisture data. Our study suggests that deep learning model have potential for operational applications of upscaling in situ surface soil moisture data at the national scale.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing Data to Parameterize Ice Jam Modeling for a Northern Inland Delta
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Slave River is a northern river in Canada, with ice being an important component of its flow regime for at least half of the year. During the spring breakup period, ice jams and ice-jam flooding can occur in the Slave River Delta, which is of benefit for the replenishment of moisture and sediment required to maintain the ecological integrity of the delta. To better understand the ice jam processes that lead to flooding, as well as the replenishment of the delta, the one-dimensional hydraulic river ice model RIVICE was implemented to simulate and explore ice jam formation in the Slave River Delta. Incoming ice volume, a crucial input parameter for RIVICE, was determined by the novel approach of using MODIS space-born remote sensing imagery. Space-borne and air-borne remote sensing data were used to parameterize the upstream ice volume available for ice jamming. Gauged data was used to complement modeling calibration and validation. HEC-RAS, another one-dimensional hydrodynamic model, was used to determine ice volumes required for equilibrium jams and the upper limit of ice volume that a jam can sustain, as well as being used as a threshold for the volumes estimated by the dynamic ice jam simulations using RIVICE. Parameter sensitivity analysis shows that morphological and hydraulic properties have great impacts on the ice jam length and water depth in the Slave River Delta.

TI  - Assessment of Land-Cover/Land-Use Change and Landscape Patterns in the Two National Nature Reserves of Ebinur Lake Watershed, Xinjiang, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC) alters landscape patterns and affects regional ecosystems. The objective of this study was to examine LCLUC and landscape patterns in Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) and Ganjia Lake Haloxylon Forest National Nature Reserve (GLHFNNR), two biodiversity-rich national nature reserves in the Ebinur Lake Watershed (ELW), Xinjiang, China. Landsat satellite images from 1972, 1998, 2007 and 2013 were used to calculate the dynamics of a land-cover and land-use (LCLU) transition matrix and landscape pattern index using ENVI 5.1 and FRAGSTATS 3.3. The results showed drastic land use modifications have occurred in ELWNNR during the past four decades. Between 1972 and 1998, 1998 and 2007, and 2007 and 2013, approximately 251.50 km(2) (7.93%), 122.70 km(2) (3.87%), and 195.40 km(2) (6.16%) of wetland were turned into salinized land. In GLHFNNR both low and medium density Haloxylon forest area declined while high density Haloxylon forest area increased. This contribution presents a method for characterizing LCLUC using one or more cross-tabulation matrices based on Sankey diagrams, demonstrating the depiction of flows of energy or materials through ecosystem network. The ecological landscape index displayed that a unique landscape patches have shrunk in size, scattered, and fragmented. It becomes a more diverse landscape. Human activities like farming were negatively correlated with the landscape diversity of wetlands. Furthermore, evidence of degraded wetlands caused by air temperature and annual precipitation, was also observed. We conclude that national and regional policies related to agriculture and water use have significantly contributed to the extensive changes; the ELWNNR and GLHFNNR are highly susceptible to LCLUC in the surrounding Ebinur Lake Watershed.

TI  - Impacts of vegetation establishment duration on soil organic carbon accumulation in Chongming-Dongtan, China
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine tidal wetlands are highly influenced by land and sea. Some environmental factors change quickly with the vegetation establishment duration and have an important influence on the soil carbon sequestration. Based on field survey and remotely sensed data, we investigated the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) content, its accumulation rate and vegetation establishment duration in Chongming-Dongtan, the Yangtze Estuary. With the increase of vegetation establishment duration, SOC content increased significantly. SOC content in the vegetation establishment duration of 14 years was about 1.3 times that of 1 year. Soil organic carbon accumulation rate decreased with time and was stabilized at 11 g . m(-2) . a(-1) 10 years later. SOC content of tidal wetland from Yangtze Estuary was close to those of other coastal wetlands in China, but the accumulation rate was far lower than that on the east coast of the United States, probably due to human disturbance such as overgrazing and harvest. Therefore, there is a great potential for carbon sequestration enhancement by conservation and restoration of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Estimation and Analysis of Spatiotemporal Dynamics of the Net Primary Productivity Integrating Efficiency Model with Process Model in Karst Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of regional net primary productivity (NPP) are useful in modeling regional and global carbon cycles, especially in karst areas. This work developed a new method to study NPP characteristics and changes in Chongqing, a typical karst area. To estimate NPP accurately, the model which integrated an ecosystem process model (CEVSA) with a light use efficiency model (GLOPEM) called GLOPEM-CEVSA was applied. The fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) was derived from remote sensing data inversion based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer atmospheric and land products. Validation analyses showed that the PAR and NPP values, which were simulated by the model, matched the observed data well. The values of other relevant NPP models, as well as the MOD17A3 NPP products (NPP MOD17), were compared. In terms of spatial distribution, NPP decreased from northeast to southwest in the Chongqing region. The annual average NPP in the study area was approximately 534 gC/m(2)a (Std. = 175.53) from 2001 to 2011, with obvious seasonal variation characteristics. The NPP from April to October accounted for 80.1% of the annual NPP, while that from June to August accounted for 43.2%. NPP changed with the fraction of absorbed PAR, and NPP was also significantly correlated to precipitation and temperature at monthly temporal scales, and showed stronger sensitivity to interannual variation in temperature.

TI  - Wildfire occurrence patterns in ecoregions of New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory, Australia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire occurrence is regulated by many factors such as climate, vegetation, topography and ignition source. The effects of these factors vary across space. In this study, generalised additive models were used to assist in understanding the drivers that regulate the spatial distribution of wildfire occurrence over five ecoregions in the south-eastern Australia. Fire occurrence data are sourced from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer active fire product over the period 2003-2013 and across New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. The experimental results suggest that vegetation is one of the key factors in most ecoregions; among the two vegetation factors, vegetation formations affect the fire occurrence pattern in the most fire-prone area; climate gradients drive fire occurrence in ecoregions with relatively broad areas; spatial effect drives the fire occurrence pattern in all the ecoregions; anthropogenic factors regulate fire occurrence patterns in the most populated area and two sparsely populated areas. In the most fire-prone area, fires are less likely to ignite from rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests than in dry sclerophyll forests. Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and fire occurrence follows a non-linear relationship with each other in most ecoregions, with small to medium levels of NDVI show positive effect. In the temperate areas, fires tend to ignite from low precipitation, high temperature areas. Fires are also likely to occur near human facilities and at non-protected areas in some ecoregions, but away from roads in one ecoregion. The findings from this study provide a better understanding of long-term fire patterns and their drivers that can potentially help fire managers and rural communities make strategic-level decisions.

TI  - Spectral-Spatial Adaptive Area-to-Point Regression Kriging for MODIS Image Downscaling
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor contains 36 bands at spatial resolutions of 250 m (e.g., bands 1-2), 500 m (e.g., bands 3-7), and 1000 m (e.g., bands 8-36). The first seven bands covering the visible to midinfrared wavelengths have been used widely for monitoring the Earth's surface. However, 500 mMODIS bands 3-7 present challenges for use in land cover/land use applications, as many land cover features on the Earth's surface possess complex structures with a spatial resolution finer than 500 m. Fusing MODIS 250 m bands 1-2 and 500 m bands 3-7 is an attractive proposition, that is, increasing the spatial resolution of bands 3-7. The geostatistical based downscaling approach, area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK), has shown great potential for MODIS image downscaling. However, it considers the global relationship between bands 1-2 and each of bands 3-7 to select a 250 m PAN-like band from bands 1-2, which may not take full advantage of both bands 1 and 2. In this paper, a new geostatistical downscalingmethod of spectral-spatial adaptive ATPRK (SSAATPRK) is proposed for MODIS image downscaling. Both fine spatial resolution bands (i.e., bands 1 and 2) are used as the input to SSAATPRK, and there is no need to choose a PAN-like band for each coarse band, as in the original ATPRK method. SSAATPRK was compared to four benchmark image fusion methods, including principal component analysis, high-pass filtering, ATPRK, and adaptive ATPRK (AATPRK), using one synthetic MODIS image experiment and two real MODIS image experiments. Both visual and quantitative evaluations demonstrated that SSAATPRK produced results consistently with the greatest amount of spatial detail and the largest accuracy. Furthermore, SSAATPRK inherits completely the advantages of ATPRK and AATPRK, while extending them for MODIS image downscaling.

TI  - A Mixed Radiometric Normalization Method for Mosaicking of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new mixed radiometric normalization (MRN) method is introduced in this paper which aims to eliminate the radiometric difference in image mosaicking. The radiometric normalization methods can be classified as the absolute and relative approaches in traditional solutions. Though the absolute methods could get the precise surface reflectance values of the images, rigorous conditions required for them are usually difficult to obtain, which makes the absolute methods impractical in many cases. The relative methods, which are simple and practicable, are more widely applied. However, the standard for designating the reference image needed for these methods is not unified. Moreover, the color error propagation and the two-body problems are common obstacles for the relative methods. The proposed MRN approach combines absolute and relative radiometric normalization methods, by which the advantages of both can be fully used and the limitations can be effectively avoided. First, suitable image after absolute radiometric calibration is selected as the reference image. Then, the invariant feature probability between the pixels of the target image and that of the reference image is obtained. Afterward, an adaptive local approach is adopted to obtain a suitable linear regression model for each block. Finally, a bilinear interpolation method is employed to obtain the radiometric calibration parameters for each pixel. Moreover, the CIELAB color space is adopted to evaluate the results quantitatively. Experimental results of ZY-3, GF-1, and GF-2 data indicate that the proposed method can eliminate the radiometric differences between images from the same or even different sensors.

TI  - Estimation of rice grain yield from dual-polarization Radarsat-2 SAR data by integrating a rice canopy scattering model and a genetic algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and accurate estimation of rice yield plays a role in forecasting rice productivity for ensuring regional or national food security. Microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been proved to have a great potential for rice monitoring and parameters retrieval. In this study, a rice canopy scattering model (RCSM) was revised and then was applied to simulate the backscatter of rice cahopy. The combination of RCSM and genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed for retrieving two important rice parameters relating to grain yield, ear length and ear number density, from a C-band, dual-polarization (HH and HV) Radarsat-2 SAR data. The stability of retrieved results of GA inversion was also evaluated by changing various parameter configurations.Results show that RCSM can effectively simulate backscattering coefficients of rice canopy at HH and HV mode with an error of <1 dB. Reasonable selection of GA's parameters is essential for stability and efficiency of rice parameter retrieval. Two rice parameters are retrieved by the proposed RCSM-GA technology with better accuracy. The rice ear length are estimated with error of <1.5 cm, and ear number density with error of <23 #/m(2). Rice grain yields are effectively estimated and mapped by the retrieved ear length and number density via a simple yield regression equation. This study further illustrates the capability of C-band Radarsat-2 SAR data on retrieval of rice ear parameters and the practicability of radar remote sensing technology for operational yield estimation.

TI  - Forest transitions in Chinese villages: Explaining community-level variation under the returning forest to farmland program
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - China's Returning Farmland to Forest Program (RFFP) aimed to transform rural landscapes and livelihoods by compensating households for planting trees on retired farmland. The program has been attributed a key role in an apparent forest transition. Studies uncover great local variation in its impacts, but the mechanisms behind them have received little attention. We examine such heterogeneity in 12 communities in northwest Yunnan, assessing the hypothesis that the RFFP catalyzed a state-led forest transition by evaluating the contributions of RFFP implementation and other processes to land cover change. Our dataset combines socioeconomic data from household surveys, focus groups, and intensive interviews with remote sensing data for a linked, cross-scale analysis. Results show no significant relationship between RFFP implementation and community-level vegetation cover change. Between 2000 and 2010, high-elevation communities had larger vegetation gains, while from 2010 to 2014, low-elevation communities had larger gains. Regression analyses and interview data show off-farm labor, tree crop planting, and changing energy sources influenced the rate of community-level vegetation change. This pattern, combining tree crop cultivation with labor outflows, may represent a distinct "policy plantation" pathway of forest gain. Meanwhile, new, high-elevation cash crops may be constraining forest expansion. This analysis suggests limited additionality for the RFFP in this region and highlights how heterogeneous, intersecting land use processes bring uneven forest transitions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Decadal-scale trends in regional aerosol particle properties and their linkage to emission changes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding long-term trends in aerosol loading and properties is essential for evaluating the health and climatic effects of these airborne particulates as well as the effectiveness of pollution control policies. While many studies have used satellite data to examine the trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD), very few have investigated the trends in aerosol properties associated with particle size, morphology, and light absorption. In this study, we investigate decadal-scale (13-15 year) trends in aerosol loading and properties during 2001-2015 over three populous regions: the Eastern United States (EUS), Western Europe (WEU), and Eastern and Central China (ECC). We use observations from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) and MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Relationships between aerosol property trends and air pollutant emission changes are examined. We find that annual mean AOD shows pronounced decreasing trends over EUS and WEU regions, as a result of considerable emission reductions in all major pollutants except for mineral dust and ammonia (NH3). Over the ECC region, AOD increases before 2006 due to emission increases induced by rapid economic development, fluctuates between 2006 and 2011, and subsequently decreases after 2011 in conjunction with effective emission reduction in anthropogenic primary aerosols, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The fraction of small-size AOD (<0.7 mu m diameter), <(A)over circle>ngstrom exponent and single-scattering albedo have generally decreased, while the fractions of large-size (>1.4 mu m diameter), nonspherical and absorbing AOD have generally shown increasing trends over EUS and WEU regions, indicating that fine and light-scattering aerosol constituents have been more effectively reduced than coarse and light-absorbing constituents. These trends are consistent with the larger reduction ratios in S(O)2 and NOx emissions than in primary aerosols, including mineral dust and black carbon (BC). Over the ECC region, no significant trends are observed with respect to size distribution, morphology, or light absorption, which we attribute to a simultaneous increase in emissions of SO2, NOx, and primary aerosols including BC before 2006, and a simultaneous decrease after 2011. This study demonstrates the importance and usefulness of satellite-borne sensors, particularly MISR, in association with evaluating the effectiveness of air pollution control policies.

TI  - Multimode Hybrid Geometric Calibration of Spaceborne SAR Considering Atmospheric Propagation Delay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric propagation delay of radar signals is a systematic error that occurs in the atmospheric environment, and is a key issue in the high-precision geometric calibration of spaceborne SAR. A multimode hybrid geometric calibration method for spaceborne SAR that considers the atmospheric propagation delay is proposed in this paper. Error sources that affect the accuracy of the geometric calibration were systematically analyzed. Based on correction of the atmospheric propagation delay, a geometric calibration model for spaceborne SAR was established. The high precision geometric calibration scheme for spaceborne SAR was explored by considering the pulse-width and bandwidth of the signal. A series of experiments were carried out based on high-resolution Yaogan 13 (YG-13) SAR satellite data and ground control data. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective. The plane positioning accuracy of YG-13 in stripmap mode without control points is better than 3 m, and the accuracy of the sliding spotlight mode is better than 1.5 m.

TI  - Postearthquake Landslides Mapping From Landsat-8 Data for the 2015 Nepal Earthquake Using a Pixel-Based Change Detection Method
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2015 Nepal earthquake and its aftershocks not only caused huge damage with severe loss of life and property, also induced many geohazards with the major type of landslide which should bring continuous threats to the affected region. To gain a better understanding of the landslides induced by this earthquake, we proposed a pixel-based change detection method for postearthquake landslide mapping by using bitemporal Landsat-8 remote sensing data [May 29, 2014 (pre-earthquake) and June 1, 2015 (postearthquake)]. Two river valleys (Trishuli river valley and Sun Koshi river valley) that contain important economic arteries linking Nepal and China were selected as the study areas. Validation of the mapping results with postearthquake high-resolution images from Google Earth shows that the pixel-based landslide mapping method is able to identify landslides with relatively high accuracy, and it also approves the applicability of Landsat-8 satellite for landslide mapping with its multispectral information. The spatial distribution analysis indicates that both river valleys are substantially affected by landslides, and the situation is even more serious in the high mountain areas. Landslides are generally found in areas of high elevation and large surface slopes, with mean values above 1600 m and 30 degrees, respectively. These findings suggest that these areas suffer greatly from these geohazards, and the threat will continue for the next few years.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of the Triangle-Based Empirical Soil Moisture Relationship Models Based on Landsat-5 TM Data and <i>In Situ</i> Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is an important parameter at the land-atmosphere interface. In past decades, passive microwave remote sensing offers a good opportunity for obtaining SSM on a global scale, and many downscaling methods have been proposed using the triangle-based empirical soil moisture relationship models to overcome the limitation of coarse spatial resolution of its SSM products for regional applications. This paper aimed to examine and compare the effectiveness of five typical triangle-based empirical soil moisture relationship models for estimating SSM with Landsat-5 data and in situ measurements from the Maqu network on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau for nine cloud-free days. The results showed that the model that treats the SSM as a second-order polynomial with land surface temperature, vegetation indices (VIs), and surface albedo as inputs exhibited the best performance compared with the results of other models. The VI comparison indicated that the use of the normalized difference VI or the fractional vegetation cover in this model outperformed other VIs, with the root-mean-square deviation of approximately 0.055 m(3)/m(3) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) above 0.78 at the nine-day average level. In addition, a significant spatial scale effect of the model was also found through analyzing the model fitting results at different window sizes. The study provides important insight into the best empirical relationship models for capturing soil moisture dynamics. These models can support the passive microwave soil moisture data spatial downscaling and validation applications in future studies.

TI  - The polarimetric features of oil spills in full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with single-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, full polarimetric SAR images contain not only geometrical and backward scattering characteristics, but also the polarization features of the scattering targets. Therefore, the polarimetric SAR has more advantages for oil spill detection on the sea surface. As a crucial step in the oil spill detection, a feature extraction directly influences the accuracy of oil spill discrimination. The polarimetric features of sea oil spills, such as polarimetric entropy, average scatter angle, in the full polarimetric SAR images are analyzed firstly. And a new polarimetric parameter P which reflects the proportion between Bragg and specular scattering signals is proposed. In order to investigate the capability of the polarimetric features for observing an oil spill, systematic comparisons and analyses of the multipolarization features are provided on the basis of the full polarimetric SAR images acquired by SIR-C/X-SAR and Radarsat-2. The experiment results show that in C-band SAR images the oil spills can be detected more easily than in L-band SAR images under low to moderate wind speed conditions. Moreover, it also finds that the new polarimetric parameter is sensitive to the sea surface scattering mechanisms. And the experiment results demonstrate that the new polarimetric parameter and pedestal height perform better than other polarimetric parameters for the oil spill detection in the C-band SAR images.

TI  - Rural Settlement Subdivision by Using Landscape Metrics as Spatial Contextual Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple policy projects have changed land use and land cover (LULC) in China's rural regions over the past years, resulting in two types of rural settlements: new-fashioned and old-fashioned. Precise extraction of and discrimination between these two settlement types are vital for sustainable land use development. It is difficult to identify these two types via remote sensing images due to their similarities in spectrum, texture, and geometry. This study attempts to discriminate different types of rural settlements by using a spatial contextual information extraction method based on Gaofen 2 (GF-2) images, which integrate hierarchical multi-scale segmentation and landscape analysis. A preliminary LULC map was derived by using only traditional spectral and geometrical features from a finer scale. Subsequently, a vertical connection was built between superobjects and subobjects, and landscape metrics were computed. The vertical connection was used for assigning landscape contextual information to subobjects. Finally, a classification phase was conducted, in which only multi-scale contextual information was adopted, to discriminate between new-fashioned and old-fashioned rural settlements. Compared with previous studies on multi-scale contextual information, this paper employs landscape metrics to quantify contextual characteristics, rather than traditional spectral, textural, and topological relationship information, from superobjects. Our findings indicate that this approach effectively identified and discriminated two types of rural settlements, with accuracies over 80% for both producers and users. A comparison with a conventional top-down hierarchical classification scheme showed that this novel approach improved accuracy, precision, and recall. Our results confirm that multi-scale contextual information with landscape metrics provides valuable spatial information for classification, and indicates the practicability, applicability, and effectiveness of this synthesized approach in distinguishing different types of rural settlements.

TI  - Identification of interacting proteins of the TaFVE protein involved in spike development in bread wheat
T2  - PROTEOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - WD-40 repeat-containing protein MSI4 (FVE)/MSI4 plays important roles in determining flowering time in Arabidopsis. However, its function is unexplored in wheat. In the present study, coimmunoprecipitation and nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled toMS/MS were used to identify FVE in wheat (TaFVE)-interacting or associated proteins. Altogether 89 differentially expressed proteins showed the same downregulated expression trends as TaFVE in wheat line 5660M. Among them, 62 proteins were further predicted to be involved in the interaction network of TaFVE and 11 proteins have been shown to be potential TaFVE interactors based on curated databases and experimentally determined in other species by the STRING. Both yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay showed that histone deacetylase 6 and histone deacetylase 15 directly interacted with TaFVE. Multiple chromatin-remodelling proteins and polycomb group proteins were also identified and predicted to interact with TaFVE. These results showed that TaFVE directly interacted with multiple proteins to form multiple complexes to regulate spike developmental process, e.g. histone deacetylate, chromatin-remodelling and polycomb repressive complex 2 complexes. In addition, multiple flower development regulation factors (e.g. flowering locus K homology domain, flowering time control protein FPA, FY, flowering time control protein FCA, APETALA 1) involved in floral transition were also identified in the present study. Taken together, these results further elucidate the regulatory functions of TaFVE and help reveal the genetic mechanisms underlying wheat spike differentiation.

TI  - Examining the short-term impacts of diverse management practices on plant phenology and carbon fluxes of Old World bluestems pasture
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Burning, grazing, and baling (hay harvesting) are common management practices in grassland. To develop and adopt sustainable management practices, it is essential to better understand and quantify the impacts of management practices on plant phenology and carbon fluxes. In this study, we combined multiple data sources, including in-situ PhenoCam digital images, eddy covariance data, and satellite data (Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) to examine the impacts of burning, baling, and grazing on canopy dynamics, plant phenology, and carbon fluxes in a pasture in El Reno, Oklahoma in 2014. Landsat images were used to assess the baling area and the trajectory of vegetation recovery. MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) were used in the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) to estimate gross primary production (GPP(VPM)) at a MODIS pixel for the flux tower (baled) site. For comparison between baled and unbaled conditions, we used MODIS VIs for a neighbor MODIS pixel (unbaled) and ran VPM. Daily PhenoCam images and green chromatic coordinate (GCC) tracked canopy dynamics and plant phenology well. The grassland greened up immediately after burning in April. GCC values showed two peaks with the similar magnitude because of quick recovery of grassland after baling. Satellite-derived VIs and GPP(VPM) showed that the pasture recovered in one month after baling. The GPFvpm matched well (R-2 = 0.89) with the eddy covariance-derived GPP (GPP(EC)). Grazing in the late growing season did not influence plant phenology (VIs and GCC) and carbon uptake (GPP) as plants were in the late growing stage. Neither did it affect GPP differently in those two conditions because of even grazing intensity. The reduction in GPP after baling was compensated by higher GPP after large rain events in late July and early September, causing little seasonal differences in GPP (-0.002 g Cm-2 day(-1)) between the baled and unbaled conditions. Interactions of different management practices with climate make it complicated to understand the impacts of different management practices on carbon dynamics and plant phenology. Thus, it is necessary to further investigate the responses of pastures to different management practices under different climate regimes at multiple temporal and spatial scales.

TI  - Evaluation of Aerosol Optical Depth and Aerosol Models from VIIRS Retrieval Algorithms over North China Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched on Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite in late 2011. Similar to the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), VIIRS observes top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance and is potentially suitable for retrieval of the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The VIIRS Environmental Data Record data (VIIRS_EDR) is produced operationally by NOAA, and is based on the MODIS atmospheric correction algorithm. The "MODIS-like" VIIRS data (VIIRS_ML) are being produced experimentally at NASA, from a version of the "dark-target" algorithm that is applied to MODIS. In this study, the AOD and aerosol model types from these two VIIRS retrieval algorithms over the North China Plain (NCP) are evaluated using the ground-based CE318 Sunphotometer (CE318) measurements during 2 May 2012-31 March 2014 at three sites. These sites represent three different surface types: urban (Beijing), suburban (XiangHe) and rural (Xinglong). Firstly, we evaluate the retrieved spectral AOD. For the three sites, VIIRS_EDR AOD at 550 nm shows a positive mean bias (MB) of 0.04-0.06 and the correlation of 0.83-0.86, with the largest MB (0.10-0.15) observed in Beijing. In contrast, VIIRS_ML AOD at 550 nm has overall higher positive MB of 0.13-0.14 and a higher correlation (0.93-0.94) with CE318 AOD. Secondly, we evaluate the aerosol model types assumed by each algorithm, as well as the aerosol optical properties used in the AOD retrievals. The aerosol model used in VIIRS_EDR algorithm shows that dust and clean urban models were the dominant model types during the evaluation period. The overall accuracy rate of the aerosol model used in VIIRS_ML over NCP three sites (0.48) is higher than that of VIIRS_EDR (0.27). The differences in Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) at 670 nm between VIIRS_ML and CE318 are mostly less than 0.015, but high seasonal differences are found especially over the Xinglong site. The values of SSA from VIIRS_EDR are higher than that observed by CE318 over all sites and all assumed aerosol modes, with a positive bias of 0.02-0.04 for fine mode, 0.06-0.12 for coarse mode and 0.03-0.05 for bi-mode at 440 nm. The overestimation of SSA but positive AOD MB of VIIRS_EDR indicate that other factors (e.g., surface reflectance characterization or cloud contamination) are important sources of error in the VIIRS_EDR algorithm, and their effects on aerosol retrievals may override the effects from non-ideality in these aerosol models.

TI  - The dynamic response of forest vegetation to hydrothermal conditions in the Funiu Mountains of western Henan Province
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper uses HJ-1 satellite multi-spectral and multi-temporal data to extract forest vegetation information in the Funiu Mountain region. The S-G filtering algorithm was employed to reconstruct the MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time-series data for the period of 2000-2013, and these data were correlated with air temperature and precipitation data to explore the responses of forest vegetation to hydrothermal conditions. The results showed that: (1) the Funiu Mountain region has relatively high and increasing forest coverage with an average EVI of 0.48 over the study period, and the EVI first shows a decreasing trend with increased elevation below 200 m, then an increasing trend from 200-1700 m, and finally a decreasing trend above 1700 m. However, obvious differences could be identified in the responses of different forest vegetation types to climate change. Broad-leaf deciduous forest, being the dominant forest type in the region, had the most significant EVI increase. (2) Temperature in the region showed an increasing trend over the 14 years of the study with an anomaly increasing rate of 0.27 degrees C/10a; a fluctuating yet increasing trend could be identified for the precipitation anomaly percentage. (3) Among all vegetation types, the evergreen broad-leaf forest has the closest EVI-temperature correlation, whereas the mixed evergreen and deciduous forest has the weakest. Almost all forest types showed a weak negative EVI-precipitation correlation, except the mixed evergreen and deciduous forest with a weak positive correlation. (4) There is a slight delay in forest vegetation responses to air temperature and precipitation, with half a month only for limited areas of the mixed evergreen and deciduous forest.

TI  - Regional hard coral distribution within geomorphic and reef flat ecological zones determined by satellite imagery of the Xisha Islands, South China Sea
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs in the Xisha Islands (also known as the Paracel Islands in English), South China Sea, have experienced dramatic declines in coral cover. However, the current regional scale hard coral distribution of geomorphic and ecological zones, essential for reefs management in the context of global warming and ocean acidification, is not well documented. We analyzed data from field surveys, Landsat-8 and GF-1 images to map the distribution of hard coral within geomorphic zones and reef flat ecological zones. In situ surveys conducted in June 2014 on nine reefs provided a complete picture of reef status with regard to live coral diversity, evenness of coral cover and reef health (live versus dead cover) for the Xisha Islands. Mean coral cover was 12.5% in 2014 and damaged reefs seemed to show signs of recovery. Coral cover in sheltered habitats such as lagoon patch reefs and biotic dense zones of reef flats was higher, but there were large regional differences and low diversity. In contrast, the more exposed reef slopes had high coral diversity, along with high and more equal distributions of coral cover. Mean hard coral cover of other zones was < 10%. The total Xisha reef system was estimated to cover 1 060 km(2), and the emergent reefs covered similar to 787 m(2). Hard corals of emergent reefs were considered to cover 97 km(2). The biotic dense zone of the reef flat was a very common zone on all simple atolls, especially the broader northern reef flats. The total cover of live and dead coral can reach above 70% in this zone, showing an equilibrium between live and dead coral as opposed to coral and algae. This information regarding the spatial distribution of hard coral can support and inform the management of Xisha reef ecosystems.

TI  - Molecular imaging probes for multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography
T2  - CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Multi-Spectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) merges the power of high-resolution imaging at tissue depths of several millimeters to centimeters with the advantages of optical imaging, in large part by exploiting spectral detection of endogenous molecules in tissue or exogenous photoabsorbing probes. Current advances in fast-tuning laser technology, image reconstruction and spectral detection schemes have yielded real-time optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging spanning applications from microscopy to human imaging. This progress has generated an unprecedented need for imaging probes and reporter gene approaches optimized for optoacoustic signal generation. New classes of probes are emerging and create new opportunities for visualizing morphological and pathophysiological features in vivo, in a non-invasive manner. Here we review recent progress in optoacoustic probes and discuss applications and challenges for biological imaging as well as prospects for clinical translation.

TI  - Dynamically triggered slip on a splay fault in the <i>M<sub>w</sub></i> 7.8, 2016 Kaikoura (New Zealand) earthquake
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the Mw 7.8, 2016 Kaikoura (New Zealand) earthquake by using optical satellite imagery and seismology to reveal the main features of the rupture process. Correlation of Landsat8 images reveals a 30-40 km surface rupture on the Kekerengu Fault and Jordan Thrust, with up to 12 m of right-lateral slip. A previously unrecognized conjugate strike-slip fault, the Papatea Fault, also slipped coseismically (3-4 m). The global centroid moment tensor (gCMT) centroid indicates both thrust and right-lateral slip and is located similar to 100 km NE of the main shock epicenter. The significant non-double-couple component of the gCMT (25%) suggests that the main shock is not well represented by a single planar fault. Back projection of teleseismic P waves reveals two main bursts of seismic radiation: (1) at 10-20 s, near the main shock epicenter, and (2) at similar to 70 s, close to the observed surface ruptures. We determine a finite source kinematic model of the rupture from the inversion of seismic waveforms. We use two faults in our model, defined to match the observed slip on the Kekerengu Fault, and a deeper offshore fault with a lower dip angle to satisfy the long period seismological observations. We compute the equivalent moment tensor from our finite source model and find it to be remarkably consistent with the gCMT solution. Although little is known about the geometry of these faults at depth, if the Kekerengu Fault splays from the deeper thrust, then it provides a rare example where the contribution of slip on a splay fault can be clearly isolated in the seismological waveforms.Plain Language Summary Through a combined analysis of satellite images and seismic waves, we investigate the recent Mw 7.8 earthquake near Kaikoura, New Zealand. We observe major surface ruptures, with up to 12m strike-slip displacement, located far from onset of earthquake slip. Properties of the seismic waves indicate that the earthquake slipped on a dipping thrust fault at depth and propagated to the northeast for 120 s. Halfway through the rupture, the earthquake triggered simultaneous slip on a neighboring fault, which possibly splays from the main thrust, and which was responsible for the observed surface offsets. Splay faults are commonly observed at converging plate boundaries globally and are suspected to pose a seismic and tsunamic hazard. This is the first time where simultaneous slip on a possible megathrust and associated splay fault has been directly observed in the seismic data.

TI  - Soy moratorium impacts on soybean and deforestation dynamics in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has established the usefulness of remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to characterize the spatial dynamics of agriculture in the state of Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil. With these data it has become possible to track MT agriculture, which accounts for similar to 85% of Brazilian Amazon soy production, across periods of several years. Annual land cover (LC) maps support investigation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of agriculture as they relate to forest cover and governance and policy efforts to lower deforestation rates. We use a unique, spatially extensive 9year (2005-2013) ground reference dataset to classify, with approximately 80% accuracy, MODIS VI data, merging the results with carefully processed annual forest and sugarcane coverages developed by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research to produce LC maps for MT for the 2001-2014 crop years. We apply the maps to an evaluation of forest and agricultural intensification dynamics before and after the Soy Moratorium (SoyM), a governance effort enacted in July 2006 to halt deforestation for the purpose of soy production in the Brazilian Amazon. We find the pre-SoyM deforestation rate to be more than five times the postSoyM rate, while simultaneously observing the pre-SoyM forest-to-soy conversion rate to be more than twice the post-SoyM rate. These observations support the hypothesis that SoyM has played a role in reducing both deforestation and subsequent use for soy production. Additional analyses explore the land use tendencies of deforested areas and the conceptual framework of horizontal and vertical agricultural intensification, which distinguishes production increases attributable to cropland expansion into newly deforested areas as opposed to implementation of multi-cropping systems on existing cropland. During the 14-year study period, soy production was found to shift from predominantly single-crop systems to majority double-crop systems.

TI  - Land loss by pond expansion on the Mississippi River Delta Plain
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's river deltas may collapse under the combined effects of rising sea levels, subsidence, and reduced sediment supply. Saving these deltaic environments requires quantifying processes driving collapse. In the Mississippi River Delta, rapid land loss offers an important opportunity to test existing theories for marsh collapse. We use Landsat images to examine how pond expansion by edge retreat contributes to land loss over 34 years in the Atchafalaya-Vermillion, Terrebonne, and Barataria basins of the Mississippi Delta. Tracking the area changes in ponds on the marsh surface, we find a striking consistency between pond expansion direction and the dominant wind direction and show that wind-generated waves are capable of causing edge erosion. Expansion rate increases rapidly for ponds wider than 300 m in Terrebonne and Barataria basins. From this, we suggest that ponds in Atchafalaya-Vermillion basin are stable, whereas ponds in Terrebonne and Barataria are unstable.

TI  - Albedo changes after fire as an explanation of fire-induced rainfall suppression
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observational evidence of rainfall suppression by fire has recently been documented in African drylands, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here we investigate the extent to which fire-induced changes in latent heat flux and albedo may inhibit boundary layer predisposition to convective rainfall. We use Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 reanalysis data from the Kalahari region of Southern Africa to drive a low-dimensional boundary layer growth model. We find that both increased albedo and, to a lesser extent, increased latent heat flux could result in less convective rainfall. The sensitivity to land surface feedbacks is higher earlier in the dry season and at drier sites. Finally, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer fire and albedo data, we present novel evidence that increases in albedo after fire, or brightening, are common in regions receiving less than 850mm of precipitation annually. This supports the idea that fire-induced surface brightening is responsible for observed rainfall deficits after fire.

TI  - Aboveground biomass estimation of mangrove species using ALOS-2 PALSAR imagery in Hai Phong City, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the potential of using the HH and HV backscatter from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) with enhanced phased array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) in high sensitive mode to estimate the above-ground biomass (AGB) of the two mangrove species of Hai Phong city, Vietnam. A positive correlation was observed between the mean backscattering coefficients of the dominant mangrove species at dual polarizations HH and HV and various biophysical parameters. In contrast, low correlations were observed between those coefficients and the tree densities for the two mangrove species. The AGB of the mangrove species were estimated at between 2.8 and 161.5 Mg ha(-1) with an average of about 39 Mg ha(-1) for Sonneratia caseolaris and between 27.6 and 209.2 Mg ha(-1) with an average of similar to 100 Mg ha(-1) for Kandelia obovata. The main indicators used for the selection of the best potential models in estimating the AGB of different species were R-2 and the root-mean- square error (RMSE). The results showed a satisfactory correlation between model estimation and field-based measurements with R-2 = 0.51, RMSE = 35.5 Mg ha(-1) for S. caseolaris and R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 41.3 Mg ha(-1) for K. obovata. This research has illustrated the potential use of ALOS-2 PALSAR data in estimating the AGB of mangrove species in the tropics. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Improving climate projections by understanding how cloud phase affects radiation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Whether a cloud is predominantly water or ice strongly influences interactions between clouds and radiation coming down from the Sun or up from the Earth. Being able to simulate cloud phase transitions accurately in climate models based on observational data sets is critical in order to improve confidence in climate projections, because this uncertainty contributes greatly to the overall uncertainty associated with cloud-climate feedbacks. Ultimately, it translates into uncertainties in Earth's sensitivity to higher CO2 levels. While a lot of effort has recently been made toward constraining cloud phase in climate models, more remains to be done to document the radiative properties of clouds according to their phase. Here we discuss the added value of a new satellite data set that advances the field by providing estimates of the cloud radiative effect as a function of cloud phase and the implications for climate projections.

TI  - Lower-tropospheric CO<sub>2</sub> from near-infrared ACOS-GOSAT observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present two new products from near-infrared Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) observations: lowermost tropospheric (LMT, from 0 to 2.5 km) and upper tropospheric-stratospheric (U, above 2.5 km) carbon dioxide partial column mixing ratios. We compare these new products to aircraft profiles and remote surface flask measurements and find that the seasonal and year-to-year variations in the new partial column mixing ratios significantly improve upon the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) and GOSAT (ACOS-GOSAT) initial guess and/or a priori, with distinct patterns in the LMT and U seasonal cycles that match validation data. For land monthly averages, we find errors of 1.9, 0.7, and 0.8 ppm for retrieved GOSAT LMT, U, and X CO2; for ocean monthly averages, we find errors of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.5 ppm for retrieved GOSAT LMT, U, and X CO2. In the southern hemispheric biomass burning season, the new partial columns show similar patterns to MODIS fire maps and MOPITT multispectral CO for both vertical levels, despite a flat ACOS-GOSAT prior, and a CO-CO2 emission factor comparable to published values. The difference of LMT and U, useful for evaluation of model transport error, has also been validated with a monthly average error of 0.8 (1.4) ppm for ocean (land). LMT is more locally influenced than U, meaning that local fluxes can now be better separated from CO2 transported from far away.

TI  - Periodicities of polar mesospheric clouds inferred from a meteorological analysis and forecast system
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is currently an ambiguity in what controls polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) periodicities near 83km altitude. This is primarily because satellite and ground-based data sets cannot resolve global mesospheric temperature variability over the diurnal cycle. To address this limitation, we employ a global meteorological analysis and forecast system that assimilates mesospheric satellite data with two significant advances. The first is that we use output at a more rapid one hourly cadence, allowing for a quantitative description of diurnal (24h), semidiurnal (12h), and terdiurnal oscillations. The second is that the output drives a simple PMC parameterization which depends only on the local temperature, pressure, and water vapor concentrations. Our study focuses on results from July 2009 in the Northern Hemisphere and January 2008 in the Southern Hemisphere. We find that the 24h migrating temperature tide as well as the 12h and 24h nonmigrating tides dominate northern PMC oscillations whereas the 12h and 24h nonmigrating tides dominate southern oscillations. Monthly averaged amplitudes for each of these components are generally 2-6K with the larger amplitudes at lower PMC latitudes (50 degrees). The 2day and 5day planetary waves also contribute in both hemispheres, with monthly averaged amplitudes from 1 to 3K although these amplitudes can be as high as 4-6K on some days. Over length scales of similar to 1000km and timescales of similar to 1week, we find that local temperature oscillations adequately describe midlatitude PMC observations.

TI  - Global soil moisture bimodality in satellite observations and climate models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A new diagnostic metric based on soil moisture bimodality is developed in order to examine and compare soil moisture from satellite observations and Earth System Models. The methodology to derive this diagnostic is based on maximum likelihood estimator encoded into an iterative algorithm, which is applied to the soil moisture probability density function. This metric is applied to satellite data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System and global climate models data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Results show high soil moisture bimodality in transitional climate areas and high latitudes, potentially associated with land-atmosphere feedback processes. When comparing satellite versus climate models, a clear difference in their soil moisture bimodality is observed, with systematically higher values in the case of CMIP5 models. These differences appear related to areas where land-atmospheric feedback may be overestimated in current climate models.

TI  - A comparison of Aqua MODIS ice and liquid water cloud physical and optical properties between collection 6 and collection 5.1: Pixel-to-pixel comparisons
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We compare differences in ice and liquid water cloud physical and optical properties between Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6 (C6) and collection 5.1 (C51). The C6 cloud products changed significantly due to improved calibration, improvements based on comparisons with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization, treatment of subpixel liquid water clouds, introduction of a roughened ice habit for C6 rather than the use of smooth ice particles in C51, and more. The MODIS cloud products form a long-term data set for analysis, modeling, and various purposes. Thus, it is important to understand the impact of the changes. Two cases are considered for C6 to C51 comparisons. Case 1 considers pixels with valid cloud retrievals in both C6 and C51, while case 2 compares all valid cloud retrievals in each collection. One year (2012) of level-2 MODIS cloud products are examined, including cloud effective radius (CER), optical thickness (COT), water path, cloud top pressure (CTP), cloud top temperature, and cloud fraction. Large C6-C51 differences are found in the ice CER (regionally, as large as 15m) and COT (decrease in annual average by approximately 25%). Liquid water clouds have higher CTP in marine stratocumulus regions in C6 but lower CTP globally (-5hPa), and there are 66% more valid pixels in C6 (case 2) due to the treatment of pixels with subpixel clouds. Simulated total cloud radiative signatures from C51 and C6 are compared to Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced And Filled (EBAF) product. The C6 CREs compare more closely with the EBAF than the C51 counterparts.

TI  - A comparison of Aqua MODIS ice and liquid water cloud physical and optical properties between collection 6 and collection 5.1: Cloud radiative effects
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In our companion study, we show how cloud property products change from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) collection 5.1 (C51) to collection 6 (C6) for both ice and liquid water clouds through a pixel-to-pixel comparison. However, the question remains as to the full impacts of these cloud property differences between collections on the inference of cloud radiative effects (CREs). In this study, we address this question from a modeling perspective using oneyear (2012) of MODIS gridded annual-averaged ice/liquid water cloud properties at 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees spatial resolution. The rapid radiative transfer model for general circulation model applications is used to simulate the broadband radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere under clear-sky and cloudy-sky conditions. The shortwave, longwave, and net radiative effects of ice, liquid water, and total clouds are derived individually assuming different cloud optical property parameterization schemes. The results provide quantifications of ice and liquid water CRE contributions to the total CRE. We find significant differences in the simulated CREs between C6 and C51 for ice clouds (up to 23Wm(-2) for the shortwave CRE) and liquid water clouds (approximately -4.5Wm(-2) for the shortwave CRE). The C6 total CRE provides the closest match with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced And Filled product. Sensitivity studies are performed to estimate the impacts of different ice optical parameterization schemes and multilayer cloud overlap assumptions. Results show that the C6-C51 CRE differences are larger than the CRE variations caused by the other factors.

TI  - Epidemiological role of dogs since the human leishmaniosis outbreak in Madrid
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) has been in the spotlight since the 2009 outbreak of human leishmaniosis in Madrid. In the framework of the Leishmaniosis Surveillance Programme set up in Madrid, this study examines Leishmania-specific seroprevalences in stray dogs for the outbreak area and rest of the Madrid region over the period spanning from the outbreak to the present (2009-2016). These data are of interest because stray dogs could be sentinels for disease surveillance in endemic areas. Since 2011, we have also been monitoring owned dogs in the outbreak area.Methods: Over the study period, Leishmania infantum seroprevalence was determined in 2,123 stray dogs from the outbreak and non-outbreak areas. A serological study was also performed for owned dogs in the outbreak area: high-risk dogs such as hunting or farm dogs (n = 1,722) and pets (n = 1372). All dogs were examined and blood was collected. The variables recorded for each animal were: breed, age, sex, and clinical history indicating if the animal was healthy or clinically suspected of having any disease, and if they showed a clinical picture compatible with CanL.Results: Seroprevalences of L. infantum in stray dogs were similar in the two areas examined: 4.7% (20 out of 346) in the outbreak area and 5.4% (96 out of 1,777) in the remaining Madrid region (x(2) = 0.080, P = 0.777). A significant association was found between seroprevalence and age (z = - 6.319; P < 0.001). Seroprevalence in owned dogs in the outbreak area was 2.1% in high-risk dogs (37 out of 1,722) and 1.2% in pets (17 out of 1,372) (x(2) = 3.561, P = 0.0591).Conclusions: Both stray and owned dogs do not seem to play an important role in maintaining the transmission cycle of L. infantum in the Madrid outbreak area. The stable seroprevalence of infection observed in sentinel dogs suggests the good clinical management and prevention of CanL by local practitioners in owned dogs.

TI  - Value of evidence from syndromic surveillance with cumulative evidence from multiple data streams with delayed reporting
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Delayed reporting of health data may hamper the early detection of infectious diseases in surveillance systems. Furthermore, combining multiple data streams, e.g. aiming at improving a system's sensitivity, can be challenging. In this study, we used a Bayesian framework where the result is presented as the value of evidence, i.e. the likelihood ratio for the evidence under outbreak versus baseline conditions. Based on a historical data set of routinely collected cattle mortality events, we evaluated outbreak detection performance (sensitivity, time to detection, in-control run length) under the Bayesian approach among three scenarios: presence of delayed data reporting, but not accounting for it; presence of delayed data reporting accounted for; and absence of delayed data reporting (i.e. an ideal system). Performance on larger and smaller outbreaks was compared with a classical approach, considering syndromes separately or combined. We found that the Bayesian approach performed better than the classical approach, especially for the smaller outbreaks. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach performed similarly well in the scenario where delayed reporting was accounted for to the scenario where it was absent. We argue that the value of evidence framework may be suitable for surveillance systems with multiple syndromes and delayed reporting of data.

TI  - Designing Patient-Centered Text Messaging Interventions for Increasing Physical Activity Among Participants With Type 2 Diabetes: Qualitative Results From the Text to Move Intervention.
T2  - JMIR mHealth and uHealth
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease affecting approximately 29.1 million people in the United States, and an additional 86 million adults have prediabetes. Diabetes self-management education, a complex health intervention composed of 7 behaviors, is effective at improving self-care behaviors and glycemic control. Studies have employed text messages for education, reminders, and motivational messaging that can serve as "cues to action," aiming to improve glucose monitoring, self-care behaviors, appointment attendance, and medication adherence.OBJECTIVES: The Text to Move (TTM) study was a 6-month 2-parallel group randomized controlled trial of individuals with T2DM to increase physical activity, measured by a pedometer. The intervention arm received text messages twice daily for 6 months that were tailored to the participant's stage of behavior change as defined by the transtheoretical model of behavior change.METHODS: We assessed participants' attitudes regarding their experience with text messaging, focusing on perceived barriers and facilitators, through two focus groups and telephone interviews. All interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach.RESULTS: The response rate was 67% (31/46 participants). The average age was 51.4 years and 61% (19/31 participants) were male. The majority of individuals were English speakers and married, had completed at least 12th grade and approximately half of the participants were employed full-time. Overall, participants were satisfied with the TTM program and recalled the text messages as educational, informational, and motivational. Program involvement increased the sense of connection with their health care center. The wearing of pedometers and daily step count information served as motivational reminders and created a sense of accountability through the sentinel effect. However, there was frustration concerning the automation of the text message program, including the repetitiveness, predictability of text time delivery, and lack of customization and interactivity of text message content. Participants recommended personalization of texting frequency as well as more contact time with personnel for a stronger sense of support, including greater surveillance and feedback based on their own results and comparison to other participants.CONCLUSIONS: Participants in a theory-based text messaging intervention identified key facilitators and barriers to program efficacy that should be incorporated into future texting interventions to optimize participant satisfaction and outcomes.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01569243; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01569243 (Archived by Webcite at http://www.webcitation.org/6pfH6yXag).

TI  - Updated MISR dark water research aerosol retrieval algorithm Part 1: Coupled 1.1km ocean surface chlorophyll <i>a</i> retrievals with empirical calibration corrections
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - As aerosol amount and type are key factors in the "atmospheric correction" required for remote-sensing chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) retrievals, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) can contribute to ocean color analysis despite a lack of spectral channels optimized for this application. Conversely, an improved ocean surface constraint should also improve MISR aerosol-type products, especially spectral single-scattering albedo (SSA) retrievals. We introduce a coupled, self-consistent retrieval of Chl together with aerosol over dark water. There are time-varying MISR radiometric calibration errors that significantly affect key spectral reflectance ratios used in the retrievals. Therefore, we also develop and apply new calibration corrections to the MISR top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data, based on comparisons with coincident MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations and trend analysis of the MISR TOA bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) over three pseudo-invariant desert sites.We run the MISR research retrieval algorithm (RA) with the corrected MISR reflectances to generate MISR-retrieved Chl and compare the MISR Chl values to a set of 49 coincident SeaBASS (SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System) in situ observations. Where Chl(in situ) < 1.5 mg m(-3), the results from our Chl model are expected to be of highest quality, due to algorithmic assumption validity. Comparing MISR RA Chl to the 49 coincident SeaBASS observations, we report a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.86, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.25, and a median absolute error (MAE) of 0.10. Statistically, a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that it is not possible to distinguish between MISR Chl and available SeaBASS in situ Chl values (p > 0.1). We also compare MODIS-Terra and MISR RA Chl statistically, over much broader regions. With about 1.5 million MISR-MODIS collocations having MODIS Chl < 1.5 mg m(-3), MISR and MODIS show very good agreement: r = 0.96, MAE = 0.09, and RMSE = 0.15.The new dark water aerosol/Chl RA can retrieve Chl in low-Chl, case I waters, independent of other imagers such as MODIS, via a largely physical algorithm, compared to the commonly applied statistical ones. At a minimum, MISR's multi-angle data should help reduce uncertainties in the MODIS-Terra ocean color retrieval where coincident measurements are made, while also allowing for a more robust retrieval of particle properties such as spectral single-scattering albedo.

TI  - The impact of gold mining and agricultural concessions on the tree cover and local communities in northern Myanmar
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Myanmar offers unique opportunities for both biodiversity conservation and foreign direct investment due to projected economic growth linked to natural resource exploitation. Industrial-scale development introduces new land uses into the landscape, with unknown repercussions for local communities and biodiversity conservation. We use participatory mapping of 31 communities, focus groups in 28 communities, and analyses of forest cover change during 2000-2010 using MODIS vegetation continuous fields images, to understand the social and environmental impacts of gold mining and agricultural concessions in Myanmar's Hukaung Valley (similar to 21,800 km(2)). Local communities, particularly the poorest households, benefit from work and trade opportunities offered by gold mining and agricultural companies but continue to depend on forests for house construction materials, food, and income from the sale of forest resources. However, gold mining and agricultural concessions reduce tree cover, potentially reducing access to forest resources and further marginalizing these households. Our analyses do not provide evidence that long-term resident communities contributed to forest cover loss between 2000 and 2010. We argue that landscape management, which recognizes local community rights to customary community use areas, and appropriate zoning for commercial land uses and protected areas could contribute to both local livelihoods and protect biodiversity throughout Myanmar during economic growth.

TI  - Fluorescence Imaging Topography Scanning System for intraoperative multimodal imaging
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence imaging is a powerful technique with diverse applications in intraoperative settings. Visualization of three dimensional (3D) structures and depth assessment of lesions, however, are oftentimes limited in planar fluorescence imaging systems. In this study, a novel Fluorescence Imaging Topography Scanning ( FITS) system has been developed, which offers color reflectance imaging, fluorescence imaging and surface topography scanning capabilities. The system is compact and portable, and thus suitable for deployment in the operating room without disturbing the surgical flow. For system performance, parameters including near infrared fluorescence detection limit, contrast transfer functions and topography depth resolution were characterized. The developed system was tested in chicken tissues ex vivo with simulated tumors for intraoperative imaging. We subsequently conducted in vivo multimodal imaging of sentinel lymph nodes in mice using FITS and PET/CT. The PET/CT/optical multimodal images were co-registered and conveniently presented to users to guide surgeries. Our results show that the developed system can facilitate multimodal intraoperative imaging.

AB  - A 68-year-old woman presented with visible haematuria. Ultrasonography and triphasic CT revealed a 2.6cm mass in the lower pole of the left kidney. A biopsy suggested low-grade renal cell carcinoma. Radical nephrectomy was performed and revealed an epithelioid angiomyolipoma. At year 3, the patient developed ductal carcinoma of the right breast and underwent a wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 4 months later, she was noted to have a 1.6cm nodule in the middle lobe of her right lung. The primary differential diagnosis was a breast cancer metastasis. Biopsy revealed a metastatic renal epithelioid angiomyolipoma. The patient elected to have stereotactic radiotherapy over surgical excision. Renal angiomyolipomata are generally regarded as benign tumours. In the present report, we describe the first case of pulmonary metastasis from renal epithelioid angiomyolipoma in the setting of breast cancer.

TI  - Investigation of the aerosol-cloud-rainfall association over the Indian summer monsoon region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monsoonal rainfall is the primary source of surface water in India. Using 12 years of in situ and satellite observations, we examined the association of aerosol loading with cloud fraction, cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature, and daily surface rainfall over the Indian summer monsoon region (ISMR). Our results showed positive correlations between aerosol loading and cloud properties as well as rainfall. A decrease in outgoing longwave radiation and an increase in reflected shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere with an increase in aerosol loading further indicates a possible seminal role of aerosols in the deepening of cloud systems. Significant perturbation in liquid-and ice-phase microphysics was also evident over the ISMR. For the polluted cases, delay in the onset of collision-coalescence processes and an enhancement in the condensation efficiency allows for more condensate mass to be lifted up to the mixed colder phases. This results in the higher mass concentration of larger-sized ice-phase hydrometeors and, therefore, implies that the delayed rain processes eventually lead to more surface rainfall. A numerical simulation of a typical rainfall event case over the ISMR using a spectral bin microphysical scheme coupled with the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF-SBM) model was also performed. Simulated microphysics also illustrated that the initial suppression of warm rain coupled with an increase in updraft velocity under high aerosol loading leads to enhanced super-cooled liquid droplets above freezing level and ice-phase hydrometeors, resulting in increased accumulated surface rainfall. Thus, both observational and numerical analysis suggest that high aerosol loading may induce cloud invigoration, thereby increasing surface rainfall over the ISMR. While the meteorological variability influences the strength of the observed positive association, our results suggest that the persistent aerosol-associated deepening of cloud systems and an intensification of surface rain amounts was applicable to all the meteorological sub-regimes over the ISMR. Hence, we believe that these results provide a step forward in our ability to address aerosol-cloud-rainfall associations based on satellite observations over the ISMR.

TI  - Direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols from crop residue burning during the summer harvest season in East China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - East China experiences extensive crop residue burnings in fields during harvest season. The direct radiative effect (DRE) of carbonaceous aerosols from crop residue burning in June 2013 in East China was investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Absorption of organic aerosol (OA) in the presence of brown carbon was considered using the parameterization of Saleh et al. (2014), in which the imaginary part of the OA refractive index is a function of wavelength and the ratio of black carbon (BC) and OA. The carbonaceous emissions from crop fires were estimated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire radiative power (FRP) product with a localized crop-burning-sourced BC-to-organic carbon (OC) ratio emission ratio of 0.27. Evaluation of the model results with in situ measurements of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) chemical composition, MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) detections and meteorological observations showed that this model was able to reproduce the magnitude, spatial variation and optical characteristics of carbonaceous aerosol pollution. The observed BC and OC peak concentrations at the site in Suixi, Anhui province, during the 2013 wheat burning season reached 55.3 mu g m(-3) and 157.9 mu g m(-3). WRF-Chem simulations reproduced these trends with a correlation coefficient of 0.74, estimating that crop residue burning contributed 86 and 90% of peak BC and OC, respectively. The simulated hourly DRE from crop residue burning at the top of atmosphere (TOA) reached a maximum of +22.66 W m(-2) at the Suixi site. On average, the simulations showed that the crop residue burning introduced a net positive DRE of +0.14 W m(-2) at TOA throughout East China, with BC from this source as the main heating contributor (+0.79 W m(-2)). The OA DRE from crop burning (0.22 W m(-2)) was a combined effect of the positive DRE of absorption (+0.21 W m(-2)) and a stronger negative DRE of scattering (0.43 W m(-2)). Sensitivity tests showed that the DRE of OA absorption strongly depended on the imaginary part of the OA refractive index, the BC-to-OA emission ratio from crop residue burning and the assumed mixing state of the aerosol, whereby the volume mixing treatment resulted in a higher positive DRE compared to the core-shell treatment. The BC mixing state and associated absorption enhancement during BC aging processes will be investigated in detail in future research.

Whether inappropriate complementary feeding (CF) practices compromise optimal growth during late infancy in Indonesia is uncertain. Therefore we characterized and evaluated CF practices in Indonesian infants and investigated their relationship with subsequent growth. We enrolled breastfed infants at 6 months of age (n = 230); and followed them at 9 (n = 202) and 12 months of age (n = 190). We collected socio-demographic and anthropometric data and two-day in-home weighed food records. Relations between WHO CF indicators, sentinel foods, and energy and micronutrient intakes at 9 months and growth at 12 months were explored using multiple linear regression. Stunting and underweight increased from 15.8% and 4.4% at 6 months to 22.6% and 10.5% at 12 months, respectively. Median intakes of calcium, iron, zinc, and riboflavin were below WHO recommendations. Infants consuming fortified infant foods (FIFs) at 9 months had diets with a lower dietary diversity (DD) score (2.3 vs. 3.0), energy density, median energy (250 vs. 310 kcal/d) and protein (6.5 vs. 9.1 g/d) intake than non-consumers (p<0.01), despite higher intakes of calcium, iron, and vitamins A and C (p<0.001). Positive relations existed for 9-month consumption of iron-rich/iron fortified infant foods with length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) at 12 months (beta = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.44; P = 0.04), and for fortified infant foods alone with both LAZ (beta = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.48; P = 0.04) and weight-for-age Z-score (beta = 0.14; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.26; P = 0.02) at 12 months. The positive association of FIFs with subsequent growth may be attributed to their content of both powdered cow's milk and multi-micronutrient fortificants. Nonetheless, mothers should not be encouraged to over-rely on FIFs as they reduce DD.

TI  - Transmission of <i>Ostreid herpesvirus</i>-1 microvariant in seawater: Detection of viral DNA in seawater, filter retentates, filter membranes and sentinel <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> spat in upwellers
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the transmission of Ostreid herpesvirus-1 microvariant(s) (OsHV-1) in seawater, it is necessary to understand the temporal pattern of occurrence of the virus in seawater in relation to demonstrated infection events in oysters. The aims of the current study were: (1) to investigate the temporal sequence of detection of OsHV-1 in seawater and Crassostrea gigas spat in an upweller system, (2) to assess whether filtration or ageing of seawater reduced the detection of OsHV-1 in seawater and spat, and (3) to assess whether retentate or membranes from filters that were installed to enable continuous sampling of particles in seawater could be used for OsHV-1 surveillance and to investigate OsHV-1 particulate attachment. This study is the first to detect OsHV-1 DNA in 5 mu m retentates and membranes used to continuously filter natural seawater. OsHV-1 DNA was detected in seawater before it was detected in oysters in 65.4% of the 26 detection events examined across 6 trials in an OsHV-1 endemic estuary. The time of sampling (morning or afternoon) did not affect the detection of OsHV-1 DNA in seawater. Seawater treatment by filtration or ageing did not reduce the frequency of detection of OsHV-1 DNA in seawater. In contrast, the odds of detecting OsHV-1 DNA in the tissues of oysters kept in aged seawater and some filtered seawater treatments were reduced (odds ratios: 0.16-0.36) in comparison to the control. Although OsHV-1 DNA was detected in the retentate from 5 mu m filtration, it is unlikely these samples will be useful for investigating OsHV-1 particle attachment due to low viral signals. Similarly, OsHV-1 DNA was detected on the 5 mu m filter membranes, however further investigation is required to ascertain their usefulness in assessing OsHV-1 particle attachment. Despite this and with further development, 5 mu m filter retentates and filter membranes may prove to be useful samples for the surveillance of OsHV-1 in seawater. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Climatic factors driving vegetation declines in the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with global climate change, the occurrence of extreme droughts in recent years has had a serious impact on the Amazon region. Current studies on the driving factors of the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts has focused on the influence of precipitation, whereas the impacts of temperature and radiation have received less attention. This study aims to explore the climate-driven factors of Amazonian vegetation decline during the extreme droughts using vegetation index, precipitation, temperature and radiation datasets. First, time-lag effects of Amazonian vegetation responses to precipitation, radiation and temperature were analyzed. Then, a multiple linear regression model was established to estimate the contributions of climatic factors to vegetation greenness, from which the dominant climate- driving factors were determined. Finally, the climate-driven factors of Amazonian vegetation greenness decline during the 2005 and 2010 extreme droughts were explored. The results showed that (i) in the Amazon vegetation greenness responded to precipitation, radiation and temperature, with apparent time lags for most averaging interval periods associated with vegetation index responses of 0-4, 0-9 and 0-6 months, respectively; (ii) on average, the three climatic factors without time lags explained 27.28 +/- 21.73% (mean +/- 1 SD) of vegetation index variation in the Amazon basin, and this value increased by 12.22% and reached 39.50 +/- 27.85% when time lags were considered; (iii) vegetation greenness in this region in non-drought years was primarily affected by precipitation and shortwave radiation, and these two factors altogether accounted for 93.47% of the total explanation; and (iv) in the common epicenter of the two droughts, pixels with a significant variation in precipitation, radiation and temperature accounted for 36.68%, 40.07% and 10.40%, respectively, of all pixels showing a significant decrease in vegetation index in 2005, and 15.69%, 2.01% and 45.25% in 2010, respectively. Overall, vegetation greenness declines during the 2005 and 2010 extreme droughts were adversely influenced by precipitation, radiation and temperature; this study provides evidence of the influence of multiple climatic factors on vegetation during the 2005 and 2010 Amazon droughts.

TI  - A method to diverge reflected beam uniformly using cube-corner retroreflector array with dihedral angle tolerances
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The cube-corner retroreflector (CCR) is widely applied in the electro-optical tracking, satellite communication, interferometers and adjust-free solid state laser. In some applications, the incident beam emitted by a laser is reflected back by the CCR to a photoelectric detector. The distance between the photoelectric detector and the laser source on the ground is much larger than the diffraction-limited spot. Meanwhile, the attitude angle of the CCR would randomly vary for the jitter of the platform. Therefore, the reflected beam should be diverged uniformly at far-field, whereas the normal CCR cannot achieve the divergence on the reflected beam. The investigation indicated that six sub-spots are generated by a CCR with dihedral angle tolerances at far-field. According the characteristics of the CCR with dihedral angle tolerances, a structure and its design method are proposed to diverge the reflected beam with a CCR array. The azimuthal angles of the every CCR of the array should be specially designed to generate an annular and uniform pattern. Due to the propagation distance is much larger than the size of the CCR array, the feasibility of the method is analyzed by the wave theory. A CCR array with a divergence half-angle of 0.5 mrad is designed, in which the dihedral angle tolerance of every CCR is 20''. The influences of the beam and structure parameters on the diffraction characteristics of the reflected beam are investigated. The numerical results indicate the divergence half-angle of the CCR array varies quasi-linearly with the change of the dihedral angle tolerance, and the intensity distribution of the incident beam does not influence the divergence half-angle. The propagation distance does not affect the uniformity of the reflected beam when the CCR array satisfies the point source condition. When the number of the array element increases to a certain value, the increase of the number can strengthen the intensity and hardly influences the uniformity of the reflected beam. For the restriction of the machining and assembling technics, the dihedral angle tolerance of every CCR is hardly identical and the assembling azimuthal angles of the array element can not be identical with the design result. Therefore, the influence of the assemblage azimuth error and machining accuracy of the dihedral angle are studied. It reveals that the assemblage azimuth error does not remarkably the reflection pattern, whereas the machining accuracy can observably affect the uniformity of the reflection pattern, which can be resolved by the growth of the number of array element.

TI  - Preliminary results from direct-to-facility vaccine deliveries in Kano, Nigeria
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: As part of its vaccine supply chain redesign efforts, Kano state now pushes vaccines directly from 6 state stores to primary health centers equipped with solar refrigerators. Our objective is to describe preliminary results from the first 20 months of Kano's direct vaccine delivery operations.Methods: This is a retrospective review of Kano's direct vaccine delivery program. We analyzed trends in health facility vaccine stock levels, and examined the relationship between stock-out rates and each of cascade vaccine deliveries and timeliness of deliveries. Analysis of vaccination trends was based on administrative data from 27 sentinel health facilities. Costs for both the in-sourced and out-sourced approaches were estimated using a bottoms-up model-based approach.Results: Overall stock adequacy increased from 54% in the first delivery cycle to 68% by cycle 33. Conversely, stock-out rates decreased from 41% to 10% over the same period. Similar trends were observed in the out-sourced and in-sourced programs. Stock-out rates rose incrementally with increasing number of cascade facilities, and delays in vaccine deliveries correlated strongly with stock-out rates. Recognizing that stock availability is one of many factors contributing to vaccinations, we nonetheless compared pre-and post-direct deliveries vaccinations in sentinel facilities, and found statistically significant upward trends for 4 out of 6 antigens. 1 antigen (measles) showed an upward trend that was not statistically significant. Hepatitis b vaccinations declined during the period. Overall, there appeared to be a one-year lag between commencement of direct deliveries and the increase in number of vaccinations. Weighted average cost per delivery is US$29.8 and cost per child immunized is US$0.7 per year.Conclusion: Direct vaccine delivery to health facilities in Kano, through a streamlined architecture, has resulted in decreased stock-outs and improved stock adequacy. Concurrent operation of insourced and outsourced programs has enabled Kano build in-house logistics capabilities. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Development and assessment of a higher-spatial-resolution (4.4 km) MISR aerosol optical depth product using AERONET-DRAGON data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since early 2000, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite has been acquiring data that have been used to produce aerosol optical depth (AOD) and particle property retrievals at 17.6 km spatial resolution. Capitalizing on the capabilities provided by multi-angle viewing, the current operational (Version 22) MISR algorithm performs well, with about 75% of MISR AOD retrievals globally falling within 0.05 or 20% x AOD of paired validation data from the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). This paper describes the development and assessment of a prototype version of a higher-spatial-resolution 4.4 km MISR aerosol optical depth product compared against multiple AERONET Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observations Network (DRAGON) deployments around the globe. In comparisons with AERONET-DRAGON AODs, the 4.4 km resolution retrievals show improved correlation (r = 0.9595), smaller RMSE (0.0768), reduced bias (-0.0208), and a larger fraction within the expected error envelope (80.92 %) relative to the Version 22 MISR retrievals.

TI  - Surgical treatment in Paget's disease with invasive ductal carcinoma: an observational study based on SEER
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim is to analyse the clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes in patients with Paget's disease with invasive ductal carcinoma (PD-IDC), with special emphasis on the role of surgical treatment. Using data obtained by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program from 2010-2013, we investigated the differences in characteristics, overall survival (OS), and breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) between patients with PD-IDC and those with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Compared with IDC group, patients with PD-IDC had a better prognosis and lower mortality in adjusted analyses. In the multivariate analysis of cases with PD-IDC, history of ALND was significantly associated with OS while Her2 status were associated with BCSM. Further, subgroup analysis demonstrated no difference between surgical treatment subgroups for either OS or BCSM. The results demonstrated that PD-IDC appears to alter the association between prognosis and Her2 status. Meanwhile, breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy may be a feasible treatment alternative and sentinel lymph node biopsy should be considered as an appropriate treatment for patients with PD-IDC.

TI  - An analysis of the 2016 Hitomi breakup event
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The breakup of Hitomi (ASTRO-H) on 26 March 2016 is analysed. Debris from the fragmentation is used to estimate the time of the event by propagating backwards and estimating the close approach with the parent object. Based on this method, the breakup event is predicted to have occurred at approximately 01:42 UTC on 26 March 2016. The Gaussian variation of parameters equations based on the instantaneous orbits at the predicted time of the event are solved to gain additional insight into the on-orbit position of Hitomi at the time of the event and to test an alternate approach of determining the event epoch and location. A conjunction analysis is carried out between Hitomi and all catalogued objects which were in orbit around the estimated time of the anomaly. Several debris objects have close approaches with Hitomi; however, there is no evidence to support the breakup was caused by a catalogued object. Debris from both of the largest fragmentation events-the Iridium 33-Cosmos 2251 conjunction in 2009 and the intentional destruction of Fengyun 1C in 2007-is involved in close approaches with Hitomi indicating the persistent threat these events have caused in subsequent space missions. To quantify the magnitude of a potential conjunction, the fragmentation resulting from a collision with the debris is modelled using the EVOLVE-4 breakup model. The debris characteristics are estimated from two-line element data. This analysis is indicative of the threat to space assets that mission planners face due to the growing debris population. The impact of the actual event to the environment is investigated based on the debris associated with Hitomi which is currently contained in the United States Strategic Command's catalogue. A look at the active missions in the orbital vicinity of Hitomi reveals that the Hubble Space Telescope is among the spacecraft which may be immediately affected by the new debris.

TI  - Simultaneous sentinel lymph node computed tomography and locoregional chemotherapy for lymph node metastasis in rabbit using an iodine-docetaxel emulsion
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: A sentinel lymph node (SLN) tracer can gain multi-functionality by combining it with additional components. We developed a SLN tracer consisting of iodine and docetaxel and applied it as a theragnostic nanoparticle to simultaneously perform SLN computed tomography (CT) lymphography and locoregional chemotherapy of the draining lymphatic system.Results: Docetaxel could be loaded in iodine emulsions at a drug-to-surfactant weight ratio as high as that in the drug formulation Taxotere (R). The particle size and drug concentration were stable during storage for up to 3 months in optimized nanoemulsions. Popliteal LN enhancement on CT was observed in all healthy rabbits (n=3) and VX2 tumor-implanted rabbits (n=6) 12 hours after injection. The rate of SLN metastasis was significantly lower in the treatment group (29.4%, 5/17) than in the non-treatment group (70.6%, 12/17) (P=0.038).Material and Methods: We prepared a nanoemulsion carrying both iodine and docetaxel in a single structure by optimizing the composition of surfactants surrounding the inner iodized oil core. CT was performed 12 hours after subcutaneous injection of the emulsion in healthy rabbits (n=3) and VX2 tumor-implanted rabbits (n=6) for SLN imaging. Next, we tested the effect of treatment by histopathologically assessing the popliteal LN metastasis rate in VX2 tumor-implanted rabbits 7 days after subcutaneous injection of the emulsion (treatment group, n=17) and comparing it with that of non-treatment group rabbits (n=17).Conclusions: We developed an iodine-docetaxel emulsion and demonstrated that it can be applied to simultaneously achieve CT SLN imaging and local chemotherapy against nodal metastasis.

TI  - Validation of OMI, GOME-2A and GOME-2B tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub> and HCHO products using MAX-DOAS observations from 2011 to 2014 in Wuxi, China: investigation of the effects of priori profiles and aerosols on the satellite products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) of NO2, SO2 and HCHO derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on AURA and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 aboard METOP-A (GOME-2A) and METOP-B (GOME-2B) are widely used to characterize the global distributions, trends and dominating sources of these trace gases. They are also useful for the comparison with chemical transport models (CTMs). We use tropospheric VCDs and vertical profiles of NO2, SO2 and HCHO derived from MAX-DOAS measurements from 2011 to 2014 in Wuxi, China, to validate the corresponding products (daily and bi-monthly-averaged data) derived from OMI and GOME-2A/B by different scientific teams. Prior to the comparison, the spatial and temporal coincidence criteria for MAX-DOAS and satellite data are determined by a sensitivity study using different spatial and temporal averaging conditions. Cloud effects on both MAX-DOAS and satel-lite observations are also investigated. Our results indicate that the discrepancies between satellite and MAX-DOAS results increase with increasing effective cloud fraction and are dominated by the effects of clouds on the satellite products. In comparison with MAX-DOAS, we found a systematic underestimation of all SO2 (40 to 57 %) and HCHO products (about 20 %), and an overestimation of the GOME2A/B NO2 products (about 30 %), but good consistency with the DOMINO version 2 NO2 product. To better understand the reasons for these differences, we evaluated the a priori profile shapes used in the OMI retrievals (derived from CTM) by comparison with those derived from the MAX-DOAS observations. Significant differences are found for the SO2 and HCHO profile shapes derived from the IMAGES model, whereas on average good agreement is found for the NO2 profile shapes derived from the TM4 model. We also applied the MAX-DOAS profile shapes to the satellite retrievals and found that these modified satellite VCDs agree better with the MAX-DOAS VCDs than the VCDs from the original data sets by up to 10, 47 and 35% for NO2, SO2 and HCHO, respectively. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of aerosols on the satellite retrievals. For OMI observations of NO2, a systematic underestimation is found for large AOD, which is mainly attributed to effect of the aerosols on the cloud retrieval and the subsequent application of a cloud correction scheme (implicit aerosol correction). In contrast, the effect of aerosols on the clear-sky air mass factor (explicit aerosol correction) has a smaller effect. For SO2 and HCHO observations selected in the same way, no clear aerosol effect is found, probably because for the considered data sets no cloud correction is applied (and also because of the larger scatter). From our findings we conclude that for satellite observations with cloud top pressure (CTP) > 900 hPa and effective cloud fraction (eCF) < 10% the application of a clearsky air mass factor might be a good option if accurate aerosol information is not available. Another finding of our study is that the ratio of morning-to-afternoon NO2 VCDs can be considerably overestimated if results from different sensors and/or retrievals (e.g. OMI and GOME-2) are used, whereas fewer deviations for HCHO and SO2 VCDs are found.

TI  - From toes to top-of-atmosphere: Fowler's Sneaker Depth index of water clarity for the Chesapeake Bay
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fowler's Sneaker Depth (FSD), analogous to the well known Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)), is a visually discerned citizen scientist metric used to assess water clarity in the Patuxent River estuary. In this study, a simple remote sensing algorithm was developed to derive FSD from space-borne spectroradiometric imagery. An empirical model was formed that estimates FSD from red-end remote sensing reflectances at 645 nm, R-rs(645). The model is based on a hyperbolic function relating water clarity to Rrs(645) that was established using radiative transfer modeling and fine tuned using in-water FSD measurements and coincident Rrs(645) data observed by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Aqua spacecraft (MODISA). The resultant FSD algorithm was applied to Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager data to derive a short time-series for the Patuxent River estuary from January 2015 to June 2016. Satellite-derived FSD had an inverse, statistically significant relationship (p<0.005) with total suspended sediment concentration (TSS). Further, a distinct negative relationship between FSD and chlorophyll concentration was discerned during periods of high biomass (> 4 mu g L-1). The complex nature of water quality in the mid-toupper Chesapeake Bay was captured using a MODISA-based FSD time series (2002-2016). This study demonstrates how a citizen scientist-conceived observation can be coupled with remote sensing. With further refinement and validation, the FSD may be a useful tool for delivering scientifically relevant results and for informing and engaging local stakeholders and policy makers.
