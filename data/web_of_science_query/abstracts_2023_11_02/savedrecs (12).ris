TI  - Early warnings for multi-stage transitions in dynamics on networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Successfully anticipating sudden major changes in complex systems is a practical concern. Such complex systems often form a heterogeneous network, which may show multi-stage transitions in which some nodes experience a regime shift earlier than others as an environment gradually changes. Here we investigate early warning signals for networked systems undergoing a multi-stage transition. We found that knowledge of both the ongoing multi-stage transition and network structure enables us to calculate effective early warning signals for multi-stage transitions. Furthermore, we found that small subsets of nodes could anticipate transitions as well as or even better than using all the nodes. Even if we fix the network and dynamical system, no single best subset of nodes provides good early warning signals, and a good choice of sentinel nodes depends on the tipping direction and the current stage of the dynamics within a multi-stage transition, which we systematically characterize.

TI  - Estimating and mapping forest age across Canada?s forested ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest age is an important variable for assessments of biodiversity and habitat, sustainable forest and land management, as well as forest carbon science and modeling. Tree and stand age are typically measured directly on site, or estimated through visual photo interpretation, with spatially explicit maps of forest age not often produced over large areas. Remote sensing enables the generation of wall-to wall, spatially explicit maps of disturbance events within the satellite record; however, as disturbance is relatively rare on the landscape in a given year, additional means of determining forest age are required. As reviewed herein, the estimation of forest age using optical Earth observation data is challenging due to the limited spectral link to the attribute of interest, especially as forests get older. The temporally dictated multi-method approach to forest age estimation outlined herein acknowledges these limitations, by applying the approach that is best suited to the quality of the infor-mation available, depending on the epoch of interest. In this research, we combine three approaches to estimate forest age at a 30-m spatial resolution using Landsat data. The first approach uses change detection protocols to detect disturbance from 1985 to 2019, with time since disturbance used as a proxy for forest age. The second approach uses Landsat surface reflectance composites to identify pixels exhibiting evidence of recovery from a disturbance that occurred within the twenty years prior to 1985, allowing for the extension of forest age esti-mates to 1965. Finally, given an understanding of the linkage between forest age and canopy height, inverted allometric equations are coupled with maps of forest structure and productivity metrics to model forest age for those pixels that show no evidence of disturbance or recovery to a maximum of 150 years, acknowledging that uncertainty in age estimate increases with increasing age. Combining these three approaches, forest age esti-mates are made for every treed pixel found within the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada. Nationwide, mean estimated forest age for forests <= 150 years old (representing 94.1% of treed area) was 70 years (standard deviation = 32.1 years). For confidence building, forest age estimates were compared to reported forest age in the National Forest Inventory (NFI) both spatially and aspatially. Nationally, 5.9% of the forested area was estimated to be older than 150 years, while 9.5% of area within in the NFI sample was recorded as older than 150 years. The median estimated forest age for forested pixels <= 150 years old was 68 years while median forest age reported in the NFI was 73 years, with regional variability matching expectations related to disturbance regimes and productivity. Spatially explicit maps of forest age provide important information for understanding forest ecosystems and can be used to inform a wide range of policy, science, and management needs.

TI  - DiD IT?: a differences-in-differences investigation tool to quantify the impact of local incidents on public health using real-time syndromic surveillance health data
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Syndromic surveillance was originally developed to provide early warning compared to laboratory surveillance, but it is increasing used for real-time situational awareness. When a potential threat to public health is identified, a rapid assessment of its impact is required for public health management. When threats are localised, analysis is more complex as local trends need to be separated from national trends and differences compared to unaffected areas may be due to confounding factors such as deprivation or age distributions. Accounting for confounding factors usually requires an in-depth study, which takes time. Therefore, a tool is required which can provide a rapid estimate of local incidents using syndromic surveillance data.Here, we present 'DiD IT?', a new investigation tool designed to measure the impact of local threats to public health. 'DiD IT?' uses a difference-in-differences statistical approach to account for temporal and spatial confounding and provide a direct estimate of impact due to incidents. Temporal confounding differences are estimated by comparing unaffected locations during and outside of exposure periods. Whilst spatial confounding differences are estimated by comparing unaffected and exposed locations outside of the exposure period. Any remaining differences can be considered to be the direct effect of the local incident.We illustrate the potential utility of the tool through four examples of localised health protection incidents in England. The examples cover a range of data sources including general practitioner (GP) consultations, emergency department (ED) attendances and a telehealth call and online health symptom checker; and different types of incidents including, infectious disease outbreak, mass-gathering, extreme weather and an industrial fire. The examples use the UK Health Security Agency's ongoing real-time syndromic surveillance systems to show how results can be obtained in near real-time.The tool identified 700 additional online difficulty breathing assessments associated with a severe thunderstorm, 53 additional GP consultations during a mumps outbreak, 2-3 telehealth line calls following an industrial fire and that there was no significant increase in ED attendances during the G7 summit in 2021.DiD IT? can provide estimates for the direct impact of localised events in real-time as part of a syndromic surveillance system. Thus, it has the potential for enhancing surveillance and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of extending national surveillance to a more granular local surveillance.

TI  - Sway of aerosol on Atmospheric Boundary Layer influencing air pollution of Delhi
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols influence the development of Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) ensuing aggravated air pollution in megacities. ABL Height (ABLH) and Ventilation coefficient (VC) are key aspects in the pollution study that determines the vertical extent of dispersion of pollutants. To address the intricate, multi-sectoral problem of air pollution, a cogent and considerable approach of evalu-ating the influence of aerosol on ABLH is vital. The data from 2019 -2021 over Delhi, presents quantitative evaluation of radiation effect of aerosol on ABL. The study demonstrates qualita-tively that high aerosol loading lowers the ABLH, consecutively causes further increase in aerosol and PM2.5. Lowering of ABLH subsequently lowers the VC. The influence of aerosol on ABL and radiative forcing (RF) is critiqued with correlation coefficient (R) as-0.17 and -0.37 respec-tively. The cooling effect of the surface is enhanced as Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) rises, further impeding the development of ABL. Further, through the interdependence between Single Scat-tering Albedo (SSA) and ABLH, it is speculated that the absorbing aerosols (AA) tend to increase the stability, ultimately leading to lower ABLH. Assessing the link between ABL and air pollution is vital not only for preventing and combating aerosol emissions in Delhi, but also for accurate air quality prediction and numerical weather prediction.

AB  - ABSTRAITEL'occupation et l'usage des sols (LULC) sont des donnees spatiales primordiales car elles constituent une entree essentielle pour la plupart des taches d'analyse et de prevision. Actuellement ces donnees sont obtenues facilement et plus rapidement que par le passe grace aux progres en teledetection, en systeme d'information geographique et en technique d'apprentissage automatique. C'est pourquoi les images satellites sont traitees pour classer l'utilisation des sols. Cette methode offre de nombreux avantages par rapport aux enquetes terrains dans l'espace reel, notamment en matiere de temps et de cout. Cependant, le traitement de donnees LULC a partir d'images satellites basse resolution presente certaines limites, les resultats sont moins precis que lorsqu'on utilise des images haute resolution. En outre, sur certaines zones, l'occupation et l'usage des sols acquises avec ce processus ne sont pas coherentes avec la realite terrain. Par consequence cette recherche a propose une nouvelle classification d'occupation et d'usage des sols a partir d'images Landsat 8 et Sentinel-2, basee sur des techniques d'apprentissage et d'apprentissage ensembliste. Les resultats de l'evaluation de la precision ont montre que la methode proposee classait l'occupation et l'usage des sols avec une precision de 88 %. De plus la methode introduit le developpement d'un systeme de notification qui utilisent des donnees volontaires ou crowdsourcees. En consequence, les donnees LUCL obtenues ont ete considerablement ameliorees, conformement a la realite terrain des zones etudiees.

TI  - Quantifying stimulus-response specificity to probe the functional state of macrophages
T2  - CELL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Immune sentinel macrophages initiate responses to pathogens via hundreds of immune response genes. Each immune threat demands a tailored response, suggesting that the capacity for stimulus-specific gene expression is a key functional hallmark of healthy macrophages. To quantify this property, termed "stim-ulus-response specificity"(SRS), we developed a single-cell experimental workflow and analytical approaches based on information theory and machine learning. We found that the response specificity of macrophages is driven by combinations of specific immune genes that show low cell-to-cell heterogeneity and are targets of separate signaling pathways. The "response specificity profile,"a systematic comparison of multiple stimulus-response distributions, was distinctly altered by polarizing cytokines, and it enabled an assessment of the functional state of macrophages. Indeed, the response specificity profile of peritoneal macrophages from old and obese mice showed characteristic differences, suggesting that SRS may be a ba-sis for measuring the functional state of innate immune cells.A record of this paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

TI  - Trends in the area of suitable breeding habitat for the Endangered Lake Titicaca Grebe <i>Rollandia microptera</i>, 2001-2020
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lake Titicaca Grebe Rollandia microptera is a poorly studied endemic species found in the Lake Titicaca watershed of Peru and Bolivia. Multiple surveys from the early 2000s indicated that the species was suffering a rapid population decline with an unknown cause. At the same time as these surveys, reports emerged that there was an increase in burning of the totora wetlands which are thought to be the primary habitat for the Lake Titicaca Grebe. However, since 2003, no work has been published either on the current population of the Lake Titicaca Grebe, or the extent of the totora wetlands in the Lake Titicaca region. This paper used satellite data to monitor the change in extent of habitat potentially suitable for the Lake Titicaca Grebe to determine whether habitat loss is likely to be a major driver of population declines in this species. We found that the extent of potentially suitable wetland remained stable between 2001 and 2020, though there are more local regional trends of change in extent of totora. We also found that multiple areas exist that might support Lake Titicaca Grebe populations, but where ornithological knowledge is lacking. We suggest no change to the IUCN status of the Lake Titicaca Grebe, but recommend that further fieldwork is required to monitor the species' current population, especially in previously unstudied but potentially habitable areas.

TI  - Interactions among spatial configuration aspects of urban tree canopy significantly affect its cooling effects
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing urban tree canopy (UTC) has been widely recognized as an effective means for urban heat mitigation and adaptation. While numerous studies have shown that both percent cover of UTC and its spatial configuration can sig-nificantly affect urban temperature, the pathways governing these relationships are largely unexplored. Here we present a cross-city comparison aiming to fill this gap by explicitly quantifying the pathways on which percent cover of UTC and its spatial configuration affect land surface temperature (LST) using structural equation modeling (SEM), based on UTC mapped from high resolution imagery and LST derived from Landsat thermal bands. We found: 1) Al-though both the direct and indirect pathways significantly affected LST regardless of scales and cities, the direct path-way played a more important role in affecting LST in Baltimore, Beijing, and Shenzhen. In contrast, an opposite result was found in Sacramento, likely due to the effects of buildings and their interactions with UTC. 2) Similarly, the direct pathway of mean patch size (MPS) and mean shape index (MSI) played a more important role in affecting LST than their indirect effects via altering edge density (ED). Our results highlighted the necessity for discomposing the effects of different spatial configuration variables on LST. Understanding the pathways through which UTC affects LST can provide insights into urban heat mitigation and adaptation.

AB  - The megaregion is viewed as a platform from which to address a variety of issues. Despite agreement that a megaregion is a large, globally connected urban agglomeration, there is no consensus as to how to delineate its boundaries and how it differs from other urban forms. The scholarly literature is dominated by three distinct analytic approaches: interdependent systems, nodal linkages, and satellite data. We assess the utility of each approach in delineating the boundaries of four megaregions - BosWash, Greater Tokyo, the Amsterdam-Brussels-Antwerp region, and a Global South megaregion - and conclude by proposing a sequence of steps to guide future research.

TI  - Ecological restoration exacerbates the agriculture-induced water crisis in North China Region
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The North China Region (NCR), a typical grain base and highly populated area in China, is a well-recognized global groundwater funnel. Severe water shortage has been threatening and limiting sustainable development in the region over the past decades. Previous studies have reported the depleted water resources in the NCR and attributed the major driver to intensified agricultural water use, hardly considering the effects of the large-scale implementation of ecological restoration (ER) programs. As terrestrial water storage (TWS) is a critical indicator for measuring and evaluating regional water resources, understanding its spatial and temporal dynamics and responses to ER programs is significant for sustainable water management in the NCR. Here, we examine the interannual variations and trends of TWS in the NCR during 2002-2016 by using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. We find the significantly (p < 0.01) decreasing TWS (-8.9 mm/yr) and identify a hotspot with the most rapid depletion (-12.7 +/- 0.45 mm/yr) in the western NCR, where interannual variations and spatial patterns of TWS depletion are consistent with those of ER-induced greening. Attribution analyses of TWS depletion by considering precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff suggest increasing evapotranspiration induced by afforestation as the major driver for TWS depletion in the ER regions. Our study highlights ER is posing a new threat to water security in the NCR, and taking ecological water usage into account would be necessary for the synergy of food, water, and ecological securities and regional sustainable development.

TI  - Time series soil moisture retrieval from SAR data: Multi-temporal constraints and a global validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series algorithms for soil moisture retrieval from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have steadily increased in popularity over the past decade due to the feasibility of decoupling the effect of other surface variables, and the increasing availability of dense time series SAR data. While soil moisture inversion from time series data can utilize more independent observations, the value of further constraints on the inversion process are widely acknowledged. However, how to constrain a time series retrieval for global soil moisture mapping is still unresolved. In this study, three kinds of time series constraints were further developed and evaluated, including the use of 1) temporal behavior of soil moisture and soil moisture bounds; 2) temporal behavior of vegetation or time-invariant vegetation; and 3) time series ensemble skill. The effect of these constraints was investigated using 4 years (2016-2019) C-band Sentinel-1 data collected over 547 worldwide stations from 17 networks available on the international soil moisture network (ISMN) and intensive ground samples collected during the Fifth Soil Moisture Active and Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5). While the effect of these temporal retrieval skills varies in time and space, the global validation yielded four general suggestions: 1) the assumption of time-invariant vegetation contributed negatively even for a short retrieval period of <= 12 days; 2) reliable soil moisture bounds of each retrieval period can substantially improve the retrieval statistics at the cost of an underestimated soil moisture range; 3) the temporal constraints of soil moisture and vegetation need to be used together with the soil moisture bounds for reliable estimation; 4) the use of an ensemble retrieval could partly remove the retrieval uncertainties at the expense of underestimating soil moisture variation. The use of these constraints resulted in a competitive correlation coefficient (R: 0.64), root mean square error (RMSE: 0.072 m3/ m3) and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE: 0.052 m3/m3) at a spatial grid of 100 m, with similar performance achieved across a retrieval window up to 132 days.

T2  - MINING METALLURGY & EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Extraction of underground coal or mineral by the caving methods leads to surface deformations and the accurate measurement of this deformation is becoming a demanding task. Thus, the study demonstrates a Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technique for surface subsidence measurement. The method was applied to measure the subsidence level over three mechanized depillaring panels with caving at GDK-11 Incline mine, India. The study was conducted using C-band data of Sentinel 1A/B sensors, which captured the data in the descending path from October 25, 2017 to March 07, 2020. The deformation level was measured based on the identified PS points in the specified region. In this case, 12 zones were identified (4 for each panel), based on the observation of permanent scatterer (PS) points. The maximum subsidence level and deformation rate range in 12 zones are -43.12 to -65 mm and -73.8 to 100 mm/year, respectively. The deformation level obtained through the PS-InSAR technique showed a good agreement with those of the field measurement. Thus, the PS-InSAR technique can detect and monitor the subsidence level over the goaved-out panel(s) of an underground mine using C-band SAR data of the Sentinal-1A/B sensor.

TI  - Permafrost Monitoring from Space
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is a sub-ground phenomenon and therefore cannot be directly observed from space. It is an Essential Climate Variable and associated with climate tipping points. Multi-annual time series of permafrost ground temperatures can be, however, derived through modelling of the heat transfer between atmosphere and ground using landsurface temperature, snow- and landcover observations from space. Results show that the northern hemisphere permafrost ground temperatures have increased on average by about one degree Celsius since 2000. This is in line with trends of permafrost proxies observable from space: surface water extent has been decreasing across the Arctic; the landsurface is subsiding continuously in some regions indicating ground ice melt; hot summers triggered increased subsidence as well as thaw slumps; rock glaciers are accelerating in some mountain regions. The applicability of satellite data for permafrost proxy monitoring has been demonstrated mostly on a local to regional scale only. There is still a lack of consistency of acquisitions and of very high spatial resolution observations. Both are needed for implementation of circumpolar monitoring of lowland permafrost. In order to quantify the impacts of permafrost thaw on the carbon cycle, advancement in wetland and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration monitoring from space is needed.

TI  - How many independent quantities can be extracted from ocean color?
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Products derived from remote sensing reflectances (R-rs(lambda)), for example, chlorophyll, phytoplankton carbon, euphotic depth, or particle size, are widely used in oceanography. Problematically, R-rs(lambda) may have fewer degrees of freedom (DoF) than measured wavebands or derived products. Here, we show that a global sea surface hyperspectral R-rs(lambda) dataset has DoF = 4. MODIS-like multispectral equivalent in situ data also have DoF = 4, while their SeaWiFS equivalent has DoF = 3. Both multispectral-equivalent datasets predict individual hyperspectral wavelengths' R-rs(lambda) within nominal uncertainties. Remotely sensed climatological multispectral R-rs(lambda) have DoF = 2, as information is lost by atmospheric correction, shifting to larger spatiotemporal scales, and/or more open-ocean measurements, but suites of R-rs(lambda )-derived products have DoF = 1. These results suggest that remote sensing products based on existing satellites' R-rs(lambda ) are not independent and should not be treated as such, that existing R-rs(lambda) measurements hold unutilized information, and that future multi-or especially hyper-spectral algorithms must rigorously consider correlations between R-rs(lambda ) wavebands.

TI  - The strong activity of noctilucent clouds at middle latitudes in 2020
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2020 summer season had more frequent than usual occurrences of noctilucent clouds (NLCs) in the Northern Hemisphere at middle latitudes (45-50 degrees N), with the lowest latitude at which NLCs were seen being 34.1 degrees N. In order to investigate a reason for this extraordinary NLC season, we have analyzed long-term Aura/MLS satellite data for all available summer periods from 2005 to 2021. Both Aura/MLS summer temperature and water vapor in the mesopause region, between about 79 and 89 km altitude, have been considered. There has been a decrease in the summer mesopause temperature between 2016 and 2020. At the same time, water vapor mixing ratio has significantly increased (by about 12-17%) in the zonal mean H2O value in the 2020 summer compared to 2017. There exists a positive linear trend in the H2O amount by about 5% between 2005 and 2021 at middle latitudes 45-50 degrees N at 0.0046 hPa. A combination of lower mesopause temperature and water vapor mixing ratio maximum at middle latitudes is the main reason for frequent and widespread occurrences of NLCs seen around the globe at middle latitudes in the summer of 2020. The 24th solar cycle minimum can explain neither the H2O maximum nor NLC maximum in 2020.

TI  - Long time series (1984-2020) of albedo variations on the Greenland ice sheet from harmonized Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Albedo is a key factor in modulating the absorption of solar radiation on ice surfaces. Satellite measurements have shown a general reduction in albedo across the Greenland ice sheet over the past few decades, particularly along the western margin of the ice sheet, a region known as the Dark Zone (albedo < 0.45). Here we chose a combination of Landsat 4-8 and Sentinel 2 imagery to enable us to derive the longest record of albedo variations in the Dark Zone, running from 1984 to 2020. We developed a simple, pragmatic and efficient sensor transformation to provide a long time series of consistent, harmonized satellite imagery. Narrow to broadband conversion algorithms were developed from regression models of harmonized satellite data and in situ albedo from the Program for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE) automatic weather stations. The albedo derived from the harmonized Landsat and Sentinel 2 data shows that the maximum extent of the Dark Zone expanded rapidly between 2005 and 2007, increasing to similar to 280% of the average annual maximum extent of 2900 km2 to similar to 8000 km2 since. The Dark Zone is continuing to darken slowly, with the average annual minimum albedo decreasing at a rate of similar to-0.0006 +/- 0.0004 a(-1) (p = 0.16, 2001-2020).

TI  - Fractional vegetation cover ratio estimated from radiative transfer modeling outperforms spectral indices to assess fire severity in several Mediterranean plant communities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The obtention of wall-to-wall fire severity estimates through reliable remote sensing-based techniques that align with management needs is a critical factor in post-fire decision-making processes. In this paper, we novelty proposed a multi-date change detection framework based on the variation in fractional vegetation cover (FCOVER), with enough ecological sense and physical basis to be generalizable across different plant commu-nities and burned landscapes with varying environmental conditions. This framework meets the definition of fire severity operationally used in the field as a biophysical indicator when fire effects on the understory and overstory layers are linked. The FCOVER was retrieved from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance scenes by inverting PROSAIL-D radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations using the random forest regression algorithm. FCOVER retrievals were validated in the field using burned and unburned control plots. We computed the FCOVERr metric as the ratio of post-fire to pre-fire FCOVER. We tested the relationship of the FCOVERr and the most common bi-temporal spectral indices in the literature, i.e. the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), the Relative dNBR (RdNBR) and the Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), with the Composite Burn Index (CBI) measured in field plots for validation purposes in two case-study wildfires in the western Mediterranean Basin. We also calculated the transferability of FCOVERr and the spectral indices between different plant communities within each site, as well as between sites. The predictive errors of pre and post-fire FCOVER retrievals were found to be low (RMSE approximate to 10%) for the two study sites. Overall, the FCOVERr metric provided more accurate CBI estimations (R2 = 0.87 +/- 0.04) than spectral indices (R2 = 0.71 +/- 0.13). The CBI was linearly related with the FCOVERr metric for both sites, whereas the type of relationship with spectral indices was not consistent, which translated into better transferability performance of the FCOVERr metric (nRMSE = 14.27% +/- 3.75%) than that of the spectral indices (nRMSE = 21.97% +/- 8.09%), not only between different Mediterranean plant communities within sites, but also between the two sites. Spectral indices underestimated moderate to high fire severity to a greater extent than FCOVERr in the CBI field plots, and misclassified fire severity in several areas with patchiness fire effects identified in the field. The FCOVERr product proposed in this study may be a sound choice for the operational identification of priority areas for post-fire management.

TI  - Humans and climate modulate fire activity across Ethiopia
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFire occurrence is influenced by interactions between human activity, climate, and fuels that are difficult to disentangle but crucial to understand, given fire's role in carbon dynamics, deforestation, and habitat maintenance, alteration, or loss. To determine the relative balance of climatic and anthropogenic influences on fire activity, we quantified interannual variability in burned area across Ethiopia from 2001 to 2018 and developed a statistical model to assess climate and human factors contributing to patterns of area burned.ResultsAnnual burned area declined nationally and within several regions from 2001 to 2018 and was closely related to climate, particularly antecedent temperature. Of the area that burned at least once, 62% reburned at 1-3-year intervals and the geographic region of frequent-fire areas did not shift over time. Despite increased enforcement of a fire ban over the past 20 years, no strong spatiotemporal shifts in fire occurrence patterns were detected at a national level.ConclusionsOur results suggest that human influence combined with dynamics of vegetation and fuels strongly influenced fire occurrence in Ethiopia, indicating that geographic variation in cultural fire practices was highly influential and relatively unchanging between 2001 and 2018. In contrast, interannual variability in total burned area was strongly related to climate and the influence of climate on fuel abundance. Our results highlight that climate can strongly influence short-term variability in fire activity even as longer-term patterns may depend more strongly on human influence.

TI  - Anomalous thermal and winds condition drove low surface chlorophyll-a in La Paz Bay during the 2015-2016 El Nin∼o event
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - La Paz Bay (LPB) considered one of the most highly productive bays in the southwestern Gulf of California, Mexico, recently established as Priority Marine Region, supports many species of ecological importance. In this context, daily composites of surface chlorophyll a (Chl-aSAT), sea surface temperature (SST) satellite images derived from the MODIS-Aqua sensor, and a wind intensity index (WI) calculated with data recorded simulta-neously at four points along the coast, were used to describe the strong 2015-2016 El Nin & SIM;o impact over the surface chlorophyll pigments in LPB, relative to its average for 2003-2013. Significant relationships between SST, WI (used as environmental factors) and Chl-aSAT (RSST =-0.74, RWI =-0.40, P < 0.01) were found using exponential models for the entire study period, with moderate correlation during El Nin & SIM;o winter condition (December 2015 to March 2016) between SST and Chl-aSAT (RSST = 0.45, P < 0.02). The Chl-aSAT showed un-expectedly low values (-0.5-1.2 mg m-3) with one month-lag of the winter bloom period jointly with the presence of warmer-than-usual water (-1.0 C) and episodes of strong northwesterly winds (speed 8.0-10.0 m s- 1) that began in autumn that drove a-2 month-lag in its winter peak. The Chl-aSAT and SST winter spatial patterns, showed low Chl-aSAT values (--0.5 to-1.0 mg m-3) along the bay and higher-than-usual SST by -0.5-1.0 C relative to a year under the La Nin & SIM;a winter condition (2017-2018). This triggered the possible thermocline deepening and the lowest levels of nutrient supply to the photic layer during the El Nin & SIM;o winter episode. Hovmoller diagrams of Chl-aSAT and SST anomalies along the coast revealed a sharp drop to negative anomaly values (--0.7 to-1.2 mg m-3), in-phase but negatively correlated with the SST coastal anomalies (R = -0.88, P < 0.01). This biophysical coupling played a crucial role in the exceptional drop to the lowest winter Chl-aSAT levels seen in LPB since the MODIS satellite sensor began taking measurements in 2002 (Chl-aSAT values were lower than usual by -0.9-1.2 mg m-3). Besides the lowest winter levels observed, this research reflected the El Nin & SIM;o signal-driven changes over the basic seasonal average of the LPB climate system The non-significant negative trend observed in the winter average Chl-aSAT values, indicates that LPB may be less resilient to future environmental disturbances.

TI  - Evolution of seasonal land surface temperature trend in pond-breeding newt (<i>Neurergus derjugini</i>) in western Iran and eastern Iraq
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTemperature, as one of the effective environmental stimuli in many aspects of species life and ecosystems, can affect amphibians in many ways. Knowing and predicting temperature change and its possible effects on the habitat suitability and movements of amphibians have led many researchers to use climate change scenarios and species distribution models (SDMs). One of the important remote-sensing products that received less attention of conservation biologists is the land surface temperature (LST). Due to the small difference between LST and air temperature, this component can be used to investigate and monitor the daily and seasonal changes of habitats. This study aims to investigate the seasonal trend of LST in the habitat suitability and connectivity of the critically endangered newt (Neurergus derjugini) in its small distribution range, using the MODIS LST time series (2003 to 2021) and with the help of SDMs, Mann-Kendall (MK) and Pettitt non-parametric tests.ResultsIn the last decade, the increasing trend of LST versus its decreasing trends is obvious. Based on MK and Pettitt tests, in the winter and spring, with the decrease in latitude of 35.45 degrees and increase in longitude of 46.14 degrees, the core populations which are located in the southeast have experienced an increase in temperature. Considering the period time of breeding and overwintering, the continuity of winter and spring can be effective on the survival of adult newts as well as larvae in the microclimate. Linkages with the highest current flow between core populations in the winter and summer are the most likely to be vulnerable. At the level of habitat, the increase in LST is proportional to the trend of thermal landscape changes, and all seasons have had an increase in LST, but in winter and summer, the largest area of the habitat has been involved. By continuing the current trend, many high-altitude southern habitats in Iran will be endangered, and the species will be at risk of local extinction.ConclusionThe increasing trend of temperature in all seasons such as winter will affect many adaptations of the species and these effects are mostly evident in the southern parts of its distribution range therefore, captive breeding and reintroduction are recommended for the populations of these areas.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of cultural immersion on counselor trainees? multicultural development and intercultural competence: A metasynthesis of qualitative evidence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This metasynthesis critically surveyed and evaluated the learning impacts on counselor and psychology trainees' multicultural development and intercultural competence through partici-pating in cultural immersion (CI), based on published qualitative research evidence. Accordingly, this metasynthesis identified and assessed the characteristics, the methodological strengths and qualities, and the thematic findings of 33 qualitative and mixed-methods CI studies resulting from exhaustive database searches. Using a directed content analysis technique, a six-domain analyt-ical framework was applied to code and analyze the themes reported in these studies. The results point to CI intervention as a multifaceted and versatile instructional apparatus that impacted and contributed to trainees' multicultural development and intercultural learning multidimension-ally, across cognitive, perceptual-attitudinal, affective, and skills-behavioral domains. These learning outcomes include trainees' increased cultural awareness and knowledge (cognitive), enhanced reflexivity on their worldview, positionality, and attitude (perceptual-attitudinal), heightened emotion and growth in cultural empathy (affective), adaptation and display of new behaviors and relational skills and increased multicultural competence (skills-behavioral). Therefore, CI embodies many favorable characteristics of experientially-based learning as stipu-lated in the existing multicultural counseling and intercultural training literature. These findings lend nuanced empirical support for the application of CI to facilitate counselor trainees' multi-cultural orientation, development, and skills, and offer insights into structural facilitators for enhancing immersion training. However, a lack of structural and methodological consistency and theoretical depth among the existing CI studies were observed as major limitations. Implications and recommendations for advancing future CI and multicultural training practice and research are discussed.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-5P TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 products by comparison with NO2 measurements from airborne imaging DOAS, ground-based stationary DOAS, and mobile car DOAS measurements during the S5P-VAL-DE-Ruhr campaign
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne imaging differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), ground-based stationary DOAS, and car DOAS measurements were conducted during the S5P-VAL-DE-Ruhr campaign in September 2020. The campaign area is located in the Rhine-Ruhr region of North Rhine-Westphalia, western Germany, which is a pollution hotspot in Europe comprising urban and large industrial sources. The DOAS measurements are used to validate spaceborne NO2 tropospheric vertical column density (VCD) data products from the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI).Seven flights were performed with the airborne imaging DOAS instrument for measurements of atmospheric pollution (AirMAP), providing measurements that were used to create continuous maps of NO2 in the layer below the aircraft. These flights cover many S5P ground pixels within an area of 30 km x 35 km and were accompanied by ground-based stationary measurements and three mobile car DOAS instruments. Stationary measurements were conducted by two Pandora, two Zenith-DOAS, and two MAX-DOAS instruments. Ground-based stationary and car DOAS measurements are used to evaluate the AirMAP tropospheric NO2 VCDs and show high Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.88 and 0.89 and slopes of 0.90 +/- 0.09 and 0.89 +/- 0.02 for the stationary and car DOAS, respectively.Having a spatial resolution of about 100 m x 30 m, the AirMAP tropospheric NO2 VCD data create a link between the ground-based and the TROPOMI measurements with a nadir resolution of 3.5 km x 5.5 km and are therefore well suited to validate the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 VCD. The observations on the 7 flight days show strong NO2 variability, which is dependent on the three target areas, the day of the week, and the meteorological conditions.The AirMAP campaign data set is compared to the TROPOMI NO2 operational offline (OFFL) V01.03.02 data product, the reprocessed NO2 data using the V02.03.01 of the official level-2 processor provided by the Product Algorithm Laboratory (PAL), and several scientific TROPOMI NO2 data products. The AirMAP and TROPOMI OFFL V01.03.02 data are highly correlated (r=0.87) but show an underestimation of the TROPOMI data with a slope of 0.38 +/- 0.02 and a median relative difference of -9 %. With the modifications in the NO2 retrieval implemented in the PAL V02.03.01 product, the slope and median relative difference increased to 0.83 +/- 0.06 and +20 %. However, the modifications resulted in larger scatter and the correlation decreased significantly to r=0.72. The results can be improved by not applying a cloud correction for the TROPOMI data in conditions with high aerosol load and when cloud pressures are retrieved close to the surface. The influence of spatially more highly resolved a priori NO2 vertical profiles and surface reflectivity are investigated using scientific TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 VCD data products. The comparison of the AirMAP campaign data set to the scientific data products shows that the choice of surface reflectivity database has a minor impact on the tropospheric NO2 VCD retrieval in the campaign region and season. In comparison, the replacement of the a priori NO2 profile in combination with the improvements in the retrieval of the PAL V02.03.01 product regarding cloud heights can further increase the tropospheric NO2 VCDs.This study demonstrates that the underestimation of the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 VCD product with respect to the validation data set has been and can be further significantly improved.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer: The new norm- A multicentre, international experience
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The landscape of early-stage endometrial cancer treatment has changed dramatically over the last decade. The aim of this study is to provide a real-world view of the impact sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has had on both clinical practice and patient outcomes. We describe detection and recurrence rates, as well as our experience in managing low volume lymph node disease.Methods: We conducted an international, multicenter retrospective cohort study of 1012 patients with apparent early-stage endometrial cancer. Eligible patients underwent primary surgical staging and SLN biopsy in one of three large academic tertiary cancer centers in Canada or the Republic of Korea between 2015 and 2019. De-mographic, surgical, clinicopathologic and recurrence data were collected through chart review.Results: A total of 1012 patients were included. Overall SLN detection rate for all tracer types was 94.1% and recurrence rate was 5.3%. Higher FIGO stage (III vs. I/II) was associated with failed bilateral mapping (OR 2.27, 95%CI 1.14-4.52). We identified seven patients with micrometastases and 12 with isolated tumor cells, of which only one patient with micrometastases recurred at 17 months. Recurrence rates based on risk groups were 2.1%, 5.3%, 8.1%, and 9.9% for low, intermediate, high-intermediate, and high risk, respectively.Conclusion: SLN biopsy is safe and feasible. Detection rates are high, regardless of which tracer type is used and recurrence rates are low, especially in low and intermediate risk disease. Patients with low volume metastases appear to have low risk of recurrence, but replication of our findings by large prospective studies are needed to elucidate their clinical importance.

TI  - Data-driven models for flood prediction in an ungauged karst wetland: Napahai wetland, Yunnan, China
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood prediction for ungauged karst wetland is facing a great challenge. How to build a wetland hydrological model when there is a lack of basic hydrological data is the key to dealing with the above challenge. Napahai wetland is a typical ungauged karst wetland. In ungauged wetland/condition, this article used the wetland open water area (OWA) extracted from Landsat remote sensing images during 1987-2018 to characterize the hydrological characteristics of Napahai wetland. The local daily precipitation in the 1987-2018 rainy season (June-October) was used to set the variables. Based on the following hypothesis: in the rainy season, the OWA of the Napahai wetland rises when there is an increase in accumulated precipitation (AP), two data-driven models were established. The study took the area difference (AD) between two adjacent OWAs as the dependent variable, the accumulated precipitation (AP) within the acquisition time of two adjacent OWAs, and the corresponding time interval (TI) of the OWA as explanatory variables. Two data-driven models (a piecewise linear regression model and a decision tree model) were established to carry out flood forecasting simulations. The decision tree provided higher goodness of fit while the piecewise linear regression could offer a better interpretability between the variables which offset the decision tree. The results showed that: (1) the goodness of fit of the decision tree is higher than that of the piecewise linear regression model (2) the piecewise linear model has a better interpretation. When AP increased by 1 mm, the average AD increased by 2.41 ha; when TI exceeded 182 d and increased by 1 d, the average AD decreased to 3.66 ha. This article proposed an easy decision plan to help the local Napahai water managers forecast floods based on the results from the two models above. In addition, the modelling method proposed in this article, based on the idea of difference for non-equidistant time series, can be applied to karst wetland hydrological simulation problems with data acquisition difficulty.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-Optical data fusion models predict the missing reflectance values through the correlation between optical images and cloud-insensitive SAR images often using deep learning to train the model. However, most existing SAR-Optical data fusion methods did not incorporate temporal correlation optimally as they were not trained on dense and localized time-series data. Herein, we develop a new SAR-Optical data fusion method that incorporated spatial, temporal, and crossdata-source correlation in the same framework. The method uses spatio-temporal (ST) partitioning and pixelwise multiple linear regression (MLR) and is named ST-MLR. The parsimonious structure of ST-MLR provides training-efficient model development, enabling the incorporation of full spatio-temporal information for a specific site. ST-MLR was validated with NDVI as the target in seven sites across a wide range of environments and landcovers. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrated the potential of ST-MLR to reproduce the target variable accurately with respect to both spatial and temporal dynamics. Although ST-MLR had relatively less accuracy when reconstructing multi-band images than when reconstructing the NDVI, its results were comparable to existing reconstruction methods in this regard. Compared with traditional optical image reconstruction methods and deep learning SAR-Optical fusion methods, ST-MLR is a simple, fast and reasonably accurate model, especially when filling large spatial gaps. ST-MLR is accessible to anyone regardless of compute capability as it can be implemented on Google Earth Engine - a public cloud computing platform. ST-MLR can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of more complicated models such as those based on deep learning. The ST-MLR code is publicly available at https://github.com/yongjingmao/SAR-OPT_fusion_GEE.

TI  - The shifting Christian right discourse on religious freedom in Australia
T2  - POLITICS AND RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Political debates over religious freedom in Australia became prominent in the context of marriage equality, achieved in 2017. The Australian Christian Right (ACR) has driven these debates, but there is little research focusing on its discourse of religious freedom. This article examines a range of texts from ACR actors. Using discourse and theoretical analyses, we identify three key turns in the religious freedom rhetoric of the ACR: "ontological security," "existential stress," and "meaning vertigo." We also explore how mimetic ACR discourse is compared to the United States' Christian Right (USCR). As with the USCR, this research demonstrates how the ACR-suffering meaning vertigo and aiming to re-secure its previously taken-for-granted worldview-has successfully reframed the discourse of religious freedom by positioning itself as a besieged minority.

TI  - Feminism and Decolonizing Decoloniality: Decolonizing the Coloniality of Power in Aymara Cosmology
T2  - MILLENNIUM-JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article demonstrates the import of feminist reflexivity for the decolonial project. At its best, the decolonial project reveals the form and extent to which contemporary ideas and power structures are imbued with generations of power structures whose foundations were laid during colonialism. However, some power dynamics can be lost in reified forms of decolonial critique. Feminist methodologies, especially reflexivity, remind us to revisit the particulars of the constructions of power within dominant power structures and, as importantly, within resistant power structures. We revisit the decolonial stance within an Indigenous cosmology, Aymaridad, 'the' Aymara worldview as constructed for the second largest Indigenous population in Bolivia. Aymaridad is an important site for feminists to revisit the relationship between feminism and decoloniality because over a decade ago, Maria Lugones charted a course for decolonial feminism that drew on an Aymaran approach to decolonizing gender. By revisiting the coloniality embedded in the construction of Aymara (in academe and in politics), we reveal that feminism's persistent reflexive methodology, even more than its attention to gender specifically, makes it an essential part of the decolonial theory.

TI  - The<i> Conquense</i> transhumance route in Spain described by 3D geographical information systems, GPS and remote sensing data
T2  - SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In semi-arid regions, such as the Mediterranean, seasonal changes in climate make the migration of ruminants essential for the efficient use of ecosystemic primary productivity. Transhumance is one of the oldest sheep husbandry systems which contributes to the conservation of natural biodiversity and to minimize the effects of climate change on livestock production. However, its use has decreased substantially, mainly because of livestock intensification. In Spain, particularly, interest in maintaining the traditional transhumant network has increased. Geotechnologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) might provide important information about the drove roads of the transhumant network. Therefore, in this study, we used several geotechnologies that described accurately and in detail the path followed by several sheep flocks and cattle herds in eastern Spain. Specifically, we monitored a Merino de los Montes Universales (MMU) sheep flock on the well-known Spanish Conquense route in Nov 2021. The flock traveled 349.8 km and climbed a total elevation of 1223 m in 23 days, moving 9-10 h per day. Maximum and minimum daily distances traveled were 19.06 km and 8.85 km, respectively, and the steepest slopes were encountered in the first few days of the journey, up to 60 %. The preferred land use/land covers (LU/LC) were scrublands, rainfed herbaceous crops, and rangelands. Indirectly, the study demonstrated the outstanding physiological aptitude of the MMU breed for withstanding the long journey, even when pregnant.

TI  - A framework for multi-sensor satellite data to evaluate crop production losses: the case study of 2022 Pakistan floods
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In August 2022, one of the most severe floods in the history of Pakistan was triggered due to the exceptionally high monsoon rainfall. It has affected similar to 33 million people across the country. The agricultural losses in the most productive Indus plains aggravated the risk of food insecurity in the country. As part of the loss and damage (L&D) assessment methodologies, we developed an approach for evaluating crop-specific post-disaster production losses based on multi-sensor satellite data. An integrated assessment was performed using various indicators derived from pre- and post-flood images of Sentinel-1 (flood extent mapping), Sentinel-2 (crop cover), and GPM (rainfall intensity measurements) to evaluate crop-specific losses. The results showed that 2.5 million ha (18% of Sindh's total area) was inundated out of which 1.1 million ha was cropland. The remainder of crop damage came from the extreme rainfall downpour, flash floods and management deficiencies. Thus approximately 57% (2.8 million ha) of the cropland was affected out of the 4.9 million ha of agricultural area in Sindh. The analysis indicated expected production losses of 88% (3.1 million bales), 80% (1.8 million tons), and 61% (10.5 million tons) for cotton, rice, and sugarcane. This assessment provided useful tools to evaluate the L&D of agricultural production and to develop evidence-based policies enabling post-flood recovery, rehabilitation of people and restoration of livelihood.

TI  - Very high-resolution Net Ecosystem Exchange over India using Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) simulations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial biosphere has a crucial role in controlling the rate of CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere. The quantification of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) is critical to determine whether the regional terrestrial ecosystem is a net sink or source of CO2. This study uses a satellite-data derived light-use-efficiency model (the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model, VPRM) to compute the biospheric CO2 fluxes over India from 2011-2020. A very high-resolution Land Use-Land Cover (LULC) data from the IRS-P6 satellite and MODIS derived surface reflectance are utilised to compute the NEE over distinct vegetation types at similar to 9 kmx 9 km. The VPRM model for the Indian region captures the spatial pattern and seasonal features of NEE over the country. The magnitude of annual mean NEE over India from the VPRM model is relatively high compared to that from Carbon Tracker, FLUXCOM, and Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-4 carbon data products. However, the VPRM model simulated NEE agrees with the NEE observations from the eddy covariance estimates, which are accepted as the ground truth. The fusion of high-resolution LULC and surface reflectance data in VPRM suggests that the average NEE over the Indian region during 2011-2020 is -0.16 +/- 0.02 PgC yr-1. Among this, the contribution from Gross Ecosystem Exchange is about -0.47 +/- 0.02 PgC yr-1, and Respiration is 0.31 +/- 0.01 PgC yr-1. The maximum biospheric CO2 absorption is during the post-monsoon season, and the minimum is during the pre-monsoon season. The very high spatial resolution and heterogeneity resolved in the NEE data derived in this work offer the first data product of this kind for a variety of NEE analyses over India.

TI  - Establishing a record of extreme debris flow events in a high Alpine catchment since the end of the Little Ice Age using lichenometric dating
T2  - GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Establishing a record of large debris flow events in high Alpine areas prior to the availability of high resolution remote sensing data can be very challenging. In this study, we investigate the debris flow activity in two tributary valleys of the Horlachtal catchment in Tyrol, Austria between the end of the Little Ice Age at about 1850 and the first available area wide aerial images from 1947. To accomplish this, we calculated a local lichenometric calibration curve using the long axis diameters of the five largest Rhizocarpon lichen thalli at 51 different reference locations. Because of the interval-censored dating of most of the reference sites, we established a bootstrapping approach within the calibration curve calculation process. With the help of the lichenometric calibration data, we were able to date 47 old debris flow deposits in the study area. The results indicate no increasing or decreasing trends in frequencies of extreme debris flow events. In addition, the results point to a very local character of debris flow triggering precipitation events, as we can detect major differences in neighbouring valleys. Lichenometric derived datings also provide temporal informations about the end of debris flow activity at some sites in the study area and thus can contribute to a better understanding of debris flow systems.

TI  - A new pattern to quantitatively evaluate the value of ecosystem services in the large-scale open-pit coal mining area
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionOpen-pit coal mining could disrupt the ecosystem and lead to the loss of service values for the ecosystem through direct occupation or indirect impacts on adjacent ecosystems. MethodsIn this research, we combined a new accounting system, gross ecosystem product (GEP), with spatial-temporal analyses to quantify the ecological variation and explore its driving factors in Pingshuo, a large-scale open-pit coal mining area in China. GEP is an aggregate accounting system that can summarize the value of provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services (ES) in a single monetary metric. The spatial-temporal approaches used in our study were known as exploratory spatial data analyses and interpretable models in machine learning. Both spatial and non-spatial data, including remote sensing images, meteorological data, and official statistics, were applied in the research. ResultsThe results indicated the following: (i) From 1990 to 2020, the annual average growth rates of GEP decreased from 30.78 to 9.1%. Furthermore, the classified results of GEP revealed that the regions with rich ES quality rapidly reduced from 51.90 to 32.18%. (ii) Spatial correlation of GEP was significant, and the degree of spatial clustering was relatively high in the mining areas. Moreover, the mining areas also continually presented concentrated high-density and hot spot areas of GEP changes. (iii) The spatial-temporal effects were notable in the relationship between GEP and three socioeconomic factors, i.e., the mining effects, human activity intensity, and gross domestic product (GDP). (iv) The win-win development for both the economy and ecological environment in Pingshuo could be realized by restricting the annual growth rate of mining areas to between 4.56 and 5.03%. DiscussionThe accounting results and spatial-temporal analyses of GEP will contribute to the future regional sustainable development and ecosystem management in Pingshuo.

TI  - Partisanship and anti-elite worldviews as correlates of science and health beliefs in the multi-party system of Spain
T2  - PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In a national sample of 5087 Spaniards, we examine the prevalence of 10 specific misperceptions over five separate science and health domains (climate change, 5G technology, genetically modified foods, vaccines, and homeopathy). We find that misperceptions about genetically modified foods and general health risks of 5G technology are particularly widespread. While we find that partisan affiliation is not strongly associated with any of the misperceptions aside from climate change, we find that two distinct dimensions of an anti-elite worldview-anti-expert and conspiratorial mindsets-are better overall predictors of having science and health misperceptions in the Spanish context. These findings help extend our understanding of polarization around science beyond the most common contexts (e.g. the United States) and support recent work suggesting anti-elite sentiments are among the most important predictors of factual misperceptions.

TI  - Can we actually monitor the spatial distribution of small pelagic fish based on Sentinel-3 data? An example from the North Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean Sea)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fish population spatial distribution data provide essential information for fleet monitoring and fishery spatial planning. Modern high resolution ocean color remote sensing sensors with daily temporal coverage can enable consistent monitoring of highly productive areas, giving insight in seasonal and yearly variations. Here is presented the methodology to monitor small pelagic fish spatial distribution by means of 500m resolution satellite data in a geographically and oceanographically complex area. Specifically, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) acoustic biomass data are modeled against environmental proxies obtained from the Sentinel-3 satellite mission. Three modeling techniques (Logistic Regression, Generalized Additive Models, Random Forest) were applied and validated against the in-situ measurements. The accuracy of anchovy presence detection peaked at 76% and for sardine at 78%. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the models' output highlighted known fishing grounds. For anchovy, biomass modeling highlighted the importance of bathymetry, SST, and the distance from thermal fronts, whereas for sardine, bathymetry, CHL and chlorophyll fronts. The models are applied to a sample dataset to showcase a potential outcome of the proposed methodology and its spatial characteristics. Finally, the results are discussed and compared to other habitat studies and findings in the area.

TI  - Stratospheric chlorine processing after the 2020 Australian wildfires derived from satellite data.
T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The 2019 to 2020 Australian summer wildfires injected an amount of organic gases and particles into the stratosphere unprecedented in the satellite record since 2002, causing large unexpected changes in HCl and ClONO2. These fires provided a novel opportunity to evaluate heterogeneous reactions on organic aerosols in the context of stratospheric chlorine and ozone depletion chemistry. It has long been known that heterogeneous chlorine (Cl) activation occurs on the polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs; liquid and solid particles containing water, sulfuric acid, and in some cases nitric acid) that are found in the stratosphere, but these are only effective for ozone depletion chemistry at temperatures below about 195 K (i.e., largely in the polar regions during winter). Here, we develop an approach to quantitatively assess atmospheric evidence for these reactions using satellite data for both the polar (65 to 90°S) and the midlatitude (40 to 55°S) regions. We show that heterogeneous reactions apparently even happened at temperatures at 220 K during austral autumn on the organic aerosols present in 2020 in both regions, in contrast to earlier years. Further, increased variability in HCl was also found after the wildfires, suggesting diverse chemical properties among the 2020 aerosols. We also confirm the expectation based upon laboratory studies that heterogeneous Cl activation has a strong dependence upon water vapor partial pressure and hence atmospheric altitude, becoming much faster close to the tropopause. Our analysis improves the understanding of heterogeneous reactions that are important for stratospheric ozone chemistry under both background and wildfire conditions.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is an important variable in drought monitoring, floods predicting, weather forecasting, etc. and plays a critical role in water and heat exchanges between land and atmosphere. SSM products from L-band observations, such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission, have proven to be optimal global estimations. Although X-band has a lower sensitivity to soil moisture than that of L-band, Chinese FengYun-3 series satellites (FY-3A/B/C/D) have provided sustainable and daily multiple SSM products from X-band since 2008. This research developed a new global SSM product (NNsm-FY) from FY-3B MWRI from 2010 to 2019, transferred high accuracy of SMAP L-band to FY-3B X-band. The NNsm-FY shows good agreement with in-situ observations and SMAP product and has a higher accuracy than that of official FY-3B product. With this new dataset, Chinese FY-3 satellites may play a larger role and provide opportunities of sustainable and longer-term soil moisture data record for hydrological study.

TI  - Rapid early-season maize mapping without crop labels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize (Zea mays), the second most-produced crop worldwide, serves as the cornerstone for global food security and human livelihood. Early-season maize mapping benefits maize production forecasting and other pre-harvest decision-making applications. However, most existing early-season mapping efforts rely heavily on either the current-year or historical crop labels to train classifiers, limiting the potential applications to new regions lacking crop labels. To explore the possibility of maize mapping only using satellite data in the early season, we proposed a Multi-temporal Gaussian Mixture Model (MGMM) to map maize planting areas without any crop labels. A chlorophyll content relevant proxy, named the Red-edge position (REP), was selected as model input, based on the truth that summer maize tends to show a higher chlorophyll content than other summer crops (e.g., soybean, cotton, peanut, sunflowers, etc.) in the peak season. The novel early-season mapping framework using the REP-based MGMM (MGMM-REP) was applied in four diverse areas (Iowa and Georgia in the US, Heilongjiang province (HLJ) in China, and Grand-Est in France). The MGMM-REP could generate maize maps more than two months before harvest with reasonable accuracy (F1 >= 77%) using all the available Sentinel-2 (S2) images and the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE). Our early-season maps agreed well with the existing crop maps and official statistics. The correlation coefficient (R) of the maize acreage between our early-season maps and sta-tistics was higher than 0.94. The high inter-class difference of REP between maize and other summer crops could increase the F1 score by 2-47% compared to the other commonly used Vegetation indices (VIs). Since MGMM-REP does not rely on crop labels, it had the potential to be transferred to label-scarce maize-cropped regions and contribute to the international commodity trade and food security forecast.

TI  - Inter-annual drought monitoring in northern mixed grasslands by a revised vegetation health index from historical Landsat imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is defined as a natural phenomenon with comprehensive influences on ecosystems, economies, and the livelihood and health of people resident in the affected regions. Severe drought has affected the grassland ecosystem in the Canadian prairie region with increased frequency. Thus, it is essential to monitor the drought effects. With various temporal, spectral, and spatial resolutions, remote sensing data can detect vegetation's dynamic responses to drought. The objective of this study was to monitor inter-annual drought in the northern mixed grassland, over the last thirty-six years by using remote sensing approach through a revised vegetation health index (VHIr), which combined the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), and the dead fuel condition index (DCI) together. Historical Landsat imagery was explored to establish the VHIr and this index was tested in the Grasslands National Parks (GNP), a typical conserved northern mixed grasslands region. The results suggested that the VHIr can distinguish dry and wet years effectively and a VHIr map was able to depict the spatial distribution pattern of the drought severity. Compared with the original vegetation health index (VHI), VHIr was more correlated with the dead-to-green biomass ratio. Meanwhile, the spatial pattern indicated that the valley grasslands had relatively low drought sensitivity; the upland grasslands experienced severe to extreme drought severity during dry years, due to a large amount of dead vegetation existed; and the drought effect on sloped grasslands was due to relatively sparse vegetation cover. In addition, VHIr was significantly correlated with greenness and wetness components derived from the tasseled cap (K-T) transformation but the correlation coefficients (r) varied between dry and wet years and among different grassland landscapes. This study expanded our understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of drought severity in the northern mixed grasslands, which can facilitate natural resource management in the arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Agricultural drought characteristics in a typical plain region considering irrigation, crop growth, and water demand impacts
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological models and drought indices based on simulation of soil moisture have been widely used in largescale agricultural drought assessments. However, hydrological models often oversimplify crop modules and does not consider irrigation, crop growth, and water demand impacts. Therefore, in the present study, a coupled hydrological-crop growth model Variable Infiltration Capacity - Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (VICEPIC) was used to consider the impact of the irrigation process on drought and propose a crop water anomaly percentage index (CWAPI) based on the crop water demand and consumption processes. Identification and assessment methods of drought events were also evaluated. The validation results of the VIC-EPIC model showed that the correlation coefficients between the MODIS evapotranspiration and the simulated evapotranspiration at 37% merged grids were above 0.74. The correlation coefficient (0.79) of the CWAPI-simulated values and statistical values of drought area rates was greater than that (0.72) of soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI), indicating that the simulation of drought area rate based on CWAPI was more reasonable. After identifying regional drought events and comparing the identified characteristic values of these events with the average drought data of each city, it was found that SMAPI misjudged some regions with high hydraulic conductivity as severe drought regions. This limitation was overcome by CWAPI, which directly reflects the degree of crop water shortage and considers the impact of irrigation on drought. Agricultural drought occurs due to low soil water content, which is caused by rapid percolation of soil water and insufficient storage of local and irrigation water. This study of drought indices will help develop a more timely and comprehensive adaptive strategy to deal with droughts by considering the impacts of irrigation, crop growth, and water demand on drought.

TI  - Hinge commitments as arational beliefs
T2  - SYNTHESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hinge epistemology is a family of views that offers a novel approach to avoiding skeptical conclusions about the possibility of a posteriori justification of our empirical beliefs. They claim that at the basis of our empirical beliefs lie certain commitments whose rational status is not determined by our evidence. These are called hinge commitments. Prominent hinge epistemologists have claimed that hinge commitments are either rational or arational but yet not beliefs. I argue that such views are subject to decisive objections. I then offer what I consider to be the best version of hinge epistemology. On this view, hinge commitments are best understood as arational beliefs that contingently inform our worldview. I call this view the Arational Beliefs View.

TI  - Morphometric analysis of Chapec?o river basin: Searching for vestigial trace of neotectonic on a basaltic landscape at southern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chapec ' o River Basin (CRB) is located in the west of Santa Catarina State (South Brazil) and has a relief modelled by a large basalt lava outpouring that occurred in the Paran ' a Sedimentary Basin. The CRB is characterised by two plateau compartments resulting from regional denudation and associated with a river network that was formed after the basaltic lava completed its flow phase in the Lower Cretaceous. Elements of structural geology together with weathering of rocks and its products, such as regolith, have been commonly used to analyse and interpret the landforms in CRB, whose fluvial landscape is shaped by bedrock channels and incision valleys. Nevertheless, there is a lack of detailed studies about such structural factors in terms of type and origin, and to what extent they may be proxies of tectonic tensions of an intra-plate character. In the lack of guide levels and deposits that allow a better interpretation of recent tectonic deformations, in this work we aimed to evaluate tectonic-structural factors involved in the landscape evolution of the CRB through measurement and analysis of morphometric indices derived from the ALOS PALSAR DEM. We analysed the following morphometric parameters for 43 sub-basins: the basin asymmetry (FA), hypsometric integral (HI), elongation, local relief, slopes distribution, Hack index for the two main river channels (Chapec ' o and Chapecozinho), and concavity index of the main channels of sub-basins. The results obtained from the morphometric analysis of the river network indicate the existence of a geomorphological disequilibrium of its relief. This result was observed in the transition from the medium to the low basin and in the base levels of the Chapec ' o and Chapecozinho rivers. Such disequilibrium is shown by convex and irregular longitudinal profiles, knickpoints, sub-basins with high values of asymmetry and hypsometric integral (HI), as well as a low correlation between slope and channel gradients for the sub-basins analysed. This context is consistent with the neotectonic hypothesis of a regional uplift that provide energy to the system to reactivate faults, tilt blocks, and deepened the incision of the river network, leading to the creation of new knickpoints and a transient river network. From the results and analysis, we can conclude that the largest knickzones and waterfalls in the study area can be considered markers associated with quaternary tectonic forcings, although many of these geomorphological features may have originated simply by joints and fractures in the rocks.

TI  - Gains and losses in ecosystem services and disservices after converting native forest to agricultural land on an oceanic island
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat conversion to agricultural land is one of the main threats to terrestrial biodiversity and can affect ecosystem processes and cause changes in ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs). Yet, studies often rely only on the abundance and diver-sity of the service providers; the effects on ecological processes of habitat conversion are rarely directly monitored. In this study, we used the sentinel approach to evaluate how habitat conversion from native forest to agricultural land affected ESs and EDs on an oceanic island. We quantified herbivory on lettuce plants, invertebrate and vertebrate predation rates on artificial caterpillars, pollination on strawberry plants, seed predation on wheat and mustard seeds, and leaf decomposition rates in native forests, maize fields and pastures on Terceira Island, Azores (Portugal). Herbivory, invertebrate predation rates, and pollination service were not significantly different between habitats. Vertebrate predation rates in native forests (mean 6.1% d-1) were sig-nificantly higher than that in pastures (0.3% d-1), or high-elevation maize fields (0.5% d-1), and marginally higher than in low-elevation maize fields (2.2% d-1). Overall seed predation after 48 h was significantly higher on wheat (mean 16.8%) than mustard seeds (5.6%). High-elevation maize fields also had higher seed predation (27.8%) than low-elevation ones (0.6%) or pastures (3.6%), but did not differ from the native forest (12.9%). Decomposition after 90 days was highest in pastures (78.4% and 45.9%, for tea and rooibos, respectively); although no significant differences between habitats were detected, except for low-elevation maize fields (64.4% and 33.6%). Conversion from native forest to cultivated land did not cause a clear decrease in the intensity of the studied ESs/EDs except for vertebrate predation. Using direct monitoring tools to simultaneously and consistently quantify multiple ecological processes is not only possible but needed, as ecological processes can respond differ-ently to landscape changes.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar versus Inclinometer Ground Surface Deformations at Active Landslide
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Rockfalls and landslides commonly occur in the Hawaiian islands. When these events occur along a thoroughfare, they can result in the loss of lives, cause significant damage to infrastructure, and force full or partial road closures, resulting in traffic congestion and commuting delays, sometimes for months. The Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) is interested in historic slope movements along its roads and highways, as this history can guide in prioritizing spending on slope remediation. This has prompted HDOT to be interested in the use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) imagery for detecting historical slope movements and identifying areas that might pose concern for landslide or rockfall activity. To provide a proof of concept for the implementation of this technology in Hawaii, an InSAR case study of a landslide on the island of O'ahu was conducted to compare the results with available inclinometer data. Two-dimensional decomposition was implemented for opposing orbits of descending and ascending Sentinel-1 datasets. Overall, the results show that when both ascending and descending datasets are used to derive line-of-sight displacements that are resolved in a direction along the direction of movement (typically perpendicular to the slope contours), InSAR analysis can effectively capture inclinometer trends in areas experiencing relatively no or little displacement over time (<30 mm/year) but the accuracy diminishes in fast-moving slides (>= 270 mm/year).

TI  - Perceived interest in learning sustainability competencies among higher education students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to assess higher education students' interest in learning sustainability competencies and their pro-ecological worldviews at a large research-intensive university in Finland to provide a background information for developing a sustainability science course. Design/methodology/approachIn total, 797 students participated in the study. The data were collected through an online survey that measured students' interest in learning sustainability competencies and their pro-ecological worldviews. Participants were classified into five categories based on field of study. The data were analysed by using Pearson's correlation, independent samples t-tests, and analysis of variance. FindingsThe participating students perceived learning of critical thinking and values thinking most interesting. Interest in learning sustainability competencies and pro-ecological worldview appeared to differ across fields of study. Participants studying humanities expressed lower interest in collaborative use of digital technology compared to the participating students in science and agriculture. Participating students in health and welfare scored lower on interest in learning values thinking than students in other study fields. Research limitations/implicationsThe response rate was low. It is likely that the participants felt strongly about sustainability challenges, therefore making them more interested in sustainability competencies. The limited number of sustainability competencies studied does not allow generalisation to all sustainability competencies. Practical implicationsThe differences in interest in learning sustainability competencies and pro-ecological worldview should be understood and considered when planning sustainability education. Originality/valueThese results provide new insights into the interlinkage of students' interest in learning sustainability competencies, their pro-ecological worldviews and their field of study.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gorgan Bay (GB) and Miankaleh Peninsula biosphere reserve has faced an endangering condition because of a significant water loss and quality degradation due to intensive eutrophication. How-ever, a synoptic view of the spatiotemporal dynamic of eutrophication is missing. In this study, we first used MODIS data to trace the long-term trend of eutrophication in GB between 2003 and 2021. To investigate the intra-annual variability of Chl-a in GB at a much higher spatial resolu-tion, we developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm that uses Sentinel-2 imagery to map monthly Chl-a in the water year 2020-2021. Finally, we explored the major physical con-trols on eutrophication in GB. Long-term status of trophic index in GB revealed that 4%, 18%, 15%, 24%, and 39% of the months between 2003 and 2021 were under the oligotrophic, intense oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and intense eutrophic condition, respectively. The results also showed a very good agreement between the observed Chl-a concentration and that estimated from ANN, as evidenced by R-2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 1.51 mg/m(3). We found that in eight months of the water year 2020-2021, there was a region of high Chl-a concentration in the southeast of GB near the outlet of the Qarasu River. We also observed that nutrient entrance to GB from the Qarasu River imposes a greater impact on Chl-a concentration in GB than that from the Gorgan-rud River. Our findings suggest that under the current GB's water circulation, the critical eutroph-ication status in GB has a slight impact on the pollution of the Caspian Sea, except along the southeastern shoreline.

TI  - Effect of cloud micro-physics on zenith brightness in urban environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Review
AB  - Cloud cover is amplifying light pollution for observers located within light-emitting cities. In addition to light scattering and absorption below the cloud layer, artificial light from the ground is reflected, trans-mitted, and absorbed by the cloud layer itself. The sky brightness on a cloudy night is determined by cloud attributes such as cloud base height and reflectance. Satellite observations provide enough infor-mation about cloud micro-physical properties to compute cloud reflectance accurately. These characteristics include cloud optical thickness, particle phase, effective particle size, water path, and cloud base height. They can be obtained from satellites through direct measurements at various wave-lengths of the visible and infrared spectrum or acquired empirically using other measured quantities. The method for obtaining cloud properties, as well as calculating cloud reflectance for numerical mod-eling of zenith brightness, are provided in the paper. The modeled zenith sky brightness is compared to measurements for selected sites with known cloud features. As a result, the zenith brightness is explicitly dependent on two co-playing parameters: cloud base height and optical thickness. While the higher the optical thickness, the brighter the zenith, the cloud base altitude has the reverse effect. The higher the cloud ceiling, the darker the zenith.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) maps are relevant tools to recognize deep changes in the natural landscape and direct strategies to minimize environmental impacts, being an important apparatus to obtain useful information in making decision by managers from watershed committees, political leaders and environmental agencies. Using Landsat multispectral images, this study aimed to investigate the changes in LULC of a watershed, influenced by the construction of the dam of the Tres Irmaos hydroelectric plant, located in the low course of the Tiete River. The images were acquired in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2018, which covers the periods before and after the flood caused by the dam build. For each date, LULC maps were generated using the supervised classification Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm. Those analysis has allowed identify possible influences of the reservoir formation over LULC in the watershed. A deep analysis showed a significant change of natural vegetation were flooded due to the damming, being partially recovered, in percentage terms, over time around the new watercourse. This study presents a reduction of 67% in the natural vegetation area from 1990 to 2000, while there was an increase of 35,36% between 2000 and 2018, when compared to the area occupied by natural vegetation existing in 1990. In addition, areas of natural vegetation also have been replaced by cultivated areas, which are predominant in the watershed.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION A-PHYSICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics and their impacts in the Alwero watershed, in western Ethiopia. LULC datasets were created from Landsat imagery from 1973, 1987, 2002, and 2020 using ArcGIS 10.7 (R) software. Results show that forest cover decreased from 52 to 30% between 1973 and 2020, mainly due to the expansion of cultivated land (small and large farms). Between 1973 and 2020, the number of small farms increased from 7.4 to 13.2%, with a net decrease in bare land (74.2%), grassland (19.7%), and forest (2.6%). Large farms increased from 1.5 to 7.2% between 2002 and 2020, with a net decrease in fallow (44%) and natural vegetation (19.4%). Fallow land shows a decreasing trend from 28% (1973) to 13% (2020), due to increased conversion to small farms (35.0%) and large farms (20.1%). The main causes of the changes are the rapid population growth and the large scale agricultural investments in the region. The deterioration of local people's living conditions and deforestation are the main impacts of LULC change in the study area. The innovative element of this study is the production of maps for large and small farms separately, which is useful for making decisions related to problems of large agricultural land investments (LALIs). The study concludes that the continued loss of forests will affect the government's development vision in general and mitigation of the negative impacts of climate change and climate variability in particular.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Soil moisture is an important factor that can be used for referring to flood situations, monitoring drought estimation, and changes in the environment such as storms and soil erosion. The Optical Trapezoid Model (OPTRAM) estimates surface soil moisture using shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (STR) and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in trapezoidal space. In this study, Landsat 8 satellite data were acquired for May (2019) and October (2019) and used for analysis in the Narmadapuram district of Madhya Pradesh, India. Validation of the retrieved soil moisture was done using microwave satellite data available on the VEDAS portal. The output maps show that soil moisture values vary from 0.0235 (m(3)/m(3)) to 0.162 (m(3)/m(3)) for May 2019 and from 0.417 to 0.781 (m(3)/m(3)) for October 2019. The data obtained from the VEDAS portal has the average change in soil moisture values in May and October 2019 as 0.04 m(3)/m(3) and 0.55 m(3)/m(3), respectively. The outcome of the study shows that the model has nearly the same accuracy as the VEDAS (Visualisation of Earth Observation Data and Archival System) portal data.

TI  - Immune determinants of the pre-metastatic niche
T2  - CANCER CELL
M3  - Review
AB  - Primary tumors actively and specifically prime pre-metastatic niches (PMNs), the future sites of organotropic metastasis, preparing these distant microenvironments for disseminated tumor cell arrival. While initial studies of the PMN focused on extracellular matrix alterations and stromal reprogramming, it is increasingly clear that the far-reaching effects of tumors are in great part achieved through systemic and local PMN immu-nosuppression. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the tumor immune microenviron-ment and provide a comprehensive overview of the immune determinants of the PMN's spatiotemporal evolution. Moreover, we depict the PMN immune landscape, based on functional pre-clinical studies as well as mounting clinical evidence, and the dynamic, reciprocal crosstalk with systemic changes imposed by cancer progression. Finally, we outline emerging therapeutic approaches that alter the dynamics of the interactions driving PMN formation and reverse immunosuppression programs in the PMN ensuring early anti-tumor immune responses.

TI  - Mechanism of erosion zone formation based on hydrodynamic factor analysis in the Mekong Delta coast, Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seven southern most provinces of Vietnam are part of the Lower Mekong Delta (LMD) with approximately 740 km of coastline during the 2016-2020 period faced extensive shoreline erosion. This study analysed the erosion/accretion trends from 2016 to 2020 and determined the mechanism underlying erosion using a MIKE 21/3 toolkit, including the hydrodynamic module (HD), wave spectrum simulation (SW), and sediment trans-port (MT), focusing on tides, currents, waves, and sediment transport factors. Satellite images (Google Earth), remote sensing images (Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS C1 Level-1), and a combination of hydrodynamic modules were used to evaluate the combined effects of erosion processes. Remote sensing results showed that the erosion speed increased over time. After five years, the coastline of Ca Mau province had an erosion rate of 32.5 m/year in the east and -12.9 m/year in the west. The accretion rate and area gradually decreased from 2016 to 2020. The natural factors that cause shoreline erosion in the MDC are the tidal regime, flow velocity and direction, wave height and direction to shore, and sediment volume. Evaluating shoreline changes using remote sensing technology and validating the results using hydrodynamic models provides a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying coastal erosion and its development and provides a basis for developing a coastal protection strategy.

TI  - Predictive factors of sentinel lymph node failed mapping in endometrial carcinoma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - ObjectiveIn endometrial carcinoma patients, sentinel lymph node bilateral mapping fails in 20-25% of cases, with several factors affecting the likelihood of detection. However, pooled data about predictive factors of failure are lacking. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the predictive factors of sentinel lymph node failed mapping in endometrial cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy. MethodsA systematic review and a meta-analysis was performed searching all studies assessing predictive factors of sentinel lymph node failed mapping in apparent uterine-confined endometrial cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy through the cervical injection of indocyanine green. The associations between sentinel lymph node failed mapping and predictive factors of failure were assessed, calculating the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. ResultsSix studies with a total of 1345 patients were included. Compared with patients with sentinel lymph node bilateral successful mapping, patients with sentinel lymph node failed mapping showed: OR 1.39 (p=0.41) for body mass index >30 kg/m(2); OR 1.72 (p=0.24) for menopausal status; OR 1.19 (p=0.74) for adenomyosis; OR 0.86 (p=0.55) for prior pelvic surgery; OR 2.38 (p=0.26) for prior cervical surgery; OR 0.96 (p=0.89) for prior Cesarean section; OR 1.39 (p=0.70) for lysis of adhesions during surgery before sentinel lymph node biopsy; OR 1.77 (p=0.02) for indocyanine green dose <3 mL; OR 1.28 (p=0.31) for deep myometrial invasion; OR 1.21 (p=0.42) for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grade 3; OR 1.89 (p=0.01) for FIGO stages III-IV; OR 1.62 (p=0.07) for non-endometrioid histotype; OR 1.29 (p=0.25) for lymph-vascular space invasion; OR 4.11 (p<0.0001) for enlarged lymph nodes; and OR 1.71 (p=0.022) for lymph node involvement. ConclusionIndocyanine green dose <3 mL, FIGO stage III-IV, enlarged lymph nodes, and lymph node involvement are predictive factors of sentinel lymph node failed mapping in endometrial cancer patients.

TI  - Increasing rates of general anesthesia use in lumpectomy procedures: A 15-year trends analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAnesthesia methods in oncologic breast surgery have evolved with less invasive practices. The aims of this study were primarily to examine trends in anesthesia type used during lumpectomy. MethodsWe analyzed lumpectomy procedures from 2005 to 2019 using the NSQIP database. Upon defining the nadir in general anesthesia (GA) and peak in monitored anesthesia care (MAC) use as 2007, we compared patient characteristics and complications in the 2007 versus 2019 GA and MAC cohorts. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with receipt of GA. ResultsOf 253 545 lumpectomy patients, 191 773 (75.6%) received GA and 61 772 (24.4%) received MAC. From 2005 to 2019, GA rates increased from 66.7% to 82.5%, while MAC rates decreased from 33.3% to 17.5%. More GA patients were obese and American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3. Over time, age and body mass index (BMI) increased in both GA and MAC cohorts. Odds of receiving GA increased over time, and predictors included concurrent axillary lymph node dissection (p < 0.0001) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (p < 0.0001). ConclusionsWe demonstrate increasing use of GA over time for lumpectomy, which may be related to aging lumpectomy patient population with higher BMIs. We also find a strong association between use of GA and concurrent lymph node procedures.

TI  - Urban tree pests can support biological control services in landscape shrubs
T2  - BIOCONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Scale insects are common tree pests in urban ecosystems. Although severe scale infestations can worsen tree condition, trees can tolerate moderate scale densities. Scale insects are prey for many arthropod natural enemies that also feed on plant pests throughout urban landscapes. Because scale-infested trees support natural enemy communities, they may support biological control services on nearby plants and function analogously to banker plants in greenhouse production systems. In this study we tested if sentinel insect prey were more likely to be removed on shrubs below scale-infested trees compared to scale-uninfested trees. We conducted several biological control experiments from 2019 to 2021 using fruit flies, aphids, and caterpillars in potted and planted holly shrubs below scale-infested and scale-uninfested oak trees. We found that caterpillars in potted shrubs and fruit flies in planted landscape shrubs were more likely to be removed underneath scale-infested trees compared to scale-uninfested trees. Caterpillars were also more likely to be removed from landscape Ilex vomitoria shrubs compared to I. cornuta shrubs. In all other experiments we found no effect of scale infestation status or shrub species on prey removal. Our results suggest that scale-infested trees can support biological control services in shrubs below them but that this effect can vary depending on prey and shrub species. The natural enemy communities in urban trees and shrubs appear to be linked and tolerating tree pests can favor conservation biological control services in urban landscapes.

TI  - Inversion models of aboveground grassland biomass in Xinjiang based on multisource data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland biomass monitoring is essential for assessing grassland health and carbon cycling. However, monitoring grassland biomass in drylands based on satellite remote sensing is challenging.Statistical regression models and machine learning have been used for the construction of grassland biomass models, but the predictive power for different grassland types is unclear. Additionally, the selection of the most appropriate variables to construct a biomass inversion model for different grassland types must be explored. Therefore,1201 ground-truthed data points collected from 2014-2021,including 15 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices,geographic location and topographic data,and meteorological factors and vegetation biophysical indicators were screened for key variables using principal component analysis (PCA). The accuracy of multiple linear regression models, exponential regression models, power function models, support vector machine (SVM) models, random forest (RF) models, and neural network models was evaluated for the inversion of three types of grassland biomass. The results were as follows: (1) The biomass inversion accuracy of single vegetation indices was low, and the optimal vegetation indices were the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) (R2 = 0.255), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (R2 = 0.372) and optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) (R2 = 0.285). (2)Grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) was affected by various factors such as geographic location,topography, and meteorological factors, and the inverse models using a single environmental variable had large errors. (3) The main variables used to model biomass in the three types of grasslands were different. SAVI, aspect, slope, and precipitation (Prec.) were selected for desert grasslands; NDVI,shortwave infrared 2 (SWI2), longitude, mean temperature, and annual precipitation were selected for steppe;and OSAVI, phytochrome ratio (PPR), longitude, precipitation, and temperature were selected for meadows. (4) The non-parametric meadow biomass model was superior to the statistical regression model. (5) The RF model was the best model for the inversion of grassland biomass in Xinjiang, and this model had the highest accuracy for grassland biomass inversion (R2 = 0.656, root mean square error (RMSE) = 815.6 kg/ha),followed by meadow (R2 = 0.610, RMSE = 547.9 kg/ha) and desert grassland (R2 = 0.441, RMSE = 353.6 kg/ha).

TI  - Abundance patterns of mammals across Russia explained by remotely sensed vegetation productivity and snow indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimPredicting biodiversity responses to global changes requires good models of species distributions. Both environmental conditions and human activities determine population density patterns. However, quantifying the relationship between wildlife population densities and their underlying environmental conditions across large geographical scales has remained challenging. Our goal was to explain the abundances of mammal species based on their response to several remotely sensed indices including the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) and the novel Winter Habitat Indices (WHIs). LocationRussia, the majority of regions. TaxonEight mammal species. MethodsWe estimated average population densities for each species across Russia from 1981 to 2010 from winter track counts. The DHIs measure vegetative productivity, a proxy for food availability. Our WHIs included the duration of snow-free ground, duration of snow-covered ground and the start, end and length of frozen season. In models, we included elevation, climate conditions, human footprint index. We parameterized multiple linear regression and applied best-subset model selection to determine the main factors influencing population density. ResultsThe DHIs were included in some of the top-twelve models of every species, and in the top model for moose, wild boar, red fox and wolf, so they were important for species at all trophic levels. The WHIs were included in top models for all species except roe deer, demonstrating the importance of winter conditions. The duration of frozen ground without snow and the end of frozen season were particularly important. Our top models performed well for all the species (R-adj(2) 0.43-0.87). Main ConclusionsThe combination of the DHIs and the WHIs with climate and human-related variables resulted in high explanatory power. We show that vegetation productivity and winter conditions are key drivers of variation in population density of eight species across Russia.

TI  - Improving the combined use of reflectance and thermal channels for ocean and coastal cloud detection for the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflectance imagery is used to aid daytime cloud detection in thermal remote sensing. This paper presents new approaches to utilization of reflectance for sea surface temperature (SST) remote sensing for the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). SLSTR is an along-track scanning sensor with a complex instrumental viewing geometry, and no co-registration of the fields-of-view of reflectance and thermal pixels. Reflectance channels have twice the spatial resolution of thermal channels, and observations are placed on compatible "image grids" for the convenience of users of Level-1 data. We highlight limitations of simple methods, based on these image grids, of using reflectance imagery to inform cloud detection at the thermal resolution. We present improvements from averaging the N-nearest reflectance observations directly to the infrared instrument geometry, where N = 10 is chosen in this study when using the A and B stripes together. We show that the standard deviation of the N-nearest reflectance observations is another calculable quantity of use to improve the discrimination of clouds in the infrared image, beneficially reducing the weight placed on coarser-scale thermal spatial variability. The developments are illustrated by case studies in coastal zones over optically bright waters and around strong ocean fronts, and the benefit for SST products is quantified by the impacts on coverage and validation statistics. In a case study over optically bright waters, the clear-sky fraction increases from 46.2% to 93.1%. Coastal zone validation shows a 23.8-31.6% reduction in the false alarm rate and a corresponding 27.133.3% increase in the cloud detection true skill score. Globally the robust standard deviation for clear-sky matches between SLSTR-A and drifting buoys reduces from 0.3 to 0.29 with a 6% reduction in data due to improved screening of scattered cloud.

TI  - CubeSats show persistence of bull kelp refugia amidst a regional collapse in California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bull kelp populations in northern California declined drastically in response to the 2014-2016 marine heatwave, sea star wasting disease, and subsequently large increases in herbivorous purple urchin populations. Despite the regional kelp forest collapse, there were small, remnant populations where bull kelp was able to survive. Moderate resolution satellites (i.e., Landsat) have been important for creating long-term, large-scale time series of bull kelp forests, however, these have been shown to underestimate or entirely exclude refugia due to their low densities and proximity to the coastline. While measurements from Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are spatially detailed, they are temporally limited and difficult to collect over regional scales. The development of CubeSat constellations has enabled a workaround for these tradeoffs, with global imagery available near-daily at meter-scale. We developed a method for mapping bull kelp canopy across the different sensor cohorts in the PlanetScope constellation. This required correcting surface reflectance measurements to account for differences in the spectral response functions among the sensors and leveraging the temporal frequency of PlanetScope data to increase the automation of classifying kelp canopy in imagery with increased noise. Using the PlanetScope derived kelp canopy extents, we identified locations where bull kelp refugia have persisted in northern California. We found that bull kelp refugia occupied about 2% of the total available habitat in the region and about 9.4% of the average canopy area observed prior to 2014. These areas may be critical to the success of kelp forest re-establishment in northern California, which increases their importance for ongoing monitoring, conservation, and restoration efforts.

TI  - Assessing the changeability of precipitation patterns using multiple remote sensing data and an efficient uncertainty method over different climate regions of Iran
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - While the rain gauge measurements are unevenly distributed in many world regions, it is necessary to use remote sensing-based precipitation data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. On the other hand, quantifying the uncertainty of precipitation is a vital issue for hydrometeorological applications globally. For this purpose, applying a new fusion framework using high-resolution remote sensing datasets can provide accurate precipi-tation evaluation against local observations with low uncertainty. This study examines three weighted fusion -based models containing the Ordered-Weighted-Averaged (OWA) family approach based on the ORLIKE method (OWA-ORLIKE) and ORNESS method (OWA-ORNESS) as well as the Entropy-weight (EW) method to combine different remote sensing precipitation products over different climate zones of Iran. In this case, mul-tiple monthly remotely sensed datasets, including ERA5, ERA5-Land, TerraClimate, GPM, PERSIANN-CDR, TRMM, and CHIRPS, are utilized to assess precipitation patterns versus local measurements, which were gath-ered by Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Furthermore, the K-means algorithm is employed to cluster ground -based precipitation stations based on the climate zones category across Iran. Additionally, the Genetic Optimi-zation Algorithm (GOA) is applied to specify optimal values of weights in weighting-based models. The per-formance of single and combination datasets are evaluated using statistical error metrics, including Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), root mean square error (RMSE), Kling Gupta efficiency (KGE), and bias. The Thiessen polygon method has been applied to calculate each cluster's mean precipitation to obtain the optimal weights of stations. Finally, as an efficient uncertainty approach, Cross Wavelet Transform (XWT) method has been used for uncertainty assessment of monthly and seasonal precipitation series. Results indicated that the OWA family as the best fusion model had almost the lowest uncertainty values and best statistical error indices compared to the EW model and all single products in different clusters of Iran. As a motivation part of this study, unlike the single sources of remotely sensed data, multiple datasets can apply together in different climate conditions with various features using combination models, which mentioned uncertainty method has clearly revealed this claim.

TI  - Are the MIA and MSKCC nomograms useful in selecting patients with melanoma for sentinel lymph node biopsy?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and MethodsThe Melanoma Institute of Australia (MIA) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomograms were developed to help guide sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) decisions. Although statistically validated, whether these prediction models provide clinical benefit at National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-endorsed thresholds is unknown. We conducted a net benefit analysis to quantify the clinical utility of these nomograms at risk thresholds of 5%-10% compared to the alternative strategy of biopsying all patients. External validation data for MIA and MSKCC nomograms were extracted from respective published studies. ResultsThe MIA nomogram provided added net benefit at a risk threshold of 9% but net harm at 5%-8% and 10%. The MSKCC nomogram provided added net benefit at risk thresholds of 5% and 9%-10% but net harm at 6%-8%. When present, the magnitude of net benefit was small (1-3 net avoidable biopsies per 100 patients). ConclusionNeither model consistently provided added net benefit compared to performing SLNB for all patients. DiscussionBased on published data, use of the MIA or MSKCC nomograms as decision-making tools for SLNB at risk thresholds of 5%-10% does not clearly provide clinical benefit to patients.

TI  - TRANSLACOL project: Nodal human papillomavirus tumoral DNA detection by ddPCR for survival prediction in early cervical cancer patients without pelvic lymph node invasion
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: : In early cervical cancer (EEC), 10 to 15% of patients without nodal metastasis (N-) will suffer from recurrences with further similar survival as N+ patients. However, no clinical, imaging or pathological risk-factor is today available to identify them. In the present study, we hypothesized that the N-histologically characterized patients who present a poor prognosis could be patients for whom metastasis are missed by classical procedure. Therefore, we propose to research HPV tumoral DNA (HPVtDNA) in pelvic Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLN) biopsy using ultrasensitive droplet-based digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect eventual occult metastasis.Materials and methods: : Sixty HPV16, HPV18 or HPV33 positive EEC N-patients with available SLN were included. In SLN, HPV16 E6, HPV18 E7 and HPV33 E6 gene were respectively detected using ultrasensitive ddPCR technology. Survival data were analysed using Kaplan-Meier-curves and log-rank-test to compare progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in two groups according to their HPVtDNA status in SLN.Results: : More than half (51.7%) of the patients finally showed HPVtDNA positivity in SLN initially diagnosed as negative by histology. Two patients with negative HPVtDNA SLN and 6 with positive HPVtDNA SLN group presented recurrence. Finally, all of the 4 deaths listed in our study occurred in the positive HPVtDNA SLN group.Conclusion: : These observations hint that the use of ultrasensitive ddPCR to detect HPVtDNA in SLN could allow the identification of two subgroups of histologically N-patients that may have different prognosis and outcome.

TI  - Continental-scale wetland mapping: A novel algorithm for detailed wetland types classification based on time series Sentinel-1/2 images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands have suffered from considerable degradation due to anthropogenic and natural disturbances in recent decades. Although some advancements have been made, effective methods that can produce large-scale wetland maps with detailed categories are still lacking due to the diversity and complexity of wetland ecosystems. To address this issue, we developed a novel algorithm for detailed wetland types classification integrating k-fold random forest and hierarchical decision tree, and so named two-step classification algorithm. Firstly, the phenology-based features were composited based on time series Sentinel-1/2 images, and the k-fold random forest was used to extract five rough wetland types in Google Earth Engine platform. Secondly, the hierarchical decision tree designed based on geometric features was used to separate the rough wetland types into fourteen detailed types. Application of the two-step classification method in Northern, Central and Southern Asia (NCSA) resulted in a continental-scale wetland map with an overall accuracy of 90.0 +/- 0.5%. Wetland types, including inland marsh, lake, river, coastal swamp, estuarine water, lagoon, shallow marine water, reservoir, canal/ channel and agricultural pond, had good accuracy with both UA and PA over 77%. The remaining wetland types had moderate accuracy, with both UA and PA over 58%. As we calculated, total wetland areas of NCSA were 1,375,489.27 km2. Among the fourteen wetland categories, the inland marsh had the largest area (544,584.38 km2) and was primarily distributed in subarctic and humid continental climates, while the canal/channel had the smallest area (1,651.57 km2) and was primarily scattered in desert, semiarid and humid subtropical climates. The lake and floodplain shared generally large areas with value of 392,413.55 km2 and 173,255.71 km2 respectively, which were typically distributed across desert and semiarid climates. This study successfully mapped continental-scale wetlands with detailed categories at a 10-m spatial resolution, which can provide valuable information for the management of wetland ecosystems and facilitate the implementation of wetland-related sustainable development goals.

TI  - A pathway for multi-stage cyclone-induced hazard tracking-case study for Yaas
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - A Very Severe Cyclonic Storm 'Yaas' developed over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) on 23 May 2021 and crossed over the Odisha coast on 26 May with maximum sustained wind speed of 75 kts. Herein, a pathway has been developed and exemplified for 'Yaas' through three-stage cyclone-induced hazard tracking. Days before the cyclone formation, cyclone genesis potential parameter, sea surface temperature (SST) (> 30 degrees C) and tropical cyclone heat potential (anomaly of 40-80 kJ/cm(2)) indicated a strong possibility of cyclogenesis in the BoB. A Lagrangian advection model used for its track prediction with 24-h lead-time provided an accuracy of similar to 19 km and similar to 6 h in its landfall location and time. Further, intensity prediction was done using numerical weather prediction model. Geostationary satellites, INSAT-3D/3DR, were used to visualize cyclone structure. Passing of cyclone had its reverbarations in oceans, which are observed in SST drop of similar to 3 degrees C, salinity and density increase by similar to 1 psu and similar to 2 kg/m(3), respectively. During the period, 23-26 May 2021, the Ekman suction velocity and chlorophyll concentration were found significantly high at similar to 5 m/day and > 0.5 mg/m(3), respectively. Forecast of storm surge was found to be between 3.5 and 4 m at coastal locations. Significant wave height was found to be 5.5-9.2 m. The coastal inundation forecast for 24 May 2021 provided its quantitative maximum inland extent. Finally, loss of the crop, fishery and forest areas by strong winds and inundation/ingress of saline water associated with storm surge were examined using SAR and optical data.

TI  - Re-imagining education: cultivating a triangle of trust and relational pedagogy within a participatory paradigm
T2  - EDUCATION 3-13
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this article, we envision a holistic approach to the education of children within a participatory paradigm, which integrates inner and outer worlds in a new understanding of consciousness. The inspiration for our reimagining arose from a research study undertaken in partnership with Kids Planet Day Nurseries which included inquiring into the impact of Covid-19 on children in early childhood education and care. It was discovered that, although parents and practitioners identified Covid as a traumatic event, there was little awareness of the potential effects on children's inner worlds. Similarly, the government in its post-lockdown policymaking focused on catch-up with learning, rather than addressing wider psychological issues. In this reimagining of the education system, the neoliberal principle of 'profit as primary' has been eradicated, along with its long-term positivist partner 'scientism', which proclaims all valid knowledge is quantifiable. Instead, the focus is on the intra-active dimensions of learning, grounded in the idea of a 'triangle of trust' developed in the early years and continued into a relational pedagogy in primary schools. The challenges involved in replacing a positivist Newtonian worldview with a participatory paradigm, where inner and outer worlds are entangled and equally important, are discussed.

TI  - Abandoned land identification in karst mountain area based on time series SAR characteristics at geo-parcels scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping abandoned land is very important for accurate agricultural management. However, in karst mountainous areas, continuous high-resolution optical images are difficult to obtain in rainy weather, and the land is fragmented, which poses a great challenge for remote sensing monitoring of agriculture activities. In this study, a new method for identifying abandoned land is proposed: firstly, a few Google Earth images are used to transform arable land into accurate vectorized geo-parcels; secondly, a time-series data set was constructed using Sentinel-1A Alpha parameters for 2020 on each farmland geoparcel; thirdly, the semi-variation function (SVF) was used to analyze the spatial-temporal characteristics, then identify abandoned land. The results show: (1) On the basis of accurate spatial information and boundary of farmland land, the SAR time-series dataset reflects the structure and time-series response. The method eventually extracted abandoned land with an accuracy of 80.25%. The problem of remote sensing monitoring in rainy regions and complex surface areas is well-resolved. (2) The spatial heterogeneity of abandoned land is more obvious than that of cultivated land within geo-parcels. The step size for significant changes in the SVF of abandoned land is shorter than that of cultivated land. (3) The SVF time sequence curve presented a strong peak feature when farmland was abandoned. This reveals that the internal spatial structure of abandoned land is more disordered and complex. It showed that time-series variations of spatial structure within cultivated land have broader applications in remote sensing monitoring of agriculture in complex imaging environments.

TI  - A reverse genetic approach in geckos with the CRISPR/Cas9 system by oocyte microinjection
T2  - DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reptiles are important model organisms in developmental and evolutionary biology, but are used less widely than other amniotes such as mouse and chicken. One of the main reasons for this is that has proven difficult to conduct CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in many reptile species despite the widespread use of this technology in other taxa. Certain features of reptile reproductive systems make it difficult to access one-cell or early-stage zy-gotes, which represents a key impediment to gene editing techniques. Recently, Rasys and colleagues reported a genome editing method using oocyte microinjection that allowed them to produce genome-edited Anolis lizards. This method opened a new avenue to reverse genetics studies in reptiles. In the present article, we report the development of a related method for genome editing in the Madagascar ground gecko (Paroedura picta), a well -established experimental model, and describe the generation of Tyr and Fgf10 gene-knockout geckos in the F0 generation.

TI  - Rotating scanning strategies for tailoring crystallographic texture of additively manufactured NiTi shape memory alloy
T2  - MATERIALS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to the ability to create complicated shapes, a key benefit of additive manufacturing (AM) is the ability to customize the microstructure and, therefore, the qualities of the components. Scan strategy has significant potential to alter the microstructure of materials. This work present new methods for controlling the crystallo-graphic texture of as-printed Nickel Titanium (NiTi) components by rotating the scan strategies. In order to accomplish this goal, three scan strategies were chosen: 90-degree, 45-degree, and 67-degree rotation scan strategies. The sample manufactured using the 90-degree scan strategy has a significant 001 texture in the build-up and scanning directions. However, the 45-degree and 67-degree rotation scan strategies reveal a new crystallographic texture in ZY and XY planes.

TI  - Terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> exchange diagnosis using a peatland-optimized vegetation photosynthesis and respiration model (VPRM) for the Hudson Bay Lowlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) models have been widely used to estimate gross primary production in various terrestrial ecosystems such as forests and croplands, but northern peatlands have received less attention. In particular, the Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) which is a massive peatland-rich region in Canada has been largely ignored in previous LUE-based studies. These peatland ecosystems have accumulated large stocks of organic carbon over many millennia, and play a vital role in the global carbon cycle. In this study, we used the satellite data-driven Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) to examine the suitability of LUE models for carbon flux diagnosis in the HBL. VPRM was driven alternately with the satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and solar -induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). The model parameter values were constrained by eddy covariance (EC) tower observations from the Churchill fen and Attawapiskat River bog sites. The main objectives of the study were to (i) investigate if site-specific parameter optimization improved NEE estimates, (ii) determine which satellite-based proxy of photosynthesis produced more reliable estimates of peatland net carbon exchange, and (iii) examine how LUE and other model parameters vary within and between the study sites. The results indicate that the VPRM mean diurnal and monthly estimates of NEE had significant strong agreements with EC tower fluxes at the two study sites. A comparison of the site-optimized VPRM against a generic peatland-optimized version of the model revealed that the site-optimized VPRM provided better estimates of NEE only during the calibration period at the Churchill fen. The diurnal and seasonal cycles of peatland carbon exchange were better captured by the SIF-driven VPRM, demonstrating that SIF is a more accurate proxy for photosynthesis compared to EVI. Our study suggests that satellite -based LUE models have the potential to be applied on a larger scale to the HBL region.

TI  - Temporal changes in the remote sensing reflectance at Lake V?nern
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aerosol Robotic Network -Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) instrument located at the Palgrunden site in Lake Vanern provides values of remote sensing spectral reflectance RRS(2,,,) since 2008. These in situ RRS(2,,,) indicated a temporal increase from 2015 at center-wavelengths in the green and red spectral regions. To investigate the environmental and climate processes responsible for this increase, water color trends in Lake Vanern were analyzed considering in situ limnological measurements, meteo-climatic quantities and additionally satellite-derived data products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on board the Aqua platform (MODIS-A). Satellite ocean color RRS(2,,,) data assessed against in situ RRS(2,,,) from the Palgrunden site showed satisfactory agreement at a number of spectral bands. Relying on these validation results, comprehensive statistical analysis were performed using MODIS-A RRS(2,,,). These indicated periodical changes between 2002 and 2021 with clear minima occurring between 2010 and 2013. The complementary analyses of temporal changes characterizing limological and meteo-climatic quantities, and also relationships between these quantities and RRS(2,,,), indicated the existence of complex and concurrent bio-geochemical processes influencing water color in Lake Vanern. In particular, significant correlations were observed between RRS(2,,,) and turbidity, and also between RRS(2,,,) and total biovolume. Additionally, an early warming of Lake Vanern surface waters was identified since spring 2014. This occurrence could potentially affect the vertical mixing and water exchange between turbid coastal and pelagic waters with implications for phytoplankton phenology. (c) 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Assessment of water demands for irrigation using energy balance and satellite data fusion models in cloud computing: A study in the Brazilian semiarid region
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of irrigation in arid and semiarid regions is imperative to ensure the sustainable use of limited water resources and guarantee food production. Therefore, this study aimed to assess actual evapotranspiration - ETa derived from the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land - SEBAL model with and without satellite image fusion as input of a soil water balance in a pilot area of sugarcane in the semiarid region of Brazil. A fusion of Landsat sensors' and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - MODIS' images was completed through a Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model - STARFM script developed using cloud computing, and its performance in estimating key variables for the radiation balance was evaluated. ETa and irrigation were daily estimated between June, 2015 and May, 2016 by combining STARFM with SEBAL and evaluated according to the Bowen ratio technique and irrigation data. In addition, one-minute surface meteorological elements at the satellite overpass times were used. STARFM performed well with RMSE of 17.00 W m- 2, 2.28 K, 0.07, and 0.01 for Rn, Ts, NDVI, and albedo, respectively. The metrics employed to evaluate ETa estimates indicated that the SEBAL+STARFM has low mean errors (PBIAS =-2.75% and RMSE = 0.97 mm d-1 and 16.66 mm month-1) and high coefficient of determination (0.87 for daily ETa-ET24, and 0.91 for monthly ETa), in comparison with SEBAL using Landsat-only images (PBIAS = - 5.25%, RMSE = 0.97 mm d-1 and 17.66 mm month-1, r2 = 0.92). Adding fused images resulted in a better fit of the estimated cumulative ET24 curve to the measured ET24. The water balance indicated that the cultivated cane suffered water stress, which was better represented by estimates using the ET24 curve with the addition of fused images than Landsat images alone. Although this increase in temporal resolution of the estimated ET24 data indicated a greater water consumption, it informs a quantity that would be sufficient to meet the water demand of the crops.

TI  - Child physical abuse screening in a pediatric ED; Does TRAIN(ing) Help?
T2  - BMC PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundChild maltreatment is distressingly prevalent yet remains under-recognized by healthcare providers. In 2015 the Ohio Children's Hospital Association developed the Timely Recognition of Abusive INjuries (TRAIN) collaborative in an effort to promote child physical abuse (CPA) screening. Our institution implemented the TRAIN initiative in 2019. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the TRAIN initiative at this institution.MethodsIn this retrospective chart review we recorded the incidence of sentinel injuries (SIS) in children presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of an independent level 2 pediatric trauma center. SIS were defined and identified by a diagnosis of ecchymosis, contusion, fracture, head injury, intracranial hemorrhage, abdominal trauma, open wound, laceration, abrasion, oropharyngeal injury, genital injury, intoxication, or burn in a child < 6.01 months of age. Patients were stratified into pre-TRAIN (PRE), 1/2017-9/2018, or post-TRAIN (POST), 10/2019-7/2020, periods. Repeat injury was defined as a subsequent visit for any of the previously mentioned diagnoses within 12 months of the initial visit. Demographics/visit characteristics were analyzed using Chi square analysis, Fischer's exact test, and student's paired t-test.ResultsIn the PRE period, 12,812 ED visits were made by children < 6.01 months old; 2.8% of these visits were made by patients with SIS. In the POST period there were 5,372 ED visits, 2.6% involved SIS (p = .4). The rate of skeletal surveys performed on patients with SIS increased from 17.1% in the PRE period to 27.2% in the POST period (p = .01). The positivity rate of skeletal surveys in the PRE versus POST period was 18.9% and 26.3% respectively (p = .45). Repeat injury rates did not differ significantly in patients with SIS pre- versus post-TRAIN (p = .44).ConclusionImplementation of TRAIN at this institution appears to be associated with increased skeletal survey rates.

TI  - Finding patterns of atoll morphometrics at a range of spatial scales
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Small Island Nations, often comprised of Atolls, are at considerable risk of climate change impacts from sea-level rise to coral acidification to increasing cyclone intensity; understanding how they will change in the coming century is vital for climate mitigation and resiliency. However, the morphology of atolls are not well quantified or summarized. In this work, we calculate modern atoll morphometrics on a global scale including 3,786 motu and 593 reef flats on 154 atolls. Temporal composites of Landsat imagery are created for 4 years (2015-2018), and are classified into motu, reef flat, open water/lagoon via unsupervised classification. Morphometrics, including widths, lengths, and area, are computed for each motu and reef flat of the atoll in Python, creating a database of atolls and their associated morphometrics. Consistency in automated processing of atoll morphometrics removes spatial and user bias, enabling a better understanding of geographic patterns of atoll area and other morphometrics. Distinct differences in the distribution of motu are seen on a regional scale in French Polynesia, while globally, wider reef flats and larger motu are found closest to the equator. Globally, there is a consistent reef flat width in front of large motu (>1 km length) of 184 +/- 93 m (n = 724). Our atoll morphometric database creates a baseline of current atoll characteristics that can be expanded upon in the future and used for evaluating temporal changes to atoll islands.

TI  - Using satellite data on remote transportation of air pollutants for PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction in northern Taiwan
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate PM2.5 prediction is part of the fight against air pollution that helps governments to manage environmental policy. Satellite Remote sensing aerosol optical depth (AOD) processed by The Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correlation (MAIAC) algorithm allows us to observe the transportation of remote pollutants between regions. The paper proposes a composite neural network model, the Remote Transported Pollutants (RTP) model, for such long-range pollutant transportation that predicts more accurate local PM2.5 concentrations given such satellite data. The proposed RTP model integrates several deep learning components and learns from the heterogeneous features of various domains. We also detected remote transportation pollution events (RTPEs) at two reference sites from the AOD data. Extensive experiments using real-world data show that the proposed RTP model outperforms the base model that does not account for RTPEs by 17%-30%, 23%-26% and 18%-22% and state-of-the-art models that account for RTPEs by 12%-22%, 12%-14%, and 10%-11% at +4h to +24h, +28h to +48 hours, and +52h to +72h hours respectively.

TI  - Development and validation of nomograms for predicting axillary non-SLN metastases in breast cancer patients: A retrospective analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to develop a nomogram for predicting positive non-sentinel lymph nodes (non-SLNs) in positive SLN breast cancer patients and validate the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram for non-SLN metastasis in Chinese patients. MethodsThe pathological features of 2,561 breast cancer patients were retrospectively reviewed, and the patients were divided into training and validation cohorts. Positive non-SLN predictors were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses and used to construct the nomogram. In patients with positive SLNs, the MSKCC nomogram was used to calculate the probability of non-SLN metastasis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to assess the accuracy of this model and the MSKCC nomogram. ResultsAccording to multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of positive and negative SLNs, tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and extracapsular extension were independent predictive factors for non-SLN metastasis and were selected to establish the nomogram for predicting positive non-SLNs. This nomogram performed favorably in predicting positive non-SLNs, with AUCs of 0.765 and 0.741 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The MSKCC nomogram predicted non-SLN metastasis with an AUC of 0.755. ConclusionA nomogram was developed and validated to assist clinicians in evaluating the likelihood of positive non-SLN.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Brown macroalgae habitats provide a range of ecosystem services, offering coastal protection, supporting and increasing biodiversity, and more recently have been recognized for their potential role as blue carbon habitats. Consequently, accurate areal estimates of these habitats are vitally important. Satellite imagery is often utilized for areal estimates of vegetated habitats due to their ability to capture vast areas but are disadvantaged by their lower resolution. In contrast, imagery collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provide high-resolution datasets but are unable to cover the necessary spatial scale required for calculating areal estimates at regional, national or international scales. This study successfully and accurately corrects the outputs from low-resolution Sentinel 2 imagery to the standard of high-resolution UAV imagery by using a novel brown algae index and a simple regression model to provide accurate spatial estimates. This model was applied to rocky shores across Wales, UK to predict a spatial extent of 6.2 km(2) for three fucoid macroalgae species; Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus vesiculosus and F. serratus. The regression model was validated in two ways. First, the data used to create the regression model was split to train and test (50:50) the model, with a root mean square error of similar to 8%-14%. Secondly, spatial estimates of fucoids in independent aerial imagery were assessed using aerial photography interpretation and compared to that of the regression model (7% difference). The carbon standing stock of fucoids calculated from the spatial estimate (6.2 km(2)) was found to be significantly lower than that of other marine carbon stores, indicating that fucoids do not significantly contribute as a blue carbon habitat based on biomass alone. This study produces a robust and accurate remote sensing technique to estimate spatial extent of macroalgae at large spatial scales, with possible worldwide applicability.

TI  - Satellite-derived bathymetry integrating spatial and spectral information of multispectral images
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a significant and cost-effective method of obtaining shallow seabed topography, satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) can acquire a wide range of shallow sea depth by integrating a small quantity of in-situ water depth data. This method is a beneficial addition to traditional bathymetric topography. The seafloor???s spatial heterogeneity leads to inaccuracies in bathymetric inversion, which reduces bathymetric accuracy. By utilizing multispectral data with multidimensional features, an SDB approach incorporating spectral and spatial information of multispectral images is proposed in this study. In order to effectively increase the accuracy of bathymetry inversion throughout the entire area, first the random forest with spatial coordinates is established to control bathymetry spatial variation on a large scale. Next, the Kriging algorithm is used to interpolate bathymetry residuals, and the interpolation results are used to adjust bathymetry spatial variation on a small scale. The data from three shallow water sites are experimentally processed to validate the method. Compared with other established bathymetric inversion tech-niques, the experimental results show that the method effectively reduces the error in bathymetry estimation caused by spatial heterogeneity of the seabed, producing high-precision inversion bathymetry with a root mean square error of 0.78 to 1.36 meters. ?? 2023 Optica Publishing Group

TI  - Spatial and temporal evolution and greenhouse gas emissions of China's agricultural plastic greenhouses
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of the use of agricultural plastic greenhouses in China in recent years has played an important role in the generation of economic benefits from agriculture. However, it has also led to severe negative environmental impacts. Thus, it is necessary to explore the spatial and temporal evolution of agricultural plastic greenhouses in China as well as their environmental impacts so as to obtain a deeper understanding of agricultural intensification and the sustainable development of the facility agriculture industry. To this end, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of agricultural plastic greenhouses and their greenhouse gas emissions within the 2000-2020 period based on the extraction of the spatial distribution of greenhouses in China in 2000, 2010, and 2020. Landsat imagery and statistical data combined with the random forest classification method as well as life cycle analysis, were used in this study. The results obtained showed that: (1) Within the 2000-2020 period, the area covered by ag-ricultural plastic greenhouses in China expanded from 1594.66 to 11,838.77 km2, with most of the greenhouses pre-dominantly distributed in the North China Plain. (2) The increase in total greenhouse gas emissions between 2000 and 2010 was mainly due to the expansion of agricultural plastic greenhouse and an increase in agricultural material in-puts, whereas the increase between 2010 and 2020 was mainly due to the expansion of agricultural plastic greenhouse. (3) Greenhouse gas emissions from nitrogenous fertilizers and greenhouse construction materials accounted for 45 % and 36 % of the total greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. These findings are of great significance as they enhance understanding regarding land intensification development and its accompanying environmental impacts in China.

TI  - The impact of FDI on haze pollution: "Pollution paradise" or "pollution halo?"--Spatial analysis of PM2.5 concentration raster data in 283 cities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper constructs a spatial econometric model based on the environmental Kuznets curve to examine the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on urban haze pollution in Chinese cities. The evidence from the raster data of PM2.5 concentration in MODIS and MISR shows that there is a significant spatial correlation between haze pollution and FDI in Chinese cities, which is expressed as a spatial spillover effect; FDI in Chinese mainland cities reduces haze pollution, which confirms the "pollution halo hypothesis"; using instrumental variable estimation, the above conclusions are still robust; The total effect of FDI on haze pollution is negative, and the total effect can be decomposed into scale effect, technology effect and structural effect; FDI increases urban haze pollution through scale effects and structural effect, but decreases urban haze pollution through technology effects; the environmental Kuznets curve exists in urban haze pollution in China, i.e., there is an inverted "U" relationship between economic development and haze pollution. This paper proposes that the establishment of inter-city linkage mechanism of haze control and the full play of the technical effect of FDI on haze pollution will help reduce urban haze pollution.

TI  - Contrasting determinants of land surface temperature in three megacities: Implications to cool tropical metropolitan regions
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Megacities in tropical regions are among the urban centers most vulnerable to increasingly intense heatwaves. However, the complex interactions between urban characteristics and thermal environments are yet to be fully understood. Here, we investigated the relationship between urban characteristics and land surface temperature (LST) for three megacities in the tropical savannah climate zone, Chennai, Dhaka, and Kolkata. LST values were retrieved from Landsat 8 data, and urban features were constructed using digital surface models, building footprints, and satellite imagery. Model-agnostic approaches were adopted to analyze the impacts of urban characteristics on LST. The boosted regression tree (BRT) model was used to capture the nonlinear effects of six most important factors on LST changes. The dominant influencing factors of LST were normalized difference built-up index, albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index. Building roofs, roads, and other hardscapes with high-albedo materials are preferred in alleviating surface urban heat island effect in Dhaka and Kolkata. The placement of urban parks with woody vegetation in an area larger than 0.6 ha produced effective cooling effect. In Chennai and Kolkata, urban policies to increase sky view factor are recommended. The application of BRT model with integrated urban data provides unique insights for thermal resilience planning.

T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Niger River (NR) is threatened with silting up due to the evolution of alluvial fans (AFs) in the Niamey region. The most significant is the Kourtere AF. This study aims to map the spatial extent of this AF and analyze its progression and impact on the NR using a machine learning algorithm such as support vector machine on Landsat and Sentinel-2 images from between 1985 and 2021. Sentinel-1 data were then used to generate a digital terrain model at 10 m resolution through the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture RADAR (InSAR) technique to understand the Kourtere watershed hydrology. Results show that the AF area increased from 55.19 ha in 1985 to 303.86 ha in 2003 and 237.18 ha in 2021. The AF has invaded a section of the NR since 2000 and began to invade its main bed in 2016. More than 73.71 ha of NR were converted into AF between 1985 and 2016. The flow direction of the NR has been disturbed by changes in AF, making it easier to overflow at flows much lower than previously. The Kourtere watershed is dominated by a dense network of gullies with a Sediment-Transport Index of 424.4, which facilitates significant sediment transport into the AF and NR and leads to its silting up.

T2  - STUDIES IN EUROPEAN CINEMA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Agnieszka Holland's animal rights horror-thriller Spoor (2017) can be read as a revenge tale wherein women, non-hegemonic men and animals join forces against the hunters and, implicitly, against what they represent: the conservative worldview of the current nationalist government in Poland. Spoor offers a feminist, queer and ecological response to these values and, in the process, expands our comprehension of how ecocinema might look or feel. While narratively human-centred, the film uses several strategies to foster an aesthetic attunement to non-human beings and non-anthropocentric politics. However, Spoor also transcends ecocinema by putting itself in quotation marks. In its self-reflexive use of extreme genericity, Spoor exemplifies Nicole Seymour's observation that politically engaged cinema can sometimes fail to follow the available scripts for 'appropriate' environmental feeling. This paper argues that, by merging tenderness and despair with more distanced modes, including irony, humour and metageneric playfulness, Spoor departs from serious approaches prevalent in environmental filmmaking, questioning the authenticity and proximity central to the very concept of ecology. Spoor's aesthetic and affective complexity rests on blending fakery and feeling, which problematises existing ways of understanding how eco-films engage us.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms have many direct and indirect effects on the environment, climate and air quality. In recent years, dust storms in the western and southwestern of Iran have increased significantly and had destructive effects on the residents of this area. The aim of this study is to develop a multi-spectral algorithm for detecting hydrated dust storms on MODIS images in western and southwestern of Iran. A multi-spectral algorithm was developed using a combination of visible and thermal bands of the MODIS sensor to detect hydrated dust. The studied dust storms events are based on the precipitation at synoptic stations in western and southwestern Iran during synoptic code 06 weather conditions. Based on the spectral and statistical analysis, the brightness temperature difference index of bands 31 and 32 (with a threshold greater than zero) was chosen for the algorithm along with the brightness temperature difference index of the bands 20 and 31 (with a threshold greater than 17) and the logarithm of reflectance bands 1 and 4 (with a threshold greater than - 1.8). A multispectral algorithm was also designed utilizing the above information. The results of the multi-spectral algorithm were validated with MODIS true color images and MODIS optical depth. Validation results revealed that the multi-spectral algorithm is suitable for monitoring hydrated dust in the study area. Results revealed that the multi-spectral algorithm is suitable for monitoring hydrated dust in the study area. Therefore, this method can be used to monitor and predict hydrated dust in this area to reduce potential risks.

TI  - phenoC++: An open-source tool for retrieving vegetation phenology from satellite remote sensing data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-retrieved vegetation phenology has great potential for application in characterizing seasonal and annual land surface dynamics. However, obtaining regional-scale vegetation phenology from satellite remote sensing data often requires extensive data processing and computation, which makes the accurate and rapid retrieval of regional-scale phenology a challenge. To retrieve vegetation phenology from satellite remote sensing data, we developed an open-source tool called phenoC++, which uses parallel technology in C++. phenoC++ includes six common algorithms: amplitude threshold (AT), first-order derivative (FOD), second-order derivative (SOD), third-order derivative (TOD), relative change rate (RCR), and curvature change rate (CCR). We implemented the proposed phenoC++ and evaluated its performance on a site scale with PhenoCam-observed phenology metrics. The result shows that SOS derived from MODIS images by phenoC++ with six methods (i.e., AT, FOD, SOD, RCR, TOD, and CCR) obtained r-values of 0.75, 0.76, 0.75, 0.76, 0.64, and 0.67, and RMSE values of 21.36, 20.41, 22.38, 19.11, 33.56, and 32.14, respectively. Satellite-retrieved EOS by phenoC++ with six methods obtained r-values of 0.58, 0.59, 0.57, 0.56, 0.36, and 0.40, and RMSE values of 52.43, 46.68, 55.13, 49.46, 71.13, and 69.34, respectively. Using PhenoCam-observed phenology as a baseline, SOS retrieved by phenoC++ was superior to MCD12Q2, while EOS retrieved by phenoC++ was slightly inferior to that of MCD12Q2. Moreover, compared with MCD12Q2 on a regional scale, phenoC++-retrieved vegetation phenology yields more effective pixels. The innovative features of phenoC++ are 1) integrating six algorithms for retrieving SOS and EOS; 2) quickly processing data on a large scale with simple input startup parameters; 3) outputting phenology metrics in GeoTIFF format image, which is more convenient to use with other geospatial data. phenoC++ could aid in investigating and addressing large-scale phenology problems of the ecological environment.

AB  - In dermatosurgery, a large number of operations involve nonsterile preoperative marking and sterile intraoperative marking to define the surgical area. This includes marking of veins and sentinel lymph nodes as well as marking of borders of malignant or benign tumors. Ideally, the markings should be resistant to disinfectant without leaving a permanent tattoo on the skin. For this purpose, a variety of commercial and noncommercial, pre- as well as intraoperative colormarking options are available, such as surgical colormarking pens, xanthene dyes, autologous patient blood, or permanent markers. The permanent pen is suitable for preoperative marking. It is inexpensive and can be reused. Nonsterile surgical marking pens can also be used for this purpose, but they are more expensive to purchase. Patient blood, sterile surgical marking pens, and eosin are suitable for intraoperative marking. Eosin is inexpensive and has many advantages, such as good skin compatibility. The marking options presented are good alternatives to the use of expensive coloredmarking pens.

TI  - The evolving volcano-ice interactions of Crater Glacier, Mount St. Helens, Washington (USA)
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interactions between volcanoes and glaciers provide insight to the evolution of a volcanic edifice and may be an indicator for renewed volcanic activity. At Mount St. Helens, Crater Glacier, which has formed in the volcanic crater after the eruption in 1980, is one of the world's last expanding glaciers and provides a unique opportunity to characterize the evolution of a glacier expanding onto an area of significant thermal flux. We combine photographic documentation and glaciovolcanic cave surveys with remote sensing data from Google Earth, UAS, and LiDAR to analyze the present state of Crater Glacier and reconstruct its development since the emplacement of the 2004-2008 lava dome. Our results show that snow accumulation has caused Crater Glacier to grow from 2009 to 2019 by approximately 13.8 x 10(6) m(3), during which time the glacier toe advanced by several hundred meters. The glacier-dome interface shift toward higher elevations against the 2004-2008 lava dome and subsequent encroachment onto thermally active areas led to glacier modification via extensive subglacial cave system formation. Analysis of subglacial tephra layers revealed the existence of juvenile material from the 2004-2008 eruption cycle, providing insights about glacier subsidence of similar to 40 m since 2004/2005 in spite of net growth. Although the lava dome is cooling, the glacier-dome interface seems to have become increasingly stable in the past few years. Our results suggest that glacier development in the accumulation area adjacent to the dome is now being affected by the thermal characteristics of the lava dome itself, making monitoring internal glacier development via tracking glaciovolcanic cave expansion a potentially important volcano monitoring tool.

TI  - Spatio-temporal change monitoring for surface water on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 1990 to 2020 using remote sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting and analyzing changes of water resources is critical for human survival and societal development in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QTP). We implemented the cosine similarity method to complete the migration of samples and achieve a more accurate random forest classifier (mean Kappa = 0.872) for each period. Based on these classifiers and 45,370 Landsat images, we estimated the surface water distribution of the QTP for six periods between 1990 and 2020 based on the Google Earth Engine platform. The results indicate that the QTP has a surface water area of 57,229 +/- 3,248 km(2) (1990-1995), 58,444 +/- 3,248 km(2) (1996-2000), 67,319 +/- 3,704 km(2) (2001-2005), 67,399 +/- 2,798 km(2) (2006-2010), 70,286 +/- 3,033 km(2) (2011-2015), 75,176 +/- 2,785 km(2) (2016-2020), that the area of water rose by ap-proximately 31.3% and continued to increase. The area of permanent water remained constant between 1990 and 2020 at 47,280 km(2). On the QTP, the change in water area can be split into four regions: rapid increase (Qiangtang Plateau), slow increase (eastern basins), decrease (northern and northeastern basins), and relatively stable (southern basins). About 186,408 km(2) area of land is significantly losing water bodies, while about 589,567 km(2) area of land is significantly gaining water bodies. This study provides higher accuracy temporal distribution data of water bodies in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and quantitatively evaluates the area changes of water bodies from multiple spatial scales. Research provides an important scientific reference for hydrological research and effective management of water resources in important rivers in the QTP.

TI  - Implementation of spatially-varying wind adjustment factor for wildfire simulations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The behaviour and rate of spread of a wildfire is strongly affected by local wind conditions depending on topography and surrounding vegetation. The wind speed within dense vegetation can be substantially lower than the open wind speed above the vegetation. This is commonly accounted for by applying a local correction factor to the local wind speed which can be called the wind adjustment factor (WAF). WAFs are often difficult to calculate and are usually based estimates for a particular vegetation type. Variation in the vegetation may result in spatially varying WAFs. We implement a model for spatially-varying WAFs based on leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation height data, which can be derived from remote sensing data sources. The model is implemented within Spark an operational wildfire prediction framework. Simulations of historical fires using the spatially-varying WAF model generally provided improved predictions compared to recorded fire extents than simulations without a spatially-varying WAF.

TI  - Comparison of snow disappearance date estimates and tree stem radial growth onset at the forest-tundra ecotone
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree wood growth is a key physiological process governing the seasonal duration of carbon sequestration, but few methods exist for remotely monitoring the phenology of wood growth. Hence, scalable methods for detecting and monitoring tree growth onset are needed, particularly in climate-sensitive regions like the forest-tundra ecotone (FTE). Because snow disappearance date (SDD) is observable across large spatial scales using satellite remote sensing and may coincide with tree growth onset at high latitudes, we tested the reliability of remotely sensed SDD as a proxy for tree growth onset at the FTE. We hypothesize that: (1) satellite based SDD estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (SDDMODIS) and PlanetScope imagery (SDDPlanet) are not statistically different (p > 0.05) from in situ estimates of SDD from soil temperature probes (SDDST), and; (2) estimates of SDDMODIS or SDDPlanet are not significantly different from tree growth onset, thus providing novel monitoring methods for tree wood growth onset at the FTE. We used data across two growing seasons from two field sites -one in Alaska, USA (AK) and one in Northwest Territories, Canada (NWT). Results differed between sites, with remote and in situ SDD estimates in AK occurring simultaneously, while remotely estimated SDD preceded in situ SDD in NWT. All SDD estimates were statistically different from tree growth onset in AK in both years. While comparisons showed possible synchrony between SDD estimates and tree growth onset at NWT, these results were limited and suggested the influence of other biophysical drivers in tree growth onset. These results highlight the phenological heterogeneity of the FTE and the key knowledge gaps remaining in our un-derstanding of processes driving tree growth onset at this ecotone. Thus, there is a clear need for more research into the relationships between tree growth onset and remote sensing information at the FTE.

TI  - A self-similar description of the wave fields generated by tropical cyclones
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, advanced operational wave models, e.g. WAM, SWAN or WAVEWATCH-III, provide very accurate solutions. Nevertheless, under extreme weather conditions, surface wave predictions can remain challenging. Indeed, for relatively small-scale tropical cyclones (TCs), rapidly evolving in time and space, and possibly not always well sampled with observing systems, extreme winds may not be properly described, and generated wave systems correctly predicted. In that context, Kudryavtsev et al. (2021b) recently proposed a simplified framework to rapidly assess evolving wave fields under typical TC conditions. Using self-similar functions, termed Tropical Cyclone-Wave Geophysical Model Function (TCW GMF), the proposed methodology and initial results demonstrate robustness and efficiency : 2D functions, assimilating a small number of parameters (maximum wind speed, cyclone radius and translation velocity), provide first-guess estimates of surface wave heights, wave lengths and directions within the intense TC core region. Following this strategy, an improved TCW GMF version is proposed to also cover the TC far zone, providing both wind wave information and outrunning swell conditions. This new version more particularly accounts for the wave field sensitivity to the shape of the wind profile. The procedure follows three main steps: (1) estimation of the characteristics of pure wind waves using self-similar matrices; (2) determination of the contour limiting the transition between wind waves to swell regime using empirically-derived universal functions; (3) derivation of analytical functions to describe the swell parameters using initial parameters estimated at this transition contour. Wind waves and swell systems are further superposed to describe the wave parameters for mixed-sea conditions. In this study, IBTrACS are used to initialize the TC's wind profiles, coordinates and translation velocities. The proposed methodology is then tested using a large altimeter database. More than 700 altimeter measurements crossing different TCs during 2020-2022 years are used, demonstrating overall convincing agreements between first-guess estimates and satellite data.

TI  - Remotely sensed functional diversity and its association with productivity in a subtropical forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Functional diversity is a critical component driving ecosystem functioning. Spatially explicit data of plant functional traits and diversity are essential for understanding biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Here we retrieved three morphological traits (95th quantile height, leaf area index, foliage height diversity) and three physiological traits (chlorophyll a + b content, specific leaf area, equivalent water thickness) from airborne laser scanning and multispectral Sentinel-2 data, respectively. We found airborne LiDAR-derived parameters corre-lated well with in-situ plot-level morphological data (R2 >= 0.67). For satellite-derived physiological traits, partial least squares regression (PLSR) obtained higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.26-0.43, cross-validation with in -situ community-weighted mean (CWM) leaf physiological trait data) than a vegetation index (VI) approach. The remotely-sensed traits were used as input to estimate multi-trait functional diversity (FD) indices in a species-rich subtropical mountainous forest. Finally, we investigated the influence of single-trait CWMs, multi-trait FD indices and environmental variables on remotely-derived aboveground ecosystem carbon stocks (aboveground biomass, AGB) and primary productivity (kernel normalized difference vegetation index, kNDVI). CWMs of all functional traits were significant predictors of AGB and kNDVI, as suggested by the mass-ratio hypothesis. Morphological FD indices were also important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, indicating effects of complementarity in crown architectures. In best-fit multivariate models, the first principal component CWM of morphological traits and that of physiological traits were the most important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, respectively. The FD index of morphological richness was additionally selected in the best-fit models for AGB and kNDVI at ecosystem and landscape scales. Our work highlights the potential of using remotely-sensed functional traits to assess the relationship between trait diversity and ecosystem functioning across large, contiguous areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal fusion for spectral remote sensing: A statistical analysis and review
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing images obtained by a variety of sensors have been widely used in different Earth observation tasks. However, owing to budget and sensor technology constraints, a single sensor cannot simultaneously provide observational images with both high spatial and temporal resolution. This brings difficulties to remote sensing research which requires high spatial and temporal resolution data. To solve the above constraints, the spatiotemporal fusion (STF) method was proposed and has received widespread attention. The main challenge for remote sensing STF is to reconstruct both phenological and land cover type changes. To overcome this challenge, many STF methods have been proposed based on different principles and strategies. Since there are STF methods have been proposed recently, there is a need for new review to reflect the current research status. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the existing studies, discusses their basic principle and limitations, collect some recent applications, and provide a comprehensive overview of current advances. Furthermore, to facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also collect publicly available resources and introduce the most used quantitative metrics. Finally, we take a conversation about some open problems and challenges that require attention in the future.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

TI  - The integration of indigenous knowledge in school: a systematic review
T2  - COMPARE-A JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Indigenous knowledge is generally recognised as an inferior social experience in spaces of knowledge production. The educational issue that results from this process imposes barriers to the integration of these epistemologies in the school environment. This study presents a systematic review about the integration of indigenous knowledge in primary schools in developing and/or emerging countries and the results of these interventions. Through a search carried out in the electronic database b-on, from the Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences of the University of Porto in Portugal, 14 studies were selected. This review identified factors that influence the representation of the indigenous culture in the school environment, allowing the construction of a framework in which indigenous knowledge is often neglected in the formal education system with obstacles to its introduction into the school environment. It also revealed that the understanding of the local context is essential in proposing interventions to open a possible intercultural dialogue.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY PSYCHIATRY AND NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIsolated seizure as a manifestation of myelin oligodendrocyte antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) has rarely been reported previously.Case presentationA 16-year-old-male presented with single episode of left focal onset motor seizure with secondary generalization and impaired awareness, without any other focal neurological deficits. There was a history of right focal onset motor seizure with secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure and impaired awareness 4 years ago. Neurological examination showed bilateral gaze evoked nystagmus. Brain imaging revealed bilateral superficial and deep white matter lesions including the corpus callosum. Anti-MOG antibody was positive. The patient received steroids and Rituximab therapy without any further recurrence of seizure or any neuro-deficits and gradual improvement in lesion burden in brain imaging.ConclusionsThis case of an adolescent boy with sole manifestation of episodes of focal seizures 4 years apart, finally diagnosed to be a case of MOGAD, not only boosts the evidence of establishing the possibility of MOG antibody-associated autoimmune epilepsy but also reinforces the importance of unexplained seizure as a clinical phenotype in MOGAD.

TI  - Desertification modeling in the Moroccan Middle Atlas using Sentinel-2A images and TCT indexes (case of the Ain Nokra Forest)
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper focuses on the quantitative modeling of desertification in Morocco's Middle Atlas regions, Ain Nokra Forest. In order to map the degree of desertification in the forest in 2021, this study used Sentinel-2A images. More precisely, the spectral indices, such as the NDVI, albedo, and TCT indices, have first been calculated. After putting different combinations through a linear regression analysis, the feature space was created using the correlation ratio that is the most negative of these indices (NDVI-albedo, TCG-TCB, and TCW-TCB). With a correlation ratio of - 0.80, the TCG-TCB combination is the best, followed by the NDVI-albedo ratio, which has a correlation ratio of - 0.63. A desertification map for the entire forest has been created as a result of the first combination being used to propose the Desertification Degree Index (DDI). There are currently five categories of desertification (extreme, severe, moderate, low, and non-desertification). according to our model, the forest is progressively desertifying. Typically, 40% of the forest area is classified as having severe to intense desertification, while 51% is classified as having weak to moderate desertification. However, only 8.52% of the region is deemed to be "non-desertified". Finally, due to its incredibly high overall accuracy of 88.32%, the model is almost optimal for quantitative analysis and monitoring of desertification in the Moroccan Middle Atlas.

AB  - In this paper, we consider an acoustic equation with incomplete data, where the bulk modulus coefficient and initial conditions are partially known. Our goal is to get information about the bulk modulus coefficient independently of the initial conditions from boundary observations. To achieve this goal, we apply the sentinel method introduced by J.L. Lions, which is a functional that links the solution to the given problem with a control function and a state observation. We prove that the existence of the sentinel functional is equivalent to a boundary-null controllability problem with constraints on the control. We use the Hilbert uniqueness method to study this controllability problem to establish the control of minimal norm.

TI  - Determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among students and parents in Sentinel Schools Network of Catalonia, Spain
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vaccine hesitancy is defined as a delay in acceptance of vaccines despite its availability, caused by many determinants. Our study presents the key reasons, determinants and characteristics associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among students over 16 years and parents of students under 16 years and describe the COVID-19 vaccination among students in the settings of sentinel schools of Catalonia, Spain. This is a cross-sectional study that includes 3,383 students and the parents between October 2021 and January 2022. We describe the student's vaccination status and proceed a univariate and multivariate analysis using a Deletion Substitution Addition (DSA) machine learning algorithm. Vaccination against COVID-19 reached 70.8% in students under 16 years and 95.8% in students over 16 years at the end of the study project. The acceptability among unvaccinated students was 40.9% and 20.8% in October and January, respectively, and among parents was proportionally higher among students aged 5-11 (70.2%) in October and aged 3-4 (47.8%) in January. The key reason to not vaccinate themselves, or their children, were concern about side effects, insufficient research about the effect of the vaccine in children, rapid development of vaccines, necessity for more information and previous infection by SARS-CoV-2. Several variables were associated with refusal end hesitancy. For students, the main ones were risk perception and use of alternative therapies. For parents, the age of students, sociodemographic variables, socioeconomic impact related to the pandemic, and use of alternative therapies were more evident. Monitoring vaccine acceptance and refusal among children and their parents has been important to understand the interaction between different multilevel determinants and we hope it will be useful to improve public health strategies for future interventions in this population.

AB  - Accidental ingestion of foreign bodies is common in clinical practice. It is usually seen to pass through the gastrointestinal tract easily. However, in the case of impaction in the esophagus, it can lead to catastrophic conditions. Aorto-esophageal fistula is one such disastrous complication with a high fatality rate. Despite treatment, mortality rates of up to 80% have been reported in the literature, with the condition being uniformly fatal in untreated patients. We describe a case of aorto-esophageal fistula secondary to a chicken bone impaction presenting with sentinel hemorrhage and managed expeditiously and successfully with simultaneous endoscopic removal and surgical repair of the fistula.

TI  - Assessing Autism Knowledge Across the Global Landscape Using the ASK-Q
T2  - JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Substantial variability exists with regard to autism service provision around the world. Service disparities observed in many low- and middle-income countries may be driven, in part, by limited autism knowledge; however, measurement limitations have made it difficult to quantify autism knowledge across countries. The current study uses the autism stigma and knowledge questionnaire (ASK-Q) to quantify autism knowledge and stigma between different countries and demographics. The current study compiled data from 6830 participants collected using adapted versions of the ASK-Q administered in 13 different countries, representing four different continents. Structural equation modeling was used to examine how autism knowledge varied across country and individual factors. Results reveal cross country variability with a large, 17-point difference between the countries with the highest knowledge (Canada) and the lowest knowledge (Lebanon). As expected, countries with higher economies had higher levels of knowledge. We also documented differences based on country worldview, participant occupation, gender, age, and education level. These results help to identify specific regions and populations that might most need greater information about autism.

TI  - A cascaded data fusion approach for extracting the rooftops of buildings in heterogeneous urban fabric using high spatial resolution satellite imagery and elevation data
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a cascaded data fusion approach was implemented to extract the rooftops of buildings from remote sensing data in a heterogeneous urban fabric in Irbid city, Jordan. The rooftops of buildings were extracted from Pleiades-B1 very high spatial resolution imagery (i.e., 2 m) along with LiDAR-derived nor-malized digital surface model (nDSM) data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The ima-gery from Pleiades-B1 satellite was classified using support vector machine (SVM), then a normalized digital surface model (nDSM) was calculated to generate the heights map. Then, the trees and vegetation cover were filtered using NDVI in which different threshold values were tested to achieve the best iden-tification of the rooftops of buildings. The results of the SVM, nDSM, and NDVI maps were combined to obtain one layer representing the rooftops of buildings in the study area. Finally, the results were eval-uated against reference data obtained from the municipality of Irbid and ground surveying. The correct-ness and completeness measures of the detected buildings' footprints were 0.956, 0.854 and 0.902 for the precision, recall, and F-score respectively. The total area of the extracted rooftops of buildings was approximately 6.2 km2 when compared to the area of the registered buildings in the municipality of Irbid (i.e., 5.9 km2) in 2021. The results proved the possibility of using the implemented method in map-ping the rooftops of buildings in such a heterogeneous urban fabric in the study area.

TI  - The status of the Jewish temple in modern Hebrew literature (1848-1948): a big-data analysis
T2  - DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Since its final destruction in antiquity, the memory of the temple in Jerusalem has served as the nexus of Jewish liturgy and messianic worldview. This article has sought to examine the ideological and cultural roles played by the image of the Jewish temple in the Hebrew literature of 1848-1948. Toward this end, I formulated a broad corpus comprised of homogeneous genres and authors, namely those which situate the temple as their main focus. The evidence arising from this corpus suggests that the conceptual role of the temple underwent no dramatic transformations; the temple in this literature, taken as a whole, is mostly indistinguishable from the historical, religious, and nationalistic symbol that featured in the Jewish tradition over nearly 2,000 years. The bulk of the present corpus places the temple in conceptual and historical contexts that are familiar and very similar to those of the historical temple in all its contexts, without removing it from the domains of Jewish nationalism or classical religiosity. These findings contravene my initial presupposition that the discourse of the temple had undergone a metamorphosis in the 19th and 20th centuries, the image of the temple had changed into an abstract symbol for world peace, moral perfection, and intellectual and scientific excellence.

TI  - Large sinuous rivers are slowing down in a warming Arctic
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming affects permafrost regions, with strong impacts on the environment such as the greening of river plains. Here the authors use satellite data to show that these changes have stabilized large Arctic sinuous rivers by slowing their lateral migration by about 20% over the past half-century.Arctic regions are disproportionately affected by atmospheric warming, with cascading effects on multiple surface processes. Atmospheric warming is destabilizing permafrost, which could weaken riverbanks and in turn increase the lateral mobility of their channels. Here, using timelapse analysis of satellite imagery, we show that the lateral migration of large Arctic sinuous rivers has decreased by about 20% over the last half-century, at a mean rate of 3.7 parts per thousand per year. Through a comparison with rivers in non-permafrost regions, we hypothesize that the observed migration slowdown is rooted in a series of indirect effects driven by atmospheric warming, such as bank shrubification and decline in overland flow and seepage discharge along channel banks, linked in turn to permafrost thaw. As lower migration rates directly impact the residence timescales of sediment and organic matter in floodplains, these surprising results may lead to important ramifications for watershed-scale carbon budgets and climate feedbacks.

TI  - Optimal estimation of Gaofen-3B satellite attitude deviation based on echo frequency domain features
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposed and verified an optimal estimation method of satellite attitude deviation in orbit based on the frequency domain features of microwave remote sensing data from the Gaofen-3B (GF-3B) satellite. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging results of the Amazon forest's strip pattern were obtained at different imaging incident angles of the GF-3B satellite. Then, the inversions of the Doppler center deviation of the SAR signal obtained the corresponding beam pointing errors at different imaging incident angles. Next, a three-degree-of-freedom nonlinear least square fitting model was established between the Doppler center deviation of the SAR signal and satellite attitude deviation. Combined with the measured SAR signals, satellite attitude deviations in different dimensions (pitch, yaw, and roll) were separated and estimated. On this basis, the GF-3B satellite proceeded with an on-orbit attitude correction test. The maximum Doppler center deviation at all im-aging incident angles decreased from 400Hz to 46Hz, and the residual beam pointing errors were less than 0.01 degrees. The proposed optimal estimation method can guarantee the on-orbit attitude deviation suppression and image quality improvement of the SAR satellites.

TI  - Robotic-assisted surgery for endometrial cancer is safe in morbidly and extremely morbidly obese patients
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Obesity has risen to affect >25% of the Canadian population. Perioperative challenges with in-creased morbidity are encountered. We evaluated the outcome of robotic-assisted surgery for endometrial can-cer (EC) in obese patients.Methods. We retrospectively reviewed all robotic surgeries performed for EC in women with BMI >= 40 kg/m2, from 2012 to 2020 in our center. Patients were divided into 2 groups (class III: 40-49 kg/m2, class IV: >= 50 kg/m2). Complications and outcome were compared.Results. 185 patients were included: 139 class III and 46 class IV. The main histology was endometrioid ade-nocarcinoma (70,5% of class III and 58,1% of class IV (p = 0,138)). The mean blood loss, overall sentinel node de-tection and median length of stay were similar in both groups. Six class III (4,3%) and 3 class IV (6,5%) patients required conversion to laparotomy due to poor surgical field exposure (p = 0,692). The rate of intraoperative complications was similar between the 2 groups (1.4% in class III vs none in class IV, p = 1). There were 10 class III (7,2%) and 10 class IV (21,7%) post-operative complications (p = 0.011), but most were grade 2 (3,6% in class III vs 13% in class IV, p = 0.029)). Grade 3 and 4 postoperative complications were low (2.7%) and not statistically different between the 2 groups. Readmission rate was low in both groups (4 in each group, p = 1.07). Recurrence occurred in 5,8% of class III and 4,3% of class IV patients (p = 1).Conclusion. Robotic-assisted surgery for EC in class III and class IV obese patients is a safe and feasible proce-dure, with low complication rate, similar oncologic outcome, conversion rate, blood loss, readmission rate and length of hospital stay.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Study on naked eye tracing of inguinal sentinel lymph nodes in penile cancer patients with carbon nanoparticle suspension injection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveExploratory study of the effect and clinical value of carbon nanoparticle suspension injection (CNSI) as a tracer for inguinal sentinel lymph nodes in penile cancer. MethodWe selected 29 patients with penile cancer in our department from January 2019 to October 2022. According to whether the CNSI tracer was injected during the pathological biopsy of the inguinal lymph nodes, the enrolled patients were assigned to the control group, the group in which CNSI was injected 12 h before the surgery (12HBS group) and the group in which CNSI was injected 0.5 h before the surgery (0.5HBS group). Evaluating the effectiveness of CNSI as a lymphatic tracer involves analyzing the following: its safety, the statistical analysis of the detection rate (DR) of different groups, the number of lymph nodes sent for each case (NOLNSFEC), the difference of positive rate of lymphatic metastasis (PROLM), and operation time (OT). ResultsThe lymph nodes in the 12HBS group and 0.5HBS group had an obvious black staining appearance, and no adverse reactions or surgical complications were found. Most of the black-stained areas caused by CNSI injection were removed with penile excision, which did not affect the postoperative appearance. This did not affect the pathological analysis. The DR of lymph nodes in the 12HBS group was higher (p < 0.05) than that in the control group. More lymph nodes were removed for examination (p < 0.05), which improved the efficiency of surgery. Compared with the 12HBS group, the number of lymph nodes removed in the 0.5HBS group decreased (p < 0.05). The OT was shortened (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the DR and PROLM. ConclusionCNSI was applied to the naked-eye tracing of inguinal sentinel lymph nodes in penile cancer, which is safe and efficient. Injection of CNSI 0.5 h before surgery can help identify the "foremost position" of sentinel lymph nodes and reduce surgical trauma.

TI  - Machine learning-based grassland aboveground biomass estimation and its response to climate variation in Southwest China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for accurate estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) at high spatial resolution is increasing in grassland-related research and management, especially for those regions with complex topography and fragmented landscapes, where grass and shrub are interspersed. In this study, based on 519 field AGB observations, integrating Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; Sentinel-1) and high-resolution (Sentinel-2) remote sensing images, environmental and topographical data, we estimated the AGB of mountain grassland in Southwest China (Yunnan Province and Guizhou Province) by using remote sensing algorithms ranging from traditional regression to cutting edge machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Four models (i.e., multiple stepwise regression (MSR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN)) were developed and compared for AGB simulation purposes. The results indicated that the RF model performed the best among the four models (testing dataset: decision co-efficient (R-2) was 0.80 for shrubland and 0.75 for grassland, respectively). Among all input variables in the RF model, the vegetation indices played the most important role in grassland AGB estimation, with 6 vegetation indices (EVI, EVI2, NDVI, NIRv, MSR and DVI) in the top 10 of input variables. For shrubland, however, topographical factors (elevation, 12.7% IncMSE (increase in mean squared error)) and SAR data (VH band, 11.3% IncMSE) were the variables which contributed the most in the AGB estimation model. By comparing the input variables to the RF model, we found that integrating SAR data has the potential to improve grassland AGB estimation, especially for shrubland (26.7% improvement in the estimation of shrubland AGB). Regional grassland AGB estimation showed a lower mean AGB in Yunnan Province (443.6 g/m(2)) than that in Guizhou Province (687.6 g/m(2)) in 2021. Moreover, the correlation between five consecutive years (2018-2022) of AGB data and climatic factors calculated by partial correlation analysis showed that regional AGB was positively related with mean annual precipitation in more than 70% of the grassland and 60% of the shrubland area, respectively. Also, we found a positive relationship with mean annual temperature in 62.8% of the grassland and 55.6% of the shrubland area, respectively. This study demonstrated that integrating SAR into grassland AGB estimation led to a remote sensing estimation model that greatly improved the accuracy of modeled mountain grassland AGB in southwest China, where the grassland consists of a complex mix of grass and shrubs.

TI  - Exploring the effects of land use and land cover changes on meteorology and air quality over Sichuan Basin, southwestern China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate characterization of land use and land cover changes (LULCC) is essential for numerical models to capture LULCC-induced effects on regional meteorology and air quality, while outdated LULC dataset largely limits model capability in reproducing land surface parameters, particularly for complex terrain. In this study, we incorporate land cover data from MODIS in 2019 into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate the impacts of LULC on meteorological parameters over the Sichuan Basin (SCB). Further, we conduct Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulations with WRF default LULC and MODIS 2019 to probe the effects on regional air quality. Despite consistency found between meteorological observations and WRF-CMAQ simulations, the default WRF land cover data does not accurately capture rapid urbanization over time compared with MODIS. Modeling results indicate that magnitude changes trigged by LULCC are highly varied across SCB and the impacts of LULCC are more pronounced over extended metropolitan areas due to alteration by urbanization, featured by elevating 2-m temperature up to 2 degrees C and increased planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) up to 400 m. For air quality implications, it is found that LULCC leads to basin-wide O-3 enhancements with maximum reaching 21.6 mu g/m(3) and 57.2 mu g/m(3) in the daytime and nighttime, respectively, which is mainly attributed to weakening NOx titration effects at night. This work contributes modeling insights into quantitative assessment for impacts of LULCC on regional meteorology and air quality which pinpoints optimization of the meteorology-air quality model.

TI  - Association of Complex Lymphatic Drainage in Head and Neck Cutaneous Melanoma With Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Outcomes A Cohort Study and Literature Review
T2  - JAMA OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Importance Although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a vital staging tool, its application in head and neck melanoma (HNM) is complicated by a higher false-negative rate (FNR) compared with other regions. This may be due to the complex lymphatic drainage in the head and neck.Objective To compare the accuracy, prognostic value, and long-term outcomes of SLNB in HNM with melanoma from the trunk and limb, focusing on the lymphatic drainage pattern.Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort observational study at a single UK University cancer center included all patients with primary cutaneous melanoma undergoing SLNB between 2010 to 2020. Data analysis was conducted during December 2022.Exposures Primary cutaneous melanoma undergoing SLNB between 2010 to 2020.Main Outcomes and Measures This cohort study compared the FNR (defined as the ratio between false-negative results and the sum of false-negative and true-positive results) and false omission rate (defined as the ratio between false-negative results and the sum of false-negative and true-negative results) for SLNB stratified by 3 body regions (HNM, limb, and trunk). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and melanoma-specific survival (MSS). Comparative analysis of detected lymph nodes on lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) and SLNB was performed by quantifying lymphatic drainage patterns by number of nodes and lymph node basins. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified independent risk factors.Results Overall, 1080 patients were included (552 [51.1%] men, 528 [48.9%] women; median age at diagnosis 59.8 years), with a median (IQR) follow-up 4.8 (IQR, 2.7-7.2) years. Head and neck melanoma had a higher median age at diagnosis (66.2 years) and higher Breslow thickness (2.2 mm). The FNR was highest in HNM (34.5% vs 14.8% trunk or 10.4% limb, respectively). Similarly, the false omission rate was 7.8% in HNM compared with 5.7% trunk or 3.0% limbs. The MSS was no different (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.43-1.53), but RFS was lower in HNM (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36-0.85). On LSG, patients with HNM had the highest proportion of multiple hotspots (28.6% with >= 3 hotspots vs 23.2% trunk and 7.2% limbs). The RFS was lower for patients with HNM with 3 or more affected lymph nodes found on LSG than those with fewer than 3 affected lymph nodes (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.77). Cox regression analysis showed head and neck location to be an independent risk factor for RFS (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.01-2.50), but not for MSS (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.35-1.71).Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found higher rates of complex lymphatic drainage, FNR, and regional recurrence in HNM compared with other body sites on long-term follow-up. We advocate considering surveillance imaging for HNM for high-risk melanomas irrespective of sentinel lymph node status.

TI  - Differences in Existential Perspectives as a Function of Having a Mystical-Type Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Prior research suggests that unique phenomenological experiences called "mystical-type experiences" (MTEs) have the potential to induce significant and persisting worldview changes. In this article, two studies add to this literature by using cross-sectional data from 837 and 1,086 participants, respectively, to investigate whether people who have had one of these experiences differ in predictable ways from those who have not on relevant existential variables. Specifically, we tested two novel hypotheses rooted in terror management theory, along with two predictions based on past research. In specific, the yes-MTE group was hypothesized to have (a) less fear of death and greater belief in death as a passage, (b) a more intrinsic and growth-oriented worldview, (c) fewer mental health symptoms, and (d) higher trait absorption. The data largely supported hypotheses 1, 2, and 4 while the results for hypothesis 3 were opposite of expectations, suggesting that clinical research with psychedelic-induced MTEs may not be generalizable to MTEs experienced outside the supportive therapeutic context.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study is done on the basis of the surface and subsurface faults and active tectonic processes which disrupt the pattern of the drainage system present in the basin. The pattern of the drainages and their morphological features shown in the morphometric drainage basin areas which are used as a sign of neotectonics activity. This study is focused on the Upper Teesta River basin of the Sikkim Himalayan. For the study of the morphometric and morphotectonic analysis of the Upper Teesta River basin, ALOS PALSAR DEM was used to generate the drainage order of the basin with the help of the Arc GIS Software. The estimated drainage order of the basin is 6th. In this study, morphotectonic parameters such as asymmetry factor, elongation ratio, transverse topography asymme-try, mountain-front sinuosity, ratio of valley floor width to valley height, and hypsometric Integral was estimated 45.66, 0.55, 0.25, 1.08, 0.94, 0.44 respectively. These all-parameters value show the Upper Teesta River Basin is tectonically active. The stream gradient index of the basin was calculated >500 indicate the study region tectonically active. This research is validated using 50 years (1971-2020) earthquake data. Therefore, geospatial tool is an important tool to know the area is neo tectonically active.

TI  - Understanding the flare emission in CF Tucanae using TESS
T2  - PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromospherically active binaries are important in the understanding of the origins of optical flares. Since studies of flares in binaries are important, we perform a detailed analysis of 11 flares emitted by the RS CVn binary source CF Tucanae using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We assume a 10000 K blackbody spectrum to determine the flare energies, which were noted to be similar to 0.29-2.86 x 10(35) erg. We also fitted optical flares with a fast rise with an exponential decay burst profile and decay times were used to estimate the flare scale lengths. Three flares among them mandate a double burst model and another two exhibit complex flare features. Spot areas were found to be similar to 10(22) cm(2) and associated magnetic energies were found to be similar to 10(36-37) erg. This excess of magnetic energy indicates that the flares release only a small fraction of the magnetic energy of the dominant spot but may indicate a lack of connection between the flares and the dominant spot. We also study the periodic variations using the times of minima obtained from TESS data along with previous values. The optical periodic variation requires a parabola and a sinusoidal function to get the best fit. A new periodic modulation of P-mod similar to 28.64 +/- 1.82 yr was observed and we attempt to explain this using a magnetic activity cycle. We conclude that CF Tuc exhibits complex flares and its periodic modulation varies, probably due to the exchange of spin and orbital angular momentum in the binary.

TI  - Impact of oral statin therapy on clinical outcomes in patients with cT1 breast cancer
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeA previous meta-analysis examining the relationship between statin use and breast cancer reported that the inhibitory effect of statins on breast cancer may be more pronounced in early-stage cases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of hyperlipidemia treatment at the time of breast cancer diagnosis and to examine its correlation with metastasis to axillary lymph nodes among patients with so-called cT1 breast cancer whose primary lesion was 2 cm or less and was pathologically evaluated by sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection. We also investigated the effects of hyperlipidemic drugs on the prognosis of patients with early-stage breast cancer.MethodsAfter excluding cases that did not meet the criteria, we analyzed data from 719 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer, with a primary lesion of 2 cm or less identified by preoperative imaging, and who underwent surgery without preoperative chemotherapy.ResultsRegarding hyperlipidemia drugs, no correlation was found between statin use and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.226), although a correlation was found between lipophilic statin use and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.042). Also, the disease-free survival periods were prolonged following treatment of hyperlipidemia (p = 0.047, hazard ratio: 0.399) and statin administration (p = 0.028, hazard ratio: 0.328).ConclusionIn cT1 breast cancer, the results suggest that oral statin therapy may contribute to favorable outcomes.

TI  - De-ESCAlating RadioTherapy in breast cancer patients with pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy: DESCARTES study
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeNeoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) is increasingly used in breast cancer patients and depending on subtype, 10-89% of patients will attain pathologic complete response (pCR). In patients with pCR, risk of local recurrence (LR) after breast conserving therapy is low. Although adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery (BCS) reduces LR further in these patients, it may not contribute to overall survival. However, radiotherapy may cause early and late toxicity. The aim of this study is to show that omission of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with a pCR after NST will result in acceptable low LR rates and good quality of life.MethodsThe DESCARTES study is a prospective, multicenter, single arm study. Radiotherapy will be omitted in cT1-2N0 patients (all subtypes) who achieve a pCR of the breast and lymph nodes after NST followed by BCS plus sentinel node procedure. A pCR is defined as ypT0N0 (i.e. no residual tumor cells detected). Primary endpoint is the 5-year LR rate, which is expected to be 4% and deemed acceptable if less than 6%. In total, 595 patients are needed to achieve a power of 80% (one-side alpha of 0.05). Secondary outcomes include quality of life, Cancer Worry Scale, disease specific and overall survival. Projected accrual is five years.ConclusionThis study bridges the knowledge gap regarding LR rates when adjuvant radiotherapy is omitted in cT1-2N0 patients achieving pCR after NST. If the results are positive, radiotherapy may be safely omitted in selected breast cancer patients with a pCR after NST.Trial registration: This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on June 13th 2022 (NCT05416164).

TI  - Influences of environment, human activity, and climate on the invasion of Ageratina adenophora (Spreng.) in Southwest China
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - With economic and social globalization, invasive alien species have significantly threatened local ecological security. Identifying the invasive mechanisms of invasive alien species can aid in preventing species invasions and protecting local ecological and economic security. As a globally invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora (Asteraceae) has spread to many parts of the world and had a seriously impacted the ecology and economy of its invaded areas. Using observational data and Landsat OLI images in an arid valley region in southwest China, this study examined how climate, human activity and environmental factors influence the invasion of A. adenophora and its underlying mechanism. Our results showed that the invasion abundance of A. adenophora was significantly affected by environmental factors (the relative importance was 87.2%), but was less influenced by human activity and climate factors (the relative importance was 2% and 10.8%, respectively). The A. adenophora abundance significantly decreased with aspect, community canopy density, shrub layer coverage, herb layer coverage, Simpson diversity index of shrub and herb layers, the shortest distance to residential areas and temperature seasonality, whereas it increased with soil moisture, temperature annual range, precipitation of wettest month and precipitation of driest month. We conclude that biotic competition is the most influential factor in the invasion of this plant in the arid valley regions. Our results are of great significance for invasion prevention and forest conservation and management in southwest China. Our work emphasized that optimizing the community structure, such as by increasing canopy and shrub coverage and species biodiversity, may help control and mitigate the A. adenophora invasion in southwest China.

TI  - Detection of changes in the hydrobiological parameters of the Oder River during the ecological disaster in July 2022 based on multi-parameter probe tests and remote sensing methods
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Starting from the second half of July, hydrological conditions (low water levels and low flows) and atmospheric conditions (high temperatures, lack of precipitation) contributed to algae bloom in the Oder River basin. The mass extinction of fish in the middle and lower section of the Oder was probably the result of such environmental conditions. Because algae bloom is correlated with an increase in the content of chlorophyll in the river and on its surface, the authors focused on an analysis of changes in the chlorophyll amount in the longitudinal profile of the river. The key data was obtained by soundings carried out at an interval of about one kilometre during the research expedition, which took place on July 16-24, 2022. These data coincided with the values of the NDVI index (normalised difference vegetation index) based on 10-metre satellite images from the Sentinel 2 mission. Imagery from cloudless periods (mainly March, June, July and August) processed using the NDVI index was compared. Regularly elevated chlorophyll levels in the upstream section (occurring in each period) and temporarily elevated chlorophyll values as moving downstream were observed. This article confirms the initial conclusions of Kolada et al. (2022) that the mass fish kill in the Oder River in the summer of 2022 was condi-tioned by natural environmental pressure causing massive algae bloom and the release of their toxins. The article also proves that the use of satellite images for this type of analysis is the correct approach, but due to low resolution, they cannot be used as reference material. Changes in the hydrobiological parameters of the river, which are a direct indicator of the causes of the ecological disaster, are the data of the multi-parameter probe obtained two weeks before the first mass catches of dead fish.

TI  - A deep residual convolutional neural network for mineral classification
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the deep learning computing paradigm has revolutionized the way of remote sensing data analysis. The emerging hyperspectral remote sensing has paved the way for the efficient and accurate exploration of the minute features of the earth's surface due to the increased number of contiguous spectral bands. Hence, hyperspectral images can efficiently impart useful information about mineral resources for precise discrimination and identification in lithological studies. Rapid advancements in computing capabilities and deep learning techniques give the research community a new impulse to develop advanced, robust, and efficient hyperspectral remote sensing-based mineral classification frameworks. The present study aims to introduce two novel deep learning-based mineral classifica-tion frameworks: mineral-CNN-LSTM and mineral-ResNet. The architecture of mineral-CNN-LSTM is based on 1D-CNN and LSTM model, whereas the architecture of mineral-ResNet is based on 1D-CNN, LSTM model, and residual connections. The frameworks use raw data as input without feature selection or data augmentation preprocessing steps. The widely used early stop method is also utilized to prevent overfitting of the framework during the training process. The experimental evaluation carried out over the AVIRIS hyper -spectral image scene of the Cuprite mining area confirms that the mineral-ResNet can effectively identify most of the minerals such as Alunite, Calcite, Halloysite, Kaolinite, Montmorillonite, Muscovite, Chalcedony with the overall accuracy of 92.16%, and kappa value of 0.89 and mineral-CNN-LSTM achieved the overall accuracy of 91.71% and kappa value of 0.88 for these minerals. Further-more, a comparative evaluation of the proposed frameworks has been performed with widely used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architectures such as VGG19, VGG16, ResNet-50, and AlexNet; and various machine learning based classifiers. The pro-posed architectures offer better performance with shorter testing and training time than these existing CNN-based architectures. The proposed framework could be useful for other earth observation-related applications in various fields such as agriculture, forestry, geol-ogy, hydrology, ecology, urban planning, military and defense applications, etc.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Evaluation of land use/land cover datasets in hydrological modelling using the SWAT model
T2  - H2OPEN JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) is a key influencer for runof f generation and the estimation of evapotranspiration in the hydrology of watersheds. Therefore, it is essential to use accurate and reliable LULC data in hydrological modelling. Ground-based data deficiencies are a big challenge in most parts of developing countries and remote areas around the globe. The main objective of this research was to evaluate the accuracy of LULC data from two different sources in hydrological modelling using the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The first LULC data was prepared by the classification of Landsat 8 satellite imagery , and the second LULC data was extracted from the ESRI 2020 global LULC dataset. The study was conducted on the Kokcha Watershed, a mountainous basin partly covered by permanent snow and glaciers. The accuracy assessment was done based on a comparison between observed river discharge and simulated river flow, utilizing each LULC dataset separately. After calibration and validation of the models, the acquired result was approximately similar and slightly (5.5%) different. However, due to the higher resolution and easily accessible ESRI 2020 dataset, it is recommended to use ESRI 2020 in hydrological modelling using the SWAT model.

TI  - Meteorological and anthropogenic contributions to changes in the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over China during the last decade
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To reduce air pollution over China, a series of measures to decrease concentrations of aerosols and trace gases has been implemented during the last two decades. The effects of these measures on aerosol concentrations, rep-resented here by satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), were evaluated by comparison of observed AOD time series from 2010 to 2021, over five representative areas, with model simulations using emissions fixed to those in 2010, but with actual meteorological data. Thus, model AOD was only influenced by meteorological conditions and the comparison with satellite AOD allows for the separation of meteorological and anthropogenic contributions to the AOD. The model data shows the influence of meteorological factors on the variation of the AOD, between +10% (unfavorable, leading to AOD increase) and-10% (favorable, leading to AOD decrease). Unfavorable meteorological conditions counteract effects of emission control measures. The satellite data show the occurrence of an AOD maximum in 2014 over three areas due to meteorological effects. The decrease of the AOD, varying between 22% and 40%, is mostly due to anthropogenic effects, but meteorological contributions are substantial and vary between the five focus regions. The satellite and model data also show that during 2017-2021 the AOD reduction flattened and AOD fluctuated within 10% of the average value for these years, with a substantial meteorological contribution. This analysis suggests that the Three-year Action Plan for Clean Air was less effective than the Clean Air Action Plan.

TI  - Performance evaluation of high-resolution IMDAA and IMERG for detecting cloudburst events over the Northwest Himalayas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this research is to assess the Indian Monsoon Data Assimila-tion and Analysis (IMDAA), a recently established high-resolution (0.12 degrees x 0.12 degrees) reanalysis dataset, for observing cloudburst events over the Northwest Himalaya (NWH). In addition, a high-resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) satel-lite estimate, the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) version 6 (IMERG-V06B) (Final run), is validated against the IMDAA. The following is a summary of our significant findings. (1) Reana-lysis data from the IMDAA detects 11 out of 16 cloudburst incidences. In addi-tion, 10 events captured in the IMERG-V06B data are a subset of those captured by IMDAA. According to contingency measures, the probability of detection (POD) of IMERG-V06B at 99.99th percentile is 33.33%-63.39% along the geographical extent of NWH. When utilizing the improved probability of detection (IPOD) to account for time, the possibility of IMERG-V06B detecting cloudburst occurrences ranges from 41.24% to 68.25%. (2) According to the finding, the IMDAA accurately detects cloudburst events in Jammu and Kashmir (J & K), where data from the India Metrological Department (IMD) at a resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees have underperformed. As a result, we can deduce that IMDAA can be used to observe extreme events in the Himalayas. IMERG-V06B is also relevant satellite data for monitoring cloudburst events and validating climate models.

TI  - Evaluating the combined impacts of hydrological change, coastal dynamics and human activity on mangrove cover and health in the Tana River delta, Kenya
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term dynamics of tropical mangrove ecosystems, and especially how they have responded to the combined pressures of local human activity, changing river hydrology and climate-change related coastal processes are insufficiently documented. In this study we combined a chronological sequence of remote sensing data spanning the last three decades (1992-2021) with time series of river-flow and precipitation data to discriminate between the respective impacts of hydroclimatic drivers and land-use changes on mangroves of the Tana River delta in Kenya. Our land-cover analysis showed an overall increase in mangrove forest cover of 5.5% over the past 30 years, however this included a 14% increase between 1992 and 2013 followed by a 8% decrease between 2013 and 2021. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data still indicate an overall positive trend (R2 = 0.58, p< 0.01) in the overall health of Tana River delta mangroves between 1992 and 2021. We also observe positive correlations between mangrove NDVI and precipitation (R=0.41, p = 0.042) and Tana River water level (R=0.82, p< 0.0001), as well as between mangrove NDVI and modelled measures of Tana River discharge (R= 0.79, p< 0.0001) and flooded area (R=0.73, p< 0.001). Overall our results show that recent historical variation in the areal cover and health of Tana River mangroves is mainly associated with changing hydrology in the Tana River delta, but that intensifying local land use and accelerating coastal erosion has also impacted their health. We suggest that management of the Tana River delta mangroves should focus on improving Tana River flows and sediment recharge.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Unusually high SO<sub>2</sub> emissions and plume height from Piton de la Fournaise volcano during the April 2020 eruption
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Piton de la Fournaise volcano, La Reunion, France, erupted between the 2 and 6 April 2020, one of a series of eruptive phases which occur typically two or three times per year. Here, we use back trajectory analysis of satellite data from the TROPOMI instrument to determine that gas emissions during the June 2020 eruption were of unusually high intensity and altitude, producing 34.9 +/- 17.4 kt of SO2 and plume heights up to 5 km a.s.l. The early stages of the eruption (2-4 April 2020) were characterised by relatively low SO2 emission rates despite strong low frequency tremor (LFT); the latter phase followed an increase in intensity and explosivity in the early hours of 5 April 2020. This period included lava fountaining, significantly increased SO2 emission rates, increased high frequency tremor (HFT) and decreased LFT. Using the PlumeTraj back trajectory analysis toolkit, we found the peak SO2 emission rate was 284 +/- 130 kg/s on the 6 April. The plume altitude peaked at similar to 5 km a.s.l. on 5 April, in the hours following a sudden increase in explosivity, producing one of the tallest eruption columns recorded at Piton de la Fournaise. PlumeTraj allowed us to discriminate each day's SO2, which otherwise would have led to a mass overestimate due to the plumes remaining visible for more than 24 h. The eruption exhibited a remarkable decoupling and anti-correlation between the intensity of the LFT signal and that of the magma and gas emission rates. LFT intensity peaked during the first phase with low magma and SO2 emissions, but quickly decreased during the second phase, replaced by unusually strong HFT. We conclude that the observation of strong HFT is associated with higher intensity of eruption, degassing, and greater height of neutral buoyancy of the plume, which may provide an alert to the presence of greater hazards produced by higher intensity eruptive activity. This might be particularly useful when direct visual observation is prevented by meteorological conditions. This eruption shows the importance of combining multiple data sets when monitoring volcanoes. Combining gas and seismic data sets allowed for a much more accurate assessment of the eruption than either could have done alone.

TI  - MLH1-methylated endometrial cancer under 60 years of age as the ?sentinel? cancer in female carriers of high-risk constitutional<i> MLH1</i> epimutation
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Universal screening of endometrial carcinoma (EC) for mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) and Lynch syndrome uses presence of MLH1 methylation to omit common sporadic cases from follow-up germline testing. However, this overlooks rare cases with high-risk constitutional MLH1 methylation (epimutation), a poorly-recognized mechanism that predisposes to Lynch-type cancers with MLH1 methylation. We aimed to de-termine the role and frequency of constitutional MLH1 methylation among EC cases with MMRd, MLH1- methylated tumors.Methods. We screened blood for constitutional MLH1 methylation using pyrosequencing and real-time methylation-specific PCR in patients with MMRd, MLH1-methylated EC ascertained from (i) cancer clinics (n = 4, <60 years), and (ii) two population-based cohorts; "Columbus-area" (n = 68, all ages) and "Ohio Colo-rectal Cancer Prevention Initiative (OCCPI)" (n = 24, <60 years).Results. Constitutional MLH1 methylation was identified in three out of four patients diagnosed between 36 and 59 years from cancer clinics. Two had mono-/hemiallelic epimutation (similar to 50% alleles methylated). One with multiple primaries had low-level mosaicism in normal tissues and somatic "second-hits" affecting the unmethylated allele in all tumors, demonstrating causation. In the population-based cohorts, all 68 cases from the Columbus-area cohort were negative and low-level mosaic constitutional MLH1 methylation was identified in one patient aged 36 years out of 24 from the OCCPI cohort, representing one of six (similar to 17%) patients <50 years and one of 45 patients (similar to 2%) <60 years in the combined cohorts. EC was the first/dual-first cancer in three pa-tients with underlying constitutional MLH1 methylation.Conclusions. A correct diagnosis at first presentation of cancer is important as it will significantly alter clinical management. Screening for constitutional MLH1 methylation is warranted in patients with early-onset EC or syn-chronous/metachronous tumors (any age) displaying MLH1 methylation.(c) 2023 The Authors.

TI  - Identification of priority areas for UGI optimisation under carbon neutrality targets: Perspectives from China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon neutrality targets are a common objective for cities and regions worldwide, the achievement of which relies on the transformation of urban infrastructure. Urban green infrastructure (UGI) is the only resilient carbon sequestration subsystem within cities in the carbon cycle process; however, a straightforward and feasible evaluation system for guiding the regulation and planning decisions regarding UGI as a carbon sink has yet to emerge. Here, we simulated the net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation in Wuhan in 2020 based on the Sentinel-2 improved CASA model and assessed the efficiency of UGI carbon sequestration by combining the biomass-carbon conversion coefficient and zonal statistical tool. Potential influencing variables were explored based on the P-S-R model. Then, the optimal parameter-based geodetector revealed the driving mechanism of spatial heterogeneity in the efficiency of the UGI carbon sequestration service supply in highly urbanized regions, based on which we developed the 'Carbon Sequestration Enhancement Priority Index' (CSEPI), a strategic planning tool for identifying priority areas in which to implement carbon sink-enhanced field intervention measures. For these 'high-priority' areas, further UGI partition management tools and partition optimisation strategies are proposed. Our study contributes to the scientific planning and management of UGI in the context of combating climate change and with limited national public investment.

In the process of developing the proofs mentioned above, we arrive at another result (providing a finite field analogue of Furstenberg-Sarkozy's Theorem) showing that any subset E of a finite field Fq for which |E| > qk root q-1 must contain at least two distinct elements whose difference is a kth power.

TI  - Three-dimensional deformation velocity field and kinematic characteristic of the middle and east parts of Haiyuan fault zone from InSAR and GPS observations
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional deformation velocity field can reveal fine characteristics of surface deformation, and provide data support for the research on crustal motion mechanism and seismic hazard. In this study, the ascending and descending InSAR deformation velocity fields in the middle and east parts of Haiyuan fault zone are firstly obtained with Sentinel-1A data and SBAS InSAR technology. Then, by combining with GPS observations, the three-dimensional deformation velocity field is extracted and analyzed. Finally, the locking depths and deep slip rates at different locations are inverted by using the classical two-dimensional screw dislocation model, and the max-imum shear-strain rate is investigated. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the InSAR deformation velocity field between both sides of the middle and east parts of Haiyuan fault zone. The east-west deformation velocity field clearly reveals the left -lateral strike-slip characteristic of the fault zone. The northward movement gradually changes to southward movement from northwest to southeast. The vertical deformation velocity field displays significant differences on both sides of the section between MMSF and the middle of LHSF, and the middle and eastern of HYE fault. For LHSF, the locking depth and deep slip rate are 9.7 km and 4.9 mm/a; for HYW fault, they gradually decrease from west to east, with the locking depths of 6.4 km, 3.6 km and 3.2 km, respectively, and the deep slip rates of 5.5 mm/a, 4.2 mm/a and 3.8 mm/a, respectively; for HYM fault, they are 7 km and 4.7 mm/a; for HYE fault, they are 5.8 km and 3.6 mm/a. There are two obvious extreme regions of maximum shear-strain rate along the fault strike. This study can provide a reference for investigating the mechanism of regional uplift and extension and seismic hazard.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing effectiveness of nature-based solution with big earth data: 60 years mangrove plantation program in Bangladesh coast
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In the climate change context, nature-based solution (NBS) is considered one of the effective tools to increase the resilience of socio-ecological system. The concept coincides with the government's attempts of afforestation and reforestation programs that have been going on for 60 years in Bangladesh. This study, therefore, envisaged understanding how NBS (mangrove afforestation and reforestation) works to promote climate change resilience through the synthetization of remote sensing-based big earth data, statistical tools, and models. The study took the entire coast of Bangladesh except for Sundarbans Reserve Forest and rolled back to 1962 to work on 60 years' time series data. Declassified CORONA satellite imagery along with Landsat satellite imagery was used, which is the first-ever attempt in the remote sensing-based ecosystem work in Bangladesh.Results The study's main innovation is to spatially establish the effectiveness of the NBS. The study critically assessed and estimated stable lands and their socio-economic benefits as part of the effectiveness of the NBS. As part of the NBS-derived benefits in the context of climate change, it estimated the sequestrated carbon in mangrove forests. A significant positive relationship was observed between the increase of mangroves and stable lands. Near about 448,011 ha of agricultural land was stabilized due to the NBS intervention whose economic value is 18,837 million USD. In addition, 29,755.71 kt of carbon have been sequestrated due to NBS program.Conclusions The concept of NBS is still in the development stage and very little or no work has been done so far in measuring and labeling the effectiveness of the NBS. Therefore, our study can innovatively contribute to the scientific community to show the effectiveness of the NBS in three domains (social, economic and ecological) in the changing climatic scenario.

TI  - Variations in aerosols and aerosols-cloud interactions in Bangkok using MODIS satellite data during high PM2.5 concentrations
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationships between particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 mm (PM2.5), aerosol optical depth (AOD), and cloud parameters were investigated during high PM2.5 concentrations from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2021 in Bangkok using satel-lite remote sensing data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Cloud parameters included: Cloud effective radius (CER), Cloud fraction (CF), Cloud optical depth (COD), Cloud liquid water (CLW), Cloud top pressure (CTP), and Cloud top temperature (CTT). The analysis showed a strong negative correlation between PM2.5 and CF. There was a negative correlation between CF and AOD. In addition, PM2.5 showed a negative relationship with CER. In contrast, PM2.5 showed a positive correlation with CTP and CTT. A negative correlation was detected between COD and PM2.5. During high PM2.5 concentrations, cloud parameters are significantly influenced by PM2.5 concentrations in the atmosphere. The three-month of CER, CF, CLW, COD, CTP, and CTT ranges from 16.34 lm to 37.05 lm, 0.22 to 0.86, 15.67 g/m2 to 169.80 g/m2, 1.14 to 19.06, 261.67 hPa to 991.67 hPa, and-66.26C to -22.17C, respectively. Consequently, Altostratus clouds most appear during high PM2.5 concentrations in Bangkok. The findings may help better understand Bangkok's cloud properties and atmospheric aerosols, providing more information for rainmaking during high PM2.5 concentrations. (c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Integration of remote sensing and geophysical data for structural lineaments analysis in the Rag-e-Sefid oil/gas field and surrounding areas, SW Iran
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The major faults in the Rag-e-Sefld oil/gas field and surrounding areas are detected by integrating digital satellite, aero-magnetic, and seismic data to improve resolution and reduce ambiguity. The main structural lineaments are extracted through the processing of satellite images. The continuity of the lineaments onto the magnetic basement is analyzed by processing the aeromagnetic data, which reveals the distribution of the basement faults, their relationship with each other, and their segmentation or continuation in the magnetic basement. The seismic profiles across the major faults support resolving the predominant geological structures of the region and identifying the sense of movement on the fault surfaces. In addition, fieldwork was performed to verify the detections and characterize the status and mechanism of the identified faults. The results indicate that the main detected faults in the area are classified into seven major categories: the Nourooz-Hendijan-Izeh, NW and SE Rag-e-Sefid, Zagros Frontal, Kharg-Mish, Izeh, and Mountain Front faults. The Rag-e-Sefid and the Nourooz-Hendijan-Izeh Faults have been considered critical structural lineaments in creating the final geometry of the Rag-e-Sefid anticline and have controlled the fracture characteristics in the Asmari reservoir.

TI  - Mapping Brazilian soil mineralogy using proximal and remote sensing data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Minerals control many soil functions and play a crucial role in addressing global existential issues. Measuring the abundance of soil minerals is a laborious, costly, and time-consuming task; however, soil spectroscopy can be a useful tool to overcome this issue. This work aimed to map the abundance of major mineralogical components of soils in Brazil from surface to 1 m deep and at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Spectral data of the Brazilian Soil Spectral Library with Vis-NIR-SWIR was used to estimate the abundance of haematite, goethite, kaolinite, and gibbsite. These minerals were spatialized using digital soil mapping techniques. We also developed a novel framework to obtain bare soil reflectance for areas without natural or anthropic soil exposure (continuous image) and used it as covariate. Soil minerals and their abundances were successfully estimated by Vis-NIR-SWIR reflectance. Haematite predictions presented the most accurate results with Random Forest models, followed by gibbsite, kaolinite, and goethite. The spatial validation with reference mineralogical data found R2 of 0.64 (haematite), 0.40 (goethite), 0.20 (kaolinite/Kt), 0.29 (gibbsite/Gbs), and 0.40 (Kt/Kt + Gbs). The resulting maps of soil minerals were in accordance with the geology, pedology, climate, and relief of Brazil and revealed the spatial distribution of mineral abundances at a finer resolution than existing geological and pedological maps, reaching a farm level detail.

TI  - Long-term ion hydration process and lithosphere-atmosphere coupling following the 2021 Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption using remotely sensed data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - After a series of earthquakes, the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland faced a volcanic eruption for the first time in 800 years. This vol-canism of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall started on March 19, 2021, and lasted until September 18, 2021. In this study, the vestiges of the mutual interplay of Earth's different geophysical shells due to the local lithospheric changes around the Fagradalsfjall were extensively investi-gated with the help of satellite-based remotely sensed datasets. Firstly, the regional surface deformations caused by the pre-eruption seis-mic activity are determined using interferometric image pairs, and horizontal and vertical displacement rates are analyzed. Secondly, the satellite observations revealed that the land surface temperature of the entire area increased to a maximum of 40 degrees C during the maximum phase of lava discharge by the end of May 2021. Moreover, we observed that the surface mass concentrations of SO2 and CO trace gases started to ascend in parallel with the lava discharge after the initial eruption, where their concentrations were doubled in April before reaching their maximum phases (three to four times more than the initial eruption) in May 2021. The cumulative concentrations of the trace gases in the atmosphere emitted from the Fagradalsfjall volcano pushed the regional atmospheric balance into a non-equilibrium state by creating air ionization through various chemical reactions with other atmospheric gases. These ion clusters underwent an ion hydration process that changed the electric conductivity of the atmospheric boundary layer, which covers the first two kilometers of the atmosphere. Finally, our observations showed a sharp decrease in the atmospheric relative humidity that led to an increase in the atmospheric air temperature due to this ion hydration process. The large ion clusters in the atmospheric boundary layer produced a ver-tical electric field that penetrated over the affected region and brought long-term changes in the ionosphere layer. This unique phe-nomenon of the simultaneous interaction of different geophysical layers was specifically observed during the maximum phase of the lava discharge and increased ion concentrations in the atmosphere. The used data sets cover the first three months of the volcanism, and this interval seemed to be sufficient to reveal the atmospheric traces. Our comprehensive study provides an important contribution to the theory of the coupling of volcanism and the Earth's atmospheric dynamics. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Fuzzy clustering for the within-season estimation of cotton phenology
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop phenology is crucial information for crop yield estimation and agricultural management. Traditionally, phenology has been observed from the ground; however Earth observation, weather and soil data have been used to capture the physiological growth of crops. In this work, we propose a new approach for the within-season phenology estimation for cotton at the field level. For this, we exploit a variety of Earth observation vegetation indices (derived from Sentinel-2) and numerical simulations of atmospheric and soil parameters. Our method is unsupervised to address the ever-present problem of sparse and scarce ground truth data that makes most supervised alternatives impractical in real-world scenarios. We applied fuzzy c-means clustering to identify the principal phenological stages of cotton and then used the cluster membership weights to further predict the transitional phases between adjacent stages. In order to evaluate our models, we collected 1,285 crop growth ground observations in Orchomenos, Greece. We introduced a new collection protocol, assigning up to two phenology labels that represent the primary and secondary growth stage in the field and thus indicate when stages are transitioning. Our model was tested against a baseline model that allowed to isolate the random agreement and evaluate its true competence. The results showed that our model considerably outperforms the baseline one, which is promising considering the unsupervised nature of the approach. The limitations and the relevant future work are thoroughly discussed. The ground observations are formatted in an ready-to-use dataset and will be available at https://github.com/Agri-Hub/ cotton-phenology-dataset upon publication.

TI  - Short-term stability of wastewater samples for storage and shipment in the context of the EU Sewage Sentinel System for SARS-CoV-2
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of an EU-wide surveillance system for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, recommended by the European Commission, this study aims to provide scientific support to the adequacy of transport and storage conditions of samples both in terms of duration and samples temperature. Three laboratories in Slovenia, Cyprus and Estonia investigated the short-term, one-week, isochronous stability of wastewater samples by RT-qPCR based detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes. The results were tested for statistical significance to determine uncertainty of quantification and shelf-life, at testing temperatures of + 20 degrees C and - 20 degrees C, relative to reference at + 4 degrees C. Samples were collected from three urban wastewater treatment plant influents and analysed respectively for SARS-CoV-2 genes N1, N2 (Laboratory 1), N2, E (Laboratory 2) and N3 (Laboratory 3), with various analytical methods. For a period of 7/8 days at + 20 degrees C, decreasing trends of measured concentrations were observed for all genes resulting in instability according to the statistical analysis, while at - 20 degrees C the trend of variation was stable only for N1, N2 (Laboratory 1) and N3 (Laboratory 3). Trends for gene E concentrations at - 20 degrees C (Laboratory 2) could not be tested statistically for stability because of lack of data. Over a period of just 3 days at + 20 degrees C, the variation was statistically non-significant indicating stability for genes N1, E and N3 for laboratories 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Nonetheless, the outcome of the study presents evidence to support the choice of the selected temperature at which samples shall be preserved during storage before analysis or transport to the laboratory. The conditions (+4 degrees C, similar to few days) chosen for EU wastewater surveillance are in accordance with these results, highlighting the importance of stability testing of environmental samples to determine the short-term analytical uncertainty.

TI  - The spatial distribution and expansion of<i> Eucalyptus</i> in its hotspots: Implications on agricultural landscapes
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast coppicing plantations like Eucalyptus are becoming an ever increasingly important land use system globally, including the Eucalyptus hotspot highlands of Northwestern Ethiopia. However, comprehensive information regarding species composition is essential for proper planning and policy decisions. The current study mapped the spatial distribution of Eucalyptus globulus (hereafter referred to as Eucalyptus) and identified the key push factors for its expansion. The study used a mapping procedure that uses Landsat imagery together with ground truth data based on supervised training of a pixel-by-pixel classification algorithm within image regions to distinguish areas of Eucalyptus plantations from other classes. High-resolution multispectral and multi-temporal remote-sensing images were combined with ground truth data to produce robust features of Eucalyptus plantation distribution maps. Heckman's Two-Stage econometric model was also employed for determining the major driving factors of Eucalyptus expansion. The results of the mapping algorithm were Eucalyptus plantation distribution maps of 30 x 30 m resolution that showed temporal changes from 1999 to 2021. The findings revealed that Eucalyptus coverage increased by 55% during the period from 1999 to 2010 and the change expressively increased to 69% in 2021 with respect to the reference period. The study also found that a number of push factors influenced the size of land planted with Eucalyptus. The developed maps showing the spatial distribution and expansion of Eucalyptus will help policymakers properly manage the ecosystems and agricultural landscapes of Eucalyptus growing areas.

TI  - The Role of Gingival Fibroblasts in the Pathogenesis of Periodontitis
T2  - JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Gingival fibroblasts (GFs) are essential components of the periodontium, which are responsible for the maintenance of tissue structure and integrity. However, the physiological role of GFs is not restricted to the production and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. GFs also act as sentinel cells that modulate the immune response to oral pathogens invading the gingival tissue. As an important "nonclassical" component of the innate immune system, GFs respond to bacteria and damage-related signals by producing cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators. Although the activation of GFs supports the elimination of invading bacteria and the resolution of inflammation, their uncontrolled or excessive activation may promote inflammation and bone destruction. This occurs in periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontium initiated and sustained by dysbiosis. In the inflamed gingival tissue, GFs acquire imprinted proinflammatory phenotypes that promote the growth of inflammophilic pathogens, stimulate osteoclastogenesis, and contribute to the chronicity of inflammation. In this review, we discuss the biological functions of GFs in healthy and inflamed gingival tissue, highlighting recent studies that provide insight into their role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. We also draw parallels with the recently discovered fibroblast populations identified in other tissues and their roles in health and disease. This knowledge should be used in future studies to discover more about the role of GFs in periodontal diseases, especially chronic periodontitis, and to identify therapeutic strategies targeting their pathological interactions with oral pathogens and the immune system.

TI  - Global patterns and influencing factors of post-fire land cover change
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire, as a strong disturbance type, can exert significant impacts on the biosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere and human society. It can inherently trigger both critical transitions in ecosystems and dramatic changes in land cover. However, the general patterns and possible influencing factors of post-fire land cover change remain largely unclear at a global scale. Obtaining such knowledge is of great value in advancing the understanding of fire ecology and promoting sustainable fire management. Here, we combined satellite observations of long-term ESA CCI land cover (300 m resolution) and burned area data from MODIS collection 6 (500 m resolution) to assess the global post-fire land cover change patterns from 2005 to 2015. The results showed that areas with identified post-fire land cover change accounted for approximately 0.36-0.74% of the annual global burned areas during the study period and were most common in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and the D.R. Congo. The most common land cover change types in 2005, 2010 and 2015 were "forest-to-agriculture" (31.93%), "forest-to-shrubland" (26.23%) and "agriculture-to-forest" (18.74%), respectively. In addition, the conversion between agriculture and forest, and shrubland and forest, after fire were found to be bidirectional. After assessing 14 fire-related, climatic, topographic, ecological and socioeconomic factors that could potentially influence post-fire land cover change occurrence, burned area size and vegetation cover di-versity were identified as the two strongest predictors, followed by aspect, fire intensity and slope. Our results provide a global overview of post-fire land cover change patterns and offer guidance for developing sustainable fire management policies.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of vegetation cover in mining areas of Dexing City, China*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dexing City is an important mining city in China, abounding in copper ore, lead ore, zinc ore, and other metal resources, and there are two large open-pit mines in its territory, Dexing Copper Mine and Yinshan Mine. The two open-pit mines have been expanding their mining production scale since 2005, with frequent mining activities; and the expansion of the pits and the discharge of solid waste will undoubtedly increase the land use and cause the destruction of vegetation. Therefore, we plan to visualize the change in vegetation cover in Dexing City from 2005 to 2020 and the expansion of the two open-pit mines by calculating changes of the Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) in the mining area using remote sensing technology. In this study, we calculated the FVC of Dexing City in 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 using data from NASA Landsat Database via ENVI image analysis software, plotted the FVC reclassified maps via ArcGIS, and conducted field investigations in the mining areas of Dexing City. In this way, we can visualize the spatial and temporal changes of vegetation cover in Dexing City from 2005 to 2020, and appreciate the situation of mining expansion and its solid waste discharge in Dexing City. The results of this study showed that the vegetation cover of Dexing City remained stable from 2005 to 2020, as the expansion of mining scale and mine pits was accompanied by active environmental management and land reclamation, setting a positive example for other mining cities.

TI  - Three stages in the variation of the depth of hypoxia in the California Current System 2003-2020 by satellite estimation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The depth of hypoxia (DOH) is the shallowest depth at which the waters become hypoxic (oxygen concentration < 60 mu mol kg-1), is a crucial indicator of the formation and expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). In this study, a nonlinear polynomial regression inversion model was developed to estimate the DOH in the California Current System (CCS), based on the dissolved oxygen proflle detected by the Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) float and re-mote sensing data. Satellite-derived net community production was used in the algorithm development, to denote the combined effect of phytoplankton photosynthesis and O2 consumption. Our model performs well, with a coeffl-cient of determination of 0.82 and a root mean square error of 37.69 m (n = 80) from November 2012 to August 2016. Then, it was used to reconstruct the variation in satellite-derived DOH in the CCS from 2003 to 2020, and three stages of the DOH variation trend were identifled. From 2003 to 2013, the DOH showed a signiflcant shallowing trend due to the intense subsurface O2 consumption caused by strong phytoplankton production in the CCS coastal re-gion. The trend was interrupted by two successive strong climate oscillation events from 2014 to 2016, which led to a signiflcant deepening of the DOH and a slowing, or even reversal, of the variations in other environmental parameters. After 2017, the effects of climate oscillation events gradually disappeared, and the shallowing pattern in the DOH re-covered slightly. However, by 2020, the DOH had not returned to the pre-2014 shallowing characteristic, which would lead to continuing complex ecosystem responses in the context of global warming. Based on the satellite inversion model of DOH in the CCS, we provide a new insight on the high-resolution spatiotemporal OMZ variations during an 18-year period in the CCS, which will aid in the evaluation and prediction of local ecosystems variation.

TI  - Evaluation of spatial resolution on crop disease detection based on multiscale images and category variance ratio
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop diseases are a main cause for crop losses in agricultural production worldwide. Remote sensing has long been used for crop disease detection, but it is necessary to select a suitable imaging platform and spatial resolution for practical applications. In this study, the category variance ratio (CVR) method was proposed to characterize the separability of healthy and cotton root rot-infested cotton areas on images from three different platforms, including an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a manned aerial vehicle (MAV) and the Sentinel-2 satellite. The visible and near-infrared bands were selected to construct several vegetation indices and the separability parameters for the three types of images were calculated and compared using multiple evaluation indicators. The comparison results showed that, based on the CVR separability index proposed in this study, the MAV image had the best separation between healthy and root rot areas among the three types of images. Through pixel clustering and resampling, the UAV images were upscaled to the resolution of the MAV images, but the upscaled UAV image was not as effective as the original MAV image. Further analysis of the upscaled UAV images at different spatial resolutions showed that the 4-m resolution in the reconstructed image was the optimal resolution for cotton root rot identification. Image classification and accuracy assessment results showed that the resampled 4-m UAV and MAV images had better classification accuracy than the original images and that the upscaled 4-m MAV image achieved the best accuracy among the three types of images. The results from this study demonstrate that the CVR method was effective for selecting the most appropriate spatial resolution and image type to extract crop disease information.

TI  - Impacts of land cover and management change on top-of-canopy and below- canopy temperatures in Southeastern Kenya
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Impacts of land cover conversion have been studied well from the top-of-canopy level using satellite observations. Yet, the warming or cooling impacts of land cover and management change (LCMC) from below-canopy level remain less explored. Here, we studied the below-canopy temperature change from field to landscape level across multiple LCMC in southeastern Kenya. To study this, in situ microclimate sensors, satellite observations, and high-resolution below -canopy temperature modelling approaches were used. Our results show that from field to landscape scale, forest to cropland conversion, followed by thicket to cropland change, generate higher surface temperature warming than other conversion types. At field scale, tree loss increases the mean soil temperature (measured at 6 cm below ground) more than the mean below-canopy surface temperature but its impact on the diurnal temperature range was higher on surface temperature than soil temperature in both forest to cropland and thicket to cropland/grassland conversions. At landscape scale, compared with top-of-canopy land surface temperature warming, which was estimated at Landsat overpass time (similar to 10:30 a.m.), forest to cropland conversion generates similar to 3 degrees C higher below-canopy surface tempera-ture warming. Land management change, through fencing of wildlife conservation areas and limiting mobility of mega browsers, can have an impact on woody cover and induce more below-canopy surface temperature warming than top-of-canopy in comparison with non-conservancy areas. These results indicate that human induced land changes can generate more below-canopy warming than inferred from top-of-canopy satellite observations. Together, the results highlight the importance of considering the climatic impacts of LCMC from both top-of-canopy and below -canopy level for effective mitigation of anthropogenic warming from land surface changes.

TI  - OptiBra study, a randomized controlled trial on optimal postoperative bra support after breast cancer surgery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare two different postoperative bras after breast cancer surgery and evaluate their impact on primary outcome pain.Method: The study included 201 patients scheduled for primary surgery (breast conserving surgery with sentinel node biopsy or axillary clearance, mastectomy, or mastectomy with primary implant reconstruction with sentinel node biopsy or axillary clearance). Participants were randomized to either a soft bra or stable bra with compression. The patients were recommended to use the bra 24 h/day for 3 weeks, record daily pain (NRS), analgesic use and hours of bra use.Results: Follow up was completed by 184 patients. No significant differences between the arms were found considering pain score over time, neither day 1-14, nor after 3 weeks. Sixty-eight percent of all patients, regardless of randomization, reported pain during the first 14 days. After 3 weeks 46% still reported pain in the operated breast. Among these, patients randomized to the stable bra with compression reported significantly lower pain score than those randomized to the soft bra. Patients who used the stable bra with compression re-ported significantly higher levels of comfort, sense of security during activity, less difficulty moving the arm, as well as support and stability for the operated breast compared to those using the soft bra.Conclusion: Using a stable bra with compression is the optimal evidence-based choice after breast cancer surgery to reduce remaining pain 3 weeks after surgery, increasing mobility, comfort, and sense of security.

TI  - Remote sensing algorithms for particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) and the global cycle of PIC
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper begins with a review of the history of remote sensing algorithms for the determination of particulate inorganic carbon (PIC; aka calcium carbonate), primarily associated with haptophyte phytoplankton known as coccolithophores. These algae have strong optical particle backscattering (bbp) which can dominate ocean color properties.. In non-bloom conditions, coccolithophore bbp typically accounts for similar to 10-20% of the total bbp, whereas in turbid coccolithophore blooms, coccolithophore bbp can account for >90% of total bbp. Since total bbp features heavily in a number of algorithms for the determination of phytoplankton standing stock, dispropor-tionate coccolithophore bbp can cause significant errors in a wide variety of other ocean-color algorithms. Here we discriminate between qualitative coccolithophore algorithms (coccolith flags), quantitative algorithms to determine the concentration of coccolithophore PIC and algorithms that focus on coccolithophore biomass. Algorithms from satellite sensors, such as the AVHRR and MISR, not typically used for phytoplankton remote sensing, are discussed as well as an improved method to model the backscattering cross-section of PIC. We also cover remote sensing algorithms for determination of calcification rates, modeling vertical profiles of PIC for the remote sensing of integrated euphotic PIC, and the effect of coccolithophore species variation on PIC retrievals. The second part of this review paper covers what we have learned about the cycling of PIC from remotely-sensed satellite measurements since the first satellite observations in 1982. The analysis begins from the global perspective, then focuses on five sub-regions which have become notorious for their regular, high-reflectance coccolithophore blooms (Southern Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean, Black Sea and Bering Sea). We end with a discussion of future directions for the PIC algorithms using machine-learning approaches and hyper -spectral applications during the upcoming PACE era.

TI  - The SENTIREC-endo study-Risks and benefits of a national adoption of sentinel node mapping in low and intermediate risk endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The SENTIREC-endo study aims to investigate risks and benefits of a national protocolled adoption of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in women with early-stage low-grade endometrial cancer (EC) with low-(LR) and intermediate-risk (IR) of lymph node metastases. Methods. We performed a national multicenter prospective study of SLN-mapping in women with LR and IR EC from March 2017-February 2022. Postoperative complications were classified according to Clavien-Dindo. Lymphedema was assessed as a change score and as incidence of swelling and heaviness evaluated by validated patient-reported outcome measures at baseline and three months postoperatively. Results. 627 women were included in the analyses; 458 with LR-and 169 with IR EC. The SLN detection rate was 94.3% (591/627). The overall incidence of lymph node metastases was 9.3% (58/627); 4.4% (20/458) in the LR-and 22.5% (38/169) in the IR group. Ultrastaging identified 62% (36/58) of metastases. The incidence of post-operative complications was 8% (50/627) but only 0.3% (2/627) experienced an intraoperative complication as-sociated with the SLN procedure. The lymphedema change score was below the threshold for clinical importance 4.5/100 CI: (2.9-6.0), and the incidence of swelling and heaviness was low; 5.2% and 5.8%, respectively. Conclusion. SLN mapping in women with LR and IR EC carries a very low risk of early lymphedema and peri-and postoperative complications. The national change in clinical practice contributed to a more correct treatment allocation for both risk groups and thus supports further international implementation of the SLN technique in early stage, low grade EC.

TI  - Evaluating gross primary productivity over 9 ChinaFlux sites based on ran- dom forest regression models, remote sensing, and eddy covariance data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate modeling of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems is a major challenge in quantifying the carbon cycle. Many light use efficiency (LUE) models have been developed, but the variables and algorithms used for environmental constraints in different models vary importantly. It is still unclear whether the models can be further improved by machine learning methods and the combination of different variables. Here, we have devel-oped a series of RFR-LUE models, which used the random forest regression (RFR) algorithm based on variables of LUE models, to explore the potential of estimating site-level GPP. Based on remote sensing indices, eddy covariance and meteorological data, we applied RFR-LUE models to evaluate the effects of different variables combined on GPP on daily, 8-day, 16-day and monthly scales, respectively. Cross-validation analyses revealed performances of RFR-LUE models varied significantly among sites with R2 of 0.52-0.97. Slopes of the regression relationship between sim-ulated and observed GPP ranged from 0.59 to 0.95. Most models performed better in capturing the temporal changes and magnitude of GPP in mixed forests and evergreen needle-leaf forests than in evergreen broadleaf forests and grass-lands. Performances were improved at the longer temporal scale, with the average R2 for four-time resolutions of 0.81, 0.87, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively. Additionally, the importance of the variables showed that temperature and vegeta-tion indices were critical variables for RFR-LUE models, followed by radiation and moisture variables. The importance of moisture variables was higher in non-forests than in forests. A comparison with four GPP products indicated that RFR-LUE model predicted GPP better matcher observed GPP across sites. The study provided an approach to deriving GPP fluxes and evaluating the extent to which variables affect GPP estimation. It may be used for predicting vegetation GPP at the regional scales and for calibration and evaluation of land surface process models.

TI  - The Hi-GLASS all-wave daily net radiation product: Algorithm and product validation
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface net radiation (Rn) represents the balance of the radiative budget on the land surface and drives many physical and biological processes. An accurate and long-term product for global daily coverage of Rn at a high spatial resolution is needed for a variety of applications at regional and local scales. This study proposes two algorithms, called the downward shortwave radiation (DSR)-based algorithm and the top-of-atmosphere (TOA)based algorithm, to estimate Rn by using Landsat data. The DSR-based algorithm consists of three conditional models, and was developed based on the analysis of the relationship between Rn and shortwave radiation as well as ancillary information from ground measurements and various datasets. The TOA-based algorithm was developed by linking Rn to TOA observations from Landsat sensors and ancillary information. The two algorithms were developed by using the random forest method. The results of their validation against ground measurements showed that the DSR-based algorithm outperformed the TOA-based algorithm in terms of accuracy, with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.93, root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 17.58 Wm-2, and bias of-4.27 Wm-2. It was stable under various conditions. We then applied the DSR-based algorithm to generate a product of the global daily Rn, called the High-resolution (Hi)-Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS), from 2013 to 2018 at a spatial resolution of 30 m under a clear sky based on remotely sensed products, including the DSR from GLASS, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Landsat, surface broadband albedo from Hi GLASS, and meteorological factors based on reanalysis data from MERRA2. Following its validation using in situ observations from 2013 to 2018, the overall accuracy of the daily Rn acquired by Hi-GLASS under clear sky was found to be satisfactory, with a value of R2 of 0.90 and an RMSE of 25.03 Wm-2. Moreover, compared with the daily Rn obtained from the GLASS product at a spatial resolution of 5 km, that obtained by Hi-GLASS can better characterize the surface by providing more details and capturing the variations in the measurements, especially large and small values. However, due to limitations of the available datasets and the algorithm, the data on Rn for most regions lacked information on cloudy skies and areas at high latitudes. This information thus cannot be provided by Hi-GLASS yet. Moreover, the influence of the topography on values of Rn has not been thoroughly considered. Nonetheless, values of Rn under clear sky obtained from Hi-GLASS offer promise for use in a wide range of areas, and efforts are underway to improve this product.

TI  - Evolution and use of remote sensing in ecological vulnerability assessment: A review
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The ecological vulnerability assessment (EVA) is employed as a tool for integrated evaluation of the ecosystem with the help of indicators belonging to natural, social, and economy systems. The unavailability of suitable datasets has repeatedly been reported as an obstacle to conducting EVA on large spatial and temporal scales. The progress in remote sensing (RS) technology has aided the development of ecological vulnerability indicators (EVIs) from RS datasets.Scope and approach: This manuscript presents a comprehensive review of 80 peer-reviewed publications which uses RS for EVA. In this regard, the paper is divided into five main sections: First, the background and rationale of conducting this review is presented in the introduction. Second, the methodology for selection and interpretation of selected literature is discussed. Then, the results section presents findings from various dimensions: general trend of literature, spatial or temporal scale of EVA, analysis of targets systems, RS and Non-RS derived EVIs, sensors used for acquisition of RS data, conceptual models, weights determining mechanisms, and software. Next, multiple gaps in the body of knowledge are identified and general recommendations are formulated for future researchers. Finally, the link of EVA with sustainable development is highlighted in the conclusion section.Key findings: The overall trend shows that both the quantity and quality of research regarding EVA has increased over the past decades. It is observed that large number of studies report EVA on both temporal and spatial scale. Further, the results reveal 52 EVIs are derived from RS data and 101 EVIs are derived from non-RS data. The Landsat datasets are found most repeatedly used in EVA research. The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) and principal component analysis (PCA) are prominent conceptual models and weighting mechanisms. Finally, ArcGIS software is most widely reported software in the EVA literature.

TI  - Deep learning based whale detection from satellite imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING-INFORMATICS & SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of their fascinating and vulnerable status, the number of whales in the world's oceans remain debatable because of their living environment. As per statics, with the efforts made towards their conservation, there have been signs of recovery in the population of whales but still, many remote areas remain unsurveyed and thus the number of whales remain ambiguous. To maintain the balance of ecology it is needed to preserve the whales to balance the ecosystem and a key component of that will be to have a count of whales. To date, whale detection has been carried out using ship/aerial surveys, acoustic surveys, etc. but with the development in the field of Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, satellite images along with deep learning is also being effectively used for the detection of whales. Most of the previous work carried out for the detection of whales via satellite imagery is based upon the manual detection of whales by observers or scientists and that suffers from a high risk of false and inappropriate detections. There is also limited availability of satellite data in this field and there is a lack of usage of Artificial Intelligence for the automatic detection of whales. In this work we propose, a novel deep learning-based automatic whale detection approach from VHR satellite feed. We created a dataset of satellite images having evident chances of whales or probable whales by combining images from two different sources, used Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) to improve the quality of the images and maintain the natural texture of the images, augmented the captured satellite images to train the model, labelled the dataset as whale and probable whale. Finally, a whale dataset of 6000 whale satellite images is created which is the largest dataset available in this field. A deep learning-based whale detection approach is proposed to detect the existence of whales in the satellite image. The proposed approach performed better in terms of precision, recall, and mAP (Mean Average Precision). The precision achieved by the proposed system is 0.95, recall is 0.85, and mAP is 0.74 which is better as compared to the stateof-the-art work in this field.

AB  - To better understand the assimilation contribution and influence mechanism of different satellite platforms and different microwave instruments, the radiance data of Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) onboard NOAA-15 and NOAA-18 are assimilated to investigate various assimilation effects on the prediction of path and intensity of Typhoon Megi (2016) based on Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) three-dimensional variation and the WRF model. The community radiative transfer model is employed as the forward operator. The quality control and bias correction procedures before the radiance data assimilation (DA) are performed to improve the simulations.Impact of AMSU-A and MHS radiances assimilation on Typhoon Megi (2016)'s path and intensity is investigated by six experiments (without and with AMSU-A and MHS DA) with initial conditions at 1200 UTC on 25 September 2016 and 60 h forecast integration.The results are compared to the observational data from the China Meteorological Administration tropical cyclone database. The impact mechanisms of DA adjustments to the initial fields and assimilation increment analysis of each physical quantity field are investigated in detail. The findings show that NOAA-15 AMSU-A assimilation produces the best output over the course of the 60 h simulation, demonstrating that assimilation satellite data from multiple platforms is not always better than assimilation satellite data from a single platform. In comparison, MHS assimilation has a favorable effect on short-term path and strength forecasts, but has a negative impact on long-term forecasts. The effect of MHS DA needs to be further investigated.

TI  - A lightweight convolutional neural network based on dense connection for open-pit coal mine service identification using the edge-cloud architecture
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an important technical tool for rapid detection of illegal mining behavior. Due to the complex features of open-pit coal mines, there are few studies about automatic extraction of open-pit coal mines. Based on Convolutional Neural Network and Dense Block, we propose a lightweight densely connected network-AD-Net for the extraction of open-pit coal mining areas from Sentinel-2 remote sensing images, and construct three sample libraries of open-pit coal mining areas in north-central Xinzhou City, Shanxi Province. The AD-Net model consists of two convolutional layers, two pooling layers, a channel attention module, and a Dense Block. The two convolutional layers greatly reduce the complexity of the model, and the Dense Block enhances the feature propagation while reducing the parameter computation. The application is designed in different modules that runs independently on different machines and communicate with each other. Furthermore, we create and build a unique remote sensing image service system that connects a remote datacentre and its associated edge networks, employing the edge-cloud architecture. While the datacentre acts as the cloud platform and is in charge of storing and processing the original remote sensing images, the edge network is largely utilised for caching, predicting, and disseminating the processed images. First, we find out the optimal optimizer and the optimal size of the input image by extensive experiments, and then we compare the extraction effect of AD-Net with AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogLeNet, Xception, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 models in the study area. The experimental results show that the combination of NIR, red, green, and blue band synthesis is more suitable for the extraction of the open-pit coal mine, and the OA and Kappa of AD-Net reach 0.959 and 0.918 respectively, which is better than other models and well balances the classification accuracy and running speed. With this design of edge-cloud, the proposed system not only evenly distributes the strain of processing activities across the edges but also achieves data efficiency among them, reducing the cost of data transmission and improving the latency.

M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water quality is of utmost importance for protection from pollution and ecological functioning of inland water body. In South Africa, water quality has been identified as a major en-vironmental issue experienced in many water bodies. Accurate estimation of reservoir's water quality indicators through conventional techniques, such as those employed by several authors in the reservoirs under investigation, has proven to be time-consuming, expensive, labour-intensive, and impractical, especially when the sample area is large or inaccessible. Sentinel-2 imagery, in conjunction with field-based water quality indicator data were used to map spatial patterns in water quality indicators. The water quality indicators investigated in this study were electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH and turbidity. Linear regression analysis was employed to establish the relationship between each water quality indicator and the spectral re-flectance patterns of Sentinel-2 bands. The empirical models were generated from the linear re-gression results that showed strong relationship between each water quality indicator and spec-tral reflectance patterns of Senstinel-2 bands. The linear regression analysis results between the in-situ data and Sentinel-2 data revealed the response of EC, TDS, pH and turbidity to red, short-wave infrared, near-infrared and green spectral channels respectively. Therefore, demonstration of the band correlations with in-situ data suggests that Sentinel-2 sensor provides invaluable in-formation for water quality monitoring.

TI  - Evolution and copula modelling of drought duration and severity over Africa using CORDEX-CORE regional climate models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the dependence of drought severity and duration across four subregions (Southern, Western, Eastern and Central) in Africa using copula modelling. The analysis was carried out for the reference period 1991-2020 and the future period 2071-2099. Simulated daily precipitation at a horizontal resolution of 0.22 degrees were obtained from three regional climate models (RCMs) participating in the Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations within the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX-CORE). The RCMs were downscaled by three global climate models and validated using three high-resolution gridded daily precipitation products obtained from The Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations data (CHIRPS), Climate Prediction Center Africa Rainfall Climatology Version 2.0 (CPC-ARC2) and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT). Comparison of precipitation from the RCMs with the three gridded reference observations shows relatively good performance across the different regions with median value within the range of 3-5 mm center dot day(-1) in Central Africa, 1.5-4.5 mm center dot day(-1) in Western Africa, 1.8-2.8 mm center dot day(-1) in Eastern Africa and 0.5-2.2 mm center dot day(-1) in Southern Africa. On the other hand, the correlation values of drought duration-severity from CORDEX-CORE models in the different regions of Africa exhibit predominantly strong values greater than 0.8 for both historical and projected climate. The analysis also considered two families of copulas: Archimedean (Frank, Clayton, Gumbel) and Elliptical (Gaussian, Student's t). The performance of the copula functions were estimated using the Akaike information criteria (AIC). Generally, there is a good agreement in the distribution of observed precipitation among the three observational data products across the subregion of Africa, with slight differences attributed to the different processing algorithms of the products. Across West Africa, mean precipitation values from CPC, CHIRPS and TAMSAT was 2.86, 3.16 and 3.07 mm center dot day(-1), respectively. The CCLM-NCC underestimated the mean values of precipitation reported in the observation data, while CCLM-MPI and CCLM-HAD overestimated the mean values of precipitation in the West Africa region.

TI  - Dairy milk from cow and goat as a sentinel for tick-borne encephalitis virus surveillance
T2  - COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one of the most severe human tick-borne diseases in Europe. It is caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), which is transmitted to humans mainly via bites of Ixodes ricinus or I. persulcatus ticks. The geographical distribution and abundance of I. ricinus is expanding in Sweden as has the number of reported human TBE cases. In addition to tick bites, alimentary TBEV infection has also been reported after consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. So far, no alimentary TBEV infection has been reported in Sweden, but knowledge about its prevalence in Swedish ruminants is scarce. In the present study, a total of 122 bulk tank milk samples and 304 individual milk samples (including 8 colostrum samples) were collected from dairy farms (n = 102) in Sweden. All samples were analysed for the presence of TBEV antibodies by ELISA test and immunoblotting. Participating farmers received a questionnaire about milk production, pasteurization, tick prophylaxis used on animals, tick-borne diseases, and TBE vaccination status. We detected specific anti-TBEV antibodies, i.e., either positive (>126 Vienna Units per ml, VIEU/ml) or borderline (63-126 VIEU/ml) in bulk tank milk from 20 of the 102 farms. Individual milk samples (including colostrum samples) from these 20 farms were therefore collected for further analysis. Our results revealed important information for detection of emerging TBE risk areas. Factors such as consumption of unpasteurized milk, limited use of tick prophylaxis on animals and a moderate coverage of human TBE vaccination, may be risk factors for alimentary TBEV infection in Sweden.

TI  - Cross frontal variability in bio-optical characteristics in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean during an austral summer
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bio-optical properties, which play a crucial role in the understanding of the radiation budget of optical active substances (OAS), phytoplankton community, biological pump, and detection of algal blooms have been sparsely studied in the Southern Ocean (SO). We assessed how bio-optical characteristics change across the frontal regions and during phytoplankton bloom and non-bloom domains in the Indian sector of the SO (ISSO) during the austral summer of 2011. In both the meridional transect (47 oE and 57.5 oE), the surface Chlorophyll-a, and phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)) increased with latitude. Whereas Chlorophyll-a specific phytoplankton absorption (a*ph(443)), an index for the "pigment package effect", decreased with latitude, implying that the size of phytoplankton increases with latitude. The 57.5 oE transect showed higher quantities of OAS than 47 oE, except for Polar Front 2 (PF-2). Moreover, the vertical profiles of Chlorophyll-a in PF-2 at 47 oE showed a massive phytoplankton bloom with a thickness of 60 m, which could be confirmed in the surface Chlorophyll-a images from the MODIS Aqua satellite. The massive bloom occurred due to distinct physical processes (nutrients supplied by pack ice), causing high productivity. The vertical profiles of Chlorophyll-a, aph(443), and a*ph(443) identified subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCM) and different phytoplankton communities across the fronts. The interrelationships between bio-optical properties exhibited distinct features in bloom and non-bloom domains. The aCDOM(443) and its spectral slope (S300-500) increased and decreased with latitude, respectively. Using the vertical distribution of CDOM and its relationships with slope and Chlorophyll-a, multiple sources of CDOM could be identified. The percentage-contribution of OAS in the Polar Front-1 (PF-1) exhibited lower aph, lower detrital absorption (ad), and higher aCDOM indicating its low productivity compared to other fronts. This study facilitates the understanding of the phytoplankton size-class (pico, nano and micro) and productivity using the bio-optical properties in this lesser-studied polar region.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Remote sensing and geophysical methods for delineating groundwater resources in schists hard rocks of the Adamawa Yade Domain, Cameroon
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of remote sensing and geophysical techniques is a practical approach for mapping envi-ronmental hydrogeological setting and delineating groundwater zones. This paper applies an integrated approach to identify and extract the subsurface structures that act as conduits for the groundwater flow in the highly deformed area of the Adamawa region. Remote sensing data through the lineament's extrac-tion technique highlights topographic lineaments along which rivers flow in the area. The distribution of these lineaments according to the lineament density map indicates the degree of permeability or porosity of each region and thus the capability in terms of groundwater potential. The filtering of aeromagnetic data enables to produce a structural map showing various geophysical lineaments interpreted as the fault systems of the study area. These faults are the main conduits through which magnetized rocks of gran-itoid type intruded into the basement and groundwater flows to the subsurface. Local application of the vertical electrical sounding (VES) shows that the study area is highly fractured/faulted and composed of multiple lithologic units including two aquifer layers (clayey sands and fractured schists) with thickness ranging from 5 to 15 m and from 34 to 82 m, respectively. Geoelectric cross-sections reveal that the sub-surface structures consist of horsts, followed by a progressive subsidence depicted by the NE-trending faults towards the southern depression and grabens bounded by NW-and NE-trending normal faults. These prominent structures (faults, fractures, and grabens) are considered as the conduits for the ground-water flow into hard rock aquifers of the study area.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Single-blind validation of space-based point-source detection and quantification of onshore methane emissions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites are increasingly seen as a tool for identifying large greenhouse gas point sources for mitigation, but independent verification of satellite performance is needed for acceptance and use by policy makers and stakeholders. We conduct to our knowledge the first single-blind controlled methane release testing of satellite-based methane emissions detection and quantification, with five independent teams analyzing data from one to five satellites each for this desert-based test. Teams correctly identified 71% of all emissions, ranging from 0.20 [0.19, 0.21] metric tons per hour (t/h) to 7.2 [6.8, 7.6] t/h. Three-quarters (75%) of quantified estimates fell within +/- 50% of the metered value, comparable to airplane-based remote sensing technologies. The relatively wide-area Sentinel- 2 and Landsat 8 satellites detected emissions as low as 1.4 [1.3, 1.5, 95% confidence interval] t/h, while GHGSat's targeted system quantified a 0.20 [0.19, 0.21] t/h emission to within 13%. While the fraction of global methane emissions detectable by satellite remains unknown, we estimate that satellite networks could see 19-89% of total oil and natural gas system emissions detected in a recent survey of a high-emitting region.

TI  - Contemporary approaches to the axilla in breast cancer
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past decade, axillary management in breast cancer has fundamentally shifted. The former notion that any degree of axillary nodal involvement warrants axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been challenged. Following publication of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, national trends demonstrated significant reductions in ALND performance. Axillary radiotherapy in lieu of ALND is a consideration for select patients with a positive sentinel lymph node, while ongoing studies are investigating the role of adjuvant regional radiotherapy in women with positive nodes prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Efforts toward de-escalation of axillary surgery continue to evolve, as do the indications for sentinel node biopsy omission in select subsets of patients. This review highlights the recent advances and neoteric approaches to local therapy of the axilla in breast cancer.

TI  - What type of rainforest burnt in the South East Queensland's 2019/20 bushfires and how might this impact biodiversity
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bushfires burnt over 18 million hectares across Australia's east coast, including rainforests, over the spring and summer 2019/2020 period. Rainforest harbours a large percentage of Australia's biodiversity and does not usually burn and therefore understanding the extent and biodiversity implications was a priority. The National Indicative Aggregated Fire Extent Dataset (NIAFED) combined with detailed regional ecosystem (RE) mapping was used to estimate the perimeter and area of each of the burnt rainforest types within South East Queensland (SEQ). Previous biodiversity estimates for each rainforest regional ecosystem type combined with remnant ecosystem mapping data then enabled an assessment of the potential biodiversity impacts of the fires for SEQ rainforest. We found that 12% of the rainforest estate in SEQ was within the burn footprint (29 031 ha) including parts of the UNESCO World Heritage Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. Fifty per cent of the total remnant area of the Endangered rainforest type, semi-evergreen vine thicket on Mesozoic to Proterozoic igneous rocks (RE: 12.12.17) was potentially burnt. This rainforest type has high diversity. Burn severity analysis found that the rainforest primarily burnt with low severity, however, there were patches of high severity. Accuracy assessment of severity mapping resulted in a weak correlation (0.57) due to the underestimation of ground fires in rainforest. As expected, we found rainforest-suppressed fires. However, in contrast to expectations, we found the wettest rainforest types and putative past refugia burnt more than other rainforest types. These results suggest that given drought conditions any rainforest could burn, and we can expect that the area of rainforest will contract if both incidences of drought and wildfires increase due to climate change.

TI  - Assessing the vulnerability of grasslands in Gannan of China under the dual effects of climate change and human activities
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities are two major drivers of grasslands degradation. Understanding the vulnerability of grasslands to both drives is of great importance for grassland conservation. This research established a vulnerability assessment model with historical and future the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which was predicted by an optimized spatiotemporal NDVI prediction model, and then examined the vulnerability of grasslands under climate change and human activities in Gannan Prefecture on the north-eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our results show that Gannan grasslands would show a vulnerability pattern of higher in the west and lower in the east under climate change and human activities. More than 46 % and 17 % of the region will become highly and medium vulnerable areas in the future, mainly concentrated in Maqu, Luqu and Xiahe counties in the west, southwest and northwest of Gannan. Specifically, the vulnerability is the lowest under the future climate scenario of moderate carbon emissions (i.e. RCP 4.5). Land use types such as forest land, unutilized land and cultivated land conversion to grassland could partially offset the vulnerability mainly caused climate change, while the conversion of grassland to unutilized land, forest land and cultivated land would increase the vulnerability of grassland. Our results would help to deepen the understanding of the patterns and main drivers of Gannan grasslands vulnerability under the impacts of climate change and human activities, and provide theoretical basis for the development of corresponding grassland management policies.

TI  - Symptom cluster trajectories and sentinel symptoms during the first cycle of chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To investigate symptom severity, symptom cluster trajectories and sentinel symptoms during chemo-therapy cycle 1 in patients with lung cancer. Methods: Patients with lung cancer were recruited to complete the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and First Appearance of Symptoms Time Sheet daily during the first week of chemotherapy cycle 1. Latent class growth analysis was performed to examine symptom cluster trajectories. The Apriori algorithm combined with the time of the first appearance of symptoms after chemotherapy was used to determine the sentinel symptoms of each symptom cluster. Results: A total of 175 lung cancer patients participated in the study. Five symptom clusters were identified: class 1 (difficulty remembering-numbness-hemoptysis-weight loss), class 2 (cough-expectoration-chest tightness -shortness of breath), class 3 (nausea-sleep disturbance-drowsiness-constipation), class 4 (pain-distress-dry mouth-sadness-vomiting), class 5 (fatigue-lack of appetite). Sentinel symptoms were found to be cough (class 2) and fatigue (class 5), while none were found for other symptom clusters. Conclusion: The trajectories of five symptom clusters were observed during the first week of chemotherapy cycle 1 and the sentinel symptoms of each cluster were explored. The study has important significance for the effective management of symptoms and the quality of nursing care for patients. At the same time, alleviating sentinel symptoms may reduce the severity of the whole symptom cluster, reducing medical resources and improving quality of life for lung cancer patients.

TI  - Clinical features and severe outcome predictors of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection among hospitalized patients: results from Egypt severe acute respiratory infections sentinel surveillance, 2021-2022
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundCOVID-19 vaccines are effective against infections and outcomes; however, breakthrough infections (VBT) are increasingly reported, possibly due to waning of vaccine-induced immunity or emerging variants. Most studies have focused on determining VBT rate based on antibody levels. This study aims at describing clinical features, risks, time trends, and outcomes of COVID-19 VBT among hospitalized patients in Egypt.MethodsData of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients hospitalized in 16 hospitals was obtained from the severe acute respiratory infections surveillance database, September 2021-April 2022. Data includes patients' demographics, clinical picture, and outcomes. Descriptive analysis was performed and patients with VBT were compared to not fully vaccinated (UPV). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Epi Info7 with a significance level < 0.05 to identify VBT risk factors.ResultsOverall, 1,297 patients enrolled, their mean age 56.7 +/- 17.0 years, 41.5% were males, 64.7% received inactivated, 25.% viral vector, and 7.7% mRNA vaccine. VBT was identified in 156(12.0%) patients with an increasing trend over time. VBT significantly was higher in (16-35 years) age, males, in those who received inactivated vaccine compared to corresponding groups of UPV (14.1 vs. 9.0%, p < 0.05 and 57.1 vs. 39.4%, p < 0.001 and 64.7 vs. 45.1, p < 0.01 respectively). Whereas receiving mRNA vaccine was significantly protective against VBT (7.7 vs. 21.6%, p < 001). VBT patients tend to have shorter hospital stays and lower case fatality (mean hospital days = 6.6 +/- 5.5 vs. 7.9 +/- 5.9, p < 0.01 and CFR = 28.2 vs. 33.1, p < 0.01 respectively). MVA identified younger ages, male gender, and inactivated vaccines as risks for VBT.ConclusionThe study indicated that COVID-19 vaccines significantly reduce hospital days and fatality. VBT trend is on the rise and males, young ages, and inactivated vaccine receivers are at higher risk. Caution regarding relaxation of personal preventive measures in areas with higher or increasing incidences of COVID-19, particularly for the at-risk group even if they are vaccinated. The vaccination strategy should be revised to reduce VBT rate and increase vaccine effectiveness.

TI  - Paget disease of the breast with underlying invasive ductal cancer in neurofibromatosis type 1: a case report
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neurofibromatoses ( NFs) are a group of rare autosomal dominant genetic disorders characterized by tumors growing in the nervous system. Neurofibromas, which are soft noncancerous tumors, have been found on or under the skin in patients with NF1. Furthermore, patients with NF1 are susceptible to various cancers, including breast cancer. Neurofibromas under the skin of the breast can delay the diagnosis of breast cancer, which severely reduces life expectancy. Paget disease of the breast (PDB) is a rare type of breast cancer that causes eczema-like changes of the nipple.Case Description: Here, we present a rare case of a 50-year-old woman who was diagnosed with NF1 and an invasive ductal breast carcinoma accompanied by PDB. The patient underwent mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant therapies, including chemotherapy, anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy, and endocrine therapy. No local recurrence or distance metastasis was found at 3 years of follow-up.Conclusions: NF1 patients aged <50 years have a higher risk of breast cancer and a worse prognosis. Moreover, neurofibroma in the breast can easily mask signs of breast cancers. Therefore, early breast cancer screening is crucial for patients with NF1. Radiotherapy should be avoided because of potential carcinogenicity to the neurofibromas. Mastectomy, and not breast-conserving surgery, is the optimal choice. Patients should undergo regular postoperative follow-up so that contralateral breast cancer can be detected

TI  - Implementation of melanoma guidelines in the multidisciplinary setting: A qualitative analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Data suggest variation in utilization of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) and adjuvant systemic therapy (AT) for sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma. We aimed to explore how clinicians consider multidisciplinary treatment options.Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews of surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, and otolaryngologists to produce a thematic analysis.Results: Participants (n = 26) described melanoma care as inherently "multidisciplinary," noting the importance of conversations facilitated by shared clinic days or space. Despite believing that their practice mirrored other clinicians, participants revealed diverging perspectives on CLND and AT. Multidisciplinary care presented challenges for surveillance as surgeons expressed desire to retain ownership of patients but did not feel comfortable overseeing AT needs. Participants questioned the fidelity of nodal ultrasounds, noted redundancy in their roles, and described a "surveillance burden" for patients.Conclusion: Opportunities exist to improve multidisciplinary melanoma care through broader consensus of how to translate emerging data into patient care and delineating surveillance roles.

TI  - WetSpass to model the components of hydrologic cycle in the big watershed of Khafr affected by land use
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present research, the hydrologic cycle in the big watershed of Khafr (1108.05 km(2)), Fars province, Iran, affected by land use in a 9-year period (2009-2017) was investigated. The flow of water and the trends of temperature (6.1-27.2 degrees C) and rainfall (300-600 mm) (1967-2018) were investigated using Mann-Kendall and Sen's tests. The hydrologic cycle was investigated using 22 observing wells and was subsequently simulated using the WetSpass (Water and Energy Transfer between Soil, Plants and Atmosphere under quasi Steady State) model in which the input variables including climate, potential evapotranspiration, soil layer, ground water level, topography, slope and land use were integrated in ArcView GIS maps. The land use in the region was illustrated by Landsat, and was processed by ENVI for the production of the final maps for use in the model. The output variables of the model were plant cover, land use, flooding pathways, rain-harvesting, rainfall-runoff, and charging and discharging of groundwater level. The maximum total yearly runoff of 724 mm, cold season of 632 mm and warm season of 250 mm were estimated by the model. The maximum of yearly groundwater charging of 91 mm, discharge (warm season) of 25 mm and yearly rain-harvesting of 145 mm were also estimated by the model. The WetSpass model simulated the hydrologic cycle in the region with a high accuracy. If land use is managed properly in the region, it would be possible to increase the efficiency of water sources.

TI  - Competing effects of vegetation on summer temperature in North Korea
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation reduction could affect regional climate by perturbing the surface energy and moisture balances via changes in albedo and evapotranspiration. However, it is unknown whether vegetation effects on climate occur in North Korea, where a severe reduction in forest cover has been observed. This study aimed to identify the biogeophysical processes in vegetation and climate interactions in North Korea, using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the AVHRR GIMMS NDVI3g and the climate reanalysis data from the ERA5-Land over the period of 1982?2015. As per the NDVI regression trend results, the highest rates of decreasing NDVI (10-20%/decade) were detected in the western region of North Korea during the summer. Based on the detrended correlation analysis of NDVI with surface energy variables at each grid point, including solar radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, Bowen ratio, and temperature, we identified the distinct biogeophysical effects of vegetation between the western and northern regions of North Korea. In the western (northern) region, a cooling (warming) effect of vegetation on the local temperature was approximately by 0.2-0.3 degrees C/0.1 NDVI during the summer. The competitive biogeophysical effects were induced by the geographical factors of relatively lower (higher) values of NDVI, altitude, and latitude in the western (northern) region. Particularly, if the current rate of deforestation continues, the increasing summer temperature would be up to 0.5 degrees C by the end of this century in the western region of North Korea, where large-scale human-induced forest loss has been observed. Thus, we urgently suggest that sustainable management and restoration of forests are needed in North Korea, which is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change now and in the future.

TI  - Large-scale agricultural burning and cardiorespiratory emergency department visits in the US state of Kansas
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPrescribed agricultural burning is a common land management practice, but little is known about the health effects from the resulting smoke exposure.ObjectiveTo examine the association between smoke from prescribed burning and cardiorespiratory outcomes in the U.S. state of Kansas.MethodsWe analyzed a zip code-level, daily time series of primary cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits for February-May (months when prescribed burning is common in Kansas) in the years 2009-2011 (n = 109,220). Given limited monitoring data, we formulated a measure of smoke exposure using non-traditional datasets, including fire radiative power and locational attributes from remote sensing data sources. We then assigned a population-weighted potential smoke impact factor (PSIF) to each zip code, based on fire intensity, smoke transport, and fire proximity. We used Poisson generalized linear models to estimate the association between PSIF on the same day and in the past 3 days and asthma, respiratory including asthma, and cardiovascular ED visits.ResultsDuring the study period, prescribed burning took place on approximately 8 million acres in Kansas. Same-day PSIF was associated with a 7% increase in the rate of asthma ED visits when adjusting for month, year, zip code, meteorology, day of week, holidays, and correlation within zip codes (rate ratio [RR]: 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.13). Same-day PSIF was not associated with a combined outcome of respiratory ED visits (RR [95% CI]: 0.99 [0.97, 1.02]), or cardiovascular ED visits (RR [95% CI]: 1.01 [0.98, 1.04]). There was no consistent association between PSIF during the past 3 days and any of the outcomes.SignificanceThese results suggest an association between smoke exposure and asthma ED visits on the same day. Elucidating these associations will help guide public health programs that address population-level exposure to smoke from prescribed burning.

TI  - Using temporal variability of land surface temperature and normalized vegetation index to estimate soil moisture condition on forest areas by means of remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) against Vegetation Index (VI) scatterplot is a base concept of Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) which is a widely used drought index taking into account evaporation over heterogenic area. The main advantage of using TVDI is that it reflects rather a soil moisture conditions than volumetric soil moisture itself. This is particularly useful when the aim of conducting research is to assess water availability for plants rather than volumetric soil moisture at some depth. Results that have been obtained so far using indices based on LST-VI scatterplot proved their effectiveness in meadows, pastures or crops but were not satisfactory enough over forest areas. An important limitation of using TVDI is a need to collect LST and VI data from heterogenic areas, to provide different soil moisture conditions which is often difficult to ensure.In this paper, we proposed a new approach to the TVDI calculation method in which we use temporal vari-ability of soil moisture conditions (shown in different satellite images of the same area) instead of their spatial heterogeneity.Calculations were conducted over the forest area in Tuczno Poland. To calculate the temporal TVDI model 4 Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS scenes were used, and calculation was performed in Python 3 using open-source packages. The average moisture conditions of each chosen scene were validated using field data, namely evapotranspira-tion determined from an eddy covariance.

TI  - Projective Psychological Warfare (PPW): an analysis of Hamas Hebrew videoclips as part of its propaganda campaign against Israel (2007-2014)
T2  - MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Hamas invests vast resources in propaganda for a number of diverse audiences, harnessing the communications channels it operates on different media platforms. Over the course of the many years of the Israel-Hamas confrontation, the organization has waged psychological warfare and an ongoing propaganda war against Israeli society, seeking to influence Israelis' perceptions and feelings. However, there is reason to doubt the effectiveness of this activity. This essay examines Hamas's psychological warfare activities by analyzing videoclips the organization produced with content in Hebrew, clearly designed for an Israeli audience. Based on an in-depth analysis of the videoclips' contents, both textual and visual, Hamas's activity may be defined as Projective Psychological Warfare (PPW), that is, psychological warfare that reflects the beliefs and feelings of the entity operating it rather than targeting its messages to the culture and worldview of its target audience. It is in light of this phenomenon that we seek to explain the inefficacy of Hamas's psychological warfare against Israel.

TI  - Benefits of fully focused SAR altimetry to coastal wave height estimates: A case study in the North Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the three geophysical variables significant wave height (SWH), sea surface height, and wind speed from satellite altimetry continues to be challenging in the coastal zone because the received radar echoes exhibit significant interference from strongly reflective targets such as sandbanks, sheltered bays, ships etc. Fully focused SAR (FF-SAR) processing exhibits a theoretical along-track resolution of up to less than half a metre. This suggests that the application of FF-SAR altimetry might give potential gains over unfocused SAR (UF-SAR) altimetry to resolve and mitigate small-scale interferers in the along-track direction to improve the accuracy and precision of the geophysical estimates.The objective of this study is to assess the applicability of FF-SAR-processed Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (S6-MF) coastal altimetry data to obtain SWH estimates as close as possible to the coast.We have developed a multi-mission FF-SAR processor and applied the coastal retracking algorithm CORALv2 to estimate SWH. We assess different FF-SAR and UF-SAR processing configurations, as well as the baseline Level-2 product from EUMETSAT, by comparison with the coastal, high-resolution SWAN-Kuststrook wave model from the Deltares RWsOS North Sea operational forecasting system. This includes the evaluation of the correlation, the median offset, and the percentage of cycles with high correlation as a function of distance to the nearest coastline. Moreover, we analyse the number of valid records and the L2 noise of the records. The case study comprises five coastal crossings of S6-MF that are located along the Dutch coast and the German coast along the East Frisian Islands in the North Sea.We observe that accurate and precise SWH records can be estimated in the nearshore zone within 1-3 km from the coast using satellite SAR altimetry. We find that the FF-SAR-processed dataset with a Level-1b posting rate of 140 Hz shows the greatest similarity with the wave model. We achieve a correlation of similar to 0.8 at 80% of valid records and a gain in precision of up to 29% of FF-SAR vs UF-SAR for 1-3 km from the coast. FF-SAR shows, for all cycles, a high correlation of greater than or equal to 0.8 for 1-3 km from the coast. We estimate the decay of SWH from offshore at 30 km to up to 1 km from the coast to amount to 26.4% +/- 3.1%.

TI  - Views on increased federal access to state and local National Syndromic Surveillance Program data: a nominal group technique study with state and local epidemiologists
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundUS public health authorities use syndromic surveillance to monitor and detect public health threats, conditions, and trends in near real-time. Nearly all US jurisdictions that conduct syndromic surveillance send their data to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), operated by the US. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, current data sharing agreements limit federal access to state and local NSSP data to only multi-state regional aggregations. This limitation was a significant challenge for the national response to COVID-19. This study seeks to understand state and local epidemiologists' views on increased federal access to state NSSP data and identify policy opportunities for public health data modernization.MethodsIn September 2021, we used a virtual, modified nominal group technique with twenty regionally diverse epidemiologists in leadership positions and three individuals representing national public health organizations. Participants individually generated ideas on benefits, concerns, and policy opportunities relating to increased federal access to state and local NSSP data. In small groups, participants clarified and grouped the ideas into broader themes with the assistance of the research team. An web-based survey was used to evaluate and rank the themes using five-point Likert importance questions, top-3 ranking questions, and open-ended response questions.ResultsParticipants identified five benefit themes for increased federal access to jurisdictional NSSP data, with the most important being improved cross-jurisdiction collaboration (mean Likert = 4.53) and surveillance practice (4.07). Participants identified nine concern themes, with the most important concerns being federal actors using jurisdictional data without notice (4.60) and misinterpretation of data (4.53). Participants identified eleven policy opportunities, with the most important being involving state and local partners in analysis (4.93) and developing communication protocols (4.53).ConclusionThese findings identify barriers and opportunities to federal-state-local collaboration critical to current data modernization efforts. Syndromic surveillance considerations warrant data-sharing caution. However, identified policy opportunities share congruence with existing legal agreements, suggesting that syndromic partners are closer to agreement than they might realize. Moreover, several policy opportunities (i.e., including state and local partners in data analysis and developing communication protocols) received consensus support and provide a promising path forward.

TI  - Detection of Crevasses in Siachen Glacier Using Remote Sensing Satellite Imageries
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Snow covered crevasses in the Siachen glacier (Karakoram Range) cause great danger during glacier movement, and the knowledge of their spatial distribution is important for the safe travel. In the present study, crevasses in the Siachen glacier have been detected and further categorized as permanent open/hidden and seasonal open/hidden using a combination of optical (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and microwave (ALOS-2) satellite data. The study is carried out for the year 2018. Initially, the locations of crevasses are manually marked using ALOS-2 data and further, their categorization in open and hidden is done using Sentinel-2 data. Apart from manual marking, the band ratio method is applied on Landsat-8 data to detect the permanent open crevasses in an automatic manner. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) technique has also been successfully attempted for the automatic classification of the crevasse and non-crevasse zones. The open crevasse locations using band ratioing are compared with manually marked and a good correlation is found having an accuracy of similar to 93%. A total of 140 crevasse zones have been found within the study area, with 32% as permanent open, 29% as permanent hidden, and 39% as seasonal open/hidden. Manual digitization is done for estimating crevasse dimension (length and width) as this is important input required before the start of any movement. The study reveals that the highly varying nature of crevasses in terms of changes from hidden to open in lower altitude regions of the glacier is mainly observed between July and September. The present methodology of crevasse detection and categorization leads to crevasse information system, which will be used in future to monitor the opening and closing of crevasses in the Siachen glacier on regular basis.

TI  - The expansion of rainfed grain production can generate spontaneous hydrological changes that reduce climate sensitivity
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As global warming intensifies climatic extremes, the need to understand their effects on farming systems, particularly under rainfed conditions, grows. During the last three decades the Argentine Pampas, a major global grain exporter, hosted an unprecedented expansion of cultivation under unirrigated and undrained conditions. Simultaneously, the extreme flatness and lack of water infrastructure favored groundwater level raises where agriculture expanded. However, the effect of climate extremes and elevated water tables buffering droughts but increasing flooding risk on the sensitivity of regional grain production remains unknown. Based on agronomic, weather, water table, and remote sensing data, we analyzed the production response to dry, wet, and flooded periods over the last 35 years, and to the ongoing water table raises during the last 15 years, focusing on sown and effective harvested area (harvested/sown area) and yield. Soybean and maize production increased 5.9 and 3.3-fold, respectively, as a result of area and yield growths. On average, droughts decreased production (-25 % for soybean and -14 % for maize) and wet periods increased it (+14 % for soybean and +17 % for maize) through their effects on yields and effective harvested area. Floods reduced production (-8 % for soybean and -10 % for maize) by decreasing sown and effective harvested area, leaving yields unaffected. As water tables rose, a positive yield effect during drought was detected, with counties with shallow water tables (< 3 m depth) halving yield cuts during dry years. Lacking water infrastructure, this South American grain belt is currently matching the annual production variability levels observed under intense irrigation and drainage in North America. The unexpected water table level raises of the Pampas had an overall positive effect on grain production, with flood disruptions being more than compensated by drought buffering. This balance may change in the future, calling for a deeper understanding of these complex relationships between climate, hydrology and agriculture.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To characterize the prevalence and genomic epidemiology of Vibrio parahaemolyticus from acute diarrheal patients in Shenzhen City from 2013 to 2021. Methods: Based on the Shenzhen Infectious Diarrhea Surveillance System, acute diarrheal patients were actively monitored in sentinel hospitals from 2013 to 2021. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates was performed, and the genomic population structure, serotypes, virulence genes and multilocus sequence typing were analyzed. Outbreak clusters from 2019 to 2021 were explored based on single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis. Results: A total of 48 623 acute diarrhea cases were monitored in 15 sentinel hospitals from 2013 to 2021, and 1 135 Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains were isolated, with a positive isolation rate of 2.3%. Qualified whole-genome sequencing data of 852 isolates were obtained. Eighty-nine serotypes, 21 known ST types and 5 new ST types were identified by sequence analysis, and 93.2% of strains were detected with toxin profile of tdh+trh-. 8 clonal groups (CGs) were captured, with CG3 as the absolute predominance, followed by CG189. The CG3 group was dominated by O3:K6 serotype and ST3 sequence type, while CG189 group was mainly O4:KUT, O4:K8 serotypes and ST189a and ST189 type. A total of 13 clusters were identified, containing 154 cases. About 30 outbreak clusters with 29 outbreak clusters caused by CG3 strains from 2019 to 2021. Conclusion: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a major pathogen of acute infectious diarrhea in Shenzhen City, with diverse population structures. CG3 and CG189 have been prevalent and predominant in Shenzhen City for a long time. Scattered outbreaks and persistent sources of contamination ignored by traditional methods could be captured by WGS analysis. Tracing the source of epidemic clone groups and taking precise prevention and control measures are expected to significantly reduce the burden of diarrhea diseases caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection in Shenzhen City.

TI  - In-season mapping of rice yield potential at jointing stage using Sentinel-2 images integrated with high-precision UAS data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing regionally applicable models for timely mapping of rice yield potential still faces challenges like the poor accuracy of yield prediction at early stages, and the scale mismatch between ground samples and satellite image pixels. Here, we explored the potential of using high-resolution multispectral images and texture features derived from unmanned aerial system (UAS) to fill these gaps. Rice field experiments were carried out in eastern China during 2017, 2018, and 2020 to acquire UAS (eBee-SQ) and satellite (Sentinel-2) images at jointing stage as well as the rice final yield. High spatial-resolution (HSR, 0.1 m) eBee-SQ images were used to extract both textures and vegetation indices (VIs), the resampled medium spatial-resolution (MSR, 20 m) eBee-SQ and Sentinel-2 images were only used to extract VIs. Firstly, using experimental data from 2017 and 2018, five kinds of yield prediction models at jointing stage were developed with: VIs derived from MSR Sentinel-2 images and linear regression (LR) (least-RMSE = 1.68 t ha(- 1)), [ii] VIs derived from MSR eBee-SQ images and LR (least-RMSE = 1.482 t ha(- 1)), [iii] VIs derived from HSR eBee-SQ images and LR (least-RMSE = 1.371 t ha(- 1)), [iv] VI-texture mixed indices derived from HSR eBee-SQ images and LR (least-RMSE = 1.082 t ha(- 1)), and [v] random forest (RF) regression combining VIs and textures derived from HSR eBee-SQ images (least-RMSE = 0.997 t ha(- 1)). These results showed that yield prediction models developed by both MSR and HSR eBee-SQ data performed better than by MSR Sentinel-2 data. Secondly, using optimal models derived from HSR eBee-SQ data and in-season HSR eBee-SQ data, different farm-scale HSR yield potential maps were generated. These yield maps were processed to Sentinel-2 resolution (20 m) to relate with Sentinel-2 VI for building integrated yield prediction models (IPMs) based on linear and quadratic regression. IPMs were then used to map town-scale rice yield potential by importing Sentinel-2 VI from jointing stage, and were compared with simple yield prediction model (SPM) that directly used Sentinel-2 VI. The independent validation results using yield data collected in 2020 suggested that all of the IPMs were more accurate (RMSE = 0.64 - 0.74 t ha(- 1)) than the SPM (RMSE = 0.96 t ha(- 1)). Besides, IPMs involving eBee-SQ derived textures and VIs showed higher accuracy in mapping yield potential than IPM involving eBee-SQ derived VI only. Overall, this study provides a novel approach to accurately mapping the regional rice yield potential through the integration of satellite and UAS data.

TI  - Land-cover changes and deforestation drivers in the forest landscape of Banmauk township in the Sagaing Region of upper Myanmar
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on the extent of land-cover changes and prediction of probable factors in deforestation based on changes observed from 2000 to 2021 in the forest landscape of Banmauk Township in Myanmar's Sagaing Region. Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery were used to identify seven land-cover classes via supervised random tree classification, and binary logistic regression analysis was used to predict the potential for biophysical and locational factors to affect deforestation. A stratified random sampling method was used to assess the accuracy of the classified maps and to estimate the areas. The study revealed that dense forest coverage decreased from 45.65% in 2000 to 29.01% in 2021, while open forest areas increased from 49.33% to 54.51%. Mining areas exhibited a considerable increase from 0.37% to 5.35%, while settlement and barren/scrub land areas increased from 0.16% to 0.51% and 1.71% to 7.70%, respectively. Agricultural areas slightly increased from 2.11% to 2.33%, while water areas remained almost the same at around 0.60%. Post-classification change detection analysis showed that deforestation occurred mainly through converting forest land to mining and barren/scrub land. The study indicated that lower altitudes and road accessibility are significantly associated with the potential for deforestation.

TI  - Integrated structural, geophysical and remote sensing data for characterizing extensional linked fault systems and related land deformation hazards at Cairo-Suez District, Egypt
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A tiered framework has been developed to map and characterize extensional linked fault systems at Cairo-Suez District, Egypt to better understand seismic and land deformation hazards. As a test site, the present tiered approach is applied on the Cairo-Suez District (CSD), Egypt, which is considered as an active seismogenic zone that encompasses complex deformation settings. Tier 1, which involves outcrop observations and structural mapping, reveals four geometries belonging to soft- and hard-linkage transfer zones (TZs). Considering the mapped TZs, the near-surface heterogeneity is characterized using a 2D-electrical resistivity tomography (2DERT) technique at "tier 2" applying an advanced inversion scheme (AIS). Inversion results of the 2D-ERT profiles indicate a subsurface continuity of the mapped surface geological and structural features including shale smears of fault zones and shale layer distributions. At "tier 2", we particularly identify a highly deformed shale bed of 15-m thick, that accommodate fault slips as indicated by internal gouge zones. We further represent all local hazard factors including slope, drainage density, land use/land cover and displacement maps using the "FuzzyShannon Entropy Model". Overall, our findings show that most of the delineated deformation hazards in the test site are related to hard-linked TZs. At "tier 3", we ultimately provide our recommendation for regional and sitespecific engineering mitigation and to avoid active faults by defining setback-zone buffer (i.e., no build zone) correlated with the local fault activity and near-surface geometry. For Egypt, an economically developing country, this approach represents a major advancement from conventional geologic and geotechnical investigations through introducing a tiered framework for risk-relevant characterization of the extensional linked fault systems to apply adequate procedures/precautions by engineers for urban planning.

TI  - Seasonal forecast of soil moisture over Mediterranean-climate forest catchments using a machine learning approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal forecast of soil moisture at large spatial scale over forested landscape has numerous implications in forest hydrology and bushfire risk planning. Remotely sensed plant response to rainfall, input meteorological forcing, and site-specific landscape attributes were integrated into a data-driven Gradient Boosting Machine Learning (ML) model to forecast summer season (December to February) soil moisture equivalent to those from Australian Water Resource Assessment-Landscape (AWRA-L) at root-zone (0-1 m) and deep (1-6 m) layers of the soil.Multispectral and thermal infrared bands from MODIS (Band 1-12, LST (day, night)) and meteorological forcing for 2000 - 2018 during and prior to winter (before August) and site-specific landscape attributes were used to generate the explanatory input variables to the model. Spatial and temporal forecasting skills of the model were evaluated using two types of cross-validation: two-fold cross-validation by space over the entire period (2000-2018) and two-fold cross-validation by time for all grid cells (2160 cells). In the first method, the model showed a high skill to forecast deep soil moisture (R2 = 0.81, NSE = 0.79, RMSE = 58.01 mm) and root-zone soil moisture (R2 = 0.65, NSE = 0.63, RMSE = 24.34 mm). In comparison, the second evaluation resulted in more accurate forecast deep-soil moisture (R2 = 0.88, NSE = 0.86, RMSE = 47.39 mm) but in lower performance for root-zone soil (R2 = 0.55, NSE = 0.47, RMSE = 29.2 mm). These outcomes have highlighted that the (>80%) variability in summers deep (1-6 m) soil moisture and (>50%) variability in root-zone (0-1 m) soil moisture over forested landscape can be explained at the end of winters. Furthermore, integrating remotely sensed observations has improved the results by showing an enhancement in the RMSE by 22.8-33.3% in the deep (1-6 m) soil moisture and 8.8-14.3% in root-zone (0-1 m) soil moisture.Overall, the integrated system using remotely sensed plant response, climate forcing and machine learning exhibit great potential to forecast summer soil moisture three months ahead in the Mediterranean climates.

TI  - Sentinel event reviews: applications in criminal justice settings
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIME & JUSTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel event reviews were developed in the medical, military, and aviation fields and involve systematic assessment of the processes that resulted in a critical event such as an unexpected death of a patient or an airplane crash. The sentinel event review is intended to identify system weaknesses that resulted in the negative outcome and to inform corrective actions. Sentinel event reviews have rarely been used in the criminal justice system, although recent years have witnessed experimentation in the use of review processes to examine negative outcomes such as domestic violence homicides and drug overdoses. This study examined the development and implementation of sentinel event review processes in three midwestern cities. The sentinel event reviews built upon existing reviews of shooting incidents and extended those reviews through a systematic approach that involved deeper investigation into specific critical incidents. The research involved participant observation, review of the materials related to the sentinel event reviews, and a small number of key actor interviews. The results suggest that the reviews hold promise for informing decision makers on system weaknesses and for improving criminal justice practices. Yet, they also revealed obstacles to effective implementation and utilization of sentinel event reviews in criminal justice settings.

TI  - LANDSAT multispectral image analysis of bedrock exposure rate in highly heterogeneous karst areas through mixed pixel decomposition considering spectral variability
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed pixels and spectral variations commonly occur in images of karst areas because these areas have rugged topography and high surface heterogeneity. Consequently, the bedrock exposure rate cannot be accurately estimated using the existing rock index method based on remote sensing and the fixed endmember mixed pixel decomposition model. In order to solve this problem, using LANDSAT operational land imager/thematic mapper (OLI/TM) images as the data source, this study estimated the bedrock exposure rate based on a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) considering spectral variability. In addition, this approach was compared with existing commonly used methods for estimating bedrock exposure rate. The results show that: (1) GLMM showed the highest performance in estimating bedrock exposure rate, with a total accuracy of 88.05% and a kappa coefficient of 0.845, and the accuracy exceeded 70% for different levels of bedrock exposure rate. However, the total accuracy of other commonly used bedrock exposure methods is was below 66%, being higher only in areas with bedrock exposure rates less than 20% and more than 70%. (2) By applying each method to different terrain scenes, GLMM was found to be more stable than other methods, and the estimated bedrock exposure rate is the closest to the ground reference value with a root mean square error less than 0.093. Other methods, including fully constrained least squares unmixing (FCLSU) and karst bare-rock index (KBRI), have a certain gap in different scenes, and their accuracy is not high. (3) Without any ground reference data, the accuracy of the direct unmixing result of GLMM is very close to that calculated by the regression model, and the accuracy difference among different grades of bedrock exposure rate is less than 5%, thus outperforming the other methods. GLMM can effectively estimate the bedrock exposure rate at different times using different data. Therefore, GLMM has great potential in extracting rocky desertification information in karst areas. It can also be a reference method for the rapid, accurate, and long-term evaluation of rocky desertification in karst areas.

TI  - Mangrove plantation suitability mapping by integrating multi criteria decision making geospatial approach and remote sensing data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Mangroves are woody plant communities that appear in tropical and subtropical regions, mainly in intertidal zones along the coastlines. Despite their considerable benefits to humans and the surrounding environment, their existence is threatened by anthropogenic activities and natural drivers. Accordingly, it is vital to conduct efficient efforts to increase mangrove plantations by identifying suitable locations. These efforts are required to support conservation and plantation practices and lower the mortality rate of seedlings. Therefore, identifying ecologically potential areas for plantation practices is mandatory to ensure a higher success rate. This study aimed to identify suitable locations for mangrove plantations along the southern coastal frontiers of Hormozgan, Iran. To this end, we applied a hybrid Fuzzy-DEMATEL-ANP (FDANP) model as a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach to determine the relative importance of different criteria, combined with geospatial and remote sensing data. In this regard, ten relevant sources of environmental criteria, including meteorological, topographical, and geomorphological, were used in the modeling. The statistical evaluation demonstrated the high potential of the developed approach for suitable location identification. Based on the final results, 6.10% and 20.80% of the study area were classified as very-high suitable and very-low suitable areas. The obtained values can elucidate the path for decision-makers and managers for better conservation and plantation planning. Moreover, the utility of charge-free remote sensing data allows cost-effective implementation of such an approach for other regions by interested researchers and governing organizations.

TI  - A comparative analysis of grid-based and object-based modeling approaches for poplar forest growing stock volume estimation in plain regions using airborne LIDAR data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Poplar (PopulusL.) is one of the most widely distributed tree species planted in the plains of China and plays an important role in wood products and ecological services. Accurate estimation of poplar Growing Stock Volume (GSV) is crucial for better understanding the ecological functions and economic values in plain regions. However, the striped distribution feature of poplar forests in plain regions makes traditional grid-based GSV modeling methods highly uncertain. This research took Lixin County and Yongqiao District as case studies to examine the advantages of using object-based GSV modeling approach over the traditional grid-based approaches for poplar GSV estimation. The canopy height variables and density variables were extracted from airborne LIDAR-derived Canopy Height Model (CHM) data through different grid sizes and segmentation unit for constructing the poplar GSV estimation models using the linear regression. The results indicate that (1) Significantly linear relationships exist between GSV and height percentile variables; (2) The estimation accuracy in Lixin can be effectively improved by incorporating the CHM density variables into height variables, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing from 0.46 to 0.71 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) decreasing from 20.23 to 14.94 m(3)/ha when a grid-based approach was implemented at grid size of 26 m by 26 m (plot size). However, CHM density variables have no effect on estimation modeling in Yongqiao district. The patch sizes and shapes considerably affect the selection of modeling variables and accuracy of modeling prediction; (3) The object-based mapping approach outperforms the grid-based approach in solving the mixed plot problem. This is especially valuable in the study areas with striped forest distribution. This study shows that differences in poplar stand structure affect the selection of modeling variables and GSV modeling performance, and an object-based modeling approach is recommended for GSV estimation in the plain areas.

TI  - Field maturity detection via interferometric synthetic aperture radar images time-series: a case study for maize crop
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting the field maturity moment for maize (Zea mays L.) crop represents a relevant point to estimate its optimal harvest time. Knowing the optimal harvest time (defined by grain moisture content) at the end of the crop season is a major concern for maize farmers, as it could lead to substantial economic losses if not harvested on time. For this crop, optimal harvest time usually occurs 3-4 weeks after field maturity, depending on weather conditions. Therefore, this study focused on the interferometric coherence time-series analysis at the end of the maize crop season, to indirectly estimate the field maturity. For such purpose, a coherence object-based change detection method using Sentinel-1 SAR images was developed aiming to estimate the potential field maturity time. These estimations were assessed using an independent data set of field maturity dates obtained through field inspection and crop growth modelling. The technique was tested over 52 fields in the northwest region of Kansas, United States, with a detection rate of 80%, and a field maturity estimation error of 10 days (assessed with the root mean square error). The proposed method constitutes a promising approach to estimating the maize field maturity in near-real time, determining the field harvest readiness, and developing a decision support tool to assist farmers in prioritizing the allocation of fields at harvest time.

TI  - Performance evaluation of convolution neural networks in canopy height estimation using sentinel 2 data, application to Thailand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Electric shorting induced by tall vegetation is one of the major hazards affecting power transmission lines extending through rural regions and rough terrain for tens of kilometres. This raises the need for an accurate, reliable, and cost-effective approach for continuous monitoring of canopy heights. This paper proposes and evaluates two deep convolution neural network (CNN) variants based on Seg-Net and Res-Net architectures, characterized by their small number of trainable weights (nearly 800,000) while maintaining high estimation accuracy. The proposed models utilize the freely available data from Sentinel-2, and a digital surface model to estimate forest canopy heights with high accuracy and a spatial resolution of 10 metres. Various factors affect canopy height estimation, including topography signature, dataset diversity, input layers, and model structure. The proposed models are applied separately to two powerline regions located in the northern and southern parts of Thailand. The application results show that the proposed Encoder-Decoder CNN Seg-Net model presents an average mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination R 2 of 1.38 m, 1.85 m, and 0.87, respectively, and is nearly 4.8 times faster than the CNN Res-Net model in conversion. These results prove the proposed model's capability of estimating and monitoring canopy heights with high accuracy and fine spatial resolution.

TI  - Feasibility of active handheld NDVI sensors for monitoring lichen ground cover
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices are corner stones in vegetation monitoring. However, previous field studies on lichens and NDVI have been based on passive sensors. Active handheld sensors, with their own light sources, enables high -precision monitoring under variable ambient conditions. We investigated the use of handheld sensor NDVI for monitoring pale lichen cover across three study sites from boreal heathlands to High Arctic tundra (62-79 degrees N), and compared it with Sentinel-2 satellite NDVI. NDVI decreased with increasing cover of pale lichens but the correlation between active and satellite NDVI varied between areas. NDVI values declined with lichen cover and ranged from 0.4-0.18 when lichen cover was above 40%. Active ground measurements of NDVI explained 81% of the variation in the satellite NDVI values in Svalbard (High Arctic), while the relationships were lower (similar to 30% explained variation) in boreal regions (Troms-Finnmark and Roros). We show that active sensors are feasible for extracting information from lichen-dominated vegetation.

TI  - On the temporal mismatch between in-situ and satellite-derived spring phenology of European beech forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest phenology plays a key role in the global terrestrial ecosystem influencing a range of ecosystem processes such as the annual carbon uptake period, and many food webs and changes in their timing and progression. The timing of the start of the phenology season has been successfully determined at a range of scales, from the individual tree by in situ observations to landscape and continental scales by using remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs). The spatial resolution of satellites is much coarser than traditional methods, creating a gap between space-borne and actual field observations, which brings limitations to phenological research at the ecosystem level. Several unconsidered methodological and observational-related limitations may lead to misinterpretation of the timing of the satellite-derived signals. The aim of this study is therefore to clarify the meaning of a set of spring phenology metrics derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series in beech forests distributed across Europe with respect to PEP725 in situ observations, from 2003 to 2020. To this aim, we (i) tested the differences between remotely sensed and in situ start-of-season (SOS) metrics and (ii) quantified the influence of latitude, elevation, temperature, and precipitation on such differences. Results demonstrated that there is a clear temporal gradient among the different SOS metrics, all of them occurring prior to the in situ observations. Furthermore, latitude and temperatures proved to be the main factors guiding the differences between remotely sensed and in situ SOS metrics. Evidence from this study may help in recognizing the actual meaning of what we see by means of remotely sensed phenology metrics. In this perspective, field observations are crucial in understanding phenology events and provide a reference base. Satellite data, on the other hand, complement field observations by filling in gaps in spatial and temporal coverage, thus enhancing the overall understanding.

TI  - Almond cultivar identification using machine learning classifiers applied to UAV-based multispectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Portugal, almonds are a very important crop, due to their nutritional properties. In the northeastern part of the country, the almond sector has endured over time, with strong cultural traditions and key economic significance. In these areas, several cultivars are used. In effect, the presence of various almond cultivars implies differentiated management in irrigation, disease control, pruning system, and harvest planning. Therefore, cultivar classification is essential over large agricultural areas. Over the last decades, remote-sensing data have led to important breakthroughs in the classification of different cultivars for several crops. Nonetheless, for almonds, studies are incipient. Thus, this study aims to fill this knowledge gap and explore the classification of almond cultivars in an almond orchard. High-resolution multispectral data were acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Vegetation indices (VIs) and tree structural parameters were, subsequently, estimated. To obtain an accurate cultivar identification, four machine learning classifiers, such as K-nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were applied and optimized through the fine-tuning process. The accuracy of machine learning classifiers was analysed. SVM and RF performed best with OAs of 76% and 74% using VIs and spectral bands (GREEN, GRVI, GN, REN, ClRE). Adding the canopy height model (CHM) improved performance, with RF and XGBoost having OAs of 88% and 84%. kNN performed worst with an OA of 73% using only VIs and spectral bands, 80% with VIs, spectral bands and CHM, and 93% with VIs, CHM, and tree crown area (TCA). The best performance was achieved by RF and XGBoost with OAs of 99% using VIs, CHM, and TCA. These results demonstrate the importance of the feature selection process. Moreover, this study reveals the feasibility of remote-sensing data and machine learning classifiers in the classification of almond cultivars.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of snow cover in the Tien Shan, China from 2000 to 2019 based on cloud-free data supported by Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent cloud cover leads to significant problems in estimating snow distribution based on remote-sensing observations, especially in mountainous regions. Supported by Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-gap filling framework using the cubic spline interpolation method was proposed to generate cloud-free data based on the MODIS snow cover dataset. The framework is validated in the Chinese Tien Shan region with in-site snow depth observations, demonstrating good agreement. Subsequently, the spatio-temporal patterns and trends of snow cover in Chinese Tien Shan for nearly 20 years were identified using temporal interpolated snow cover data. The results show that (1) the interpolated images generated by the framework effectively fill the invalid value caused by cloud cover and have significant consistency with the snow depth data from gauges (with the Snow Cover Days (SCD) score of 0.89 and the correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.80); (2) compared with linear interpolation, the interpolated snow cover images generated based on cubic spline method have higher CC with snow depth data from gauges, reflecting higher data reliability; and (3) the snow cover over Chinese Tien Shan demonstrated remarkable periodicity and different spatial distribution, and it had an apparent decreasing trend in the southeastern region of Chinese Tien Shan.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution of alpine shrubs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrubs are typical vegetation on the Qinghai - Tibet Plateau, and their spatial distribution pattern is crucial for understanding the regional ecological environment. Existing global land cover products cannot represent shrubs well in this area, and the relationship between shrubs and the corresponding environmental factors is still unclear. In this study, using the Dogxung Zangbo River Basin as an example, Sentinel-2 images were applied to estimate the regional shrub fraction image, using the random forest regression model trained with samples generated from fine-resolution Jilin-1 images. The estimated shrub fraction image was further analysed using an elevation dataset to explore the impact of topography on the spatial distribution of shrubs. The results showed that using Sentinel-2 images acquired in both plant growing and non-growing seasons can better distinguish shrubs from grass than using only one season of data, and the coefficient of determination and root-mean-square error derived from this model were 0.821 and 0.087, respectively. The shrub distribution was strongly correlated with topography. In the study area, areas with a southeast or south orientation and large slope are more suitable for shrub growth.

TI  - Resilience through Disclosure and Meaning Making in Qoheleth and the Babylonian Theodicy
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study rereads Qoheleth and the Babylonian Theodicy through a trauma lens as opposed to the generic lens of speculative wisdom encompassing retributive justice, retribution theology, and the deed-consequence nexus and their consequent view of the gods'/God's justice. According to retribution theology, actions correlate appropriately to consequences; however, in light of their suffering and resilience, both authors are disillusioned, struggling to make sense of life's predicaments despite their religiosity and placating of the deity, as they also resist retribution theology. Rereading Qoheleth and the Babylonian Theodicy through a trauma lens shows that both sufferers seek answers and cope with suffering similarly to modern readers. This study acknowledges the use and limits of retribution theology operating within the Hebrew and Mesopotamian worldview to illustrate how these texts resist retributive justice. However, we also illustrate how the collective and individual aspects of trauma theory transcend ethic, cultural, epochal, and geographical boundaries. Furthermore, the juxtaposed ancient texts demonstrate how to cope with traumatic life experiences outside the confines of retributive justice by making meaning of self and others in the world and exhibiting resilience through effective coping strategies. Ultimately, Qoheleth affirms that while fearing God is right, navigating trauma includes enjoying God's simple gifts such as food, wine, work, and a spouse for momentary relief. The Babylonian Theodicy sufferer makes meaning and develops resiliency through self-disclosure to friends and acceptance.

TI  - Enterprise version 8 total column ozone algorithm (EV8TOz) development and applications on multiple sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We expand the Version 8 Total Column Ozone algorithm (V8TOz) into an Enterprise V8TOz (EV8TOz), which provides a unique platform accommodating a variety of UV/Visible satellite measurements for total ozone (TOz) estimation. A satellite-oriented flexible dynamic input data space applicable to any existing and upcoming satellite UV/Visible sensor measurements is developed in EV8TOz. The EV8TOz also provides flexible choices of band adjustment for either conducting sensor original single band or combined broad band retrievals, and includes options for introducing soft calibration adjustments. The applications of EV8TOz to the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) aboard Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) and NOAA-20 (N20), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) aboard Meteorological Operational satellite (Metop)-B and MetOp-C and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) are demonstrated. As far as we know, it is the first time TROPOMI ozone has been estimated and soft-calibrated with this limited wavelength channels and table lookup technique for the V8TOz. Statistical analyses show that EV8TOz estimated global TOz with measurements from these five sensors on the same day have less than +/- 2% differences relative to the NASA NPP retrievals.

TI  - Effects of socio-ecological factors on the pastoralists-farmers conflicts in Nigeria's Mid-Benue Trough
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the effects of socio-ecological factors on the pastoralists-farmers conflicts in Nigeria's Mid-Benue trough from the year 2000-2020. To understand the nexus of climate and land-use change, population density, economic development and conflicts, the study used conflict data and analyzed satellite data of Land Surface Temperature (LST) as a proxy for climate change, and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) data. Also, Night Time Light (NTL) which was a proxy for economic development, as well as population density data were used. The data were analyzed through multiple spatial analyses such as classification and reclassification to distinguish feature classes and overlays to show probable relationships. The conflict data was overlaid on the other datasets and the events that occurred within each data class were identified, while the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) were used to establish effects. Results showed that 87 percent of the conflicts occurred in areas with high LST (>30 degrees C) which increased by 10 percent, and 63 percent occurred in croplands which increased the most (25.7 percent). As well, 79.3 percent of the conflicts occurred in low population density areas (3-8 persons per 30 m2) and 77.3 percent in the lowest NTL radiance class (0-8 W/m2-sr). Further, the OLS and GWR analyses revealed that socio-ecological factors significantly influence the lethality of pastoralist-farmers conflicts in the Mid-Benue Trough as the three exploratory variables (climate change, economic development and population density) were statistically significant. The study recommends location-specific programs, policies and interventions to manage the conflicts based on deductions from the spatial analyses.

TI  - Unsupervised annual change detection from optical-SAR fused satellite image time-series using 3D-CAE
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images are widely used for change detection in various applications, like, agricultural and forest cover area monitoring and management, urban planning, disaster management etc. which require prior information about the timeline of changes. However, it is very challenging to identify precise timeline of changes and to acquire corresponding labelled reference of changes. Considering this, Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE)-based approaches has been proposed for unsupervised change detection from bi-temporal remote sensing images. However, these type of approaches require prior knowledge about the exact moment the change occurs in order to employ the bi-temporal images, one pre-change and one post-change. This work introduces the utilization of satellite image time-series (SITS) data in a Joint 3D CAE-based unsupervised approach to detect annual changes. Our study focuses on a mining area where the changes mostly occurs due to tailings, waste and ore deposit, mining pit, mining residue, and so on. Here, we have explored Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (i.e. Sentinel-1) data along with optical (i.e. Sentinel-2) data, since optical data alone was not able to detect all the changes. The recall of detected change areas during 2016-2018 has improved by about 16% with the use of combination of Sentinel-1&2 data as compared to utilization of only Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - Satellite gravity observation and hydrological modelling-based integrated groundwater storage change in Northwestern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel approach for an improved estimate of regional groundwater storage (GWS) change in Northwestern India by integrating satellite-based Gravity Recovery and Climate Exchange (GRACE) gravity observation and hydrological modelling of satellite/in situ hydrometeorological data. Initially, GRACE observation-based terrestrial water storage (TWS) change and hydrological model-based TWS change products were integrated using weight coefficients derived from multi-linear regression analysis of TWS change vs governing hydrological components. Later, the monthly average soil moisture change was subtracted from the monthly average individual and integrated TWS change products to obtain GWS change products. By spatial correlation analysis, three GWS change products were then compared with groundwater level (GWL) fluctuation-based in situ GWS change. Hydrological model, spaceborne GRACE observation, and integrated GWS change products show a positive correlation in similar to 59,similar to 69, and similar to 73% of the study area with in situ GWS change. While a hydrological model-based estimate considers geology, terrain, and hydrometeorological conditions, GRACE gravity observation includes groundwater withdrawal from aquifers. All the factors are included in the integrated GWS change product. The approach overcomes the limitations of GRACE observation (spatial resolution, geology, terrain, and hydrometeorological factors), hydrological modelling (groundwater withdrawal conditions), and conventional GWL fluctuation-based method (inadequate spatial continuity and cumbersome, labour-intensive exercise).

TI  - Smart Channel Modelling for Cloud and Fog Attenuation Using ML for Designing of 6G Networks at D and G Bands
T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In case of future telecommunication technologies, extremely high data rates above 100 Gbps is the expectations, which can be fulfilled by utilizing higher spectrum bands. Higher frequency bands like terahertz wave bands are expected to have far broader bandwidths then 5G, therefore 6G will need to encourage R&D activities to utilize so called terahertz waves with frequencies ranging from 100 to 200 GHz. The challenge in utilizing these higher frequency bands is their sensitive nature toward outdoor environmental conditions like cloud, Fog, dust and Rain. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Machine Learning Model based on Artificial Neural Network to predict the attenuation caused due to Clouds and Fog at D and G bands. The model was trained using AMSER-2 Satellite data. The trained model is further optimized using different optimizing techniques. Obtained results was compared with the different existing models.

TI  - Mapping global maximum irrigation extent at 30m resolution using the irrigation performances under drought stress
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate global irrigation information is essential for managing water scarcity and improving food security. However, the mapping of high-resolution irrigation at the global scale is challenging due to the wide range of climate conditions, crop types and phenology, ambiguous and heterogeneous spectral features, and farming practices. Here, a robust method is proposed using irrigation performance under drought stress as a proxy for crop productivity stabilization and crop water consumption. For each irrigation mapping zone (IMZ), dry months in the 2017-2019 period and the driest months in the 2010-2019 period were identified over the growing season. The thresholds of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the dry months from 2017 to 2019 and the NDVI deviation (NDVIdev) in the driest month were identified to separate irrigated and rainfed cropland with samples. The final threshold from either the NDVI or the NDVIdev of the IMZ was determined with a higher overall accuracy in separating irrigated and non-irrigated areas. The results show that the global maximum irrigation extent (GMIE) at a 30-m resolution was 23.38% of global cropland in 2010-2019, with an overall accuracy of 83.6% globally and significant regional differences in irrigation proportions ranging from 1.1% in western Africa to 100% in Old World deserts among the 110 IMZs and from 0.4% in Belarus to 80.2% in Pakistan and 100% in Egypt among 45 countries. The study quantitatively distinguished annually and intermittently irrigated regions, which had values of 42% and 58% of global cropland, respectively, by applying indicators. This method, using the NDVI and NDVIdev thresholds, is simple, concrete and reproducible and better for zones with homogeneous weather conditions. The study offers independent, consistent and comparable information for defining the baseline, tracking changes in irrigation infrastructure, and leading future changes in how stakeholders plan and design irrigation systems.

TI  - Uncertainty of multi-source vegetation products on regional climate simulation in China
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is one of the most important parts of the Earth's land surface system. To investigate the impact and uncertainty of multi-source vegetation data on climate simulations in East Asia, we have compared two Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) and five Leaf Area Index (LAI) products and then performed seven experiments from 1999 to 2018 with the WRF model. The results suggest that the sensitivity of vegetation climatology is large especially in south East Asia, with a maximum difference of 4 m(2)/m(2) in LAI and 16% in FVC. For the mean temperature, the responses in East Asia are between +/- 0.4 K, and the uncertainty over the Chinese Mainland gradually enhances with the rapid vegetation growth. The feedback of precipitation is highly heterogeneous with sensitivities ranging between +/- 1 mm. For interannual variability, vegetation has a greater impact in summer and autumn. The uncertainty of temperature and precipitation in summer over the Chinese Mainland is 118 and 1754 times that in winter. In addition, the linear trend results also indicate that the maximum trend difference in temperature is around 0.04 K/a in eastern China, while the precipitation has a larger range of 0.04-0.10 mm/a in southern East Asia. Besides, the biophysical mechanism analysis suggests that vegetation impact on surface energy budget is mainly a competition between albedo feedback and moisture feedback, and the large differences in multi-source FVC and LAI are sufficient to simulate different or even opposite feedbacks.

TI  - Efficient geomorphological mapping based on geographic information systems and remote sensing data: an example from Jena, Germany
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a detailed geomorphological map (1:5000-scale) of a middle mountainous area in Jena, Germany. To overcome limitations and to extend the possibility of manually digital mapping in a structural way, we propose an approach using geographic information systems (GIS) and high-resolution digital data. The geomorphological map features were extracted by manually interpreting and analyzing the combination of different data sources using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. A combination of topographic and geological maps, digital orthophotos (DOPs), Google Earth images, field investigations, and derivatives from digital terrain models (DTMs) revealed that it is possible to generate the geomorphologic features involved in classical mapping approaches. LiDAR-DTM and land surface parameters (LSPs) can provide better results when incorporating the visual interpretation of multidirectional hillshade and LSP composite maps.Findings enabled us to systematically delineate landforms and geomorphological process domains. We suggest that further use of digital data should be undertaken to support analysis and applications.

TI  - Upgrade Rate of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ to Invasive Carcinoma and the Clinicopathological Factors Predicting the Upgrade Following a Mastectomy: A Retrospective Study
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The rate of upgrading ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive cancer varies widely in the literature with no consensus regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for DCIS; however, some guidelines do recommend it in the event of a mastectomy. The primary aim of this study was to determine the upgrade rate of DCIS to invasive carcinoma (IC) in patients undergoing mastectomy for DCIS and identify the clinicopathological predicting factors for the upgrade. The secondary aim was to determine the SLNB positivity rate. Methodology We retrospectively analysed consecutive patients with DCIS diagnosed through a biopsy who then underwent mastectomy over a 10-year period (2010 to 2020). Clinical, radiological, and histological variables were collected from medical records. Results We studied 143 women (mean age = 57.4 years, range = 26-85 years) who underwent mastectomy for DCIS identified on biopsy. Almost two-thirds (62.9%, 90/143) of the patients were detected on screening mammography, while 35.6% (51/143) were diagnosed following presentation with either an area of palpable concern or nipple discharge. The most common mammographic presentation of DCIS was calcification (83.9%, 120/143), and, in 85.9% of the patients, the mammographic lesion was more than 20 mm. High-grade DCIS was noted in 76.9% of preoperative biopsy results, while the rest was either low or intermediate -grade DCIS. Overall, 24.5% (35/143) were upgraded to IC (upgraded group) on postoperative histology, whereas 108/143 remained DCIS postoperatively (pure DCIS group). The positivity rate of SLNB was 4.8%. Multifocality was the only significant predictor of IC on multivariate analyses of clinicopathological predictors (odds ratio = 3.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.0-8.7). The presence of comedonecrosis was higher in the upgraded group compared to the pure DCIS group (42.9% vs. 27.8%), but this was not statistically significant. Conclusions In our study cohort, nearly one in four (24.5%) patients were upgraded from DCIS to IC on postoperative histology, with an SLNB positivity rate of 4.8%. This is important when counselling patients regarding the risk of coincident occult IC and the importance of SLNB at the time of mastectomy. Multifocality on preoperative imaging was the only significant predictive factor. Based on this result, we recommend that SLNB should also be considered if patients have multifocal DCIS and planned for oncoplastic breast -conserving surgery. However, further studies are required to investigate the association between multifocal DCIS and the risk of upgrading to IC.

TI  - Remote sensing techniques for monitoring algal blooms in the area between Jeddah and Rabigh on the Red Sea Coast
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Red Sea is known to host and facilitate the growth and reproduction of several species of phytoplankton and algae. The degree of density and distribution of these organisms differ with region. However, very few studies have been conducted on algal blooms in this region. Hence, this study aimed to identify the effectiveness of remote sensing techniques in monitoring and controlling algal blooms in the area extending between the cities of Jeddah and Rabigh on the Red Sea coast. A series of satellite images were used to study algae from January 2020 to March 2021. All study data were subjected to processing and analysis using spectral indices [chlorophyll a (Chl-a); Concentration and Sea Surface Temperature (SST); Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI); Surface Scum Index (SSI); Surface Algal Bloom Index (SABI); Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)], and the classification, overlay, and buffer methods. We found that the rate of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) increased in February 2021 and decreased in May 2020, with the algal bloom dwindling with increasing distance from the shores of the Red Sea. Furthermore, despite the varying effectiveness of the spectral indices in estimating the distribution and density of algae in the Red Sea, Landsat SSI was the most effective. One of the primary results of the study was that algal blooms more frequently occur in the winter (February). The study produced a digital map of algal blooms in the study area. Algal blooms exhibited medium inverse correlations with temperature and specific humidity, and strong direct correlation with wind speed. Valley estuaries, close to the beaches, were found to be the most suitable area for the concentration and growth of algae. The study's findings emphasize the need for close monitoring and controlling changes in the components of the marine environment using remote sensing techniques, in order to track the changes that marine plants (algae) are exposed to in the Red Sea.

TI  - Large increases in methane emissions expected from North America's largest wetland complex
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural methane (CH4) emissions from aquatic ecosystems may rise because of human-induced climate warming, although the magnitude of increase is highly uncertain. Using an exceptionally large CH4 flux dataset (similar to 19,000 chamber measurements) and remotely sensed information, we modeled plot-and land-scape-scale wetland CH4 emissions from the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), North America's largest wetland complex. Plot-scale CH4 emissions were driven by hydrology, temperature, vegetation, and wetland size. Histor-ically, landscape-scale PPR wetland CH4 emissions were largely dependent on total wetland extent. However, regardless of future wetland extent, PPR CH4 emissions are predicted to increase by two-or threefold by 2100 under moderate or severe warming scenarios, respectively. Our findings suggest that international efforts to decrease atmospheric CH4 concentrations should jointly account for anthropogenic and natural emissions to maintain climate mitigation targets to the end of the century.

TI  - Multispectral remote sensing of potential groundwater dependent vegetation in the greater Floristic region of the Western Cape, South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Groundwater dependent vegetation (GDV) is increasingly threatened by the transformation of the natural environment. An understanding of the nature of GDV at the appropriate scale helps environmental managers make suitable decisions. This study assesses the potential for mapping the distribution of GDV within the Heuningnes Catchment using multispectral remotely sensed data (i.e., Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel 2 (S2)), the derived vegetation indices (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)) and in-situ data. The GDV distribution maps were produced by integrating vegetation productivity, landcover, and topographic layers as GDV indicators. The findings of the study revealed that the spectral indices had a significant influence on the sensor's GDV classification performance. Specifically, the S2-derived SAVI mapped the GDV areas with the highest overall accuracy (97%), followed by the S2-derived NDVI, with an accuracy of 95%. Comparatively, the L8(NDVI) GDV map was achieved with an overall accuracy of 92% and the L8(SAVI) map had an overall accuracy of 96%. The estimated coverage of potential GDV within the catchment ranges between 2.34 and 2.60%. This work demonstrated the capabilities of a combined remote sensing and GIS methodological framework, which can improve our knowledge on GDV.

TI  - Delineation of groundwater potential zones using remotely sensed data and GIS-based analytical hierarchy process: Insights from the Geba river basin in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The study was undertaken in the Geba Drainage Basin, major tributary of the Tekeze Drainage Basin in Northern Ethiopia. Study focus: The objective of this study is to identify the groundwater potential zones of Northern Ethiopia's Geba Drainage Basin. Nine groundwater indicators were used as inputs, including li- thology, geomorphology, lineament density, drainage density, slope, elevation, land use and land cover, rainfall, and soil. According to their relative influence on groundwater potentiality, the thematic layers and their classes were assigned appropriate weights based on Saaty's 1-9 judg- ment scale. The assigned weights were then normalized using an Eigen vector-based Analytical Hierarchy process. By superimposing all the normalized layers in the GIS environment, a groundwater potential map was developed.New hydrological insights for the region: Five distinct groundwater potential zones-very good, good, moderate, poor, and very poor were found in the study area. The areal distribution showed that majority of the area (45%) fell within the poor groundwater potential zone. The groundwater potential zones of moderate, very poor, good, and very good cover approximately 27%, 12%, 10%, and 6% of the total area, respectively. The results were compared to the groundwater yield of boreholes collected from the study area. The validation analysis revealed a 72% similarity, which is representative. The employed method is therefore a reasonable option for groundwater development in the Geba Drainage Basin.

TI  - Shoreline change detection using DSAS technique: Case of Saint Martin Island, Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Saint Martin, Bangladesh's only coral island, is a popular tourist destination and a blue economy hub. Saint Martin's shoreline constantly changes due to natural and manmade erosion and accre-tion. Since no previous work has been done, this research uses geospatial and statistical methods to evaluate spatial and temporal shoreline changes on Saint Martin Island from 1974 to 2021 and anticipated changes between 2032 and 2042. The study used the Normalized Difference Water Index and Tasseled Cap Transformation tools to extract shorelines from the United States Geolog-ical Survey (USGS) Landsat satellite images with resolutions of 60 m in 1974 and 30 m in 1988, 2001, 2013, and 2021. Then, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) calculated shoreline change for each year using End Point Rate (EPR), Linear Regression Rate (LRR), and Net Shore-line Movement (NSM) methods. Global Positioning System (GPS) was also used to measure accu-racy and shoreline change intensity. Around 253 transects were placed at 50 - m intervals along the island's coast, with approximately 55% of the transects indicating erosion, the remaining indi-cating accretion, and just 1% in stable condition. The research reveals that Uttar Para experiences the most dramatic shoreline alterations among the five coastal zones, with minimum erosion rates of -2.21 m/yr due to high tidal waves. Aside from that, Dakhin Para has the highest accre-tion rates, up to a maximum of 4.81 m/yr, due to the coral colonies' protection. Nazrul Para, Purba Para, Majer Para, Deil Para, and Eastern Galachipa erode and accrete moderately. Paschim Para, Uttar Para, and the eastern edge of the Dakhin Para coastline length are exceptionally high -risk areas, according to the Shoreline Length Intensity Index. In contrast, there is a low-risk index on the western side of the Dakhin Para and Deil Para coastlines. The LRR technique yields the best shoreline change estimates, with average erosion at -2.13 m/yr and accretion at 1.4 m/yr across 12.65 km from 1974 to 2021. The Kalman Filter Model (KFM) predicts Saint Martin's coastline will erode at a minimum rate of -2.33 m/yr by 2032 and-2.73 by 2042. Conversely, the coastline could accrete 2.09 m/yr in 2032 and 2.45 m/yr in 2042. Lower NRMSE values of 0.09 provide a highly accurate KFM for shoreline validation methods. Shoreline validation has an NRMSE of 0.16, indicating better agreement between field-derived and satellite-based shoreline positions. Finally, recognizing eroding and accreting hotspots along the Saint Martin Island coast can assist academicians, policymakers, and stakeholders. The research enables coastal re-searchers to comprehend regional shoreline dynamics.

TI  - GAN-based SAR and optical image translation for wildfire impact assessment using multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the popularity and success in burned area detection and assessment, multispectral satellite images are often affected by poor sunlight-illumination conditions, particularly at high latitudes. Given that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can effectively penetrate clouds and collect images in all-weather conditions during day and night, the complementary use of optical and SAR data can be helpful for remote-sensing measurements and assessments of burned sites. Nevertheless, the widely used burn-sensitive spectral indices hardly help analyze SAR data due to the inherent difference between optical and SAR sensors in physical imaging mechanisms. In this study, we aim to leverage multi-source data for burned area mapping and burn severity assessment by translating SAR images into optical images using ResNet-based Pix2Pix model. Experiments were performed on 8669 pairs of bitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical patches over 304 large wildfire events in Canada with a wide range of land covers. The translated optical images from SAR data occupied similar spectral properties to real optical observations and the corresponding generated spectral indices (i.e., delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), relative dNBR, and Relativized Burn Ratio) also showed high agreement with real optical indices. In terms of burned area detection using the generated indices, their medium values of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were over 85%, achieving promising performance that outperformed the SAR-based index. Burn severity maps derived from multi-source data achieved a relatively high Kappa coefficient of 0.77. Results showed the feasibility and effectiveness of GAN-based SAR-to-optical translation for wildfire impact assessment, paving the way for the combined use of optical and SAR data.

TI  - Simulation of water productivity of wheat in northwestern Bangladesh using multi-satellite data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water productivity (WP), a performance indicator, defines if the agricultural production system uses the re-sources competently. Spatial information on crop WP is fundamental to knowing where a gap in WP exists along with underlying reasons within the gaps, where a crop production system performs well, and where de-velopments are still possible to enhance the water-productive performance. This study proposes to assess spatial wheat WP in drought-prone northwestern Bangladesh. Both primary and secondary data, such as Sentinel 2 MSI, Landsat 8 OLI satellite images, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from Lysimeter, and wheat farmers' field data over the study area, were collected to accomplish this study. The wheat-cultivated fields were delineated first using Sentinel 2 MSI data during the 2018 wheat growing season. WP parameters, namely crop yield and ETa were estimated using Landsat 8 satellite data. Based on yield data from the farmer's field and normalized dif-ference vegetation index (NDVI) values generated from the same fields, a linear regression model was developed. This model was applied to obtain crop yield maps from the NDVI maps of the study area. A remote sensing-based well-tested, robust algorithm surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) was used to estimate ETa using Landsat 8 images and local ground information. Cloud-free single-date images corresponding to wheat growth stages such as initial, development, mid-season, and late-season were used to estimate seasonal ETa. SEBAL-estimated single date ETa was validated by newly developed (under this study) Lysimeter-measured ETa. Wheat maps were then masked to get crop-specific yield and ETa maps. Finally, the WP maps of wheat were produced by the mathematical operation of the yield and ETa raster maps. The NDVI-crop yield (Y) models were calibrated and validated, which shows an acceptable degree of dispersion between observed and estimated values. Thakurgaon and Panchagorh districts (second administrative tier) are higher wheat-yielding districts in the study area. The average wheat-yield of the study area was 3.51 t ha -1, which is close to the department of agricultural extension (officially) reported data. In the case of the denominator (ETa) of WP estimation, results show that SEBAL-estimated wheat ETa on the image dates is close to ETa estimated by the Lysimeter. The average seasonal ETa for wheat is found as 253 mm. The estimated highest and lowest ETa demands are found in Tha-kurgaon and Panchagorh districts, respectively. The estimated WP of wheat ranged between 1.33 and 1.46 kg m- 3, with an average of 1.39 kg m- 3 among the eight study districts. Panchagorh and Thakurgaon districts are the highest water productive, whereas Gaibandha and Nilphamari show the minimum level of the WP. Among the Y-ETa, WP-ETa, and WP-Y relationships, WP-Y shows the highest correlation (r2 =0.73), as the higher WP observed mainly due to high yielding capacity. Besides, suitable soil characteristics and weather conditions favor wheat WP in those areas. This study identifies high-performing bright and low-performing hot spots of WP across the northwest of Bangladesh. Finally, stakeholders and decision-makers can use the information to define priority areas, set goals for improvement, and justify the type of investment or measures for improving water-productive agriculture in Bangladesh.

TI  - X-ray irradiation negatively affects immune responses in the lymphatic network
T2  - MICROVASCULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has been attracting attention as a new cancer treatment and is likely to be widely used in combination with radiotherapy. Therefore, examination of the effects of X-ray irradiation on sentinel lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels, which are involved in antigen presentation, is important for therapy. The hindlimbs of mice were irradiated with X-rays (total radiation doses: 2, 10, and 30 Gy), and X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed using 15-nm or 2-nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as contrast agents on days 7, 14, and 28 after irradiation to evaluate the diameter of the collecting lymph vessels and lymph flow within the irradiated area. X-ray CT imaging data using 15-nm AuNPs on day 28 after irradiation showed that the diameter of the collecting lymph vessels was significantly larger in all irradiated groups compared to the control group (p <= 0.01). CT imaging with 2-nm AuNPs showed that lymphatic drainage was significantly reduced in the lymph nodes irradiated with 10 Gy and 30 Gy compared to the lymph nodes irradiated with 2 Gy (p <= 0.05). Additionally, immunohistochemical analyses were conducted to evaluate the area density and morphology of high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the lymph nodes, which are important vessels for naive T cells to enter the lymph nodes. The expression level of MECA-79, which specifically localized to HEVs, was significantly decreased in the 10 Gy and 30 Gy irradiation groups compared to the control group (p <= 0.05). There was a significant decrease in normal HEV morphology (p <= 0.05) and a significant increase in abnormal HEV morphology (p <= 0.05) in all irradiated groups. These results also showed that X-ray irradiation induced a time-and radiation dose-dependent increase in the diameter of the collecting lymph vessels, stagnation of intralymphatic lymph flow, and a reduction in the area density of HEVs and their abnormal morphology, demonstrating that X-ray irradiation affected the immune responses. Therefore, these findings suggest that X-ray irradiation to lymph nodes may impair the opportunity for antigen presentation in the lymph nodes, which is the key to cancer immunity, and that for this reason, it is important to carefully plan irradiation of sentinel lymph nodes and develop treatment strategies according to future treatment options.

TI  - Integrating image segmentation in the delineation of burned areas on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise and regularly updated maps of surface burned area extent are essential for fire manage-ment. It is challenging to obtain this information through ground surveys due to high cost. Satel-lite remote sensing has become a fundamental and cost-effective tool for acquiring such informa-tion in a temporal context. This paper features the integration of image segmentation in a methodological framework to delineate the extent of burned areas on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 optical data. A rule-based and a supervised classification approach are employed to support this aim. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches, the results were compared to the relevant Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) maps. The results obtained us-ing the rule-based approach depicted adequate agreement with the EMS product (86.9% using Landsat 8 data and 85.4% using Sentinel-2 data), whereas those obtained using a supervised clas-sification approach depicted noticeable agreement with the EMS product (88.6% using Landsat 8 data and 90.7% using Sentinel-2 data). Finally, the widely used error matrix was calculated for each classification approach. We obtained 96% overall accuracy value using Landsat 8 data and 98% overall accuracy value using Sentinel-2 data. The results depict that the proposed methodol-ogy can be very useful for the delineation of burned areas.

TI  - Checkpoint blockade and BRAF/MEK therapy in the therapeutic setting improved the overall survival after sentinel node biopsy: A retrospective study comparing patients with primary care between 1998-2009 and 2010-2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Immunotherapies using checkpoint blockade and BRAF/MEK therapies have improved overall survival (OS) in patients with unresectable melanoma metastases. In this retrospective study, we aimed to demonstrate the resulting increase in melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and OS after the excision of primary melanomas (>= 1 mm thick) and sentinel lymph node (SN) biopsy (SNB). Using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox models, we compared two consecutive cohorts. Patients in cohort 1 (N = 518) underwent SNB between 1998 and 2009, and patients in cohort 2 (N = 460) between 2010 and 2017, when checkpoint blockade and BRAF/(MEK) inhibition became available for the treatment of unresectable relapses. The median follow-up times were 120 and 73 months, respectively. While recurrence-free and distant metastasis-free survival rates remained very similar, MSS and OS increased in favor of cohort 2. The estimated 5-year OS rate of SN-positive patients increased by 14.3% (78.5% vs 64.2%, logrank test: P = .005). The MSS benefit was significant even with low SN tumor burden (metastasis diameter < 1 mm). On multivariate analyses, the risk-reduction in favor of cohort 2 was significant in the total population and in the SN-negative and SN-positive subgroups. In SN-positive patients, besides the availability of modern therapies, SN metastasis diameter and ulceration were independent factors of MSS and OS. Treatment of unresectable melanoma recurrences with modern drug therapies results in significantly higher survival rates in a population with SNB. The survival benefit measured from primary melanoma affects both the SN-positive and SN-negative subpopulations.

TI  - Remote sensing of seasonal variation of LAI and fAPAR in a deciduous broadleaf forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is affecting the phenology of terrestrial ecosystems. In deciduous forests, phenology in leaf area index (LAI) is the primary driver of seasonal variation in the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), which drives photosynthesis. Remote sensing has been widely used to estimate LAI and fAPAR. However, while many studies have examined both empirical and model-based relationships among LAI, fAPAR, and spectral vegetation indices (SVI) from remote sensing, few studies have systematically and empiri-cally examined how relationships among these variables change over the growing season. In this study, we examine how and why seasonal-scale covariation differs among time series of remotely sensed SVIs and both LAI and fAPAR based on current understanding and theory. To do this we use newly available remote sensing data sets in combination with time series of in-situ measurements and a canopy radiative transfer model to analyze how seasonal variation in canopy and environmental conditions affect relationships among remotely sensed SVIs, LAI, and fAPAR at a temperate deciduous forest site in central Massachusetts. Our results show that accounting for seasonal variation in canopy shadowing, which is driven by variation in solar zenith angle, improved remote sensing-based estimates of LAI, fAPAR, and daily total APAR. Specifically, we show that the phenology of SVIs is strongly influenced by seasonal variation in near infrared (NIR) reflectance arising from systematic variation in the canopy shadow fraction that is independent of changes in LAI or fAPAR. Results of this work provide a refined basis for understanding how remote sensing can be used to monitor and model the phenology of LAI, fAPAR, APAR, and gross primary productivity in temperate deciduous forests.

TI  - Upscaling remote sensing inversion and dynamic monitoring of soil salinization in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a global problem of soil degradation, salinization has become a major obstacle to the sustainable development of the ecological environment and agriculture in coastal plains. However, the traditional process of salinity survey is too cumbersome, expensive and time-consuming to meet the mapping needs in a large scale. Remote sensing technology has become an important tool for digital soil mapping because of its rich sources, real-time and low cost. In order to meet the objective demand for rapid, accurate, and efficient acquisition and monitoring of soil salinization. This paper collected 61 soil samples from the Kenli District (experimental area) and extracted vegetation and salinity indicators from the Landsat image to construct the salinity inversion model by random forest algorithm. Then, taking the Yellow River Delta as the study area, the conversion coefficient of spectral indicators between Landsat and MODIS images was constructed in the form of the ratio of the mean value. Through optimization, the upscaling conversion method based on land use regionalization was proposed to realize the upscaling inversion and dynamic monitoring of soil salinization. The results showed that: (1) The random forest model based on NDVI, RVI, EVI, SI3, and SI5 can better predict the soil salinity in the experimental area, with R2 = 0.821 and RMSE = 2.811 (validation accuracy). (2) The upscaling conversion method based on land use regionalization can effectively reduce the statistical error and collinearity of spectral indicators con-structed by MODIS images and improve their correlation with OLI data and soil salinity. (3) From coastal to inland, soil salinization gradually decreases in the Yellow River Delta. From 2000 to 2020, soil salinization increased first and then decreased, and the salinized soil accounted for 20.35%similar to 35.10%. This study used multi-source remote sensing data to realize the collaborative inversion at different scales, which was significant for the quantitative estimation of soil salinity, salinization control, and sustainable agricultural development in coastal plains.

TI  - SIFNet: A self-attention interaction fusion network for multisource satellite imagery template matching
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource satellite images provide abundant and complementary earth observations, while nonlinear radio-metric and geometric distortions (such as scale and rotation variations) between these multimodal images pose remarkable challenges for further remote sensing applications, such as change detection. We therefore proposed a template matching algorithm based on self-attention interactive fusion network, named SIFNet, to align multisource satellite images. First, a feature pyramid network was first conducted to extract multiscale features for each pixel, with the template and reference images as the inputs. Then, the extracted features were fused by self-attention layers in Transformer for information interaction. Third, the similarity and semantic matching loss functions were developed to convert satellite imagery registration into regression task, allowing SIFNet aligning multimodal patch images more efficiently based on point-to-point correspondence, instead of globally searching extremums as previous matching strategies did. We performed experiments based on four multimodal datasets (i. e. Google, GF-2, Landsat-8 and optical-SAR images) with various scenes to evaluate the performance and robustness of SIFNet. The results demonstrate the proposed SIFNet performed a comparable accuracy for tem-plate matching with other algorithms and was robust to geometric distortions and radiometric variations of multisource remote sensing data.

TI  - Remote sensing for field pea yield estimation: A study of multi-scale data fusion approaches in phenomics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionRemote sensing using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are prevalent for phenomics and precision agricultural applications. The high-resolution data for these applications can provide useful spectral characteristics of crops associated with performance traits such as seed yield. With the recent availability of high-resolution satellite imagery, there has been growing interest in using this technology for plot-scale remote sensing applications, particularly those related to breeding programs. This study compared the features extracted from high-resolution satellite and UAS multispectral imagery (visible and near-infrared) to predict the seed yield from two diverse plot-scale field pea yield trials (advanced breeding and variety testing) using the random forest model. MethodsThe multi-modal (spectral and textural features) and multi-scale (satellite and UAS) data fusion approaches were evaluated to improve seed yield prediction accuracy across trials and time points. These approaches included both image fusion, such as pan-sharpening of satellite imagery with UAS imagery using intensity-hue-saturation transformation and additive wavelet luminance proportional approaches, and feature fusion, which involved integrating extracted spectral features. In addition, we also compared the image fusion approach to high-definition satellite data with a resolution of 0.15 m/pixel. The effectiveness of each approach was evaluated with data at both individual and combined time points. Results and discussionThe major findings can be summarized as follows: (1) the inclusion of the texture features did not improve the model performance, (2) the performance of the model using spectral features from satellite imagery at its original resolution can provide similar results as UAS imagery, with variation depending on the field pea yield trial under study and the growth stage, (3) the model performance improved after applying multi-scale, multiple time point feature fusion, (4) the features extracted from the pan-sharpened satellite imagery using intensity-hue-saturation transformation (image fusion) showed better model performance than those with original satellite imagery or high definition imagery, and (5) the green normalized difference vegetation index and transformed triangular vegetation index were identified as key features contributing to high model performance across trials and time points. These findings demonstrate the potential of high-resolution satellite imagery and data fusion approaches for plot-scale phenomics applications.

TI  - Inclusive excellence through digital learning: an undergraduate research experience to pilot cross-institutional collaboration between a historically black university and a predominantly white institution
T2  - INTERCULTURAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing diversity in higher education and the workforce requires undergraduate students to learn to work together effectively to address scientific and social issues. Our goal is to learn how best to facilitate teamwork among students from Historically Black Universities (HBU) and Predominantly White Institutions (PWI) to promote collaborative learning. We analysed the evolving knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of participating students as they developed close working relationships through a 'study-within-a-study' design where student pairs (one from an HBU and one from a PWI) conducted their own research project while we analysed how these students interacted with their partners. The Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU) rubric of Intercultural Knowledge and Competence was used to develop a set of codes for assessing transcripts of student meetings. AACU defines six attributes of this rubric including cultural self-awareness, cultural worldview frameworks, empathy, verbal and nonverbal communication, curiosity, and openness. Our pilot results suggest that students willing to engage collaboratively with others from different cultural or educational backgrounds can display attributes of intercultural competence, while those not willing to engage in the collaborative process may not exhibit such competence. We also learnedthat students require the same initial preparation necessary for the assigned project.

TI  - A mid-infrared study of synthetic glass and crystal mixtures analog to the geochemical terranes on mercury
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The MERTIS (MErcury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer) onboard of the BepiColombo ESA/JAXA mission to Mercury will map the surface of Mercury in the wavelength range of 7-14 & mu;m and for the interpretation of these spectra a database of analog materials is needed. We analyzed bulk grain size fractions of a series of analog materials relevant to the distinct terranes of Mercury in diffuse reflectance in the mid-infrared (2.5 & mu;m to 18 & mu;m). Mineral mixtures cover a wide range of modal amounts of forsterite, enstatite, diopside and plagioclase, the resulting spectra can be divided into three distinct groups: (1) is dominated by a single glass feature, (2) by forsterite bands, and (3) by pyroxene bands. Despite often high contents, plagioclase features, are usually 'overprinted' by forsterite and pyroxene bands.Spectral parameter CF, an easy obtainable proxy for chemistry (SiO2) and polymerization (SCFM) places the hermean mixtures mostly in the intermediate and basaltic range. The correlation of parameters easily obtainable in remote sensing, Mg/Si ratio, and CF, allows differing materials from high-energy evaporation processes in impacts from such formed in igneous processes.Preliminary comparison with a spectrum covering most of the hermean surface shows some similarity with band positions of the Inter Crater Plain and Heavily Cratered Terrains (IcP-HCT) and High-Mg Northern Volcanic Plains (High-Mg NVP) mixtures, but none of our spectra is able to reproduce the remote sensing data entirely.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Global warming is one of the top environmental concerns in the U.S, yet little is known about the effects of green advertising on different generational cohorts - Gen-Z, Gen-Y, Gen-X, and Baby Boomers. Specifically, environmental values (egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric) were assessed for differentially impacting ad attitudes and behavioral intentions across the four cohorts. Study-1 (n = 613) found the biospheric ad (plants and animals) to be more persuasive for Gen-Z and Gen-Y, with no preference shown for Gen-X and Baby Boomers, and no differences between the self (egoistic) and community (altruistic) focused ads. Based on these findings, Study 2 (n = 634) merged the four cohorts into two, Gen-ZY and Gen-XB, focused only on egoistic and biospheric, while introducing informativeness and task difficulty to better understand messaging preferences on attitudes and intentions to act. The findings revealed that Gen-ZY preferred to donate money for a biospheric ad with low information, while being motivated to volunteer their time when presented with a high information biospheric ad. Irrespective of ad appeal (egoistic or biospheric), Gen-XB had stronger intentions to donate for an advertisement with high information content (vs. low). Theoretical and advertiser implications are discussed along with future research avenues.

TI  - Self-lofting of wildfire smoke in the troposphere and stratosphere: simulations and space lidar observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire smoke is known as a highly absorptive aerosol type in the shortwave wavelength range. The absorption of sunlight by optically thick smoke layers results in heating of the ambient air. This heating is translated into self-lofting of the smoke up to more than 1 km in altitude per day. This study aims for a detailed analysis of tropospheric and stratospheric smoke lofting rates based on simulations and observations. The main goal is to demonstrate that radiative heating of intense smoke plumes is capable of lofting them from the lower and middle free troposphere (injection heights) up to the tropopause without the need of pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) convection. The further subsequent ascent within the lower stratosphere (caused by self-lofting) is already well documented in the literature. Simulations of absorbed solar radiation by smoke particles and resulting heating rates, which are then converted into lofting rates, are conducted by using the ECRAD (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Radiation) scheme. As input parameters thermodynamic profiles from CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) reanalysis data, aerosol profiles from ground-based lidar observations, radiosonde potential temperature profiles, CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) aerosol measurements, and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) aerosol optical depth retrievals were used. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the lofting rate strongly depends on aerosol optical thickness (AOT), layer depth, layer height, and black carbon (BC) fraction. We also looked at the influence of different meteorological parameters such as cloudiness, relative humidity, and potential temperature gradient. To demonstrate the applicability of our self-lofting model, we compared our simulations with the lofting processes in the stratosphere observed with CALIOP after major pyroCb events (Canadian fires in 2017, Australian fires in 2019-2020). We analyzed long-term CALIOP observations of smoke layers and plumes evolving in the UTLS (upper troposphere and lower stratosphere) height region over Siberia and the adjacent Arctic Ocean during the summer season of 2019. Our results indicate that self-lofting contributed to the vertical transport of smoke. We hypothesize that the formation of a near-tropopause aerosol layer, observed with CALIOP, was the result of self-lofting processes because this is in line with the simulations. Furthermore, Raman-lidar-based aerosol typing (in Leipzig and the High Arctic) clearly indicated the dominance of smoke in the UTLS aerosol layer since August 2019, most probably also the result of smoke self-lofting.

TI  - Application of genetic algorithm in optimization parallel ensemble-based machine learning algorithms to flood susceptibility mapping using radar satellite imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are the natural disaster that occurs most frequently due to the weather and causes the most widespread destruc-tion. The purpose of the proposed research is to analyze flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) in the Sulaymaniyah prov-ince of Iraq. This study employed a genetic algorithm (GA) to fine-tune parallel ensemble-based machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF) and bootstrap aggregation (Bagging)). Four machine learning algorithms (RF, Bagging, RF-GA, and Bagging-GA) were used to build FSM in the study area. To provide inputs into parallel ensemble-based ma-chine learning algorithms, we gathered and processed data from meteorological (Rainfall), satellite image (flood in-ventory, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), aspect, land cover, altitude, stream power index (SPI), plan curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), slope) and geographic sources (geology). For this research, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images were utilized to locate flooded areas and create an inventory map of floods. To train and validate the model, we employed 70 % and 30 % of 160 selected flood locations, respectively. Mul-ticollinearity, frequency ratio (FR), and Geodetector methods were used for data preprocessing. Four metrics were uti-lized to assess the FSM performance: the root mean square error (RMSE), the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), the Taylor diagram, and the seed cell area index (SCAI). The results exhibited that all the suggested models have high accuracy of prediction, but the performance of Bagging-GA (RMSE (Train = 0.1793, Test = 0.4543)) was slightly better than RF-GA (RMSE (Train = 0.1803, Test = 0.4563)), Bagging (RMSE (Train = 0.2191, Test = 0.4566)), and RF (RMSE (Train = 0.2529, Test = 0.4724)). According to the ROC index, the Bagging-GA model (AUC = 0.935) was the most accurate in flood susceptibility modeling, followed by the RF-GA (AUC = 0.904), the Bagging (AUC = 0.872), and the RF (AUC = 0.847) models. The study's identification of high -risk flood zones and the most significant factors contributing to flooding make it a helpful resource for flood manage-ment.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - High-resolution maps of material stocks in buildings and infrastructures are of key importance for studies of societal resource use (social metabolism, circular economy, secondary resource potentials) as well as for transport studies and land system science. So far, such maps were only available for specific years but not in time series. Even for single years, data covering entire countries with high resolution, or using remote-sensing data are rare. Instead, they often have local extent (e.g., [1] ), are lower resolution (e.g., [2] ), or are based on other geospatial data (e.g., [3] ). We here present data on the material stocks in three types of buildings (commercial and industrial, single- and multifamily houses) and three types of infrastructures (roads, railways, other infrastructures) for a 33-year time series for Austria at a spatial resolution of 30 m. The article also presents data on popula-tion , employment in Austria for the same time period, at the same spatial resolution. Data were derived with the same method applied in a recent study for Germany [4] .(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - GIS integrated RUSLE model-based soil loss estimation and watershed prioritization for land and water conservation aspects
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation has become one of the major threats throughout the globe, affecting about 2.6 billion people in more than 100 countries. The highest rate of land degradation is in Asia, followed by Africa and Europe. Climate change coupled with anthropogenic activities have accelerated the rate of land degradation in developing nations. In India, land degradation has affected about 105.48 million hectares. Thus, modeling and mapping soil loss, and assessing the vulnerability threat of the active erosional processes in a region are the major challenges from the land and water conservation aspects. The present study attempted rigorous modeling to estimate soil loss from the Banas Basin of Rajasthan state, India, using GIS-integrated Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) equation. Priority ranking was computed for different watersheds in terms of the degree of soil loss from their catchments, so that appropriate conservation measures can be implemented. The total area of Banas basin (68,207.82 km(2)) was systematically separated into 25 watersheds ranging in area from 113.0 to 7626.8 km(2). Rainfall dataset of Indian Meteorological Department for 30 years (1990-2020), FAO based Soil map for soil characterization, ALOS PALSAR digital elevation model for topographic assessment, and Sentinal-2 based land use and land cover map were integrated for modeling and mapping soil erosion/loss risk assessment. The total annual soil loss in the Banas basin was recorded as 21,766,048.8 tons. The areas under very low (0-1 t ha(-1) year(-1)), low (1-5 t ha(-1) year(-1)), medium (5-10 t ha(-1) year(-1)), high (10-50 t ha(-1) year(-1)) and extreme (> 50 t ha(-1) year(-1)) soil loss categories were recorded as 24.2, 66.8, 7.3, 0.9, and 0.7%, respectively, whereas the respective average annual soil loss values were obtained as 0.8, 3.0, 6.0, 23.1, and 52.0 t ha(-1) year(-1). The average annual soil loss among different watersheds was recorded in the range of 1.1-84.9 t ha(-1) year(-1), being highest (84.9 t ha(-1) year(-1)) in WS18, followed by WS10 (38.4 t ha(-1) year(-1)), SW25 (34.7 t ha(-1) year(-1)) and WS23 (17.9 t ha(-1) year(-1)), whereas it was lowest for WS8 (1.1 t ha(-1) year(-1)). Thus, WS18 obtained the highest/top priority rank in terms of the average annual soil loss (84.9 t ha(-1) year(-1)) to be considered as the first priority for land and water conservation planning and implementation. The quantitative results of this study would be useful for implementation of land and water conservation measures in the problematic areas of the Banas basin for controlling soil loss through water erosion.

TI  - Epidemiology of human papillomavirus on condyloma acuminatum in Shandong Province?China
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Condyloma acuminatum (CA) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. It is important to study the prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes before implementing the HPV vaccination program. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological characteristics of CA cases and the distribution of HPV genotypes in Shandong Province, China. One-to-one questionnaire surveys were conducted on all patients diagnosed with CA in sentinel hospitals from Shandong Province, China. HPV genotypes were determined using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-reverse dot blot hybridization method. The study enrolled 1185 patients (870 males and 315 females) and found that CA patients are mainly males and sexually active people between the ages of 20 and 40. Recurrence occurred in 34.7% patients. Among the 880 CA patients who underwent HPV typing, the HPV test positivity rate was 91.4%. In these cases, low-risk (LR) HPV infection was predominant, with an infection rate of 91.3%, while high-risk (HR) HPV genotypes were found in 53.5% patients. The most frequent HPV genotypes encountered were HPV6 (57.8%), HPV11 (37.2%), HPV16 (13.7%), and HPV42 (10.3%). HPV6 and/or HPV11 are the main infections in all patients, and more than half of the patients are coinfected with HR-HPV. However, unlike other regions, HPV42 has a higher prevalence rate among CA patients in Shandong Province and is a nonvaccine HPV genotype. Therefore, regular HPV typing helps to understand the characteristics of specific genotypes and the choice of the best type for vaccine coverage.

TI  - Use of ablation-season albedo as an indicator of annual mass balance of four glaciers in the Tien Shan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier mass balance and its sensitivity to climate change depend to a large degree on the albedo and albedo feedback. Although recent increasing studies reconstruct the annual surface mass balance (SMB) based on the relationships between satellite-derived minimum albedo and annual glaciological mass balance (so-called albedo method), a relationship remains conjectural for Tien Shan glaciers. Accumulation and ablation occur simultaneously in summer, causing different surface processes. We examine this relationship using glaciological mass-balance data and the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) made on the eastern branch of Urumqi Glacier No. 1 (UG1-E), Tuyuksu, Golubin and Glacier No. 354, and ablation-season (May-September) albedo retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2000 to 2021. Compared with minimum ablation-season albedo, we find higher coefficients of determination between mean ablation-season albedo and glaciological mass balance at UG1-E and Tuyuksu. In contrast, for Golubin and Glacier No. 354, glaciological mass balance is higher correlated to minimum ablation-season albedo than mean ablation-season albedo. This difference is related to the glaciological mass-balance time period. The relationship between albedo and glaciological mass balance is obtained over a shorter time for Golubin (8 years) and Glacier No. 354 (9 years) than for UG1-E (20 years) and Tuyuksu (20 years). Nonetheless, based on the correlativity between MODIS-derived mean ablation-season albedo and minimum ablation-season albedo and glaciological mass balance of Golubin and Glacier No. 354 over the 2011-2019 period, the annual SMB for these glaciers can be reconstructed using the albedo method over the period 2000-2010. Comparison with previously reconstructed results indicated that the mass balance derived from albedo is robust for Glacier No. 354, while for Golubin, the results derived from the albedo method only captured the relative changes in mass balance. The current study suggested that ablation-season albedo can be regarded as a proxy for annual mass balance, and mean ablation-season albedo may be more reliable than minimum ablation-season albedo for some Tien Shan glaciers.

AB  - Except assimilated data of soil moisture (SM), there is always a circumstance that not every spatial point has valid value over a specific region in a day, and there are invalid values or gaps between days in a time series at a spatial point, especially the satellite and ground-based data. Thus, those data are not spatiotemporally seamless on daily time scale, and the seamless data of surface SM is fundamental for research on the land-atmosphere interactions on various time scales. Deep learning methods of multi-perceptron (MLP) and convolution (Conv) neural networks are applied for obtaining spatiotemporally seamless SM over eastern China during MaySeptember of 2015-2020 to combine the advantages of ground-based and remote-sensed data. Firstly, taking atmospheric and land variables as inputs, MLP is trained against the satellite products, including the level-2 product of Chinese FengYun 3C (FY3C), level-3 product of the US Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and level-2 neural network product of the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS). After that, spatiotemporally seamless SM is predicted by MLP, which is stable during training and validation. Compared with the in-situ SM, MLP SM inherits the characteristics of the satellite products, though the quality is slightly improved. Secondly, Conv uses the MLP SM as inputs and is trained against in-situ SM. The unbiased errors are reduced notably that unbiased correlation increases and root mean square errors decreases. At last, from the pattern correlation between precipitation and SM anomalies, the error-reduced Conv SM can well reflect the relationships forced out by the major patterns of rainfall, but the satellite products cannot. In addition, during the evaluation, SMAP has the best quality over eastern China, and SMOS is generally better than FY3C. However, after processed by Conv, the differences of the quality among different satellites are negligible, except some differences in the mean patterns of Conv SM, which is mainly associated with the properties of the satellite products.

TI  - A sensor-agnostic albedo retrieval method forrealistic sea ice surfaces: model and validation
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A framework was established for remote sensing of sea ice albedo that integrates sea ice physics with high computational efficiency and that can be applied to optical sensors that measure appropriate radiance data. A scientific machine learning (SciML) approach was developed and trained on a large synthetic dataset (SD) constructed using a coupled atmosphere-surface radiative transfer model (RTM). The resulting RTM-SciML framework combines the RTM with a multi-layer artificial neural network SciML model. In contrast to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43 albedo product, this framework does not depend on observations from multiple days and can be applied to single angular observations obtained under clear-sky conditions. Compared to the existing melt pond detection (MPD)-based approach for albedo retrieval, the RTM-SciML framework has the advantage of being applicable to a wide variety of cryosphere surfaces, both heterogeneous and homogeneous. Excellent agreement was found between the RTM-SciML albedo retrieval results and measurements collected from airplane campaigns. Assessment against pyranometer data (N=4144) yields RMSE = 0.094 for the shortwave albedo retrieval, while evaluation against albedometer data (N=1225) yields RMSE = 0.069, 0.143, and 0.085 for the broadband albedo in the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave spectral ranges, respectively.

T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Mehao Wildlife Sanctuary, situated in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, is part of an important biodiversity hotspot in the north-eastern part of India in the Himalayas. The current study deals with the identification of important wildlife habitats in the sanctuary. We used a supervised classification technique to delineate these habitats in the sanctuary, which are used by several mammals and bird species encountered during camera trap and sign surveys conducted between November 2017 and May 2020. Satellite images from Sentinel - 2A were used to classify the land use land cover (LULC) of the sanctuary. The LULC information was generated by using a maximum likelihood classifier. We classified a total of thirteen LULC classes, i.e., water, built-up, agriculture, orchard, grassland, bamboo forest, bamboo-mixed forest, riverbed, barren land, snow, wild banana, riverine forest and mixed forest. LULC classification reveals a high percentage of mixed forest, about 69.9%, followed by wild bananas at 7.2%. The commission and omission error rates, however, are high for riverbed and agriculture (0.5) and bamboo forest (0.5), respectively. The accuracy assessment showed an overall classification accuracy of 88.5% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.87. The abundance of mammals was high in the mixed forest, but Ivlev's electivity index shows that species generally avoided this habitat and preferred specialized forest habitats, such as bamboo forest, bamboo-mixed forest, grassland, riverbed and riverine forest. Our LULC map will provide a baseline for potential planning and monitoring changes of wildlife habitats in Mehao WLS.

TI  - Characteristics of Remotely Sensed Urban Pollution Island (UPI) & its Linkage with Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) over Eastern India
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urbanisation and its detrimental impact on climate is a well-documented phenomenon in today's world, but research documenting the Urban Pollution Island (UPI) especially over South Asia is seldom found. With the advancement of the satellite datasets, the quantification of UPI has become possible only in recent years. When measured using satellite data, the UPI is the spatial anomaly of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over an urban area with reference to a nearby non-urban zone. UPI may influence energy budget, precipitation patterns and human health over the city. In the present research, it has been attempted to analyse the climatology and characteristics of UPI and its association with the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) over six cities (Patna, Gaya, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Bardhaman and Siliguri) from eastern India, which is a highly populated region and infamous for climatic concerns. Alongside, a Surface PM2.5 data is also investigated further, to find heat and pollution island links. The UPI-SUHI interactions have been evaluated and found to be very distinct for each city. It is found that high urban AOD value can be noticed irrespective of the UPI magnitude over Patna. Bardhaman has exhibited very high AOD (> 3.0) even in very low UPI conditions. Jamshedpur's urban loadings found to be contributing somewhere to UPI formations. UPII has also shown a clear sign of a seasonal cycle across the cities. In Patna, increase in PM2.5 may be linked to SUHII in medium loading cases and very high PM2.5 loadings (> 200 mu g/m(3)) result in low average SUHII. It may be summarised that Patna, Gaya and Bardhaman are exhibiting high surface PM2.5 loads over urban zones, whilst Ranchi, Siliguri and Jamshedpur have much cleaner urban air. The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test also detected significant increasing trend and change point in recent times for UPI intensity. The well-developed UPI system shows an exigency of more in-depth studies to mitigate the detrimental effects of UPI-SUHI in upcoming times.

TI  - Diversified land conversion deepens understanding of impacts of rapid rubber plantation expansion on plant diversity in the tropics
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the status and changes of plant diversity in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations is essential for sustain-able plantation management in the context of rapid rubber expansion in the tropics, but remains very limited at the continental scale. In this study, we investigated plant diversity from 10-meter quadrats in 240 different rubber planta-tions in the six countries of the Great Mekong Subregion (GMS)-where nearly half of the world's rubber plantations are located-and analyzed the influence of original land cover types and stand age on plant diversity using Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery since the late 1980s. The results indicate that the average plant species richness of rubber plantations is 28.69 +/- 7.35 (1061 species in total, of which 11.22 % are invasive), approximating half the species rich-ness of tropical forests but roughly double that of the intensively managed croplands. Time-series satellite imagery analysis revealed that rubber plantations were primarily established in place of cropland (RPC, 37.72 %), old rubber plantations (RPORP, 27.63 %), and tropical forests (RPTF, 24.12 %). Plant species richness in RPTF (34.02 +/- 7.62) was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that in RPORP (26.41 +/- 7.02) and RPC (26.34 +/- 5.37). More importantly,species richness can be maintained for the duration of the 30-year economic cycle, and the number of invasive species decreases as the stand ages. Given diverse land conversions and changes in stand age, the total loss of species richness due to rapid rubber expansion in the GMS was 7.29 %, which is far below the traditional estimates that only consider tropical forest conversion. In general, maintaining higher species richness at the earliest stages of cultivation has sig-nificant implications for biodiversity conservation in rubber plantations.

TI  - Problematising current coaching strategies from a worldview perspective
T2  - SA JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Orientation: Leaders need goodness-of-fit with the context in which they are leading, and coaching is considered an effective strategy to achieve this.Research purpose: To critically problematise current dominant coaching strategies in terms of their underlying worldviews, in order to assess their potential effectiveness and relevance in enhancing context-leadership goodness-of-fit, given the emerging context faced by leaders.Motivation for the study: The current ever-changing context of leaders requires different thinking, including with regard to coaching. The framework of the coaching landscape, with its associated building blocks, provides the conceptual framework for the review of current coaching strategies. Three dominant worldviews that have historically influenced the thinking in social sciences are employed in this review, namely Newtonian, general systems theory and complexity or chaos (second-order systemic thinking).Research approach/design and method: This was a critical conceptual study aimed at problematising the worldviews informing the currently dominant coaching strategies.Main findings: The problematising of the worldviews underlying the dominant coaching strategies revealed that these strategies are not always informed by a worldview congruent with that demanded by the qualities and features of the world that leaders currently face. There is a pressing need for a coaching strategy informed by a complexity or chaos (second -order systemic) worldview, which better meets the emerging contextual demands and requirements imposed on leaders in practice.Practical/managerial implications: A different coaching strategy, called systemic coaching, is proposed.Contribution/value-add: The proposed systemic coaching strategy is highly suitable to bringing about improved goodness-of-fit between the leader and the emerging context.

TI  - The Wastewater Contamination Index: A methodology to assess the risk of wastewater contamination from satellite-derived water quality indicators
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major sources of pollution affecting inland and coastal waters is related to poorly treated or untreated wastewater discharge, particularly in urbanized watersheds. The excess of nutrients, organic matter, and pathogens causes an overall deterioration of water quality and impairs valuable ecosystem services. The detection of wastewater pollution is essential for the sustainable management of inland and coastal waters, and remote sensing has the capability of monitoring wastewater contamination at extended spatial scales and repeated frequencies. This study employed satellite-derived water quality indicators and spatiotemporal analysis to assess the risk of wastewater contamination in Conceicao Lagoon, a coastal lagoon in Southern Brazil. Using an analytical model, three water quality indicators were derived from Level 2A Sentinel-2 MSI images: the absorption coefficients of chlorophyll-a and detritus combined with coloured dissolved organic matter, and the backscattering coefficient of suspended solids. The temporal standardized anomalies were calculated for each water quality indicator for the period of 2019-2021, and their anomalies during a known outfall event were used to evaluate spatial variation modes. The spatial mode explaining most of the variability was used to estimate weights for the water quality indicators anomalies in a linear transformation that can indicate the risk of wastewater contamination. Results showed that the wastewater spatial mode for this region was characterized by positive anomalies of backscattering coefficient of particulate matter and absorption coefficient of detritus combined with coloured dissolved organic matter, each with a relative importance of 50%. The application of this spatiotemporal analysis was formulated as the Wastewater Contamination Index. With the aid of photographic records, and additional meteorological and water quality data, the results of the index were verified for wastewater outfall events in the study area. The methodology for constructing the proposed Wastewater Contamination Index applies to other locations and can be a valuable tool for operational monitoring of wastewater contamination.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced and indirect computed tomography lymphangiography accurately identifies the cervical lymphocenter at risk for metastasis in pet dogs with spontaneously occurring oral neoplasia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - For dogs with oral tumors, cervical lymph node (LN) metastasis alters treatment and prognosis. It is therefore prudent to make an accurate determination of the clinical presence (cN+ neck) or absence (cN0 neck) of metastasis prior to treatment. Currently, surgical LN extirpation with histopathology is the gold standard for a diagnosis of metastasis. Yet, recommendations to perform elective neck dissection (END) for staging are rare due to morbidity. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with indirect computed tomography lymphangiography (ICTL) followed by targeted biopsy (SLNB) is an alternative option to END. In this prospective study, SLN mapping followed by bilateral END of all mandibular LNs (MLNs) and medial retropharyngeal LNs (MRLNs) was performed in 39 dogs with spontaneously occurring oral neoplasia. A SLN was identified by ICTL in 38 (97%) dogs. Lymphatic drainage patterns were variable although most often the SLN was identified as a single ipsilateral MLN. In the 13 dogs (33%) with histopathologically confirmed LN metastasis, ICTL correctly identified the draining lymphocentrum in all (100%). Metastasis was confined to the SLN in 11 dogs (85%); 2 dogs (15%) had metastasis beyond the SLN ipsilaterally. Contrast enhanced CT features had good accuracy in predicting metastasis, with short axis measurements less than 10.5 mm most predictive. ICTL imaging features alone were unable to predict metastasis. Cytologic or histopathologic SLN sampling is recommended prior to treatment to inform clinical decision-making. This is the largest study to show potential clinical utility of minimally invasive ICTL for cervical LN evaluation in canine oral tumors.

TI  - A method of estimating imperviousness for the catchment modelling of urban environments
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban impervious surfaces, a symbol of urbanisation, have permanently changed urban hydrology behaviour and play a critical role in model-ling the rainfall-runoff process. The distribution pattern of impervious surfaces is intrinsically connected with functional land zoning schemes. However, estimating impervious fractions for catchment modelling is becoming increasingly difficult due to intricate land zoning categories and heterogeneous land use land cover (LULC) during urbanisation. This study demonstrates an integrated approach of deep learning (DL) and the grid sampling method to overcome the challenges of LULC classification, sample standardisation and statistical sample extraction. The classified impervious features were extracted within the land zoning scope and translated into polynomial functions using a probability-fitting approach to measure the occurrence likelihood distribution of the samples' impervious fraction. Then, we use the information entropy (IE) to evaluate prediction stability by quantifying the condition entropy and information gain (IG) from each functional land zones to the occurrence likelihood of different impervious fraction intervals. The DL model shows robust LULC prediction, while the probability-fitting study of imper-vious samples reflects the distribution differential of impervious fractions under the land zoning categories. The IE stability test shows a robust approach that clarifies different confident ranges of imperviousness estimation based on land zoning information.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of the degree of harmony between humanity and nature for national parks in China: A case study of the Three-River-Source National Park
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionNational parks, defined as the mainstay of the nature reserve system in China, pursue to achieve scientific protection and rational utilization of natural resources. However, eco-environmental and socioeconomic benefits are rarely considered together. Hereby, how to quantitatively express the relationship between humanity and nature in national parks needs further exploration. We selected the Three-River-Source National Park (TRSNP), China's largest national park by area and the world's highest altitude national park, as a representative case to construct an evaluation model for the degree of harmony between humanity and the nature of the national alpine ecological park. MethodsBased on the field survey data, the meteorological data, the remote sensing data, and the socioeconomic data, the study used the model inversion and the spatial analysis methods to quantitatively evaluate the degree of harmony consisting of 12 indexes from a fresh perspective of a combination of the ecological environment and social economy. Considering the TRSNP establishment in 2016 as the time node, we assessed and compared the degree of harmony between humanity and nature during the dynamic baseline period (2011-2015) and the evaluation period (2016-2020). ResultsThe results show that the degree of harmony between humanity and nature showed a gradual upward trend from the northwest to the southeast in the TRSNP. Compared with the dynamic baseline period, the eco-environmental and socioeconomic levels of the evaluation period were increased by 34.48 and 5.46%, respectively. Overall, the degree of harmony between humanity and nature visibly increased by 23.38%. DiscussionThis study has developed a novel comprehensive method for evaluating national parks at the regional scale for the win-win goal of both protection and development, and it provides a theoretical basis for effective planning and management policies for national parks.

TI  - The role of harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) products to reveal multiple trajectories and determinants of cropland abandonment in subtropical mountainous areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland abandonment is a widespread land-change process globally, which can stem from the accelerated outmigration of the population from rural to urban areas, socio-economic and political changes, catastrophes, and other trigger events. Clouds limit the utility of optical satellite data to monitor cropland abandonment in highly fragmented mountain agricultural landscapes of tropical and subtropical regions, including the south of China. Taking Nanjing County of China as an example, we developed a novel approach by utilizing multisource satellite (Landsat and Sentinel-2) imagery to map multiple trajectories of cropland abandonment (transitioning from cropland to grassland, shrubs and forest) in subtropical mountainous landscapes. Then, we employed a redundancy analysis (RDA) to identify the spatial association of cropland abandonment considering agricultural productivity, physiography, locational characteristics and economic factors. Results indicate the great suitability of harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images to distinguish multiple trajectories of cropland abandonment in subtropical mountainous areas. Our framework of mapping cropland abandonment resulted in good producer's (78.2%) and user's (81.3%) accuracies. The statistical analysis showed 31.85% of croplands cultivated in 2000 were abandoned by 2018, and more than a quarter of townships experienced cropland abandonment with high abandoned rates (>38%). Cropland abandonment mainly occurred in relatively unfavorable areas for agricul-tural production, for instance with a slope above 6 degrees. Slope and the proximity to the nearest settlement explained 65.4% and 8.1% of the variation of cropland abandonment at the township level, respectively. The developed approaches on both mapping cropland abandonment and modeling determinants can be highly relevant to monitor multiple trajectories of cropland abandonment and ascribe their determinants not only in mountainous China but also elsewhere and thus promote the formulation of land-use policies that aim to steer cropland abandonment.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On 21 May 2021, an earthquake of moment magnitude (Mw) 7.4 occurred near Maduo county in Qinghai Province China. This is the first major earthquake that occurred in the interior of the Bayan Har block in the Tibetan Plateau over the past 70 decades. Focusing on this event, we conducted a study on three-dimensional (3D) coseismic displacement reconstruction and its tectonic implication. We acquired both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imaging satellite imagery, including SAR images from Sentinel-1 and Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) as well as the multi-spectrum images from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite. We applied the Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and pixel-offset tracking (POT) techniques to coseismic SAR data pairs and reconstructed two dimensional displacements. With the constructed displacement fields in multiple viewing directions, we resolved the 3D coseismic displacements (north-south, east-west, and up components) by integrating the regional strain model with variance components estimation (SM-VCE). We recommend using the standard deviation value at each grid cell, which can be calculated in the resampling, as the initial weight. Based on the resolved 3D coseismic displacements, we further estimated the dip angles for the two segments (F4 and F5) in the east of the rupture zone. The associated moment magnitude is about Mw7.4, which corresponds to the released energy of & SIM; 1.74 x 10 (20) Nm.

In this study, we assessed the forest fire susceptibility in Istanbul Province and Thrace Region, Turkiye using a well-known machine learning technique, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Benefiting from freely available Earth Observation datasets such as Sentinel-2 images, Tree Cover Density from European Union (EU) European Environment Agency (EEA) Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, etc., and a forest inventory with ignition locations recorded over a period of eight years, we utilized a total of 16 independent and one dependent variables. The variables can be categorized as anthropogenic, topographic, vegetation, and hydrological factors. A ratio of 1:2 was preferred for the fire/non-fire location samples. The results show that the ANN exhibited high prediction performance with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) value and F-1 score of 0.94 and 0.80, respectively. Based on feature importance analyses, we found that a humanrelated factor, proximity to forest roads, was the most predictive input variable. The ANN model trained with openly available data (i.e., without forest database) also yielded a high F-1 score, but produced maps with fewer details. Our results confirm that data-driven machine learning methods are promising for regional forest fire susceptibility assessments and can be extended further for other regions by deriving similar parameters from freely available Earth Observation datasets.

TI  - Machine learning technology for early prediction of grain yield at the field scale: A systematic review
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Machine learning (ML) has become an important technology for the development of prediction models for crop yield. Predictive modeling using ML is rapidly growing as research addresses early predictions versus predictions shortly before harvest, predictions at the scale of field or region, and predictions for different types of crops. This great diversity of prediction tasks requires a proper choice of specific ML techniques to attain high levels of performance. Therefore, this review focuses on a distinct prediction task and aims to provide task-specific in-sights into the adoption of ML. The objective of our research is to investigate ML approaches for the early prediction of grain yield at the field scale. We identified studies published between 2014 and 2021 through a systematic search in Scopus and Web of Science for journal articles and a retrieval of analogous articles from three previous reviews. The study selection process included screening, full-text assessment, and data extraction by two independent coders. Of 924 unique records identified in the search and retrieval, 157 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 46 studies met all inclusion criteria. The results paint a comprehensive picture of the ML techniques used, revealing the richness of data collection, preprocessing, model training, and model eval-uation. Specifically, the results highlight (1) a wide range of prediction horizons from a few weeks up to more than eight months before harvest; (2) a large set of input data representing weather, crop management, site characteristics, and vegetation properties; (3) a low level of adoption of feature selection methods to enhance performance; (4) some lack of information on the size of the training and test sets required to assess their suitability; and (5) heterogeneity in the reporting of performance metrics that hinders the comparison and integration of evidence from individual studies. To overcome barriers to the accumulation of evidence, we suggest recommendations for enhanced reporting and building greater consensus regarding the most appropriate performance metrics.

TI  - Grounding line retreat and tide-modulated ocean channels at MoscowUniversity and Totten Glacier ice shelves, East Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Totten and Moscow University glaciers, located in East Antarctica, contain 5.1 m sea-level equivalent of ice and have been losing mass over recent decades. Using ICESat-2 laser altimetry repeat track analysis and satellite radar interferometry from Sentinel-1a/b synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, we mapped the grounding line (GL) locations of these two glaciers between 2017 and 2021. By comparing the 2017-2021 GL measurements with historic GLs, we detected pervasive GL retreats along the ice plains at the glacier central trunk of Totten Glacier Ice Shelf (TGIS) and Moscow University Ice Shelf (MUIS). The GL retreated 3.51 +/- 0.49 km at TGIS, while it retreated 13.85 +/- 0.08 km at MUIS from 1996. Using CryoSat-2 radar altimetry, we found that the observed GL retreats are coincident with high thinning rates, in addition to high ice velocities, indicating a mass loss pattern dominated by ice dynamics. We also identified two tide-modulated ocean channels on Totten Glacier Eastern Ice Shelf (TGEIS) and Moscow University Western Ice Shelf (MUWIS), where the ocean channel widths are highly correlated with the differential tidal amplitudes. The opening of the MUWIS ocean channel connects the two previously separated TGIS and MUIS systems, which might open a pathway for the warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water to enter the main MUIS cavity and facilitate further GL retreat.

TI  - A satellite-based hybrid model for trophic state evaluation in inland waters across China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is one of the major threats to the inland water ecosystem. Satellite remote sensing provides a promising way to monitor trophic state at large spatial scale in an efficient manner. Currently, most satellitebased trophic state evaluation approaches have focused on water quality parameters retrieval (e.g., transparency, chlorophyll-a), based on which trophic state was evaluated. However, the retrieval accuracies of individual parameter do not meet the demand for accurate trophic state evaluation, especially for the turbid inland waters. In this study, we proposed a novel hybrid model to estimate trophic state index (TSI) by integrating multiple spectral indices associated with different eutrophication level based on Sentinel-2 imagery. The TSI estimated by the proposed method agreed well with the in-situ TSI observations, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.93 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 13.77%. Compared with the independent observations from Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the estimated monthly TSI also showed good consistency (RMSE = 5.91,MAPE = 10.66%). Furthermore, the congruent performance of the proposed method in the 11 sample lakes (RMSE = 5.91, MAPE = 10.66%) and the 51 ungauged lakes (RMSE = 7.16, MAPE = 11.56%) indicated the favorable model generalization. The proposed method was then applied to assess the trophic state of 352 permanent lakes and reservoirs across China during the summers of 2016-2021. It showed that 10%, 60%, 28%, and 2% of the lakes/reservoirs are in oligotrophic, mesotrophic, light eutrophic, and middle eutrophic states respectively. Eutrophic waters are concentrated in the Middle-and-Lower Yangtze Plain, the Northeast Plain, and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Overall, this study improved the trophic state representativeness and revealed trophic state spatial distribution of Chinese inland waters, which has the significant meanings for aquatic environment protection and water resource management.

TI  - A new rice identification algorithm under complex terrain combining multi-characteristic parameters and homogeneous objects based on time series dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of rice-growing areas is essential to ascertain the spatial distribution of rice fields, and ensure food security. It is a challenging task to timely and accurate identify rice under the complex terrain due to its diversified land cover, small- or middle-sized rice fields with fragmented distribution. In this paper, the time series VV and VH backscatter coefficient datasets were first constructed based on 411 sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in Chongqing city with complex terrain. Then, the rice multi-characteristic parameters, including SAR backscatter features, composite features, rice phenological parameters, texture features and topographic features, were generated. On this basis, the homogeneous image objects were produced. Furthermore, a rice identification algorithm combining multi-characteristic parameters and homogeneous objects based on time series dual-polarization SAR (MPHO-DPSAR) was established. The research demonstrated that the MPHO-DPSAR algorithm can achieve accurate mapping of small and medium-sized and fragmented rice fields in regions under complex terrain according to the accuracy evaluation at three levels and the comparison with other three classical rice identification methods. The suitability and limitations of proposed MPHO-DPSAR algorithm were also discussed from the aspects of SAR data temporal and spatial resolution, rice phenology, and surface landscape complexity.

TI  - Long-term changes in hydrology of warm Mediterranean wetlands under land use land cover change
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands in warm Mediterranean regions are strongly influenced by land use land cover change (LULCC). Studying the effects of LULCC on wetlands can prevent further destruction of these valuable ecosystems in the future. Here, LULCC effect on hydrological changes in Ajigol, Almagol and Alago international wetlands in northern Iran, was investigated using Long-term hydrological impact assessment (L-THIA) model and satellite images (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) during 1987-2018. The L-THIA model estimates direct runoff based on the CN method for LULCC classes using multi-time satellite images. Wetland water volume calibrated based on inflow and outflow, and its balance was investigated using STELLA method. The results showed that the most LULCC was observed in agricultural lands and residential areas with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 0.93 and 0.8, respectively. During the evaluation period, the area of Almagol, Alagol and Ajigol wetlands decreased by 78.0, 74.0 and 23.0%, respectively. The L-THIA model showed that LULCCs have directly affected the three wetlands over time. A correlation coefficient (R-squared) of 0.70, 0.64 and 0.60 was observed between modeled and actual water volume in Almago, Ajogol and Alagol wetlands, respectively, under LULCCs. Also, the water volume of Almagol, Alagol and Ajigol wetlands decreased by 51.0, 42.0 and 52.0%, respectively. Overall, ecological land management can lead to physical protection of wetlands.

TI  - Seeing is Believing: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of the Experiences of the ?Spiritual But Not Religious? in Britain
T2  - SECULARISM & NONRELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - A majority of the British population now consider themselves not religious, but many of these individuals still have some beliefs they consider spiritual. This study explores the connections between the beliefs and practices of five British participants who identified as 'spiritual but not religious' (SBNR). Semi-structured interviews with each participant were analyzed inductively using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). This analysis developed seven sub-themes that were organized into two superordinate themes: 'Experiencing Transcendence' and 'Constructing a Personal Spirituality'. The participants' spirituality was an important part of their identities and lives. They pragmatically and eclectically drew on a wide range of spiritual tools and resources to enrich their lives. In a complex world where they considered traditional sources of religious or spiritual authority untrustworthy, the participants developed their own answers to existential questions that resonated with their own experiences of the world. Both their personal experiences and sociocultural influences were important in shaping and sustaining the participants' worldviews and practices. These idiosyncratic ways that individuals made sense of their experiences show why it is important the research tools used to study worldview dynamics are sensitive to a wide range of factors and the iterative interactions between them.

TI  - Coupling physical constraints with machine learning for satellite-derived evapotranspiration of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - More accurate and process-based satellite evapotranspiration (ET) estimation for the Tibetan Plateau (TP)-the Third Pole of the world-have long been of major interest in hydrometeorology. Combining recent advances in satellite-based ET mechanistic algorithms and data-oriented methods allows ET hybrid modeling by coupling physical constraints with machine learning (ML). Specifically, we developed two hybrid models, a surface conductance-based ML model (ML-Gs) and a soil evaporation-based ML model (ML-Es), to estimate regional ET on the TP. These hybrid models have biophysical framework, under which one of the parameters or components is modeled using ML. Hybrid models make ML complementary to the process-based ET framework, which to find an optimal junction between well physical mechanism and high model performance. The daily ET estimates were evaluated at 28 eddy covariance flux tower sites, as well as by comparison with two process-based ET algorithms (a Penman-Monteith-based ET-PM algorithm and a Priestley-Taylor-based ET-PT algorithm) and a data-oriented pure ML method. The hybrid models decreased the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of two physical algorithms (1.11 mm/day for ET-PM, 1.09 mm/day for ET-PT) to 0.50 mm/day, and increased the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) (0.35 for ET-PM, 0.36 for ET-PT) to 0.92. Our hybrid models also showed improved performance (KGE of 0.65) than pure ML (KGE of 0.62) at data-sparse regions as well as for the responses to extreme weather events. It indicates that our approach does not only boost the ET simulation accuracy, but also improve the physical un-derstanding of ML-based ET estimation. More importantly, ML-Es focuses on the ET components on the TP and is more well-defined than ML-Gs. An innovation of our approach is that for data-sparse regions and extreme cases, the more robust physical mechanism was coupled, the better generalization performance of hybrid model could achieve. The spatiotemporal ET patterns based on our hybrid models were consistent with the variations in local climatic regions and could provide critical information on the understanding of hydrological processes under the global and regional climate changes.

TI  - Crustal deformation study of Kashmir basin: Insights from PSInSAR based time series analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the rate of deformation of the Kashmir basin has been determined using the Sentinel-1A based Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR). The study reveals highest rate of uplift in the Pir-Panjal range (8-13 mm/y) whereas, in the Saribal range the rate of upliftment is 5-6 mm/y. The line of sight displacement in the Kashmir basin was recorded in the range of-20 to +30 mm/y over the period of 2015 to 2021. However, the temporal displacement variation in the Kashmir valley varies in different years during the observation period and was found maximum in the year 2021. The Persistent Scatterer Inter-ferometry (PSI) clearly show dominant uplift in the valley and surrounding hill ranges. The PSInSAR results were further validated with the GPS based deformation rates, which indicates a maximum of 10 mm/yr of deformation in the study area. The high / lows of gravity and magnetic based surveys are well corroborated with the observed positive and negative anomalies of present PSInSAR velocity results. Further, the Global Positioning System (GPS) based crustal strain results are also collectively substantiating our PSInSAR based crustal behaviour of the Kashmir basin.

TI  - The risk of injuries during work and its association with precipitation: New insight from a sentinel-based surveillance and a case-crossover design
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInjuries during work are often exogenous and can be easily influenced by environmental factors, especially weather conditions. Precipitation, a crucial weather factor, has been linked to unintentional injuries, yet evidence of its effect on work-related injuries is limited. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the impact of precipitation on injuries during work as well as its variation across numerous vulnerability features. MethodsRecords on the work-related injury during 2016-2020 were obtained from four sentinel hospitals in Guangzhou, China, and were matched with the daily weather data during the same period. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover design followed by a conditional logistic regression to evaluate the association between precipitation and work-related injuries. Covariates included wind speed, sunlight, temperature, SO2, NO2, and PM2.5. Results were also stratified by multiple factors to identify the most vulnerable subgroups. ResultsDaily precipitation was a positive predictor of work-related injuries, with each 10 mm increase in precipitation being associated with an increase of 1.57% in the rate of injuries on the same day and 1.47-1.14% increase of injuries on subsequent 3 days. The results revealed that precipitation had a higher effect on work-related injuries in winter (4.92%; 95%CI: 1.77-8.17%). The elderly (2.07%; 95%CI: 0.64-3.51%), male (1.81%; 95%CI: 0.96-2.66%) workers or those with lower educational levels (2.58%; 95%CI: 1.59-3.54%) were more likely to suffer from injuries on rainy days. There was a higher risk for work-related injuries caused by falls (2.63%; 95%CI: 0.78-4.52%) or the use of glass products (1.75%; 95%CI: 0.49-3.02%) on rainy days. ConclusionsPrecipitation was a prominent risk factor for work-related injury, and its adverse effect might endure for 3 days. Certain sub-groups of workers were more vulnerable to injuries in the rain.

TI  - Between Bacchae and Bahanalii-balkanizing classical reception
T2  - CLASSICAL RECEPTIONS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article sets Euripides' Bacchae in dialogue with Goran Stefanovski's Bahanalii, a play that was performed in the immediate aftermath of Yugoslavia's break-up. Contrapuntal reading shows how the two plays problematize conservative epistemologies by imagining their borderlands as privileged sites of knowledge production. Euripides' Bacchae opens with a Dionysus who arrives on stage from a faraway land where Greeks and non-Greeks live mixed together. My reading of this passage challenges Edward Said's interpretation of the Bacchae as a play about the dangers of 'what lies beyond familiar borders'. Instead, the Bacchae performs an exercise in literary imagination in which a border-minded worldview responds to Athens' dwindling geopolitical prestige, resists narratives of Greek exceptionalism inherited in the aftermath of the Persian wars, and foresees a return to a kind of Hellenic balkanization avant la lettre. In Bahanalii, Stefanovski resists idealizing mindsets by staging a contradictory Dionis, one that focalizes the epistemological power of the border, while also embodying the uncanny poltergeist of the violence that plagued Yugoslavia in the 1990s. In juxtaposing the narratives of Yugoslav and ancient Athenian exceptionalism, this comparison unlocks a 'balkanizing' paradigm of classical reception which complements and complicates existing theoretical accounts of classical reception.

TI  - Sub-continental-scale carbon stocks of individual trees in African drylands
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of dryland trees and their density, cover, size, mass and carbon content are not well known at sub-continental to continental scales(1-14). This information is important for ecological protection, carbon accounting, climate mitigation and restoration efforts of dryland ecosystems(15-18). We assessed more than 9.9 billion trees derived from more than 300,000 satellite images, covering semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa north of the Equator. We attributed wood, foliage and root carbon to every tree in the 0-1,000 mm year(-1) rainfall zone by coupling field data(19), machine learning(20-22), satellite data and high-performance computing. Average carbon stocks of individual trees ranged from 0.54 Mg C ha(-1) and 63 kg C tree(-1) in the arid zone to 3.7 Mg C ha(-1) and 98 kg tree(-1) in the sub-humid zone. Overall, we estimated the total carbon for our study area to be 0.84 (& PLUSMN;19.8%) Pg C. Comparisons with 14 previous TRENDY numerical simulation studies(23) for our area found that the density and carbon stocks of scattered trees have been underestimated by three models and overestimated by 11 models, respectively. This benchmarking can help understand the carbon cycle and address concerns about land degradation(24-29). We make available a linked database of wood mass, foliage mass, root mass and carbon stock of each tree for scientists, policymakers, dryland-restoration practitioners and farmers, who can use it to estimate farmland tree carbon stocks from tablets or laptops.

TI  - Temporal stability of long-term satellite and reanalysis products to monitor snow cover trends
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring snow cover to infer climate change impacts is now feasible using Earth observation data together with reanalysis products derived from Earth system models and data assimilation. Temporal stability becomes essential when these products are used to monitor snow cover changes over time. While the temporal stability of satellite products can be altered when multiple sensors are combined and due to the degradation and orbital drifts in each sensor, the stability of reanalysis datasets can be compromised when new observations are assimilated into the model. This study evaluates the stability of some of the longest satellite-based and reanalysis products (ERA5, 1950-2020, ERA5-Land, 1950-2020, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Data Record (NOAA CDR), 1966-2020) by using 527 ground stations as reference data (1950-2020). Stability is assessed with the time series of the annual bias in snow depth and snow cover duration of the products at the different stations.Reanalysis datasets face a trade-off between accuracy and stability when assimilating new data to improve their estimations. The assimilation of new observations in ERA5 improved its accuracy significantly during the recent years (2005-2020) but introduced three negative step discontinuities in 1977-1980, 1991-1992, and 2003-2004. By contrast, ERA5-Land is more stable because it does not assimilate snow observations directly, but this leads to worse accuracy despite having a finer spatial resolution. The NOAA CDR showed a positive artificial trend from around 1992 to 2015 during fall and winter that could be related to changes to the availability of satellite data. The magnitude of most of these artificial trends and/or discontinuities is larger than actual snow cover trends and the stability requirements of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). The use of these products in seasons and regions where artificial trends and discontinuities appear should be avoided.The study also updates snow trends (1955-2015) over local sites in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), corroborating the retreat of snow cover, driven mainly by an earlier melt and recently by a later snow onset. In warmer regions such as Europe, snow cover decrease is coincident with a decreasing snow depth due to less snowfall, while in drier regions such as Russia, earlier snowmelt occurs despite increased maximum seasonal snow depth.

TI  - Cropformer: A new generalized deep learning classification approach for multi-scenario crop classification
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficient crop classification using remotely sensed data can provide fundamental and important information for crop yield estimation. Existing crop classification approaches are usually designed to be strong in some specific scenarios but not for multi-scenario crop classification. In this study, we proposed a new deep learning approach for multi-scenario crop classification, named Cropformer. Cropformer can extract global features and local features, to solve the problem that current crop classification methods extract a single feature. Specifically, Cropformer is a two-step classification approach, where the first step is self-supervised pre-training to accumulate knowledge of crop growth, and the second step is a fine-tuned supervised classification based on the weights from the first step. The unlabeled time series and the labeled time series are used as input for the first and second steps respectively. Multi-scenario crop classification experiments including full-season crop classification, in-season crop classification, few-sample crop classification, and transfer of classification models were conducted in five study areas with complex crop types and compared with several existing competitive approaches. Experimental results showed that Cropformer can not only obtain a very significant accuracy advantage in crop classification, but also can obtain higher accuracy with fewer samples. Compared to other approaches, the classification performance of Cropformer during model transfer and the efficiency of the classification were outstanding. The results showed that Cropformer could build up a priori knowledge using unlabeled data and learn generalized features using labeled data, making it applicable to crop classification in multiple scenarios.

TI  - A simple and efficient strategy for trace detection of ferroptosis-related miRNAs based on novel hydrophobic paper-based plasmonic substrate and "inverse molecular sentinel (iMS)" nanoprobes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring ferroptosis-related miRNAs is crucial for the treatment and prognosis of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. In this work, a novel hydrophobic paper (h-paper)-based plasmonic substrate was produced by dropping DS Au nanorods with a narrow range of sizes and morphologies onto h-paper. Raman reporter molecules were adsorbed to the array surface, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectra at randomly selected points reveal uniform and significant SERS enhancement. Hairpin DNAs labelled with Raman reporters and hybridized with placeholder DNAs were decorated on SERS substrate to fabricate SERS biosensor. Target miRNAs initiated the "inverse Molecular Sentinel " process. During the process, PHs were removed and the conformation of HPs changed toward the hairpin structure, thus eliciting the proximity of Raman reporter to substrate and a stronger SERS signal. The proposed SERS biosensor performs well in terms of stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. The limits of detection of miR-122-5p and miR-140-5p in serum were 4.17 aM and 4.49 aM, respectively. Finally, the fabricated SERS biosensor was applied to detect miR-122-5p and miR-140-5p in ICH patients and healthy subjects, and the results obtained by SERS were consistent with the results from quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, revealing the accuracy of the method. This simple, rapid approach offers great potential for the simultaneous detection of miRNAs in practical clinical applications.

TI  - A method for mapping and monitoring of iron ore stopes based on hyperspectral remote sensing-ground data and a 3D deep neural network
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research explores a new hyperspectral remote sensing processing method that combines remote sensing and ground data, and builds a model based on a novel 3D convolutional neural network and fusion data. The method can monitor and map changes in iron ore stopes. First, we used an unmanned aerial vehicle-borne hyperspectral imager to take a hyperspectral image of the iron ore stope; second, collected iron ore samples and then used a ground-based spectrometer to measure the spectral data of these samples; third, combined the hyperspectral remote sensing data with the ground data and then proposed a data augmentation method. Fourth, based on the 3D convolutional neural network and deep residual network, an iron ore stope classification model is proposed. Finally, the model is applied to monitor and map iron ore stopes. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective, and the overall accuracy is 99.62% for the five-class classification problem. The method provides a quick, accurate, and low-cost way to monitor iron ore stopes.

TI  - Comparable biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks on warming from tropical moist forest degradation
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests have undergone extensive deforestation and degradation during the past few decades, but the area and the carbon loss due to degradation could be larger than the losses from deforestation. Degraded forests also induce biophysical feedback on climate, as they sustain less cooling from evapotranspiration. Here we estimate the biophysical and biogeochemical temperature changes caused by tropical moist forest degradation using high-resolution remote sensing data from 2010. Degraded forests, including burned, isolated, edge and other degraded forests, account for 24.1% of the total tropical moist forest area. The land surface temperature of degraded tropical moist forests is higher than that of nearby intact forests, leading to a warming effect of 0.022 +/- 0.014 degrees C over the tropics. The cumulative carbon deficit of degraded forests reaches 6.1 +/- 2.0 PgC, equivalent to a biogeochemical warming effect of 0.026 +/- 0.013 degrees C. Forest degradation caused by anthropogenic disturbances from 1990 to 2010 induces a daytime warming effect of 0.018 +/- 0.008 degrees C and a carbon deficit of 2.3 +/- 0.8 PgC. These values are of the same order of magnitude as those due to deforestation. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for the combined biophysical and biogeochemical effects in mitigation pledges related to reducing forest degradation and the restoration of tropical forest.Biophysical and biogeochemical effects of forest degradation cause comparable temperature increases in tropical rainforests, according to analyses of high-resolution satellite observations.

TI  - Monitoring and Modelling Morphological Changes in Rivers Using RS and GIS Techniques
T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN
M3  - Article
AB  - River geomorphological investigation issues have received little attention in most countries of the world. Such processes become a pressing necessity due to climate change and anticipated events of extraordinary surges and dry seasons, which may debilitate the security of adjacent and downstream cities, particularly in locales that are exceedingly delicate and influenced by climatic changes. Al-Abbasia reach is a river that runs through the middle of the Euphrates River and is known for its numerous bends and meanders. The study of hydraulic structures such as barrages can provide important information about their influences on morphological processes in river reaches near the barrage upstream and downstream. Hydraulic analysis is made of the river behavior in u/s and d/s of hydraulic structures like barrages as a result of sediment deposition and erosion in u/s and d/s. A study, i.e., research on the impacts of the Abbassia barrage on the river system, has been conducted to address this issue using multi-temporal Landsat satellite data from 1976 to 2022 provided by the USGS. The study reach is located 5 kilometres upstream and 5 kilometres downstream of the Abbassia reach. Following the construction of the barrage, which had an impact on the sedimentation and geometry of the river, morphological variations took place in this part of the Al Abbassia reach. In this study, morphological changes throughout 49 years between 1976 and 2022 were investigated utilising remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) approaches. Additionally, four image groups from three separate decades were used to perform change detection (1990-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2022). In this study, a monitoring system using Landsat-3 MSS: 1985, Landsat-5 TM: 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and Landsat-8 OLI: 2010, 2011, 2015, 2021, 2022 were employed to map river planform changes. The long-term comparison of this series of satellite images and historical maps for the period 1976-2022 indicates a continuation of change in the reach study with a rate of approximately 56, 33, 97, and 55% for upstream and 19%, 26%, 3%, and 45% for downstream for the width, area, deposition, and erosion, respectively. Furthermore, it is observed that there is a shift in river course within 200 m downstream of the barrage for the period of 1985-1990. The findings of this study, which monitor river morphological change at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, are crucial for promoting sustainable river management. They also aid in the investigation of river behaviour, which is necessary for providing the best management possible and overcoming the difficulties posed by this important research issue.

TI  - Conceptual Representations in Sherko Bekas'<i> Gray:</i> A Cognitive Stylistic Study
T2  - ARAB WORLD ENGLISH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper aims to examine Bekas' worldview (mind style) in the selected poem Gray from a cognitive stylistic perspective. The concept of mind style, which refers to any particular linguistic representation of an individual's mental self, encompasses the process of "reality formation" in one's mind. In cognitive stylistics, the worldview (mind style) of the poet, narrator and character is formed from and displayed through the linguistic structure of the text. Therefore, the highlighted research question is: How is Bekas' worldview constructed and represented in the selected poem? This study is essential for readers and listeners because it will assist them in interpreting poetic texts so they can comprehend the poet's worldview. To achieve the main aim, the researchers will apply the cognitive linguistic theories of schema, conceptual metaphor, and conceptual metonymy, all of which are concerned with the representation of conceptual structures. These cognitive theories are considered strong and dynamic theories in accounting for cognitive processes that underpin the production and interpretation of various types of discourse, whether factual or fictional, by forming mental representations in the mind. More specifically, schema theory can be used to explain how text worlds are created and processed during discourse processing, primarily when reading poetry. Additionally, schema theory involves researching mental models, which entails analysing how poets think about the world in contrast to readers. To examine the poet's worldview, the researchers also use perspective and foregrounding in construal dimensions. Since the study is qualitative, the study's data will be limited to the analysis of Bekas' Gray. The study has concluded that Bekas views the world pessimistically and hopelessly.

TI  - A preliminary assessment of Sentinel-3 ocean and land color instrument data for the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration using bio-optical methods in Annaba Bay and El Kala's coast (Algerian Basin)
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of bio-optical methods and high spatial and spectral resolution satellite sensors has enabled the estimation of chlorophyll -a (Chl-a) on a large spatiotemporal scale. However, their application on a regional scale necessitates validation and, in certain cases, calibration, especially when it comes to coastal waters. This study was carried out in the eastern Algerian coastal waters to evaluate the relevance of Sentinel-3 satellite data in Annaba Bay and El Kala's coast. Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Color Instrument) Level-2 products (OC4Me and Chl-a NN) and the Chl-a generated by applying the C2RCC processor on Level-1B (Chl-a C2RCC) were compared to the measured Chl-a at fixed locations. In addition, nine other Chl-a algorithms have been tested. Finally, six of those later were locally calibrated. The results demonstrate the good performance of the initially available products (Chl-a C2RCC and Chl-a NN), followed by the blue-green algorithms (OC4, OC5, OC6, MedOC4, and ADOC4), whereas the near-infrared (NIR) algorithms (2B-OLCI, 3B-OLCI, and G2B) show underwhelming performance and very poor prediction of the Chl-a concentration. Even though the OC4Me has the best correlation (r = 0.9820), it also has the highest MAE, RMSD, and BIAS (0.628, 1.264, and 0.5696, respectively). The fit of the NIR methods has been significantly refined. Nevertheless, their performance is still inadequate for the estimation of the Chl-a in our region. The performance of the calibrated OCx was improved, with the OC6-AW at the top of the list (r = 0.9881, MAE = 0.08). The latter outperforms the existing ones, which improves the estimation of Chl-a based on the Sentinel-3 OLCI data in our study area.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cloud-Based Remote Sensing for Wetland Monitoring-A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The rapid expansion of remote sensing provides recent and developed advances in monitoring wetlands. Integrating cloud computing with these techniques has been identified as an effective tool, especially for dealing with heterogeneous datasets. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to determine the current state-of-the-art knowledge for integrating remote sensing and cloud computing in the monitoring of wetlands. The results of this SLR revealed that platform-as-a-service was the only cloud computing service model implemented in practice for wetland monitoring. Remote sensing applications for wetland monitoring included prediction, time series analysis, mapping, classification, and change detection. Only 51% of the reviewed literature, focused on the regional scale, used satellite data. Additionally, the SLR found that current cloud computing and remote sensing technologies are not integrated enough to benefit from their potential in wetland monitoring. Despite these gaps, the analysis revealed that economic benefits could be achieved by implementing cloud computing and remote sensing for wetland monitoring. To address these gaps and pave the way for further research, we propose integrating cloud computing and remote sensing technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor wetlands effectively.

TI  - Modeling Soil CO<sub>2</sub> Efflux in a Subtropical Forest by Combining Fused Remote Sensing Images with Linear Mixed Effect Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring tropical and subtropical forest soil CO2 emission efflux (FSCO2) is crucial for understanding the global carbon cycle and terrestrial ecosystem respiration. In this study, we addressed the challenge of low spatiotemporal resolution in FSCO2 monitoring by combining data fusion and model methods to improve the accuracy of quantitative inversion. We used time series Landsat 8 LST and MODIS LST fusion images and a linear mixed effect model to estimate FSCO2 at watershed scale. Our results show that modeling without random factors, and the use of Fusion LST as the fixed predictor, resulted in 47% (marginal R-2 = 0.47) of FSCO2 variability in the Monthly random effect model, while it only accounted for 19% of FSCO2 variability in the Daily random effect model and 7% in the Seasonally random effect model. However, the inclusion of random effects in the model's parameterization improved the performance of both models. The Monthly random effect model that performed optimally had an explanation rate of 55.3% (conditional R-2 = 0.55 and t value > 1.9) for FSCO2 variability and yielded the smallest deviation from observed FSCO2. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating random effects and using Fusion LST as a fixed predictor to improve the accuracy of FSCO2 monitoring in tropical and subtropical forests.

TI  - Smaller is better? Unduly nice accuracy assessments in roof detection using remote sensing data with machine learning and k-fold cross-validation
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving the thematic accuracy of models is a fundamental part of image classification analyses. K-fold cross-validation (KCV), as an accuracy assessment technique, can be biased because existing built-in algorithms of software solutions do not handle the high autocorrelation of remotely sensed images, leading to overestimation of accuracies. We aimed to quantify the magnitude of the overestimation of KCV-based accuracies and propose a method to overcome this problem with the example of rooftops using a WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite image, and two orthophotos. Random split to training/testing subsets, independent testing and different types of repeated KCV sampling strategies were used to generate input datasets for classification. Results revealed that applying the random splitting of reference data to training/testing subsets and KCV methods had significantly biased the accuracies by up to 17%; overall accuracies (OAs) can incorrectly reach >99%. We found that repeated KCV can provide similar results to independent testing when spatial sampling is applied with a sufficiently large distance threshold (in our case 10 m). Coarser resolution of WV2 ensured more reliable results (up to a 5-9% increase in OA) than orthophotos. Object-based pixel purity of buildings showed that when using a majority filter for at least of 50% of objects the final accuracy approached 100% with each sampling method. The final conclusion is that KCV-based modelling ensures better accuracy than single models (with better pixel purity on the object level), but the accuracy metrics without spatially filtered sampling are not reliable.

TI  - Art Anthropology Study on Turkmen Handwoven and Handkerchiefs Motifs
T2  - BAGH-E NAZAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem statement: Turkmen handwoven and handkerchiefs are a field of native arts that, while meeting the needs of life and highlighting the artistic identity, have been a vehicle for revealing beliefs through the representation of abstract motifs. The critical point in these works is the importance and exceptional attention to the semantic and belief-oriented aspects of the motifs, along with the aesthetic dimension. This issue is relatively less in other nomadic societies. In the lifestyle of Turkmen society, there is a prominent presence of ancient (shamanic) and religious beliefs, rituals, and teachings that are presented to the audience through abstract artworks. Therefore, we can do an anthropological study on the Turkmen weavers' worldview, which presents in the paintings. This approach seeks to study and understand artworks' content in their creators' cultural context. So the central question of the research is, what are the anthropological characteristics of Turkmen handwoven and handkerchief motifs? And how can we study their semantics and aesthetics in terms of this aspect and Turkmen cultural contexts? Research objective: This study attempts to examine and understand Turkmen's handmade motifs in the context of Turkmen weaving culture. Research method: The type of this study is qualitative and developmental and its method is descriptive-analytical with a library data collection. Conclusion: The dominant style of painting motifs is more discrete than abstract. Also, the motifs are created relying on beliefs more than they have aesthetics (decorative) and symbolic and semantic aspects. Most of the motifs include the group of protective motifs (prayer, spell, armband), ram, local birds, and flowers (bergamot) That has a special marker and form in each tribe. Also, handmade have special functions.

TI  - Between Tolstoyan dogmas and ideals: The worldview of the writer Ivan Nazhivin in 1904-1914
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The author studies the evolution of religious, ethical and social views of the writer Ivan Nazhivin in 1904-1914. A few works on Nazhivin's writing touch upon his worldview only tangentially. Therefore, the dynamics of his philosophical searches is shown as simplified and stereotypic: Nazhivin, a Tolstoy's follower, breaks with previous ideals and becomes a monarchist during the Civil War. The study is aimed to present and explain a different point of view: Nazhivin gradually rejected Tolstoyism ideals a bit earlier, within the decade from pre-revolutionary 1904 to the beginning of World War I. The author uses the sources of different groups to solve this problem. Nazhivin's literary works of the beginning of the 20th century, his publicistic articles of the end of the 1900s and the beginning of the 1910s and his later memoires of the 1930s had substantial significance. However, these sources would not allow the author to fully present the evolution of Nazhivin's worldview in terms of general historic events and the development of the Tolstoyan movement of that period. To do this, the author also uses other materials: Nazhivin's, Tolstoy's and Tolstoyans' correspondence, procedure documents of the police department, printed press articles, memoires of those who sympathised with Tolstoyans' ideas. The results of the study are given in a problem and chronological order. In 1904-1907, Nazhivin had first doubts in the Tolstoyan's program of self-perfection that did not comply with the atmosphere of a revolution rise. In contrast to Nazhivin's later refusal to accept the events of 1905, his attitude to the revolution was not so definite at that time. Wishing to support the changes in his own manner, the writer started to help people who refused to serve in the army and spread the knowledge of religious doctrines close to Tolstoyism. However, Nazhivin's doubts, even stronger, arose again after the revolution was defeated - in the period of an active growth of Tolstoyism. The writer's worldview crisis was amplified when he became closely acquainted with peasants and workers and then when his elder daughter tragically died in 1909. At the beginning of the 1910s, Nazhivin rejected the rationalist principles of Tolstoyan religion and narodniks' optimism of Tolstoyism sharply criticising the moral views of Russian people and intellectuals; Nazhivin's former comrades were also hard hit. The writer then gave up vegetarianism and attempts to garden on his own. In the end, after World War I had started, Nazhivin did not support Tolstoyans' anti-war campaign and stroke Valentin Bulgakov back; it was his final re- jection of Tolstoyan non-resistance. Thus, the evolution of Nazhivin's worldview was completed by 1914 with his refusal of the main religious, ethical and social principles of Tolstoyism. Nevertheless, in conclusion the author mentions that Nazhivin's devotion to Tolstoyism left its marks on him. It is not difficult to find the echo of Tolstoyan ideals in his later literary works; they came in full force in his historiosophic ideas of the 1920s-1930s.

TI  - Mapping potential groundwater accumulation zones for Karachi city using GIS and AHP techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Karachi is the largest industrial metropolitan of Pakistan facing an acute water shortage which is leading to an overdraft of groundwater resources in the city. Groundwater is an important freshwater resource for the city as millions of people depend for sustenance. However, over-exploitation of groundwater has led to decreased groundwater levels within the city leading to environmental issues of depleting aquifers, deteriorating groundwater quality, land subsidence, and harm to groundwater-dependent ecosystems. The objective of the study was to assess the potential groundwater accumulation zones by integrating hydrogeological aspects of the city through nine thematic layers using the Geographic Information System (GIS) based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique. The potential groundwater accumulation map reveals that 20% of the area has a low potential, 70% has moderate potential, and around 10% of the area in the city is composed of a high potential accumulation zone. The upstream regions of the city have the highest recharge potential because of sandy soil and barren land use, which promote high infiltration rates. The urbanized downstream areas have the lowest recharge potential due to impervious fabric. The findings reveal that the MCDA technique can be used with confidence in data-scarce regions for groundwater resource assessment and management. The recharge potential map can help better manage groundwater resources in the city by helping explore groundwater extraction opportunities and could hint at areas suitable for artificial recharge wells/ponds.

TI  - Does neoadjuvant chemotherapy provide any benefit for surgical de-escalation in luminal B, HER2(-) breast cancers?
T2  - CIRUGIA Y CIRUJANOS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in less aggressive breast cancer (BC) is controversial. Objective. To investigate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2 negative luminal B breast cancer. Patients and methods.Patients between January 2016 and December 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. Results. A total of 128 patients were included in the study. Patients with pathological complete response (pCR) were younger and had higher ki67 levels. Cutoff levels for ki67 based on pCR and ypT status were <= 40% and <= 35%, respectively. According to pre-NAC magnetic resonance imaging findings, only mastectomy was viable in 90 patients, but after NAC breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was possible in 29 (32%). Moreover, 68.5% became eligible for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NAC. Since SLNB was positive in 45 (54.2%), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed and the remainder, 38 (31.4%), avoided ALND. Conclusion.In patients with Luminal B, HER2(-) BC a low pCR rate should not discourage the use of NAC. The ki67 level is a guide for individualizing treatment. Especially in young patients with high ki67 levels, NAC increases the chance of breast-conserving surgery and may spare patients from ALND.

TI  - Investigating the nutritional potential and vegetation blueprint mapping of Acacia tortilis and <i>Acacia ehrenbergiana</i> from the origin of Fujairah, UAE, for Arabian Tahr as native fodder plants
T2  - ADVANCEMENTS IN LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Acacia ehrenbergiana and Acacia tortilis are the native plant of the Emirates of Fujairah, UAE. The qualities of these plants of bearing harsh environmental conditions makes it prime focus for native fodder plants for Arabian tahr and the priority plants for the Higher authorities in Fujairah.Methods: The following study has assessed the comparative nutritional values of Acacia tortilis and Acacia ehrenbergiana. The analyses have been determined by international standard procedures using Gravimetry, Soxhlet extraction, HPLC, and ICP-OES(AOAC 962.09, AOAC 941.12). The vegetation mapping for the blooming period has been done by NVDI using data from Sentinel-2 satellite. The statistics of agricultural and non-agriculture areas in kilometer square (km2) have been found to confirm the findings of the NDVI using the satellite images.Results: The study has highlighted the importance of these native plants as a fodder plant for Arabian tahr as potential source of potassium, calcium, and magnesium and phosphorus. Furthermore, the native plant's mapping showed Emirates of Fujairah's vegetation during March to May 2022. Conclusion: Results shows that the A. ehrenbergiana is comparatively healthier diet for Arabian Tahr than Acacia tortilis. Tahr can get on average 400 mg/100g of four important minerals including K, Ca, P and Mg while Acacia tortilis could provide 174 mg/100g. Moreover, the native plant's vegetation mapping can work as blueprint and will help identify plant dispersion and expansion planning.

TI  - Dynamic Change in Normalised Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 2015 to 2021 in Dhofar, Southern Oman in Response to the Climate Change
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change poses a major threat to vegetation and land cover worldwide. The loss of vegetation as a result of climate change can alter the functions and structure of the environment and its ecological systems. In the first part of this study, Sentinel-2 data, normalised different vegetation index (NDVI), and multiple regression methods were used to examine the impacts of the climatic factors of humidity, rainfall, and air temperature on vegetation dynamics from 2015 to 2021 in Dhofar, Southern Oman. In the second part of this study, random forest regression was employed to model the relationships between the NDVI and temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil map, geology map, topographic wetness index, curvature, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to buildings, and distance to roads. The multiple regression values revealed significant associations between the spatial distributions of the NDVI and the abovementioned climatic factors. The findings also indicated an increase of 1 degrees C in air temperature fluctuations between 2018 and 2021 over all five sites, with a strong tendency over Qairoon Hairiti Mountain. The rainfall records clearly indicated an increasing tendency from 2018 to 2020 due to the impact of frequent cyclones. Therefore, the results revealed a significant increase of 0.01 in the vegetation cover trend in 2018, 2019, and 2020 along the Sadah Mountain range and the eastern part of the Jabal Qara Mountains under the areas directly impacted by the cyclone, whereas there was a decrease along the western mountain range consisting of Jabal Qara and Jabal Qamar Mountains due to the impact of warm, dry air. The results revealed that NDVI values were sensitive to heavy rainfall over Jabal Samhan Mountain. The 12 variables that influenced NDVI levels had different levels of importance. Soil types, elevation, slope, rainfall, curvature, humidity, and temperature had the highest importance, while topographic wetness index, distance to urban area, aspect, distance to roads, and geology map had the lowest. The findings provide a significant foundation for Oman's planning and management of regional vegetation, water conservation, and animal husbandry.

TI  - To Admit or Not to Admit to the Emergency Department: The Disposition Question at a Tertiary Teaching and Referral Hospital
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Disposition decision-making in the emergency department (ED) is crucial to patient safety and quality of care. It can inform better care, lower chance of infections, appropriate follow-up care, and reduced healthcare costs. The aim of this study was to examine correlates of ED disposition among adult patients at a teaching and referral hospital based on patients' demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics. Method: A cross-sectional study conducted at the ED of the King Abdulaziz Medical City hospital in Riyadh. A two-level validated questionnaire was used-a patient questionnaire and healthcare staff/facility survey. The survey employed a systematic random sampling technique to recruit subjects at a pre-specified interval as patients arrived at the registration desk. We analyzed 303 adult patients visiting the ED, who were triaged, consented to participate in the study, completed the survey, and admitted to a hospital bed or discharged home. We used descriptive and inferential statistics to summarize and determine the interdependence and relationships of variables. We used logistic multivariate regression analysis to establish relationships and the odds of admission to a hospital bed. Results: The mean age of the patients was 50.9 (SD = 21.4, Range 18 to 101). A total of 201 (66%) were discharged home while the rest were admitted to a hospital bed. Results of the unadjusted analysis suggest that older patients, males, patients with low level of education, and those with comorbidities and middle-income were more likely to be admitted to the hospital. The results of the multivariate analysis suggest that patients with comorbidities, urgent conditions, prior history of hospitalization, and higher triage levels were more likely to be admitted to a hospital bed. Conclusions: Having proper triage and timely stopgap review measures in the admission process can help new patients to locations that best support their needs and improve the quality and efficiency of the facility. The findings may be a sentinel indicator that informs overuse or inappropriate use of EDs for non-emergency care, which is a concern in the Saudi Arabian publicly funded health system.

T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Neom is expected to face climate and environmental challenges, including the provision of water and the mitigation of flood and drought risks. The field data for identifying the potential risk zones are limited. I utilized remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to identify such zones. The datasets used here included drainage density, lineament density, precipitation, elevation, lithology, slope, soil, and land use/land cover. These data were analyzed using a weighted overlay analysis in a GIS environment. The analysis successfully mapped the potential groundwater, flood, and drought zones in Neom. The zone with a good potential for groundwater covered 515 km(2) of Neom, whereas 11,562, 10,616, and 289 km(2) of land had a moderate, poor, and very poor chance of having groundwater, respectively. The area with the lowest flood danger covered only 195 km(2), whereas the areas with a low, moderate, and high flooding risk covered 4355, 13,542, and 4910 km(2) of land, respectively. The results of the overlay analysis showed that low and very low drought risks were associated with 4322 and 44 km(2) of land, respectively. In turn, 10,615 and 8266 km(2) of the region were at a moderate and high drought risk, respectively.

TI  - The Influence of Obesity on Melanoma and Sentinel Lymph Node Diagnosis: A Retrospective Monocentric Study in 1001 Patients
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The impact of obesity on melanoma has rarely been researched. Incidence of obesity is rapidly growing and melanoma is one of the most prevalent types of cancers worldwide. Several studies have shown that overweight and obese populations not only have a higher risk of developing melanoma but also tend to present with thicker melanomas at the time of diagnosis. Given that melanoma thickness is one of the main predictors of the melanoma prognosis, a worse prognosis in a patient with obesity would be expectable. However, this has not yet been demonstrated in the literature. Our study is the first to show that obese patients are twice more likely to present with lymph-node metastases. Lymph node metastases is the second most important prognosis predictor of melanoma. Our findings, therefore, raise important questions regarding the screening and treatment of obese patients with melanoma. (1) Background: While obesity is a known independent risk factor in the development of melanoma, there is no consensus on its influence on melanoma prognosis. (2) Methods: In a monocentric retrospective study, data was collected from patients who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for stage IB-IIC melanoma between 2013 and 2018. Patients were divided into groups according to their body mass index (BMI). The association between BMI and melanoma features, as well as the risk factors for metastases in SLN were examined. (3) Results: Of the 1001 patients, 336 had normal weight (BMI < 25), 402 were overweight (BMI >= 25 and <30), 173 obese (BMI >= 30 and <35) and 90 extremely obese (BMI >= 35). Overweightness and obesity were associated with higher tumor thicknesses at time of diagnosis. Ulceration was not influenced by the patient's weight. Metastases in sentinel lymph node was almost twice more likely in extremely obese patients than in normal weight patients. Independent risk factors for metastases in SLN in our study were tumor thickness, ulceration, and BMI > 35. (4) Conclusions: This is the first study to show higher metastases rates in high-BMI patients with melanoma, raising important questions regarding the screening and treatment of this specific patient population.

TI  - Study on Atmospheric Water Resource Variation Characteristics in China and Influencing Factors of Precipitation Efficiency of Hydrometeors
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of atmospheric water resources in each region of China is essential for their exploitation. In this study, we focus on the variation in atmospheric precipitable water (PW), cloud parameters, cloud water resources (CWR), and precipitation efficiency of hydrometeors (PEh) as well as their possible influencing factors in each region of China in summer using ERA5 and MODIS data. The results showed that: (1) In the past 42 years, PW increased significantly in the northwest and Tibetan Plateau regions, and both cloud cover and total column cloud water content decreased significantly in northern China, except for medium-cloud cover which significantly increased in the Tibetan Plateau. (2) In the past 20 years, annual PEh was significantly higher, with clear interdecadal variation in most regions, whereas CWR decreased in northern China, the southwest, central region, and southeast, and increased in northeast and Tibetan Plateau. (3) PEh in each region was greatly influenced by precipitation (correlation coefficient 0.55 < R < 0.82 *, * = p < 0.05), having a significant positive correlation in the northeast with cloud water path, cloud optical thickness, and aerosol optical depth (0.44 * < R < 0.54 *), and a significant negative correlation in the central region with the cloud effective radius (R = -0.54 *).

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of climate and irrigated vegetation cover changes and their role in lake water level depletion using a pixel-based approach and canonical correlation analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Urmia, located in northwest Iran, was among the world's largest hypersaline lakes but has now experienced a 7 m decrease in water level, from 1278 m to 1271 over 1996 to 2019. There is doubt as to whether the pixel-based analysis (PBA) approach's answer to the lake's drying is a natural process or a result of human intervention. Here, a non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to a 21-year record (2000-2020) of satellite data products, i.e., temperature, precipitation, snow cover, and irrigated vegetation cover (IVC). The Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform utilized over 10 sub-basins in three provinces surrounding Lake Urmia to obtain and calcu-late pixel-based monthly and seasonal scales for the products. Canonical correlation analysis was employed in order to understand the correlation between variables and lake water level (LWL). The trend analysis results show significant increases in temperature (from 1 to 2 degrees C during 2000-2020) over May-September, i.e., in 87 %-25 % of the basin. However, precipitation has seen an insignificant decrease (from 3 to 9 mm during 2000-2019) in the rainy months (April and May). Snow cover has also decreased and, when compared with precipitation, shows a change in precipita-tion patterns from snow to rain. IVC has increased significantly in all sub-basins, especially the southern parts of the lake, with the West province making the largest contribution to the development of IVC. According to the PBA, this analysis underpins the very high contribution of IVC to the drying of the lake in more detail, although the contribution of climate change in this matter is also apparent. The development of IVC leads to increased water consumption

TI  - Potential of Using Night-Time Light to Proxy Social Indicators for Sustainable Development
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-observed night-time light (NTL) data provide a measure of the lighting brightness seen from space at different times and spatial and temporal resolutions, thus offering opportunities to explore them in many applications at different spatial locations (global, regional, local). However, most applications to date have been at relatively large spatial scales, despite the need to measure indicators at a local level. This paper sets out an analysis of the potential of NTL data for populating indicators at more local (neighbourhood, street) scales. We first reviewed the overall potential of NTL data for social indicators at different spatial scales by using a systematic search of the literature and applying the Maturity Matrix Framework (MMF). We also explored a case study (Durango State, Mexico) using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imageries, other geospatial data, and the social gap index (SGI) to identify social gaps at the local scale. The literature review showed that NTL can play a role in supporting 49 out of 192 sustainable development goal (SDG) indicators having a focus on social issues, but most of these have been explored at the global or country scales. In the case study, we found that low radiance is indeed associated with higher SGI levels (i.e., more social deprivation) and vice versa. However, more research is needed from other contexts to support a link between NTL radiance levels and social indicators at local scales.

TI  - Predictive factors of preoperative sentinel lymph node detection in intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In endometrial cancer (EC), sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has emerged as an alternative to systematic lymphadenec-tomy. Little is known about factors that might influence SLN preoperative detection. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and techni-cal variables that may influence on the success of SLN detection in preoperative lymphatic mapping in patients with intermediate and high-risk EC when performing transvaginal ultrasound-guided myometrial injection of radiotracer (TUMIR).METHODS: Between March 2006 and March 2017, we prospectively enrolled patients with histologically confirmed EC with intermediate or high-risk of lymphatic involvement. All women underwent SLN detection by using TUMIR approach. After radiotracer injection, pelvic and abdominal planar and SPECT/CT images were acquired to obtain a preoperative lymphoscintigraphic mapping. Pattern of drainage was regis-tered and analyzed to identify the factors directly involved in drainage. Sonographer learning curves to perform TUMIR approach were created following Cumulative Sum and Wright methods. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using logistic regression.RESULTS: During study period, 123 patients were included. SLN preoperative detection rate was 70.7%. Age under 75 years at diagnosis (P<0.01), radiotracer injection above 4 mL -high-volume-(P<0.01), and tumoral size below 2 cm (P=0.04) were associated with higher SLN preoperative detection rate. Twenty-five procedures were necessary to attain an adequate performance in TUMIR approach.CONCLUSIONS: The higher SLN preoperative detection rate in women with intermediate and high-risk endometrial cancer after TUMIR ap-proach was related with younger age, smaller tumors and high-volume injection of radiotracer. Sonographers are required to perform 25 proce-dures before acquiring an expertise in radiotracer injection.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Land Cover on Groundwater Quality in a Smart City Using GIS and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to assess the impacts of land cover on groundwater quality by integrating physico-chemical data and satellite imageries. Initially, fourteen groundwater parameters of both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon were collected from nineteen sampled stations and water quality index (WQI) was calculated. Consequently, Google earth, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2A imageries were considered for land cover mapping including the concentration of settlement and urban built-up, greenery coverage, and micro-level land use. Two machine learning models such as artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) were used for pixel-based classification and establish spatial relation between water quality and land cover. This study trained and tested the models for the whole study area as well as 500m buffers from each sampled station. The result of model's validation including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Kappa statistic (K), overall accuracy of model (OAC), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicated that random forest classifier has better performance than the artificial neural network. The results show that the testing dataset of pre-monsoon season has higher accuracy with MAE 0.343, RMSE 0.397, K value 0.55, and ROC value 0.838 to envisage the impact of land cover on groundwater quality in comparison to post-monsoon season. The results also reveal that the classification accuracy is greater within 500m buffer areas in comparison to the whole study area with a close to 0 values of MAE and RMSE, and absolutely 1 value of K and ROC. Based on the above findings, the present study suggested considering a large scale for determining the controlling factors of groundwater degradation.

TI  - Deriving Coastal Shallow Bathymetry from Sentinel 2-, Aircraft- and UAV-Derived Orthophotos: A Case Study in Ligurian Marinas
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric surveys of shallow waters are increasingly necessary for navigational safety and environmental studies. In situ surveys with floating acoustic sensors allow the collection of high-accuracy bathymetric data. However, such surveys are often unfeasible in very shallow waters in addition to being expensive and requiring specific sectorial skills for the acquisition and processing of raw data. The increasing availability of optical images from Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles, aircrafts and satellites allows for bathymetric reconstruction from images thanks to the application of state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we illustrate a bathymetric reconstruction procedure involving the classification of the seabed, the calibration of the algorithm for each class and the subsequent validation. We applied this procedure to high-resolution, UAV-derived orthophotos, aircraft orthophotos and Sentinel-2 Level-2A images of two marinas along the western Ligurian coastline in the Mediterranean Sea and validated the results with bathymetric data derived from echo-sounder surveys. Our findings showed that the aircraft-derived bathymetry is generally more accurate than the UAV-derived and Sentinel-2 bathymetry in all analyzed scenarios due to the smooth color of the aircraft orthophotos and their ability to reproduce the seafloor with a considerable level of detail.

TI  - Method for Frequent High Resolution of Optical Sensor Image Acquisition using Satellite-Based SAR Image for Disaster Mitigation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Method for frequent high resolution of optical sensor imagery data acquisition from satellite-based SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) image for disaster mitigation is proposed. The proposed method is based on Generative Adversarial Network: GAN-based super resolution and conversion method from a SAR imagery data to the corresponding optical sensor imagery data in order to increase observation frequency. Through experiments, it is found that it is possible to convert SAR imagery data to the corresponding optical sensor imagery data and also found that the spatial resolution of SAR imagery data is improved remarkably. Thus, initial stage of disaster (small scale of disaster) can be detected with resolution enhanced optical sensor imagery data derived from the corresponding SAR imagery data which results in prevention of secondary occurrence of relatively large scale of disaster. It is also found that 2.5 m of spatial resolution of optical sensor imagery data can be acquired every 2.5 days in the case that only Sentinel-1/SAR and Sentinel-2/MSI (Multi Spectral Imager) are used, for instance.

TI  - Present-Day Surface Deformation in North-East Italy Using InSAR and GNSS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geodetic data can detect and estimate deformation signals and rates due to natural and anthropogenic phenomena. In the present study, we focus on northeastern Italy, an area characterized by similar to 1.5-3 mm/yr of convergence rates due to the collision of Adria-Eurasia plates and active subsidence along the coasts. To define the rates and trends of tectonic and subsidence signals, we use a Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) approach called the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS), which is based on the detection of coherent and temporally stable pixels in a stack of single-master differential interferograms. We use Sentinel-1 SAR images along ascending and descending orbits spanning the 2015-2019 temporal interval as inputs for Persistent Scatterers InSAR (PSI) processing. We apply spatial-temporal filters and post-processing steps to reduce unrealistic results. Finally, we calibrate InSAR measurements using GNSS velocities derived from permanent stations available in the study area. Our results consist of mean ground velocity maps showing the displacement rates along the radar Line-Of-Sight for each satellite track, from which we estimate the east-west and vertical velocity components. Our results provide a detailed and original view of active vertical and horizontal displacement rates over the whole region, allowing the detection of spatial velocity gradients, which are particularly relevant to a better understanding of the seismogenic potential of the area. As regards the subsidence along the coasts, our measurements confirm the correlation between subsidence and the geological setting of the study area, with rates of similar to 2-4 mm/yr between the Venezia and Marano lagoons, and lower than 1 mm/yr near Grado.

TI  - Global Water Quality of Inland Waters with Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Using Cloud-Computed Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling inland water quality by remote sensing has already demonstrated its capacity to make accurate predictions. However, limitations still exist for applicability in diverse regions, as well as to retrieve non-optically active parameters (nOAC). Models are usually trained only with water samples from individual or local groups of waterbodies, which limits their capacity and accuracy in predicting parameters across diverse regions. This study aims to increase data availability to understand the performance of models trained with heterogeneous databases from both remote sensing and field measurement sources to improve machine learning training. This paper seeks to build a dataset with worldwide lake characteristics using data from water monitoring programs around the world paired with harmonized data of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Additional feature engineering is also examined. The dataset is then used for model training and prediction of water quality at the global scale, time series analysis and water quality maps for lakes in different continents. Additionally, the modeling performance of nOACs are also investigated. The results show that trained models achieve moderately high correlations for SDD, TURB and BOD (R-2 = 0.68) but lower performances for TSM and NO3-N (R-2 = 0.43). The extreme learning machine (ELM) and the random forest regression (RFR) demonstrate better performance. The results indicate that ML algorithms can process remote sensing data and additional features to model water quality at the global scale and contribute to address the limitations of transferring and retrieving nOAC. However, significant limitations need to be considered, such as calibrated harmonization of water data and atmospheric correction procedures. Moreover, further understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate nOAC prediction is necessary. We highlight the need for international contributions to global water quality datasets capable of providing extensive water data for the improvement of global water monitoring.

TI  - A CONCERT THAT BRINGS SPIRITUAL ENLIGHTENMENT (A.G. SCHNITTKE "CONCERT FOR A MIXED CHOIR IN FOUR PARTS" TO VERSES FROM THE BOOK OF SORROWFUL SONGS BY GRIGOR NAREKATSI)
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The choir concert was created by A.G. Schnittke from 1984-1985 to the text of the third chapter of the Book of Sorrowful Songs by an Armenian poet of the Middle Ages, Grigor Narekatsi (951-1003).Four sections of the 3rd chapter are embodied by the composer in four parts of the concert. The content and composition of the concert show the features of a Christian outlook: part I ("Oh, the lord of everything that gives us invaluable gifts") - high praise addressed to God; Part II (" The collection of these songs, where every verse is filled with sorrow") - the tears of a repentant confession, sorrow from the consciousness of one's sinfulness; Part III ("To all those who delve into the essence of mournful words" is a passionate prayer addressed to the Almighty; Part IV ("This work that I began with hope and Your Name") is heavenly comfort, peace, hope in God.As is known, polystylistics occupied a large place in the musical work of the composer. This was reflected in the score of the Choir concert. Allusions arise in the work, which make it possible to identify certain stylistic models at the musical level. So, we can talk about certain associations with the technique of the medieval organum, Baroque music, with the musical style of G. Schutz, and, without a doubt, with the old Russian znamenny chant, choral concerts of Russian composers of the XVIII century, and more broadly - in general Russian choral culture.In addition, in the concert one can note the orientation towards the melody of Armenian chants as the most important stylistic source.However, the choir concert of A.G. Schnittke - a work of the twentieth century, the musical language of which reflects the characteristics of the individual style of the composer. This is evidenced by: microtonal deviations, multimodal structures, polyphony of formations, complex vertical complexes, polyaccordica, atonal formations, etc.Continuous movement, which does not lead to qualitative changes, the so-called " dynamic statics" (E. Orlova) is in this work the dramatic basis for the development of musical form. This type of drama is common in church music, in which there can be no conflict, confrontation.The figurative unity in the concert is associated with the use of such universal "leitsseries" as: 1) reliance on rhetorical figures (especially such as catabasis, anabasis, saltus-duriusculus etc.); 2) the contrast of smooth movement and jumps over wide, including dissonant intervals (uv. 8, m. 9); 3) the principle of singing the reference tone; 4) echo effect.The composer as a whole relies on a chord warehouse and creates a work that is characterized by the simplicity and rigor of musical expression. Polyphonic performances are presented at the concert (as a rule, in the form of canonical imitation). They are different in functional purpose. For example, in Part II, canonical conducts are built by analogy with the dialogical speech form. In the third part, imitation development is directed towards exacerbation of expression. At the same time, the unity of polyphonic and homophonic-harmonic warehouses is noted.High spirituality, uniting the medieval poet and masters of the twentieth century, provides the basis for creating a masterpiece that reflects the depth of the Christian worldview, opening new horizons in the spiritual formation of society.

TI  - Mapping Forest Cover and Estimating Soil Organic Matter by GIS-Data and an Empirical Model at the Subnational Level in Mexico
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play an essential role in climate change as they are the terrestrial ecosystems that store the highest C content in their soils and biomass. Despite this, the lack of information at the subnational level hinders their proper management and conservation. This study aimed to identify the extension and distribution of forests and to develop an empirical model for the spatial prediction of soil organic matter (SOM) in Ixtacamaxtitlan, Puebla, Mexico, based on environmental variables generated through Geographical Information Systems. A supervised classification in Landsat 8 images was used to define the forest cover, and environmental variables related to topography, climate and vegetation were generated. Finally, a Multiple Linear Regression model validated with the leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to examine the relationships between the covariates and the SOM and estimate its content in forest. The results show that the forest cover extension is 41%, with an overall accuracy of 97.7%. The model shows a good fit (R-cv(2) = 0.69, RMSEcv = 1.53). The mean of SOM was 5.2%, and upper values were consistent with higher altitude, precipitation and cooler temperature. Estimating SOM content in forest areas is essential in developing planning strategies at the subnational level to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change.

TI  - A Principal Component Analysis Methodology of Oil Spill Detection and Monitoring Using Satellite Remote Sensing Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring, assessing, and measuring oil spills is essential in protecting the marine environment and in efforts to clean oil spills. One of the most recent oil spills happened near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, caused by Hurricane Ida (Category 4), that had a wind speed of 240 km/h. In this regard, Earth Observation (EO) Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) images can effectively highlight oil spills in marine areas as a "fast and no-cost" technique. However, clouds and the sea surface spectral signature complicate the interpretation of oil spill areas in the optical images. In this study, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been applied of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 SRS images to improve information from the optical sensor bands. The PCA produces an output unrelated to the main bands, making it easier to distinguish oil spills from clouds and seawater due to the spectral diversity between oil, clouds, and the seawater surface. Then, an additional step has been applied to highlight the oil spill area using PCAs with different band combinations. Furthermore, Sentinel-1 (SAR), Sentinel-2 (optical), and Landsat-8 (optical) SRS images have been analyzed with cross-sections to suppress the "look-alike" effect of marine oil spill areas. Finally, mean and high-pass filters were used for Land Surface Temperature (LST) SRS images estimated from the Landsat thermal band. The results show that the seawater value is about -17.5 db and the oil spill area shows a value between -22.5 db and -25 db; the Landsat 8 satellites thermal band 10, depicting contrast at some areas for oil spill, can be determined by the 3 x 3 and 5 x 5 Kernel High pass and the 3 x 3 Mean filter. The results demonstrate that the SRS images should be used together to improve oil spill detection studies results.

TI  - An Assessment of Geospatial Analysis Combined with AHP Techniques to Identify Groundwater Potential Zones in the Pudukkottai District, Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is critical to the socioeconomic development of any region. Infiltration of surface water into the ground is influenced by a variety of factors such as soil pores, folds, fractures, faults, and joints, all of which contribute to groundwater recharge. Groundwater is an important source of freshwater in the drought-prone Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu, India. Therefore, the search for groundwater potential zones (GWPZs) is critical. The present study focuses on the investigation of potential groundwater zones using geospatial techniques. Geology, land use and land cover, geomorphology, soil, drainage density, lineament, and groundwater levels were obtained from state and non-state associations. ArcGIS version 10.8 was used to create all thematic layers and classified grids. The intensive use of groundwater in arid and semiarid regions is becoming a problem for the public to meet their freshwater needs. The condition of arid and semi-arid regions due to intensive groundwater extraction has become one of the most important environmental problems for the public. In this study, a powerful groundwater potential mapping technique was developed using integrated remote sensing data from GIS-AHP. Using AHP techniques, thematic layers for geology, geomorphology, and soil followed by drainage, drainage density and lineament, lineament density, slope, water level, and lithological parameters were created, classified, weighted, and integrated into a GIS environment. According to the results of the study, it is estimated that 14% of the groundwater potential in the study area is good, 49% is moderate and 36% is poor. A groundwater level map was used to verify the groundwater potential. In addition, the model was validated with a single-layer sensitivity analysis, which showed that geology was the most influential layer and water level was the least influential thematic layer. The low-potential areas identified on the groundwater potential map can be used for further study to identify ideal locations for artificial recharge. In low potential areas, the groundwater potential map can be used to find ideal locations for artificial recharge. The water table in the area must be raised by artificial recharge structures such as infiltration basins, recharge pits, and agricultural ponds. Artificial recharge structures such as infiltration basins, recharge pits, and agricultural ponds can be used for groundwater development in the low potential zones. The GWPZ map was successfully validated with three proxy data, such as the number of wells, groundwater level, and well density, obtained from well inventory information. The results of this study will improve our understanding of the geographic analysis of groundwater potential and help policy makers in this drought-prone area to create more sustainable water supply systems.

TI  - Assessment of RXD Algorithm Capability for Gas Flaring Detection through OLI-SWIR Channels
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The environment, the climate and human health are largely exposed to gas flaring (GF) effects, releasing significant dangerous gases into the atmosphere. In the last few decades, remote sensing technology has received great attention in gas flaring investigation. The Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ), located in the south of Iran, hosts many natural oil/gas processing plants and petrochemical industries, making this area one of the most air-polluted zones of Iran. The object of this research is to detect GF-related thermal anomalies in the PSEEZ by applying, for the first time, the Reed-Xiaoli Detector (RXD), distinguished as the benchmark algorithm for spectral anomaly detection. The RXD performances in this research field have been tested and verified using the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of OLI-Landsat 8 (L8), acquired in 2018 and 2019 on the study area. Preliminary results of this automatic unsupervised learning algorithm demonstrated an exciting potential of RXD for GF anomaly detection on a monthly scale (75% success rate), with peaks in the months of January and February 2018 (86%) and December 2019 (84%). The lowest detection was recorded in October 2019 (48%). Regarding the spatial distribution of GF anomalies, a qualitatively analysis demonstrated the RXD capability in mapping the areas affected by gas flaring, with some limitations (i.e., false positives) due to possible solar radiation contribution. Further analyses will be dedicated to recalibrate the algorithm to increase its reliability, also coupling L8 and Landsat 9, as well as exploring Sentinel 2 SWIR imagery, to overcome some of the observed RXD drawbacks.

TI  - AVHRR NDVI Compositing Method Comparison and Generation of Multi-Decadal Time Series-A TIMELINE Thematic Processor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image composites are crucial for a wide range of remote sensing applications, such as multi-decadal time series analysis. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument has provided daily data since the early 1980s at a spatial resolution of 1 km, allowing analyses of climate change-related environmental processes. For monitoring vegetation conditions, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most widely used metric. However, to actually enable such analyses, a consistent NDVI time series over the AVHRR time-span needs to be created. In this context, the aim of this study is to thoroughly assess the effect of different compositing procedures on AVHRR NDVI composites, as no standard procedure has been established. Thirteen different compositing methods have been implemented; daily, decadal, and monthly composites over Europe and Northern Africa have been calculated for the year 2007, and the resulting data sets have been thoroughly evaluated according to six criteria. The median approach was selected as the best-performing compositing algorithm considering all the investigated aspects. However, the combination of the NDVI value and viewing and illumination angles as the criteria for the best-pixel selection proved to be a promising approach, too. The generated NDVI time series, currently ranging from 1981-2018, shows a consistent behavior and close agreement to the standard MODIS NDVI product. The conducted analyses demonstrate the strong influence of compositing procedures on the resulting AVHRR NDVI composites.

TI  - SCALABLE DATA PROCESSING PLATFORM FOR EARTH OBSERVATION DATA REPOSITORIES
T2  - SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation (EO) satellite data is essential to environmental monitoring. At a national and regional level, the open data cubes harness the power of satellite data by providing application programming interfaces and services to the end-users. The volume and the complexity of satellite observations are increasing, demanding novel approaches for data storing, managing, and processing. High-performance computing (HPC) and cloud platforms may improve Big EO data processing performance. However, it is necessary to consider several vital aspects for efficient and flexible EO data processing, such as the interoperability from cloud-HPC and EO data repositories, automatic provisioning and scaling of cloud-HPC resources, cost-effectiveness, support of new EO data formats and open-source packages, or linkage with data cube platforms. The article proposes a scalable EO data processing platform interoperable from cloud-HPC and EO data repositories. The platform enables linking any data repository supporting web coverage service or SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog Application Programming Interfaces (STAC-API), and any cloud or HPC resource supporting scheduling system API for providing access to the cluster backends.

TI  - Site Assessment and Layout Optimization for Rooftop Solar Energy Generation in Worldview-3 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the growth of residential rooftop PV adoption in recent decades, the problem of effective layout design has become increasingly important in recent years. Although a number of automated methods have been introduced, these tend to rely on simplifying assumptions and heuristics to improve computational tractability. We demonstrate a fully automated layout design pipeline that attempts to solve a more general formulation with greater geometric flexibility that accounts for shading losses. Our approach generates rooftop areas from satellite imagery and uses MINLP optimization to select panel positions, azimuth angles and tilt angles on an individual basis rather than imposing any predefined layouts. Our results demonstrate that shading plays a critical role in automated rooftop PV optimization and significantly changes the resulting layouts. Additionally, they suggest that, although several common heuristics are often effective, they may not be universally suitable due to complications resulting from geometric restrictions and shading losses. Finally, we evaluate a few specific heuristics from the literature and propose a potential new rule of thumb that may help improve rooftop solar energy potential when shading effects are considered.

TI  - Shoreline extraction and analyzing the effect of coastal structures on shoreline changing with remote sensing and geographic information system: Case of Samsun, Turkey
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and man-made effects may produce dynamic changes in coastal areas. Analysis of changes in the shorelines of water bodies like seas, lakes, and wide rivers from remote sensing images is a critical issue for different applications such as monitoring coastal erosion and accretion, coastal zone management, watershed definition, flood prediction, and water resource management. This study has been done to extract and analyze the change in the shoreline around the area of the Derekoy Port and Tekkekoy Shipyard between 1995 and 2021. Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing were used for data processing, analysis, and presenting the result. An ArcGIS extension softwares, the Landsat toolbox was used to extract the shoreline using a combination of NDVI and Tasseled Cap Transformation methods, and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System was used to analyze the change of the shoreline based on the reference baseline, transects and shoreline parameters. Linear Regression Rate, End Point Rate, Shoreline Change Envelope, and Net Shoreline Movement methods have been used to analyze the change of the shoreline. The calculated result of the EPR and LRR methods were highly correlated with the coefficient of determination (R-square) 0.96 for Derekoy Port, and 0.93 for Tekkekoy Shipyard. In this study important changes were determined in the shoreline after Derekoy Port and Tekkekoy Shipyard were built. The results obtained from GIS and remote sensing techniques combined with digital shoreline analysis system can be beneficial for the management, planning and monitoring of the coastal zone after coastal structures have been built.

TI  - Pollution from Highways Detection Using Winter UAV Data
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study identified and evaluated the association between metal content and UAV data to monitor pollution from roadways. A total of 18 mixed snow samples were collected at the end of winter, utilizing a 1 m long and 10 cm wide snow collection tube, from either side of the Caspian Highway (Moscow-Tambo-Astrakhan) in Moscow. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to examine the chemical composition of the samples, yielding 35 chemical elements (metals). UAV data and laboratory findings were calculated and examined. Regression estimates demonstrated the possibility of using remote sensing data to identify Al, Ba, Fe, K, and Na metals in snow cover near roadways due to dust dispersal. This discovery supports the argument that UAV sensing data can be utilized to monitor air pollution from roadways.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the work is to highlight the image of the dog through the analysis of traditional religious and mythological representations and ritual practice of the buryats. Proceeding from the goal, the following tasks were set: to give a characterization of the image of the dog in the buryat culture; to consider dog on the basis of mythology, folklore and language of the buryats; to determine the dog's place in rituals of the buryats. The study was carried out within the framework of a systemic integrated approach. At the same time, the methodological basis of the work is the structural- semiotic method, according to which the symbols containing ideas about the dog are determined.The source base of the work was folklore, linguistic data and field materials of the author. In the course of the study, the following conclusions were made: the buryats formed a complex set of traditional representations about the dog. According to folk classification, it is included in the class "domestic animals". Dog is considered useful for human, and so is vested with positive characteristics. It was incorporated into the ritual associated with the life cycle and swearing-wool. It was believed that it performs a protective-magical function, this is due to the veneration of her as a guardian of the family and home. This animal symbolized the male principle. But, the image of a red / yellow dog was associated with female symbolism, the idea of receiving grace. Yellow dog was a totem from galzhuts that proves the existence in the past they have a local cult of this animal. The dog was included in the concept of space and time.However, this animal had a negative connotation. In the mythological views of the buryats, she acted as an intermediary between the Middle and Lower worlds. Believed that the dog is associated with demonic characters. The ambivalence of the animal, in particular, was manifested in relation to its wool: along with the belief in its healing power, there was a judgment about the "impurity" of dog hair.In addition to the substrate layer in the representations of the dog, we can distinguish borrowings. Dogs have drilled along with the change in religious preferences has been modified, in particular, significantly influenced by buddhism. At the same time, the views of this animal, which are typologically close to the views of a certain circle of peoples, mainly the turkic-mongolian ethnic groups of southern Siberia and Central Asia, testifying to the former ethno-cultural contacts of their ancestors, are highlighted.

AB  - The present study examines the role of religious interpretation in conceptualizations of mental illness and experiences with mental health providers in a sample of Muslim Americans. As part of a larger study, participants completed an anonymous online or article-based survey. A portion of the larger sample responded to four open-ended questions delving deeper into interpretations of mental illness and personal experiences with mental health concerns and mental health professionals. Of the 255 participants, 190 provided an open-ended response with their definition of mental illness, 66 described their beliefs regarding the causes of mental illness, 50 described personal experiences with mental health issues, and 34 described experiences interacting with mental health professionals. This study analyzes the responses that focus on an Islamic spiritual or religious interpretation or view the encounter with a mental health professional through the lens of religious identity. The implications of both religious worldview and Islamic identity on effective spiritually competent practice in the clinical setting are outlined.

TI  - Using deep ensemble forest for high-resolution mapping of PM2.5 from MODIS MAIAC AOD in Tehran, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution mapping of PM2.5 concentration over Tehran city is challenging because of the complicated behavior of numerous sources of pollution and the insufficient number of ground air quality monitoring stations. Alternatively, high-resolution satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data can be employed for high-resolution mapping of PM2.5. For this purpose, different data-driven methods have been used in the literature. Recently, deep learning methods have demonstrated their ability to estimate PM2.5 from AOD data. However, these methods have several weaknesses in solving the problem of estimating PM2.5 from satellite AOD data. In this paper, the potential of the deep ensemble forest method for estimating the PM2.5 concentration from AOD data was evaluated. The results showed that the deep ensemble forest method with R-2 = 0.74 gives a higher accuracy of PM2.5 estimation than deep learning methods ( R-2 = 0.67 ) as well as classic data-driven methods such as random forest ( R-2 = 0.68 ). Additionally, the estimated values of PM2.5 using the deep ensemble forest algorithm were used along with ground data to generate a high-resolution map of PM2.5. Evaluation of produced PM2.5 map revealed the good performance of the deep ensemble forest for modeling the variation of PM2.5 in the city of Tehran.

TI  - Delineation of Wetland Areas in South Norway from Sentinel-2 Imagery and LiDAR Using TensorFlow, U-Net, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important habitats for biodiversity and provide ecosystem services such as climate mitigation and carbon storage. The current wetland mapping techniques in Norway are tedious and costly, and remote sensing provides an opportunity for large-scale mapping and ecosystem accounting. We aimed to implement a deep learning approach to mapping wetlands with Sentinel-2 and LiDAR data over southern Norway. Our U-Net model, implemented through Google Earth Engine and TensorFlow, produced a wetland map with a balanced accuracy rate of 90.9% when validated against an independent ground-truth sample. This represents an improvement upon manually digitized land cover maps in Norway, which achieved accuracy rates of 46.8% (1:50,000 map) and 42.4% (1:5000 map). Using our map, we estimated a total wetland coverage area of 12.7% in southern Norway, which is double the previous benchmark estimates (5.6%). We followed an iterative model training and evaluation approach, which revealed that increasing the quantity and coverage of labeled wetlands greatly increases the model performance. We highlight the potential of satellite-based wetland maps for the ecosystem accounting of changes in wetland extents over time-something that is not feasible with traditional mapping methods.

TI  - Production of Railwayscape in urban environment: Analysing railway heritage tourism potential in Siliguri City, India
T2  - REGIONAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - For a long time, it has been argued that the theories and practices devoted to urban planning and management should conform to the fundamental role of planning policies in the production of urban space, but not merely the spatial distribution of the produced services. Towards this wider connotation, this study introduces the notion of Railwayscape, grounded on the theory of 'The Production of Space', to examine the role of railway station districts as catalysts of urban development through the social production of urban space. The present research sets out to establish the notion of Railwayscape and apply it in a railway heritage, i.e., the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) and its point of inception, Siliguri City, India. Accordingly, a criteria-based evaluation of four railway station districts (New Jalpaiguri, Siliguri Town, Siliguri Junction, and Sukna) in Siliguri and its surroundings was performed. The information regarding the selected four railway station districts is obtained through field observation and key informant consultation, supplemented by published literature and remote sensing data. This evaluation is succeeded by the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis accentuating the potential strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with the selected four railway station districts and their prospects to become the potential Railwayscape. The results of this research show that there is no railway station district in Siliguri that can fully meet the demands of the locals and tourists, therefore, relfecting a lack of awareness of the historical values of these districts. The results also indicate that there are significant differences in the relative potentials of railway station districts to become the Railwayscape in urban environment. The outcomes of this research, therefore, are expected to encourage policy-making insitutions and practitioners to realise the 'place value' of some railway station districts and their potentials to yield better economic, social and structural virtue for a wide range of actors.

TI  - Structurally Different Yet Functionally Similar: Aptamers Specific for the Ebola Virus Soluble Glycoprotein and GP1,2 and Their Application in Electrochemical Sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) gene templates several mRNAs that produce either the virion-associated transmembrane protein or one of two secreted glycoproteins. Soluble glycoprotein (sGP) is the predominant product. GP1 and sGP share an amino terminal sequence of 295 amino acids but differ in quaternary structure, with GP1 being a heterohexamer with GP2 and sGP a homodimer. Two structurally different DNA aptamers were selected against sGP that also bound GP1,2. These DNA aptamers were compared with a 2 ' FY-RNA aptamer for their interactions with the Ebola GP gene products. The three aptamers have almost identical binding isotherms for sGP and GP1,2 in solution and on the virion. They demonstrated high affinity and selectivity for sGP and GP1,2. Furthermore, one aptamer, used as a sensing element in an electrochemical format, detected GP1,2 on pseudotyped virions and sGP with high sensitivity in the presence of serum, including from an Ebola-virus-infected monkey. Our results suggest that the aptamers interact with sGP across the interface between the monomers, which is different from the sites on the protein bound by most antibodies. The remarkable similarity in functional features of three structurally distinct aptamers suggests that aptamers, like antibodies, have preferred binding sites on proteins.

TI  - Evaluation of ABCD water balance conceptual model using remote sensing data in ungauged watersheds (a case study: Zarandeh, Iran)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water balance is an important concern in water resources management and water consumption planning. ABCD water balance conceptual model is a suitable simulation tool due to its simplicity, low input data requirement, and water balance components provision. As the lack of data is a major challenge in many developing countries, IMERG precipitation satellite products and ERA5 temperature reanalysis data were used to obtain the required data for the Zarandeh sub-basin in Neyshabur Northeast Iran. The results were evaluated using four statistical indices including correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and BIAS. The Results showed that products are reasonably accurate, and there is a high correlation between outputs and observed data. Zarandeh and Baqi stations indicated the highest and lowest correlation of 0.89 and 0.84, respectively. This study aimed to use ABCD model and remote sensing products to determine the water balance. The uncertainties in the model parameters were assessed through Fuzzy numbers. Additionally, the Monte Carlo method was employed to calibrate them based on NSE as an objective function. The results illustrated that the ABCD water balance model is an accurate tool for simulating the surface runoff of the Zarandeh sub-basin with an efficiency coefficient of 0.86. Finally, the model was applied to the Sebi sub-basin in Torbat-e-Heydariyeh, with a moderate performance (NSE = 0.49) showing that the model parameters should be recalibrated in each region. This study indicates that the remote sensing products could be applied as appropriate tools in ungauged basins.

TI  - Impact Assessment of Tropical Cyclones <i>Amphan</i> and <i>Nisarga</i> in 2020 in the Northern Indian Ocean
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) is one of the most vulnerable coasts to tropical cyclones (TCs) and is frequently threatened by global climate change. In the year 2020, two severe cyclones formed in the NIO and devastated the Indian subcontinent. Super cyclone Amphan, which formed in the Bay of Bengal (BOB) on 15 May 2020, made landfall along the West Bengal coast with a wind speed of above 85 knots (155 km/h). The severe cyclone Nisarga formed in the Arabian Sea (ARS) on 1 June 2020 and made landfall along the Maharashtra coast with a wind speed above 60 knots (115 km/h). The present study has characterized both TCs by employing past cyclonic events (1982-2020), satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed and direction, rainfall dataset, and regional elevation. Long-term cyclonic occurrences revealed that the Bay of Bengal encountered a higher number of cyclones each year than the ARS. Both cyclones had different intensities when making landfall; however, the regional elevation played a significant role in controlling the cyclonic wind and associated hazards. The mountain topography on the east coast weakened the wind, while the deltas on the west coast had no control over the wind. Nisarga weakened to 30 knots (56 km/h) within 6 h from making landfall, while Amphan took 24 h to weaken to 30 knots (56 km/h). We analyzed precipitation patterns during the cyclones and concluded that Amphan had much more (1563 mm) precipitation than Nisarga (684 mm). Furthermore, the impact on land use land cover (LULC) was examined in relation to the wind field. The Amphan wind field damaged 363,837 km(2) of land, whereas the Nisarga wind field affected 167,230 km(2) of land. This research can aid in the development of effective preparedness strategies for disaster risk reduction during cyclone impacts along the coast of India.

TI  - Detection of Water Hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) in Lake Tana, Ethiopia, Using Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Tana is Ethiopia's largest lake and is infested with invasive water hyacinth (E. crassipes), which endangers the lake's biodiversity and habitat. Using appropriate remote sensing detection methods and determining the seasonal distribution of the weed is important for decision-making, water resource management, and environmental protection. As the demand for the reliable estimation of E. crassipes mapping from satellite data grows, comparing the performance of different machine learning algorithms could help in identifying the most effective method for E. crassipes detection in the lake. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the ability of random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART) machine learning algorithms to detect E. crassipes and estimating seasonal spatial coverage of the weed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images. Cloud-masked monthly median composite Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 data from October 2021 and 2022, January 2022 and 2023, March 2022, and June 2022 were used to represent autumn, winter, spring, and summer, respectively. Four spectral indices were derived and used in combination with spectral bands to improve the E. crassipes detection accuracy. All methods achieved greater than 95% and 90% overall accuracy when using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images, respectively. Using both data sets, all methods achieved a greater than 93% F1 score for E. crassipes detection. Though the difference in performance between the methods was small, the RF was the most accurate, while the SVM and CART methods had the same accuracy. The maximum E. crassipes coverage area was observed in autumn (22.4 km(2)), while the minimum (2.2 km(2)) was observed in summer. Based on Sentinel 2 data, the E. crassipes area coverage decreased significantly by 62.5% from winter to spring and increased significantly by 81.7% from summer to autumn. The findings suggested that the RF classifier was the most accurate E. crassipes detection algorithm, and autumn was an appropriate season for E. crassipes detection in Lake Tana.

TI  - S2k Guideline - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC, neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin) - Update 2022
T2  - JOURNAL DER DEUTSCHEN DERMATOLOGISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC, ICD-O M8247/3) is a rare, malignant, primary skin tumor with epithelial and neuroendocrine differentiation. The tumor cells share many morphologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features with cutaneous Merkel cells. Nevertheless, the cell of origin of MCC is unclear. MCC appears clinically as a reddish to purple spherical tumor with a smooth shiny surface and a soft to turgid elastic consistency, usually showing rapid growth. Spontaneous and often complete regressions of the tumor are observed. These likely immunologically-mediated regressions explain the cases in which only lymph node or distant metastases are found at the time of initial diagnosis and why the tumor responds very well to immunomodulatory therapies even at advanced stages. Due to its aggressiveness, the usually given indication for sentinel lymph node biopsy, the indication of adjuvant therapies to be evaluated, as well as the complexity of the necessary diagnostics, the clinical management should already be determined by an interdisciplinary tumor board at the time of initial diagnosis.

TI  - Shrubs Compensate for Tree Leaf Area Variation and Influence Vegetation Indices in Post-Fire Siberian Larch Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In post-fire Siberian larch forests, where tree density can vary within a burn perimeter, shrubs constitute a substantial portion of the vegetation canopy. Leaf area index (LAI), defined as the one-sided total green leaf area per unit ground surface area, is useful for characterizing variation in plant canopies. We estimated LAI with allometry for trees and tall shrubs (> 0.5 and < 1.5 m) across 26 sites with varying tree stem density (0.05-3.3 stems/m(2)) and canopy cover (4.6%-76.9%) in a uniformly-aged mature Siberian larch forest that regenerated following a fire similar to 75 years ago. We investigated relationships between tree density, tree LAI, and tall shrub LAI, and between LAI and satellite observations of Normalized Difference and Enhanced Vegetation Indices (NDVI and EVI). Across the density gradient, tree LAI increases with increasing tree density, while tall shrub LAI decreases, exhibiting no patterns in combined tree-shrub LAI. We also found significant positive relationships between tall shrub LAI and NDVI/EVI from PlanetScope and Landsat imagery. These findings suggest that tall shrubs compensate for lower tree LAI in tree canopy gaps, forming a canopy with contiguous combined tree-shrub LAI across the density gradient. Our findings suggest that NDVI and EVI are more sensitive to variation in tall shrub canopies than variation in tree canopies or combined tree-shrub canopies in these ecosystems. The results improve our understanding of the relationships between forest density and tree and shrub leaf area and have implications for interpreting spatial variability in LAI, NDVI, and EVI in Siberian boreal forests.

TI  - Gender Stereotypes in Moroccan EFL Textbooks' Illustrations: Content and Critical Image Analysis
T2  - ARAB WORLD ENGLISH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Textbooks have always been influential in transmitting knowledge and values in modern education systems. However, they may transmit various gender-based stereotyped roles that could negatively affect learners in shaping their worldview. Accordingly, this study investigates gender stereotypes in the visual discourse of one English as a Foreign Language (EFL) textbook currently used in Moroccan secondary schools. It does so by looking at male/female appearance in the textbook illustrations. It also considers gender differences in occupations and roles. Moreover, the study employs a qualitative critical image analysis to selected images based on Giaschi's (2000) model analysis. To this end, the research comprises quantitative content analysis and qualitative critical image analysis. The findings show less visibility of female characters in illustrations, ascribing them to gender-based traditional occupations and subordinate roles. Besides, the qualitative critical image analysis reveals that women still suffer from misrepresentation by depicting them as dependent, submissive, and needing help. The study contains, in the end, recommendations for promoting gender equality through textbooks in Morocco.

TI  - The spatial and temporal influence of infrastructure and road dust on seasonal snowmelt, vegetation productivity, and early season surface water cover in the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased industrial development in the Arctic has led to a rapid expansion of infrastructure in the region. Localized impacts of infrastructure on snow distribution, road dust, and snowmelt timing and duration feeds back into the coupled Arctic system causing a series of cascading effects that remain poorly understood. We quantify spatial and temporal patterns of snow-off dates in the Prudhoe Bay Oilfield, Alaska, using Sentinel-2 data. We derive the Normalized Difference Snow Index to quantify snow persistence in 2019-2020. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Water Index were used to show linkages of vegetation and surface hydrology, in relationship to patterns of snowmelt. Newly available infrastructure data were used to analyze snowmelt patterns in relation infrastructure. Results show a relationship between snowmelt and distance to infrastructure varying by use and traffic load, and orientation relative to the prevailing wind direction (up to 1 month difference in snow-free dates). Post-snowmelt surface water area showed a strong negative correlation (up to -0.927) with distance to infrastructure. Results from field observations indicate an impact of infrastructure on winter near-surface ground temperature and snow depth. This study highlights the impact of infrastructure on a large area beyond the direct human footprint and the interconnectedness between snow-off timing, vegetation, surface hydrology, and near-surface ground temperatures.

TI  - Water Body Extraction from Sentinel-2 Imagery with Deep Convolutional Networks and Pixelwise Category Transplantation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A common task in land-cover classification is water body extraction, wherein each pixel in an image is labelled as either water or background. Water body detection is integral to the field of urban hydrology, with applications ranging from early flood warning to water resource management. Although traditional index-based methods such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have been used to detect water bodies for decades, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have recently demonstrated promising results. However, training these networks requires access to large quantities of high-quality and accurately labelled data, which is often lacking in the field of remotely sensed imagery. Another challenge stems from the fact that the category of interest typically occupies only a small portion of an image and is thus grossly underrepresented in the data. We propose a novel approach to data augmentation-pixelwise category transplantation (PCT)-as a potential solution to both of these problems. Experimental results demonstrate PCT's ability to improve performance on a variety of models and datasets, achieving an average improvement of 0.749 mean intersection over union (mIoU). Moreover, PCT enables us to outperform the previous high score achieved on the same dataset without introducing a new model architecture. We also explore the suitability of several state-of-the-art segmentation models and loss functions on the task of water body extraction. Finally, we address the shortcomings of previous works by assessing each model on RGB, NIR, and multispectral features to ascertain the relative advantages of each approach. In particular, we find a significant benefit to the inclusion of multispectral bands, with such methods outperforming visible-spectrum models by an average of 4.193 mIoU.

TI  - Field Evaluation of Commonly Used Adult Mosquito Traps in Greece
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Entomological monitoring activities are a major part of mosquito and mosquito-borne diseases surveillance. Several trapping methods are implemented worldwide, aiming to gather data on species composition and their abundance in various study areas.Methods: Several methodological modifications, such as trapping systems baited with attractants or carbon dioxide, have been proposed to increase trap efficiency. The aim of this study was to test different trap types, commonly used in Greece to collect mosquitoes, with the addition of the Biogents Sentinel lure. Moreover, traps were placed in two distinct land types and two different heights above the ground to compare their efficacy. West Nile Virus is endemic in Greece, so we also aimed to detect viral presence and circulation in selected mosquito pools.Results: Adult mosquitoes of Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens s.l., and Culiseta longiareolata were collected in both study areas. The trap type had a significant impact on the total collections, while the trap position and interaction between trap and position did not significantly affect mosquito catches. WNV was detected in Cx. pipiens s.l. pools examined from the two study areas.Conclusion: This study emphasizes the role of trapping methods as a key component for monitoring and surveillance of adult mosquito populations, reflecting that several trap types present with different mosquito species capture and catch rates.

TI  - A Cloud-Controlling Factor Perspective on the Hemispheric Asymmetry of Extratropical Cloud Albedo
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northern and Southern Hemispheres reflect on average almost equal amounts of sunlight due to compensating hemispheric asymmetries in clear-sky and cloud albedo. Recent work indicates that the cloud albedo asymmetry is largely due to clouds in extratropical oceanic regions. Here, we investigate the proximate causes of this extratropical cloud albedo asymmetry using a cloud-controlling factor (CCF) approach. We develop a simple index that measures the skill of CCFs, either individually or in combination, in predicting the asymmetry. The index captures the contribution to the asymmetry due to interhemispheric differences in the probability distribution function of daily CCF values. Cloud albedo is quantified using daily MODIS satellite retrievals, and is related to range of CCFs derived from the ERA5 product. We find that sea surface temperature is the CCF that individually explains the largest fraction of the asymmetry, followed by surface wind. The asymmetry is predominantly due to low clouds, and our results are consistent with prior local-scale modeling work showing that marine boundary layer clouds become thicker and more extensive as surface wind increases and surface temperature cools. The asymmetry is consistent with large-scale control of storm-track intensity and surface winds by meridional temperature gradients: persistently cold and windy conditions in the Southern Hemisphere keep cloud albedo high year-round. Our results have important implications for global-scale cloud feedbacks and contribute to efforts to develop a theory for planetary albedo and its symmetry.

TI  - Towards a General Monitoring System for Terrestrial Primary Production: A Test Spanning the European Drought of 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Land surface models require inputs of temperature and moisture variables to generate predictions of gross primary production (GPP). Differences between leaf and air temperature vary temporally and spatially and may be especially pronounced under conditions of low soil moisture availability. The Sentinel-3 satellite mission offers estimates of the land surface temperature (LST), which for vegetated pixels can be adopted as the canopy temperature. Could remotely sensed estimates of LST offer a parsimonious input to models by combining information on leaf temperature and hydration? (2) Using a light use efficiency model that requires only a handful of input variables, we generated GPP simulations for comparison with eddy-covariance inferred estimates available from flux sites within the Integrated Carbon Observation System. Remotely sensed LST and greenness data were input from Sentinel-3. Gridded air temperature data were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. We chose the years 2018-2019 to exploit the natural experiment of a pronounced European drought. (3) Simulated GPP showed good agreement with flux-derived estimates. During dry conditions, simulations forced with LST performed better than those with air temperature for shrubland, grassland and savanna sites. (4) This study advances the prospect for a global GPP monitoring system that will rely primarily on remotely sensed inputs.

TI  - The Characteristics of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Cutaneous Melanoma and the Particularities for Elderly Patients-Experience of a Single Clinic
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Melanoma is a malignant tumor that determines approximately 80% of deaths as skin cancer-related. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) represents the first filter of tumor cells toward systemic dissemination. The primary objective was to outline the surgical specifics of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) technique, correlate the location of the lymph node with the radiotracer load, and identify the characteristics of older patients. Methods: In this prospective study, 122 cases of malignant melanoma needing SLNB technique were included, between June 2019 and November 2022, resulting in 162 lymph nodes removed. Results: Patients' mean age was 54.3 +/- 14.4 years old, the prevalence of 70 years and older being 20.5%. The rate of positive SLN was 24.6%, with a single drainage in 68.9% of cases. The frequency of seroma was 14.8%, while reintervention 1.6%. The inguinal nodes had the highest preoperative radiotracer load (p = 0.015). Patients 70 years old or older had significantly more advanced-stage melanoma (68.0% vs. 45.4%, p = 0.044, OR = 2.56) and a higher rate of positive SLN (40.0% vs. 20.6%, p = 0.045,OR = 2.57). Melanoma of the head and neck was more common among older individuals (32.0% vs. 9.3%, p = 0.007,OR = 4.60). Conclusions: The SLNB has a low rate of surgical complications and the positivity of SLN is not related to radiotracer load. Elderly patients are at risk for head and neck melanoma, have more advanced stages, a higher SLN positivity, and a greater rate of surgical complications.

TI  - Abbreviated MRI for Comprehensive Regional Lymph Node Staging during Pre-Operative Breast MRI
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The clinically relevant information that guides further surgical management of the axilla in women with breast cancer is the distinction between non-significant (N0-N1) versus significant (>= N2) lymph node metastases. In women with newly diagnosed breast cancer, MRI is increasingly used to determine the local extent of disease in the breast. The aim of our retrospective study on 414 patients who underwent routine breast MRI for local staging of the breast was to determine whether an abbreviated protocol for regional lymph node staging is sufficient to identify patients with significant nodal disease. Our results demonstrated that a single 3 min coronal T1-weighted sequence, acquired with the system's built-in body coil, covering the chest wall, axilla, and supra- and infraclavicular region, helped rule out the presence of significant nodal disease with a NPV of 98.8% [97.0-100%]. False-positive findings were mostly caused by patients with positive, but non-significant, lymph node metastases (N1). Background: The detection of regional lymph node metastases (LNM), in particular significant LNM (>= N2), is important to guide treatment decisions in women with breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a coronal pulse sequence as part of pre-operative breast MRI is useful to identify women without significant LNM. Material: Retrospective study between January 2017 and December 2019 on 414 consecutive women with breast cancer who underwent pre-operative breast MRI on a 1.5 T system. For lymph node (LN) staging, a coronal pre-contrast non-fat-suppressed T1-weighted TSE sequence was acquired with the system's built-in body coil, covering the chest wall; acquisition time 3:12 min. Two radiologists rated the likelihood of LNM on a 3-point scale (absent/possible/present). Validation was obtained by histology from sentinel LN biopsy, axillary LN dissection, and/or PET/CT. Results: 368/414 women were staged to have no or non-significant LNM (pN0 in 282/414, pN1 in 86/414), and significant LNM (>= pN2) in 46/414. For identification of women with significant LNM, MRI was true-positive in 42/46, false-negative in 4/46, true-negative in 327/368, and false-positive in 41/83, the latter mostly caused by women with N1-disease (38/41), yielding an NPV and PPV for significant LNM of 98.8% [95%-CI: 97.0-100%] and 50.6% [43.1-58.1%], respectively. Conclusions: A 3 min coronal T1-weighted pulse sequence covering the chest wall as part of pre-operative breast MRI is useful to rule out significant LNM with high NPV. Where MRI staging is positive for significant LNM, additional work-up is indicated to improve the distinction of N1 and N2 disease.

AB  - Astrocytes are a type of non-neuronal, glial cells, anatomically placed in the intersection between the brain blood vessels and other neural cells-including neurons. Such a strate-gic situation confers these cells a unique opportunity to sense circulating molecules and adapt according to different organismal conditions. By acting as sentinel cells, astrocytes thus co-ordinate gene expression profiles, immune responses, signal transduction path-ways, and metabolic programs that play essential roles in the formation of brain circuits to modulate neurotransmission and higher-order organismal functions.

TI  - Monitoring Displacements and Damage Detection through Satellite MT-InSAR Techniques: A New Methodology and Application to a Case Study in Rome (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite interferometry has recently developed as a powerful tool for monitoring displacements on structures for structural health monitoring (SHM), as it allows obtaining information on past deformation and performing back analysis on structural behavior. Despite the increasing literature on this subject, the lack of protocols for applying and interpreting interferometric data for structural assessment prevents these techniques from being employed alongside conventional SHM. This paper proposes a methodology for exploiting satellite interferometric data aiming at remotely detecting displacements and buildings' criticalities at different levels of analysis, i.e., urban scale and single-building scale. Moreover, this research exploits the capability of satellite monitoring for damage diagnosis, comparing the millimeter scale displacements to information derived from on-site inspections. Different data-driven algorithms were applied to detect seasonal and irreversible components of displacements, such as statistical models for damage identification derived from traditional on-site monitoring. Thus, the proposed methodology was applied to a XVI-century case study located in the city center of Rome (Italy), Palazzo Primoli, and two stocks of COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) images processed through the Small BAseline Subset Differential Interferometry (SBAS-DInSAR) technique were used to assess displacements for an eight-year-long (between 2011 and 2019) monitoring period.

TI  - Predicting micronutrient deficiency with publicly available satellite data
T2  - AI MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Micronutrient deficiency (MND), which is a form of malnutrition that can have serious health consequences, is difficult to diagnose in early stages without blood draws, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect and process. It is even more difficult at a public health scale seeking to identify regions at higher risk of MND. To provide data more widely and frequently, we propose an accurate, scalable, low-cost, and interpretable regional-level MND prediction system. Specifically, our work is the first to use satellite data, such as forest cover, weather, and presence of water, to predict deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin A, directly from their biomarkers. We use real-world, ground truth biomarker data collected from four different regions across Madagascar for training, and demonstrate that satellite data are viable for predicting regional-level MND, surprisingly exceeding the performance of baseline predictions based only on survey responses. Our method could be broadly applied to other countries where satellite data are available, and potentially create high societal impact if these predictions are used by policy makers, public health officials, or healthcare providers.

TI  - Intense Wildfires in Russia over a 22-Year Period According to Satellite Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distributions of wildfire areas and FRP values for the territory of Russia and its large regions (the European part of Russia, as well as the Ural, Siberian, and Far Eastern Federal Districts) during 2001-2022 were analyzed using satellite data. For the territory of Russia, there was a decreasing trend in annual burned areas and a small increase in average hotspot FRP. At the same time, the largest annual burned areas in the territory of Russia were recorded in 2008 (295.2 thous. km(2)), 2002 (272.4 thous. km(2)), 2006 (261.2 thous. km(2)), and in 2012 (258.4 thous. km(2)). It was found that during the studied period, 90% of fire hotspots in Russia had a maximum FRP < 100 MW. The most intense wildfires (FRP > 1500 MW) amounted to only 0.1% and were detected mainly in the Siberian and Far Eastern Federal Districts. Interconnections between large wildfires and meteorological factors, including blocking activity in the atmosphere, were revealed.

TI  - A Comprehensive Methodology for the Statistical Characterization of Solar Irradiation: Application to the Case of Morocco
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Determination and validation of solar irradiation data for the techno-economic valuation of solar projects. The prediction and characterization of solar irradiation relies mostly on either the use of complex models or on complicated mathematical techniques, such as artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithms. This mathematical complexity might hamper their use by businesses and project developers when assessing the solar resource. In this study, a simple but comprehensive methodology for characterizing the solar resource for a project is presented. It is based on the determination of the best probability distribution function (PDF) of the solar irradiation for a specific location, assuming that the knowledge of statistical techniques may be more widely extended than other more complex mathematical methods. The presented methodology was tested on 23 cities across Morocco, given the high interest in solar investments in the country. As a result, a new database for solar irradiation values depending on historical data is provided for Morocco. The results show the great existing variety of PDFs for the solar irradiation data at the different months and cities, which demonstrates the need for undertaking a proper characterization of the irradiation when the assessment of solar energy projects is involved. When it is simply needed to embed the radiation uncertainty in the analysis, as is the case of the techno-economic valuation of solar energy assets, the presented methodology can reach this objective with much less complexity and less demanding input data. Moreover, its application is not limited to solar resource assessment, but can also be easily used in other fields, such as meteorology and climate change studies.

TI  - Long and short-term evolution of the Algerian coastline using remote sensing and GIS technology
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is carried out over the 150 km Algerian coastline. It focuses on the qualitative and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis of Algiers coast and the main factors controlling the modification of its coastline. Data processing was carried out using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and a Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS v5.0) tool. Eleven shorelines were extracted from Landsat images Landsat 5-TM (Thematic Mapper), Landsat7-ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and Landsat8-Operational Land Imager (OLI)) during the extended period from 1984 to 2021. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index - Tasseled-Cap Transformation (NDVI-TCT) technique was used to extract the coastlines and then evaluated with the R-squared (R2) and Normalized Root Means Square Error (NRMSE) methods. The study area was divided into three geomorphological units: (1) Bou Ismail Bay (2) Algiers Bay (3) and Zemmouri Bay. Statistical techniques such as the Linear Regression Rate (LRR) and the End Point Rate (EPR) of DSAS v5.0 were used to understand the trend of coastline change. The long-term results show that Bou Ismail Bay has a stable trend at an average rate of change equal to 0.35 m/yr; Algiers Bay has an accretion trend at an average rate of 1.24 m/yr. The western and central sections of Zemmouri bay have a stable trend at an average rate of 0.44 m/yr and -0.01 m/yr, respectively. Whereas, the eastern section of Zemmouri Bay shows particularly intense erosion with an erosion rate of up to -4.98 m/yr. According to the short-term analysis, the results show a cyclic pattern of erosion-accretion along the coastline of the study area. These results also show that the erosion effect due to the 2007 storm was extremely important. Thus, the coast after this event is the most degraded.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization of Vegetation Dynamics on Linear Features Using Airborne Laser Scanning and Ensemble Learning
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Linear feature networks are the roads, trails, pipelines, and seismic lines developed throughout many commercial boreal forests. These linear features, while providing access for industrial, recreational, silvicultural, and fire management operations, also have environmental implications which involve both the active and non-active portions of the network. Management of the existing linear feature networks across boreal forests would lead to the optimization of maintenance and construction costs as well as the minimization of the cumulative environmental effects of the anthropogenic linear footprint. Remote sensing data and predictive modelling are valuable support tools for the multi-level management of this network by providing accurate and detailed quantitative information aiming to assess linear feature conditions (e.g., deterioration and vegetation characteristic dynamics). However, the potential of remote sensing datasets to improve knowledge of fine-scale vegetation characteristic dynamics within forest roads has not been fully explored. This study investigated the use of high-spatial resolution (1 m), airborne LiDAR, terrain, climatic, and field survey data, aiming to provide information on vegetation characteristic dynamics within forest roads by (i) developing a predictive model for the characterization of the LiDAR-CHM vegetation cover dynamic (response metric) and (ii) investigating causal factors driving the vegetation cover dynamic using LiDAR (topography: slope, TWI, hillshade, and orientation), Sentinel-2 optical imagery (NDVI), climate databases (sunlight and wind speed), and field inventory (clearing width and years post-clearing). For these purposes, we evaluated and compared the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS) and machine learning (ML) regression approaches commonly used in ecological modelling-multiple linear regression (mlr), multivariate adaptive regression splines (mars), generalized additive model (gam), k-nearest neighbors (knn), gradient boosting machines (gbm), and random forests (rf). We validated our models' results using an error metric-root mean square error (RMSE)-and a goodness-of-fit metric-coefficient of determination (R-2). The predictions were tested using stratified cross-validation and were validated against an independent dataset. Our findings revealed that the rf model showed the most accurate results (cross-validation: R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 18.69%, validation against an independent dataset: R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 20.29%). The most informative factors were clearing width, which had the strongest negative effect, suggesting the underlying influence of disturbance legacies, and years post-clearing, which had a positive effect on the vegetation cover dynamic. Our long-term predictions suggest that a timeframe of no less than 20 years is expected for both wide- and narrow-width roads to exhibit similar to 50% and similar to 80% vegetation cover, respectively. This study has improved our understanding of fine-scale vegetation dynamics around forest roads, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The information from the predictive model is useful for both the short- and long-term management of the existing network. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that spatially explicit models using LiDAR data are reliable tools for assessing vegetation dynamics around forest roads. It provides avenues for further research and the potential to integrate this quantitative approach with other linear feature studies.An improved knowledge of vegetation dynamic patterns on linear features can help support sustainable forest management.

AB  - Maxwell's electrodynamics admits radial charge densities of the elementary organization with one vertex of the spherical symmetry. A multi-vertex distribution of sharply inhomogeneous charge densities can also be described by monistic field solutions to Maxwell's equations-equalities. Coulomb-Lorentz forces are exerted locally to correlated electric densities in their volume organization with the fixed self-energy integral. The long-range Coulomb interaction between the dense peaks of the charged space continuum can be described quantitatively through bulk integrals of local tensions within observable bodies in favor of the monistic all-unity in the material space physics of Descartes and Russian cosmists.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Arboviruses are endemic in Uganda; however, little is known about their epidemiology, seasonality and spatiotemporal distribution. Our study sought to provide information on arbovirus outbreaks from acute clinical presentations.Methods: Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and confirmatory Plaque Reduction Neutralisation Test (PRNT) results for arbovirus diagnosis of samples collected from patients attending sentinel sites from 2016-19 were analysed retrospectively. Demographic data were analysed with SaTScan and SPSS software to determine the epidemiology and spatiotemporal distribution of arboviruses.Results: Arbovirus activity peaked consistently during March-May rainy seasons. Overall, arbovirus seroprevalence was 9.5%. Of 137 IgM positives, 52.6% were confirmed by PRNT, of which 73.6% cases were observed in central Uganda with Yellow Fever Virus had the highest prevalence (27.8%). The 5-14 age group were four times more likely to be infected with an arbovirus p=0.003, 4.1 (95% CI 1.3-12.3). Significant arboviral activity was observed among outdoor workers(p=0.05) . Spatiotemporal analysis indicated arboviral activity in 23 of the 85 districts analysed..Interpretation: Our study shows that arbovirus activity peaks during the March-May rainy season and highlights the need for YFV mass vaccination to reduce the clinical burden of arboviruses transmitted within the region.

T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Characteristic features of the Baikal natural territory (BNT) are analyzed and the problems of forest monitoring are highlighted. An approach is proposed for the digital transformation of forest resource monitoring using a service-oriented paradigm, an infrastructure approach, and declarative specifications, as well as end-to-end and Web technologies for collecting and processing large amounts of spatiotemporal data. A scheme of a digital forest monitoring platform based on an information-analytical geoportal environment is described, including a system for processing and storing spatiotemporal data and a catalog of basic and thematic services for assessing the consequences of natural and anthropogenic impacts on forests of the BNT. The experience of using deep learning methods to monitor changes in the state of forests is presented. An automated determination of land cover types is carried out on the basis of Sentinel-2 images. The composition of classes of the training data set created for the BNT is described. The result of satellite image classification with the identified land cover classes is given. The digital platform (DP) thus created can be used to assess and predict the state of forest resources of the BNT and make managerial decisions on effective forest management.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Study of Supernatant Process Water Pond in Tailings Storage Facilities: Use of Remote Sensing Techniques for Preventing Mine Tailings Dam Failures
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the global impact on society due to tailings storage facilities (TSFs) accidents, this article describes a study to monitor mine tailings management and prevent mining tailings dam failures, considering the analysis of different TSFs real cases. The spatial and temporal dynamic behavior of the supernatant process water pond of the TSFs is studied as a critical issue, using remote sensing techniques based on multispectral satellite imagery. To understand the current state of the art, a brief description of engineering studies for the control and management of the supernatant process water pond in TSFs is presented. This research considers the main method of the study of practical cases with the use of techniques of multispectral interpretation of satellite images from the Sentinel 2 remote sensor. In addition, the management of tools such as Geographical Information System (GIS) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) is implemented, as well as the application of some spectral indices such as NDWI and the joint use of (i) NDVI, (ii) mNDWI, and (iii) EVI. Real TSF cases are analyzed, including the dam failures of Jagersfontain TSF in South Africa and Williamson TSF in Tanzania. Finally, this article concludes that the size, location, and temporal variability of the supernatant process water pond within a TSF has a direct impact on safety and the possible potential risk of the physical instability of tailings dams.

TI  - Multi-Branch Deep Neural Network for Bed Topography of Antarctica Super-Resolution: Reasonable Integration of Multiple Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bed topography and roughness play important roles in numerous ice-sheet analyses. Although the coverage of ice-penetrating radar measurements has vastly increased over recent decades, significant data gaps remain in certain areas of subglacial topography and need interpolation. However, the bed topography generated by interpolation such as kriging and mass conservation is generally smooth at small scales, lacking topographic features important for sub-kilometer roughness. DeepBedMap, a deep learning method combined with multiple surface observation inputs, can generate high-resolution (250 m) bed topography with realistic bed roughness but produces some unrealistic artifacts and higher bed elevation values in certain regions, which could bias ice-sheet models. To address these issues, we present MB_DeepBedMap, a multi-branch deep learning method to generate more realistic bed topography. The model improves upon DeepBedMap by separating inputs into two groups using a multi-branch network structure according to their characteristics, rather than fusing all inputs at an early stage, to reduce artifacts in the generated topography caused by earlier fusion of inputs. A direct upsampling branch preserves large-scale subglacial landforms while generating high-resolution bed topography. We use MB_DeepBedMap to generate a high-resolution (250 m) bed elevation grid product of Antarctica, MB_DeepBedMap_DEM, which can be used in high-resolution ice-sheet modeling studies. Moreover, we test the performance of MB_DeepBedMap model in Thwaites Glacier, Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, and several other regions, by comparing the qualitative topographic features and quantitative errors of MB_DeepBedMap, BEDMAP2, BedMachine Antarctica, and DeepBedMap. The results show that MB_DeepBedMap can provide more realistic small-scale topographic features and roughness compared to BEDMAP2, BedMachine Antarctica, and DeepBedMap.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution of Residential Exposure to Green Space in Beijing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space has a critical impact on the urban ecological environment, residents' health, and urban sustainability. Quantifying residential exposure to green space and proposing targeted enhancement strategies in urban areas is helpful to rationally plan urban green space construction, reduce the inequality in residential exposure to green space, and promote environmental equity. However, the long-time evolution analysis of residential exposure to green space at different scales and the influence of green space quality on residential exposure to green space are rarely reported. Here we produced a long-time series dataset of urban green space from 1990 to 2020 based on the 30 m Landsat data and used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a representation of the green space quality to comprehensively analyze residential exposure to green space at the city and block scales within the 5th ring of Beijing, China. We found that the urban green space in Beijing is mainly distributed in urban areas between the 4th and 5th rings (i.e., 153.4 km(2) in 2020), and there is little green space within the 2nd ring area (i.e., 12.6 km(2) in 2020). There is clear spatial inequality in residential exposure to green space, and about 2.88 million (i.e., similar to 27%) residents have experienced different degrees of decline in residential exposure to green space from 2015 to 2020. However, the degree of inequality in residential exposure to green space has gradually weakened from a high level (Palma ratio = 2.84) in 1990 to a relatively low level (Palma ratio = 0.81) in 2020. In addition, the spatial-temporal analysis method of residential exposure to green space based on green space quality has certain advantages that can help explore the degraded and lost areas of green space.

TI  - Iceland Kinematics From InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale ground deformation in Iceland is dominated by extensional plate-boundary deformation, where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge crosses the island, and by uplift due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) from thinning and retreat of glaciers. While this deformation is mostly steady over multiple years, it is modulated by smaller-scale transient deformation associated with, for example, earthquakes, volcanic unrest, and geothermal exploitation. Here, we combine countrywide Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data (from six tracks) from 2015 to 2021 with continuous Global Navigation Satellite System observations to produce time series of displacements across Iceland. The InSAR results were improved in a two-step tropospheric mitigation procedure, using (a) global atmospheric models to reduce long-wavelength and topography-correlated tropospheric signals, and (b) modeling of the stochastic properties of the residual troposphere. Our results significantly improve upon earlier countrywide InSAR results, which were based on InSAR stacking, as we use more data, better data weighting, and advanced InSAR corrections to produce time series of ground displacements instead of just velocities. We fuse the three ascending and three descending track results to estimate maps of East and Up velocities, which clearly show the large-scale extension and GIA deformation. Using revised plate-spreading and GIA models, based on these new ground velocity maps, we remove the large-scale and steady deformation from the InSAR time series and analyze the remaining transient deformations. Our results demonstrate the importance of (a) mitigating InSAR tropospheric signals over Iceland and of (b) solving for time series of deformation, not just velocities, as multiple transient deformation processes are present.

TI  - Analysis of the Rockfall Phenomena Contributing to the Evolution of a Pocket Beach Area Using Traditional and Remotely Acquired Data (Lo Zingaro Nature Reserve, Southern Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal domain of central western Sicily is characterized by the presence of rocky coasts, which mainly consist of pocket beaches situated between bedrock headlands that constitute ecological niches of great touristic and economic value. In this peculiar morphodynamic system, the sedimentary contributions are mainly derived from the rockfall that affects the back of nearby cliffs or the sediment supply of small streams that flow into it. In this study, we investigated the geomorphological processes and related landforms that contribute to the evolution of a pocket beach area located in a coastal sector of NW Sicily Island. The cliffs in this are affected by several rockfalls, and deposits from these rockfalls also add to the rate of sedimentary contribution. The analysis was conducted through the application of traditional approaches and contemporary methods that have previously been used to forecast the collection of input data in the field, often under difficult conditions due to the accessibility of the sites, and which have been supported by UAV surveys. Through the analysis of the digital models of terrain and orthophotos, geometrical and multitemporal analyses of landforms were carried out. A dedicated software was utilized for the detection of rockfall runout zones and block trajectories and for defining the automatic extraction of rock mass discontinuities. The data were compared with those derived from traditional geomechanical surveys. The availability of the existing and acquired remote sensing data proved essential for this study for both defining the reference geological model and for performing the site-specific analysis of rockfall.

TI  - Satellite SAR Interferometry and On-Site Traditional SHM to Monitor the Post-Earthquake Behavior of the Civic Tower in L'Aquila (Abruzzo Region, Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) represents a very powerful tool to assess the health condition of buildings. In recent years, the growing availability of high-resolution SAR satellite images has made possible the application of multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) techniques for structural monitoring purposes, with high precision, low costs, timesaving, and the possibility to investigate wide areas. However, a comprehensive validation of the effectiveness of MT-InSAR in this application field has not been achieved yet. For this reason, in this paper a comparison between interferometric data and on-site measurement of displacements is proposed. The application case study is the Civic Tower of the city of L'Aquila (Abruzzo Region, Italy). After the seismic events that affected the area in 2009, an on-site monitoring system was installed on the tower to detect any changes in the damage pattern in the period 2010-2013. Furthermore, images acquired by COSMO-SkyMed constellation in Stripmap mode (similar to 3 m resolution) during the same period were processed by the Permanent Scatterer-InSAR (PSI) technique to estimate the deformation of the structure and the surrounding area. The obtained results indicate that both methods are consistent in the measurement of displacement trends of the building and a slight rotation/displacement of the tower was detected. Such evidence highlights both the huge potential and the limitations of using InSAR techniques for SHM.

TI  - LASSO (L1) Regularization for Development of Sparse Remote-Sensing Models with Applications in Optically Complex Waters Using GEE Tools
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing data are used extensively to monitor water quality parameters such as clarity, temperature, and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) content. This is generally achieved by collecting in situ data coincident with satellite data collections and then creating empirical water quality models using approaches such as multi-linear regression or step-wise linear regression. These approaches, which require modelers to select model parameters, may not be well suited for optically complex waters, where interference from suspended solids, dissolved organic matter, or other constituents may act as "confusers". For these waters, it may be useful to include non-standard terms, which might not be considered when using traditional methods. Recent machine-learning work has demonstrated an ability to explore large feature spaces and generate accurate empirical models that do not require parameter selection. However, these methods, because of the large number of included terms involved, result in models that are not explainable and cannot be analyzed. We explore the use of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Select Operator (LASSO), or L1, regularization to fit linear regression models and produce parsimonious models with limited terms to enable interpretation and explainability. We demonstrate this approach with a case study in which chl-a models are developed for Utah Lake, Utah, USA., an optically complex freshwater body, and compare the resulting model terms to model terms from the literature. We discuss trade-offs between interpretability and model performance while using L1 regularization as a tool. The resulting model terms are both similar to and distinct from those in the literature, thereby suggesting that this approach is useful for the development of models for optically complex water bodies where standard model terms may not be optimal. We investigate the effect of non-coincident data, that is, the length of time between satellite image collection and in situ sampling, on model performance. We find that, for Utah Lake (for which there are extensive data available), three days is the limit, but 12 h provides the best trade-off. This value is site-dependent, and researchers should use site-specific numbers. To document and explain our approach, we provide Colab notebooks for compiling near-coincident data pairs of remote-sensing and in situ data using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and a second notebook implementing L1 model creation using scikitlearn. The second notebook includes data-engineering routines with which to generate band ratios, logs, and other combinations. The notebooks can be easily modified to adapt them to other locations, sensors, or parameters.

TI  - The Development of Copper Clad Laminate Horn Antennas for Drone Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an active remote sensing technique that typically utilises satellite data to quantify Earth surface and structural deformation. Drone InSAR should provide improved spatial-temporal data resolutions and operational flexibility. This necessitates the development of custom radar hardware for drone deployment, including antennas for the transmission and reception of microwave electromagnetic signals. We present the design, simulation, fabrication, and testing of two lightweight and inexpensive copper clad laminate (CCL)/printed circuit board (PCB) horn antennas for C-band radar deployed on the DJI Matrice 600 Pro drone. This is the first demonstration of horn antennas fabricated from CCL, and the first complete overview of antenna development for drone radar applications. The dimensions are optimised for the desired gain and centre frequency of 19 dBi and 5.4 GHz, respectively. The S-11, directivity/gain, and half power beam widths (HPBW) are simulated in MATLAB, with the antennas tested in a radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic anechoic chamber using a calibrated vector network analyser (VNA) for comparison. The antennas are highly directive with gains of 15.80 and 16.25 dBi, respectively. The reduction in gain compared to the simulated value is attributed to a resonant frequency shift caused by the brass input feed increasing the electrical dimensions. The measured S-11 and azimuth HPBW either meet or exceed the simulated results. A slight performance disparity between the two antennas is attributed to minor artefacts of the manufacturing and testing processes. The incorporation of the antennas into the drone payload is presented. Overall, both antennas satisfy our performance criteria and highlight the potential for CCL/PCB/FR-4 as a lightweight and inexpensive material for custom antenna production in drone radar and other antenna applications.

TI  - Estimating Daily NO<sub>2</sub> Ground Level Concentrations Using Sentinel-5P and Ground Sensor Meteorological Measurements
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental and health deterioration due to the increasing presence of air pollutants is a pressing topic for governments and organizations. Institutions such as the European Environment Agency have determined that more than 350,000 premature deaths can be attributed to atmospheric pollutants. The measurement of trace gas atmospheric concentrations is key for environmental agencies to fight against the decreased deterioration of air quality. NO2, which is one of the most harmful pollutants, has the potential to cause diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Unfortunately, not all countries have local atmospheric pollutant monitoring networks to perform ground measurements (especially Low- and Middle-Income Countries). Although some alternatives, such as satellite technologies, provide a good approximation for tropospheric NO2, these do not measure concentrations at the ground level. In this work, we aim to provide an alternative to ground sensor measurements. We used a combination of ground meteorological measurements with satellite Sentinel-5P observations to estimate ground NO2. For this task, we used state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, linear regression models, and feature selection algorithms. From the results obtained, we found that a Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor and Kriging in combination with a Random Forest feature selection algorithm achieved the lowest RMSE (2.89 mu g/m(3)). This result, in comparison with the real data standard deviation and the models using only satellite data, represented an RMSE decrease of 55%. Future work will focus on replacing the use of meteorological ground sensors with only satellite-based data.

TI  - Evapotranspiration in Semi-Arid Climate: Remote Sensing vs. Soil Water Simulation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETa) is an important requirement for a rational assessment and management of water resources. The various remote sensing products allow the determination of crops' biophysical variables integrated in the evaluation of ETa by using surface energy balance (SEB) models. This study compares ETa estimated by the simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) using Landsat 8 optical and thermal infra-red spectral bands and transit model HYDRUS-1D. In semi-arid Tunisia, real time measurements of soil water content (theta) and pore electrical conductivity (ECp) were made in the crop root zone using capacitive sensors (5TE) for rainfed and drip irrigated crops (barley and potato). Results show that HYDRUS model is a fast and cost-effective assessment tool for water flow and salt movement in the crop root layer. ETa estimated by S-SEBI varies according to the available energy resulting from the difference between the net radiation and soil flux G(0), and more specifically according to the assessed G(0) from remote sensing. Compared to HYDRUS, the ETa from S-SEBI was estimated to have an R-2 of 0.86 and 0.70 for barley and potato, respectively. The S-SEBI performed better for rainfed barley (RMSE between 0.35 and 0.46 mm center dot d(-1)) than for drip irrigated potato (RMSE between 1.5 and 1.9 mm center dot d(-1)).

TI  - Reconstructing 34 Years of Fire History in the Wet, Subtropical Vegetation of Hong Kong Using Landsat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burn-area products from remote sensing provide the backbone for research in fire ecology, management, and modelling. Landsat imagery could be used to create an accurate burn-area map time series at ecologically relevant spatial resolutions. However, the low temporal resolution of Landsat has limited its development in wet tropical and subtropical regions due to high cloud cover and rapid burn-area revegetation. Here, we describe a 34-year Landsat-based burn-area product for wet, subtropical Hong Kong. We overcame technical obstacles by adopting a new LTS fire burn-area detection pipeline that (1) Automatically uniformized Landsat scenes by weighted histogram matching; (2) Estimated pixel resemblance to burn areas based on a random forest model trained on the number of days between the fire event and the date of burn-area detection; (3) Iteratively merged features created by thresholding burn-area resemblance to generate burn-area polygons with detection dates; and (4) Estimated the burn severity of burn-area pixels using a time-series compatible approach. When validated with government fire records, we found that the LTS fire product carried a low area of omission (11%) compared with existing burn-area products, such as GABAM (49%), MCD64A1 (72%), and FireCCI51 (96%) while effectively controlling commission errors. Temporally, the LTS fire pipeline dated 76.9% of burn-area polygons within two months of the actual fire event. The product represents the first Landsat-based burn-area product in wet tropical and subtropical Asia that covers the entire time series. We believe that burn-area products generated from algorithms like LTS fire will effectively bridge the gap between remote sensing and field-based studies on wet tropical and subtropical fire ecology.

TI  - Extraction and Analysis of Radar Scatterer Attributes for PAZ SAR by Combining Time Series InSAR, PolSAR, and Land Use Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting meaningful attributes of radar scatterers from SAR images, PAZ in our case, facilitates a better understanding of SAR data and physical interpretation of deformation processes. The attribute categories and attribute extraction method are not yet thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study recognizes three attribute categories: geometric, physical, and land-use attributes, and aims to design a new scheme to extract these attributes of every coherent radar scatterer. Specifically, we propose to obtain geometric information and its dynamics over time of the radar scatterers using time series InSAR (interferometric SAR) techniques, with SAR images in HH and VV separately. As all InSAR observations are relative in time and space, we convert the radar scatterers in HH and VV to a common reference system by applying a spatial reference alignment method. Regarding the physical attributes of the radar scatterers, we first employ a Random Forest classification method to categorize scatterers in terms of scattering mechanisms (including surface, low-, high-volume, and double bounce scattering), and then assign the scattering mechanism to every radar scatterer. We propose using a land-use product (i.e., TOP10NL data for our case) to create reliable labeled samples for training and validation. In addition, the radar scatterers can inherit land-use attributes from the TOP10NL data. We demonstrate this new scheme with 30 Spanish PAZ SAR images in HH and VV acquired between 2019 and 2021, covering an area in the province of Friesland, the Netherlands, and analyze the extracted attributes for data and deformation interpretation.

AB  - As a major human activity, urbanization exerts a strong impact on the fragile ecosystem in the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) region. To maintain sustainable development, reliable data on urban land change are required to assess the impact of urbanization. Here, the reliability evaluation of four global fine-resolution impervious surface area (ISA) products: global annual impervious area (GAIA), global annual urban dynamics (GAUD), global impervious surface area (GISA), and global urban expansion (GUE) was carried out. The characteristics of urban expansion for five representative cities including Kabul, Lhasa, Lijiang, Thimphu, and Xining were remarkably different. Based on the results of incremental analysis and the spatial difference of the ISA, it was found that the GAIA dataset at a 30-m spatial resolution could provide better ISA information than the others in characterizing urban expansion in the mountainous region. Subsequently, the changes in the urban area were analyzed using the GAIA dataset from 1993 to 2018. In general, human settlements had grown, with the transformation of small villages into larger towns and some towns into major cities. Urban expansion would continuously intensify the contradictions between human activity and sustainability and exert a more significant impact on the fragile ecosystem in the HKH region. More attention should be paid to the impact of urbanization on the fragile mountainous ecosystem.

TI  - MAFF-HRNet: Multi-Attention Feature Fusion HRNet for Building Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up areas and buildings are two main targets in remote sensing research; consequently, automatic extraction of built-up areas and buildings has attracted extensive attention. This task is usually difficult because of boundary blur, object occlusion, and intra-class inconsistency. In this paper, we propose the multi-attention feature fusion HRNet, MAFF-HRNet, which can retain more detailed features to achieve accurate semantic segmentation. The design of a pyramidal feature attention (PFA) hierarchy enhances the multilevel semantic representation of the model. In addition, we develop a mixed convolutional attention (MCA) block, which increases the capture range of receptive fields and overcomes the problem of intra-class inconsistency. To alleviate interference due to occlusion, a multiscale attention feature aggregation (MAFA) block is also proposed to enhance the restoration of the final prediction map. Our approach was systematically tested on the WHU (Wuhan University) Building Dataset and the Massachusetts Buildings Dataset. Compared with other advanced semantic segmentation models, our model achieved the best IoU results of 91.69% and 68.32%, respectively. To further evaluate the application significance of the proposed model, we migrated a pretrained model based on the World-Cover Dataset training to the Gaofen 16 m dataset for testing. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our model can accurately segment buildings and built-up areas from remote sensing images.

TI  - Land use land cover change and socio-economic activities in the Burunge Wildlife Management Area ecosystem during COVID-19
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover change (LULCC) is among the major factors affecting the natural environment worldwide. Studying LULCC is essential as it contributes to natural resource management, biodiversity conservation, and land use planning, especially during pandemics such as COVID-19. This study aimed at assessing the trend (1995-2021) and magnitude of LULCC in the Burunge WMA ecosystem before (2015-2018) and during COVID-19 (2018-2021). The data on LULCC were collected from the satellite imagery on the USGS website, whereas the data on perceptions of local communities on LULCC from Mwada, Kakoi and Maweni villages were collected through a household questionnaire survey (HQS) of 445 randomly sampled households, focused group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). Quantitative data were analyzed using MS Excel 2019, R software (2022.02.0 + 443) and ArcGIS (Version 10.8). Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis techniques. The findings indicated a fluctuation in agriculture, forest, and water coverage. For instance, agriculture and settlements increased significantly by 23.91% in 2015-2021 and 5.71% in 1995-2005 respectively, whereas forested land showed a maximum increase of 7.33% in 1995-2005. However, there was a pronounced increase in agricultural lands (3.99%) during the COVID-19 phase as compared to the same time frame before the pandemic. Local communities pointed to agriculture and settlements as the major activities contributing to LULCC. The findings show significant LULCC in Burunge WMA which calls for special attention from responsible authorities and other stakeholders for the achievement of biodiversity conservation and the development of livelihoods in the area.

TI  - Identification of Rubber Plantations in Southwestern China Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data and Phenology Windows
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous transformation from biodiverse natural forests and mixed-use farms into monoculture rubber plantations may lead to a series of hazards, such as natural forest habitats fragmentation, biodiversity loss, as well as drought and water shortage. Therefore, understanding the spatial distribution of rubber plantations is crucial to regional ecological security and a sustainable economy. However, the spectral characteristics of rubber tree is easily mixed with other vegetation such as natural forests, tea plantations, orchards and shrubs, which brings difficulty and uncertainty to regional scale identification. In this paper, we proposed a classification method combines multi-source phenology characteristics and random forest algorithm. On the basis of optimization of input samples and features, phenological spectrum, brightness, greenness, wetness, fractional vegetation cover, topography and other features of rubber were extracted. Five classification schemes were constructed for comparison, and the one with the highest classification accuracy was used to identify the spatial pattern of rubber plantations in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2020 in Xishuangbanna. The results show that: (1) the identification results are in consistent with field survey and rubber plantations area generally shows a first increasing and then decreasing trend; (2) the Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient of the proposed method are 90.0% and 0.86, respectively, with a Producer's Accuracy (PA) and User's Accuracy (UA) of 95.2% and 88.8%, respectively; (3) cross-validation was employed to analyze the accuracy evaluation indexes of the identification results: both PA and UA of the rubber plantations stay stable over 85%, with the minimum fluctuation and best stability of UA value. The OA value and Kappa coefficient were stable in the range of 0.88-0.90 and 0.84-0.86, respectively. The method proposed provides reliable results on spatial distribution of rubber, and is potentially transferable to other mountainous areas as a robust approach for rapid monitoring of rubber plantations.

TI  - Ecosystems threatened by intensified drought with divergent vulnerability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change is projected to increase the severity and duration of droughts across many regions of the world, which could push ecosystems across their tipping points. To protect the most vulnerable ecosystems, it is critical to understand if ecosystems are likely to collapse rapidly or have a certain buffer capacity with aggra-vating drought (as characterized by their onset, duration and severity). However, such ecosystem vulnerability has been rarely characterized. Here, we present a novel, multi-faceted approach to quantify the ecosystem vulnerability and associated impacts of drought characteristics across different ecosystems at the continental -scale in Europe using high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data. We observed substantially different vulnerabilities across ecosystems where the vegetation damage increases with earlier, longer and more intense droughts. In particular, irrigated croplands are under prominently high risk when facing intensified droughts with the shortest delay in response to drought (0.67 times that of other ecosystems) and a fast increase in damage to drought (1.27 times that of other ecosystems). Mixed forests have a prominently low vulnerability in terms of a notably slow increase in damage to drought (0.67 times that of other ecosystems) and a relatively long response time (longer than over half ecosystems). Moreover, the vulnerability of most ecosystems largely increases with increasing drought severity. Consequently, vegetation tends to succumb more quickly to intensified droughts. Our multi-faceted approach to ecosystem vulnerability characterization indicates that under future intensified droughts in the 21st century, the functioning of a vast range of ecosystems will be threatened.

TI  - Generalized Interval Type-II Fuzzy Rough Model-Based Feature Discretization for Mixed Pixels
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature discretization algorithms of remote sensing images are often based on the assumption that a sample only belongs to a single category and cannot describe uncertainty caused by mixed pixels. Fuzzy rough models quantify uncertain information by introducing the memberships of pixels to each category. However, there are large errors in the decomposition model of mixed pixels, making the obtained memberships fuzzy. To overcome this weakness, we propose a feature discretization algorithm based on the generalized interval type-II fuzzy rough set for mixed pixels (GIT2FRSD). We use the fuzzy mean vector and the fuzzy covariance matrix to calculate the primary grades of pixels to each ground object and determine the secondary grades according to the distribution of pixels in the boundary region of the rough set. Then, we construct the fitness function using the magnitude of the reduction of the number of breakpoints and the average approximation precision of the generalized interval type-II fuzzy rough set and search for the best discrete breakpoints in all bands of the remote sensing image using an adaptive genetic algorithm. Our method further fuzzifies the abundance information, more accurately quantifying and evaluating the uncertainty caused by mixed pixels at a time complexity similar to that of the fuzzy rough model. The experimental results on GF-2 and Landsat 8 images show that compared with current mainstream discretization algorithms, our method has better search efficiency. It obtains the minimum number of discrete intervals while ensuring data consistency and achieves the highest classification accuracy.

TI  - Satellite Imagery Recording the Process and Pattern of Winter Temperature Field in Yangtze Estuary Interrupted by a Cold Wave
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is a key marine ecological metric. An optimized split-window algorithm was used to invert the Yangtze Estuary's temperature field during a cold wave process. Additionally, MODIS SST inversion results were used to explore the effects of typical cold waves on the Yangtze Estuary's temperature field through the application of a temperature profile analysis method and a multiscale, multidirectional edge detection algorithm. According to the findings, (1) the cold wave altered the temperature field characteristics and the temperature front intensity, morphology, and spatial distribution pattern within the Yangtze Estuary for a short period. The strong temperature front displayed irregular edges and scattered patterns due to the combined effects of cold water masses produced by the cold wave and the tides and the warm water currents outside the mouth. (2) The cold wave caused significant short-term deviations in the Yangtze Estuary's SST. The cold water tongue stretched across the entire Yangtze Estuary, where the temperature dropped sharply with time, with the maximum cooling occurring outside the mouth, at 12.2 degrees C, and the minimum cooling occurring inside the mouth, at only 5.5 degrees C. (3) The spatially gradual warming of the Yangtze Estuary's SST from inside to outside the mouth became a low-lower-high pattern during cold waves. (4) The cold wave exhibited a greater influence on the strength, form, and distribution of the temperature front. Studying the effects of cold waves on the Yangtze Estuary's temperature field has significant theoretical and practical implications for understanding the changes in the winter temperature field, environmental protection, disaster mitigation, and prevention.

TI  - The spatial configuration of buildings: A vital consideration impossible to ignore in regulating urban land surface temperature? Evidence from 35 Chinese cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land urbanization not only efficiently met the requirements of social development but also brought severe heating effects, especially the changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST). The effects of building density on LST and driving relation of the configuration of buildings remain poorly understood over large areas. Using Landsat 8 satellite imagery acquired from the summer of 2019, this study quantified the heating effects (k) of building density on LST across 35 cities in China, and further analyzed the driving relation of the configuration of buildings such as the size, shape, and spatial distribution on k. Here the regression analysis results showed that the building density had a significant relationship with LST, and the k varied from 1.10 to 7.27 amount of the different cities. The size and aggregation distribution of buildings were the main positive drivers for the effects of building density on LST, and the shape of buildings was not obviously related to the k-value. The results of thermal environment simulation showed that the major reason might be that the close spatial relationship reduced the heat exchange between buildings and the atmosphere, resulting in higher LST. These conclusions will provide an important reference for urban planning and design.

TI  - Surface water and aerosol spatiotemporal dynamics and influence mechanisms over drylands
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of global warming and excessive human activities, much surface water in drylands is experiencing rapid degradation or shrinkage in recent years. The shrinkage of surface water, especially the degradation of lakes and their adjacent wetlands in drylands, may lead to the emergence of new salt dust storm hotspots, which causes greater danger. In this paper, based on high spatial resolution global surface water (GSW) and multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) AOD data, we systematically analyze the dynamic characteristics of surface water and aerosols in typical drylands (Central Asia, CA) between 2000 and 2018. Simultaneously, combined with auxiliary environment vari-ables, we explore the driving mechanisms of surface water on the regional salt/sand aerosols on different spatial scales. The results show that the seasonal surface water features an increasing trend, especially a more dramatic increase after 2015, and the permanent surface water indicates an overall decrease, with nearly 54.367 % at risk of receding and drying up. In typical lakes (Aral Sea and Ebinur Lake), the inter-annual change feature of the surface water area (WA) is that a continuous decrease during the study per-iod occurs in Aral Sea area, yet a significant improvement has occurred in Ebinur Lake after 2015, and the degradation of Ebinur Lake takes place later and its recovery earlier than Aral Sea. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) in CA shows obvious seasonal variation, with the largest in spring (0.192 +/- 0173), next in summer (0.169 +/- 0.106), and the smallest in autumn (0.123 +/- 0.065). The interannual variation of AOD exhibits an increase from 2000 to 2018 in CA, with high AOD areas mainly concentrated in the Taklamakan Desert and some lake beds resulting from lake degradation, including Aral Sea and Ebinur Lake. The AOD holds a similar trend between Aral Sea and Ebinur Lake on an interannual scale. And the AOD over Ebinur Lake is lower than that over Aral Sea in magnitude and lags behind in reaching the peak compared with Aral Sea. The WA change can significantly affect aerosol variation directly or indirectly on the aerosol load or mode size, but there are obvious differences in the driving mechanisms, acting paths, and influence magnitude of WA on aerosols on different spatial scales. In addition, the increase of WA can significantly directly suppress the increase of Angstrom exponent (AE), and the effects of WA on AOD are realized majorly by an indirect approach. From the typical lake perspective, the effects of WA on aerosol in Aral Sea are achieved via an indirect path; and the decrease of WA can indirectly pro-mote the AOD rise, and directly stimulate the AE growth in Ebinur Lake.(c) 2022 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

TI  - Conjoint Inversion of Snow Temperature Profiles from Microwave and Infrared Brightness Temperature in Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow temperature above the ice sheet is one of the basic characteristic parameters of the ice sheet, which plays an important role in the study of the global climate. Because infrared and microwaves with different frequencies have different penetration depths in snow, it is possible to retrieve the snow temperature profiles by combining microwave and infrared brightness temperatures. This paper proposes a conjoint inversion algorithm to retrieve snow temperature profiles by combining multi-frequency microwave brightness temperature (BT) with infrared BT, in which different weight functions of microwave BT at different frequencies are adopted, and the atmosphere influence has also been corrected. The snow temperature profile data are retrieved based on AMSR2 microwave BT data and MODIS infrared BT data in 2017 and 2018, which are evaluated by comparing with the measured snow temperature at Dome-C station. The results confirm that the inverted snow temperature profiles are consistent with the field observation data from the Dome-C station. Multi-frequency microwave brightness temperature can be used to invert the snow temperature profiles; however, the inverted snow surface temperature is more accurate by combining the infrared BT with the microwave BT in the conjoint inversion algorithm.

TI  - Debris Flow Gully Classification and Susceptibility Assessment Model Construction
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The location of debris flow occurring in a gully determines the observable differences in its formation, evolution and effects. In this piece of research, we propose a new method for debris flow gully classification based on the locations of the debris flows occurring in the gullies. It is termed the three-section method (TSM). It includes eight different types of gullies with different digital identifications (IDs) and susceptibility degrees (SDs). By taking the Jiangjia Gully (JJG), in Yunnan, China, as a case study site, the main gully and the sub-gullies at different levels were identified using a hydrological analysis method. Then, the gullies were divided into different types using the new classification TSM. The results show that there are seven different types of debris flow gullies in the JJG. The number of different types varied greatly in gullies at different levels. In particular, the topological diagram of debris flow gullies was drawn after simplifying the shape of the gullies, and it was a good way to understand the characteristics of debris flow gullies. Finally, the relationships were explored between the hypsometric integrals (HIs), surface exposures (SEs) and susceptibility degrees (SDs), and a new calculation model construction method for determining the degree of debris flow susceptibility was proposed. This model, using the above method, can not only be used to calculate the SDs of debris flows in the gullies, but can also be instrumental in pointing out the approximate locations of the debris flow commonly and easily occurring in the gullies. We hope that our research can provide a new concept for the assessment of debris flow susceptibility.

TI  - Responses to the Impact of Drought on Carbon and Water Use Efficiency in Inner Mongolia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of plants' carbon and water use efficiency and their responses to drought are crucial to the sustainable development of arid and semi-arid environments. This study used trend analysis and partial correlation analysis to examine the carbon use efficiency (CUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) of Inner Mongolia's vegetation from 2001 to 2020. MODIS data for gross primary productivity (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), potential evapotranspiration (PET), evapotranspiration (ET), drought severity index (DSI), and plant type were used. Altered trends were observed for drought during 2001-2020 in the study area. The results revealed that 98.17% of the research area's drought trend was from dry to wet and 1.83% was from wet to dry, and the regions with decreased drought regions were broadly dispersed. In 2001-2020, CUE in Inner Mongolia declined by 0.1%center dot year(-1), whereas WUE reduced by 0.008 g C center dot mm(-1)center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1), but the total change was not significant. CUE decreased from west to east, whereas WUE increased from southwest to northeast. DSI and CUE had the highest negative connection, accounting for 97.96% of the watershed area, and 71.6% passed the significance test. The correlation coefficients of DSI and WUE were spatially opposite to those of CUE and DSI. In total, 54.21% of the vegetation cover exhibited a negative connection with DSI. The CUE and WUE of different vegetation types in Inner Mongolia were negatively correlated with the DSI index except for grasslands (GRA). Drought in Inner Mongolia mostly influenced the CUE of different plant types, which had a higher negative correlation than WUE. The study's findings can inform climate change research on Inner Mongolia's carbon and water cycles.

TI  - Carbon Stock Prediction in Managed Forest Ecosystems Using Bayesian and Frequentist Geostatistical Techniques and New Generation Remote Sensing Metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study compares the performance of a hierarchical Bayesian geostatistical methodology with a frequentist geostatistical approach, specifically, Kriging with External Drift (KED), for predicting C stock using prediction aides from the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing platforms. The frequentist geostatistical approach's reliance on the long-run frequency of repeated experiments for constructing confidence intervals is not always practical or feasible, as practitioners typically have access to a single dataset due to cost constraints on surveys and sampling. We evaluated two approaches for C stock prediction using two new generation multispectral remote sensing datasets because of the inherent uncertainty characterizing spatial prediction problems in the unsampled locations, as well as differences in how the Bayesian and frequentist geostatistical paradigms handle uncertainty. Information on C stock spectral prediction in the form of NDVI, SAVI, and EVI derived from multispectral remote sensing platforms, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, was used to build Bayesian and frequentist-based C stock predictive models in the sampled plantation forest ecosystem. Sentinel-2-based C stock predictive models outperform their Landsat-8 counterparts using both the Bayesian and frequentist inference approaches. However, the Bayesian-based Sentinel-2 C stock predictive model (RMSE = 0.17 MgCha(-1)) is more accurate than its frequentist-based Sentinel-2 (RMSE = 1.19 MgCha(-1)) C stock equivalent. The Sentinel-2 frequentist-based C stock predictive model gave the C stock prediction range of 1 = MgCha(-1) =290, whilst the Sentinel-2 Bayesian-based C stock predictive model resulted in the prediction range of 1 = MgCha(-1) = 285. However, both the Bayesian and frequentist C stock predictive models built with the Landsat-8 sensor overpredicted the sampled C stock because the range of predicted values fell outside the range of the observed C stock values. As a result, we recommend and conclude that the Bayesian-based C stock prediction method, when it is combined with high-quality remote sensing data such as that of Sentinel-2, is an effective inferential statistical methodology for reporting C stock in managed plantation forest ecosystems.

TI  - Surgical Planning after Neoadjuvant Treatment in Breast Cancer: A Multimodality Imaging-Based Approach Focused on MRI
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary The effectiveness of neoadjuvant treatment has led to an expansion of its indications from locally advanced to highly chemo-sensitive early-stage breast cancers, aiming to increase conservative treatments, in place of more invasive surgery, and to improve long term outcomes. At the same time, the continuous development of diagnostic techniques necessitates continuous updating, due to their importance in tumoral staging and in the prediction of the response to treatment, as well as in surgical planning. With our review, we sought to discuss the strengths of the various imaging modalities; in particular, the role of magnetic resonance imaging, which is still the center of scientific debate in this setting. Moreover, we analyzed the evolution of surgical approaches to breast cancer in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) today represents a cornerstone in the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer and highly chemo-sensitive tumors at early stages, increasing the possibilities of performing more conservative treatments and improving long term outcomes. Imaging has a fundamental role in the staging and prediction of the response to NACT, thus aiding surgical planning and avoiding overtreatment. In this review, we first examine and compare the role of conventional and advanced imaging techniques in preoperative T Staging after NACT and in the evaluation of lymph node involvement. In the second part, we analyze the different surgical approaches, discussing the role of axillary surgery, as well as the possibility of non-operative management after-NACT, which has been the subject of recent trials. Finally, we focus on emerging techniques that will change the diagnostic assessment of breast cancer in the near future.

TI  - Monitoring of the irrigated coconut orchard by biophysical parameters determined by Landsat 8 image
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite imagery is a tool that over the last few years has contributed to the management of agricultural areas. In this context, the objective was to determine and monitor the dynamics of biophysical parameters in the irrigated coconut orchard in the Brazilian semi-arid region, using remote sensing techniques using orbital images from LANDSAT 8. Evaluating the biophysical parameters; albedo, NDVI, IAF, and Ts. Processing was performed by the METRIC algorithm. All estimates of biophysical parameters were evaluated using descriptive statistics using the main measures of position and dispersion, and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The determination of albedo, leaf area indices and surface temperature from the Landsat 8 satellite image, allowed the detection of the influence of management, seasonality and loads of correlations between the biophysical parameters in the coconut crop. Being a promising technique in the management of agricultural areas, reducing cost and time, helping in decision making.

TI  - Post-vaccination seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 in peruvian health workers vaccinated with BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm)
T2  - TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of post-vaccination seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 and identify its predictors in Peruvian Social Health Insurance (EsSalud) personnel in 2021. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a representative simple stratified sample of EsSalud workers. We evaluated IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies response (seropositivity) by passive (previous infection) and active immunization (vaccination), and epidemiological and occupational variables obtained by direct interview and a data collection form. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used with correction of sample weights adjusted for non-response rate, and crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and geometric mean ratio (GMR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were estimated.Results: We enrolled 1077 subjects. Seropositivity was 67.4% (95%CI: 63.4-71.1). Predictors of seropositivity were age (negative relation; p < 0.001), previous infection (aOR = 11.7; 95%CI: 7.81-17.5), working in COVID-19 area (aOR = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.02-2.11) and time since the second dose. In relation to antibody levels measured by geometric means, there was an association between male sex (aGMR = 0.77; 95%CI: 0.74-0.80), age (negative relation; p < 0.001), previous infection (aGMR = 13.1; 95%CI:4.99-34.40), non-face-to-face/licensed work modality (aGMR = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.73-0.84), being a nursing technician (aGMR = 1.30; 95%CI: 1.20-1.41), working in administrative areas (aGMR = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.10-1.25), diagnostic support (aGMR = 1.07; 95%CI: 1.01-1.15), critical care (aGMR = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.79-0.93), and in a COVID-19 area (aGMR = 1.30; 95%CI: 1.24-1.36) and time since receiving the second dose (negative relation; p < 0.001).Conclusions: Seropositivity and antibody levels decrease as the time since receiving the second dose increases. Older age and no history of previous infection were associated with lower seropositivity and antibody values. These findings may be useful for sentinel antibody surveillance and the design of booster dose strategies.

TI  - Identification of the Spectral Patterns of Cultivated Plants and Weeds: Hyperspectral Vegetation Indices
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate recognition of weeds on crops supports the spot application of herbicides, the high economic effect and reduction of pesticide pressure on agrocenoses. We consider the approach based on the quantitative spectral characteristics of plant objects to be the most appropriate for the development of methods for the spot application of herbicides. We made test plots with different species composition of cultivated and weed plants on the experimental fields of the scientific crop rotation of the Federal Research Center of Biological Plant Protection. These plants form the basis of the agrocenoses of Krasnodar Krai. Our primary subjects are sunflower crops (Helianthus annuus L.), corn (Zea mais L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.)). Besides the test plots, pure and mixed backgrounds of weeds were identified, represented by the following species: ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), California-bur (Xanthium strumarium L.), red-root amaranth (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), white marrow (C. album L.) and field milk thistle (Sonchus arvensis L.). We used the Ocean Optics Maya 2000-Pro automated spectrometer to conduct high-precision ground-based spectrometric measurements of selected plants. We calculated the values of 15 generally accepted spectral index dependencies based on data processing from ground hyperspectral measurements of cultivated and weed plants. They aided in evaluating certain vegetation parameters. Factor analysis determined the relationship structure of variable values of hyperspectral vegetation indices into individual factor patterns. The analysis of variance assessed the information content of the indicators of index values within the limits of the selected factors. We concluded that most of the plant objects under consideration are characterized by the homogeneity of signs according to the values of the index indicators that make up the selected factors. However, in most of the cases, it is possible to identify different plant backgrounds, both by the values of individual vegetation indices and by generalized factorial coefficients. Our research results are important for the validation of remote aerospace observations using multispectral and hyperspectral instruments.

TI  - Can Satellites Predict Yield? Ensemble Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis of Sentinel-2 Imagery for Processing Tomato Yield Prediction
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for robust prediction of processing tomato yield using open-source AutoML techniques and statistical analysis. Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was deployed to obtain values of five (5) selected vegetation indices (VIs) during the growing season of 2021 (April to September) at 5-day intervals. Actual recorded yields were collected across 108 fields, corresponding to a total area of 410.10 ha of processing tomato in central Greece, to assess the performance of Vis at different temporal scales. In addition, VIs were connected with the crop phenology to establish the annual dynamics of the crop. The highest Pearson coefficient (r) values occurred during a period of 80 to 90 days, indicating the strong relationship between the VIs and the yield. Specifically, RVI presented the highest correlation values of the growing season at 80 (r = 0.72) and 90 days (r = 0.75), while NDVI performed better at 85 days (r = 0.72). This output was confirmed by the AutoML technique, which also indicated the highest performance of the VIs during the same period, with the values of the adjusted R-2 ranging from 0.60 to 0.72. The most precise results were obtained with the combination of ARD regression and SVR, which was the most successful combination for building an ensemble (adj. R-2 = 0.67 +/- 0.02).

TI  - Landsat-Based Assessment of Morphological Changes along the Sinai Mediterranean Coast between 1990 and 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess coastal dynamics of the Sinai Mediterranean coastline (SMC) between 1990 and 2020. In this study, remote sensing imagery and geographic information systems-based spatial computing methods were used for coastline change analysis. The study found that the SMC experienced major morphological changes during the period of study. The results show a spatial heterogeneity of coastline change rate over the study period with some periods of rapid change and other periods of stability. The overall analysis during the period of study indicated that the coastline has retreated landward approximately 555 m; the average annual erosion rate was 2.5 m/year. The percentage of the eroded section in the coastline is 60% with the remaining 40% either advancing or remaining stable. Sections of the coastline accreted as much as 542 m. The GIS-based DSAS model application used in this study is unique because it measured spatial variations of coastline dynamics over time using a multiple statistical approach.

TI  - Forest Fire Susceptibility Zonation in Eastern India Using Statistical and Weighted Modelling Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurring forest fires disturb ecological balance, impact socio-economic harmony, and raise global concern. This study implements multiple statistical and weighted modelling approaches to identify forest fire susceptibility zones in Eastern India. Six models, namely, Frequency Ratio (FR), Certainty Factor (CF), Natural Risk Factor (NRF), Bivariate statistical (Wi and Wf), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Logistic Regression (LR) were used in the study. Forest fire inventory (2001 to 2018) mapping was done using forest fire points captured by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor. Fire responsible components, namely, topography (which has four variables), climate (5), biophysics (8) and disturbance (4) were used as inputs to the modelling approaches. Multicollinearity analysis was carried out to examine the association and remove the highly-correlated variables before performing the modeling. Validation of model prediction levels was done using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC curve-AUC) value. The results reveal that the areas with west and southwest orientations, and moderate slope demarcate higher susceptibility to forest fire. High precipitation areas with lower temperature but ample solar radiation increase their susceptibility to forest fire. Mixed deciduous forest type with ample solar radiation, higher NDVI, lower NDWI and lower TWI values exhibits higher susceptibility. Model validation shows that LR (with AUC = 0.809) outperforms other models used in the study. To minimize the risk of fire and frame with proper management plans for the study area, susceptibility mapping using satellite imageries, GIS technique, and modelling approaches is highly recommended.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated workflow is developed to estimate the spatial distribution of harmful algal blooms, especially cyanobacteria concentrations in inland water bodies. The methodology comprises satellite data extraction and preprocessing for atmospheric and water surface corrections, identifying feature importance, in-situ sample collection, training and testing of machine learning algorithms, and prediction. Six input bands are selected using feature importance algorithms from 12 original bands of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In-situ sample data that are synchronous with Sentinel-2 image capture time were obtained from a public database. These models are evaluated and compared using spider plots of different error calculations. The workflow developed in this study and the predicted spatial concentration of harmful algal blooms across the lake can be used to improve warning and advisory systems for the public and avoid exposure. The incorporation of other parameters such as water temperature, nutrient concentrations, and surface wind speed could improve the machine-learning models.

TI  - A Data-Centric Approach for Wind Plant Instance-Level Segmentation Using Semantic Segmentation and GIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind energy is one of Brazil's most promising energy sources, and the rapid growth of wind plants has increased the need for accurate and efficient inspection methods. The current onsite visits, which are laborious and costly, have become unsustainable due to the sheer scale of wind plants across the country. This study proposes a novel data-centric approach integrating semantic segmentation and GIS to obtain instance-level predictions of wind plants by using free orbital satellite images. Additionally, we introduce a new annotation pattern, which includes wind turbines and their shadows, leading to a larger object size. The elaboration of data collection used the panchromatic band of the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) 4A, with a 2-m spatial resolution, comprising 21 CBERS 4A scenes and more than 5000 wind plants annotated manually. This database has 5021 patches, each with 128 x 128 spatial dimensions. The deep learning model comparison involved evaluating six architectures and three backbones, totaling 15 models. The sliding windows approach allowed us to classify large areas, considering different pass values to obtain a balance between performance and computational time. The main results from this study include: (1) the LinkNet architecture with the Efficient-Net-B7 backbone was the best model, achieving an intersection over union score of 71%; (2) the use of smaller stride values improves the recognition process of large areas but increases computational power, and (3) the conversion of raster to polygon in GIS platforms leads to highly accurate instance-level predictions. This entire pipeline can be easily applied for mapping wind plants in Brazil and be expanded to other regions worldwide. With this approach, we aim to provide a cost-effective and efficient solution for inspecting and monitoring wind plants, contributing to the sustainability of the wind energy sector in Brazil and beyond.

TI  - Assessment of Estimated Phycocyanin and Chlorophyll-a Concentration from PRISMA and OLCI in Brazilian Inland Waters: A Comparison between Semi-Analytical and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to test the state-of-the-art of water constituent retrieval algorithms for phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in Brazilian reservoirs from hyperspectral PRISMA images and concurrent in situ data. One near-coincident Sentinel-3 OLCI dataset has also been considered for PC mapping as its high revisit time is a relevant element for mapping cyanobacterial blooms. The testing was first performed on remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), as derived by applying two atmospheric correction methods (6SV, ACOLITE) to Level 1 data and as provided in the corresponding Level 2 products (PRISMA L2C and OLCI L2-WFR). Since PRISMA images were affected by sun glint, the testing of three de-glint models was also performed. The applicability of Semi-Analytical (SA) and Mixture Density Network (MDN) algorithms in enabling PC and chl-a concentration retrieval was then tested over three PRISMA scenes; in the case of PC concentration estimation, a Random Forest (RF) algorithm was further applied. Regarding OLCI, the SA algorithm was tested for PC estimation; notably, only SA was calibrated with site-specific data from the reservoir. The algorithms were applied to the R-rs spectra provided by PRISMA L2C products-and those derived with ACOLITE, in the case of OLCI-as these data showed better agreement with in situ measurements. The SA model provided low median absolute error (MdAE) for PRISMA-derived (MdAE = 3.06 mg.m(-3)) and OLCI-derived (MdAE = 3.93 mg.m(-3)) PC concentrations, while it overestimated PRISMA-derived chl-a (MdAE = 42.11 mg.m(-3)). The RF model for PC applied to PRISMA performed slightly worse than SA (MdAE = 5.21 mg.m(-3)). The MDN showed a rather different performance, with higher errors for PC (MdAE = 40.94 mg.m(-3)) and lower error for chl-a (MdAE = 23.21 mg.m(-3)). The results overall suggest that the model calibrated with site-specific measurements performed better and indicates that SA could be applied to PRISMA and OLCI for remote sensing of PC in Brazilian reservoirs.

To irrigate adequately with less waste, it is necessary that studies aim at increasing efficiency in the use of water in this sector, and one of the ways to do so is to estimate evapotranspiration (ET). The objective of this study was to estimate the actual daily evapotranspiration using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in eastern Amazonia. Six images from the Landsat 8 satellite were used, and the estimates of evapotranspiration with the SEBAL algorithm showed good agreement with the results obtained by the Bowen ratio method in the area of acai planting, including the mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE), root of mean square error (RMSE), and the concordance index (d index) equal to 0.45 mm day(-1), 4.23%, 0.52 mm day(-1), and 0.80, respectively. SEBAL showed the ability to distinguish the soil cover, demonstrating the sensitivity of the model, which provided the mapping of the components analyzed. The use of the algorithm helps in decision making regarding irrigation management and reducing costs and water losses.

TI  - Shifting Sands: Assessing Bankline Shift Using an Automated Approach in the Jia Bharali River, India
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Bank erosion hazard is a frequent occurrence that poses threats to floodplain ecosystems. This analysis examined changes to the Jia Bharali River channel in India using the GIS-based Digital Shoreline Analysis System [DSAS]. The Jia Bharali's future channel was predicted so as to identify the most erosion-susceptible zones. The rate of bankline movement was calculated using remotely sensed data collected over a period of 45 years (1976-2021). The results show that the river's erosion and deposition rates were higher in the early years than towards the later part of the period under analysis. On the right and left banks of the river, the average shift rate was -9.22 and 5.8 m/y, respectively, which is comparatively high. The chosen portion of the river was evenly divided into three zones, A, B, and C. The most positively affected zone was zone A. The left bank of zone B exhibited a higher rate of erosion than the right bank, indicating that the river was moving to the left [eastward] in this zone. At the same time, the right bank was being eroded faster than the left, indicating a westward thrust at zone C. The predicted result demonstrates that the left bank of zone B and the right bank of zone C would have a higher average migration rate. Therefore, these banks were identified as being the most susceptible to bank erosion. The study evaluates the spatio-temporal change of the river in sensitive regions where neighboring settlements and infrastructure were at risk of changing channel dynamics. Using the actual and forecasted bankline, the degree of accuracy was confirmed. The results of the automated prediction approach could be useful for river hazard management in the Jia Bharali and in similar environmental settings with tropical high precipitation zones.

TI  - Unified Framework for Ship Detection in Multi-Frequency SAR Images: A Demonstration with COSMO-SkyMed, Sentinel-1, and SAOCOM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the framework of maritime surveillance, vessel detection techniques based on spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have promoted extensive applications for the effective understanding of unlawful activities at sea. This paper deals with this topic, presenting a novel approach that exploits a cascade application of a pre-screening algorithm and a discrimination phase. Pre-screening is based on a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector, whereas discrimination exploits sub-look analysis (SLA). For the first time, the method has been validated with experiments on multi-frequency (C-, X-, and L-band) SAR images, demonstrating a significant reduction of up to 40% in false alarms within highly congested scenarios, along with a notable enhancement of the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves. For future synergic exploitation of multiple SAR missions, the developed dataset, composed of Sentinel-1, SAOCOM, and COSMO-SkyMed images, is comprehensive, having images gathered over the same area with a short time lag (below 15 min). Finally, the diversified processing chains and the results for each mission product and scenario are discussed. Being the first dataset of single-look complex (SLC) SAR multi-frequency data, the present work intends to encourage additional investigation in this promising field of research.

TI  - Recognizing the Shape and Size of Tundra Lakes in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Images Using Deep Learning Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost tundra contains more than twice as much carbon as is currently in the atmosphere, and it is warming six times as fast as the global mean. Tundra lakes dynamics is a robust indicator of global climate processes, and is still not well understood. Satellite data, particularly, from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a suitable tool for tundra lakes recognition and monitoring of their changes. However, manual analysis of lake boundaries can be slow and inefficient; therefore, reliable automated algorithms are required. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach, comprising instance deep-learning-based segmentation by U-Net, followed by semantic segmentation based on a watershed algorithm for separating touching and overlapping lakes. Implementation of this concept is essential for accurate sizes and shapes estimation of an individual lake. Here, we evaluated the performance of the proposed approach on lakes, manually extracted from tens of C-band SAR images from Sentinel-1, which were collected in the Yamal Peninsula and Alaska areas in the summer months of 2015-2022. An accuracy of 0.73, in terms of the Jaccard similarity index, was achieved. The lake's perimeter, area and fractal sizes were estimated, based on the algorithm framework output from hundreds of SAR images. It was recognized as lognormal distributed. The evaluation of the results indicated the efficiency of the proposed approach for accurate automatic estimation of tundra lake shapes and sizes, and its potential to be used for further studies on tundra lake dynamics, in the context of global climate change, aimed at revealing new factors that could cause the planet to warm or cool.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network for Coastal Aquaculture Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture has important economic and environmental benefits. With the development of remote sensing and deep learning technology, coastline aquaculture extraction has achieved rapid, automated, and high-precision production. However, some problems still exist in extracting large-scale aquaculture based on high-resolution remote sensing images: (1) the generalization of large-scale models caused by the diversity of remote sensing in breeding areas; (2) the confusion of breeding target identification caused by the complex background interference of land and sea; (3) the boundary of the breeding area is difficult to extract accurately. In this paper, we built a comprehensive sample database based on the spatial distribution of aquaculture, and expanded the sample database by using confusing land objects as negative samples. A multi-scale-fusion superpixel segmentation optimization module is designed to solve the problem of inaccurate boundaries, and a coastal aquaculture network is proposed. Based on the coastline aquaculture dataset that we labelled and produced ourselves, we extracted cage culture areas and raft culture areas near the coastline of mainland China based on high-resolution remote sensing images. The overall accuracy reached 94.64% and achieved a state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - The artifact "yurt" as an object of Kyrgyz and Tuvan linguoculture
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The "yurt" artifact is a part of the Kyrgyz and Tuvan peoples' systems of cultural values. As a cognitive mechanism, language offers its own linguistic and creative interpretation. This paper considers the artifact "Yurt" in terms of cognitive linguistics by analyzing the concepts of boz uy and.g. The linguistic and cultural analysis of these concepts made it possible to reveal the specificity of their ethnolinguistic perception that discovers the role, place, and significance of "yurt" in the linguistic worldview of the Kyrgyz and the Tuvan peoples. Common cultural and linguistic roots of the Kyrgyz and Tuvan people and their long-term coexistence in the historical arena have predetermined the significance of parallels and correspondences in the cognitive-semantic scope of the concepts boz uy and.g. The cognitive and conceptual core of these concepts' structure reveals the elements of the cognitive comprehension of "yurt" associated with its spatial segmentation, specification of its fragments, and the functionality of its attributes. The figurative-symbolic level of the concepts demonstrates the results of the sensory-associative perception of the yurt. In the Tuvan language, it is the symbolization of space, and in the Kyrgyz language, it is the symbolization of objects. The value-cultural level of the concepts under consideration explicates the thesis that "yurt" is the focus of cultural traditions, rituals, and customs for Tuvan and Kyrgyz peoples that have lasted since time immemorial.

TI  - Soot Aerosols from Wheat Stubble Burning Lead to Ice Nucleation and Heavy Rainfall Over Arid Rajasthan, India
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Indo-Gangetic Plains, extensive crop residue burning (CRB) of wheat stubble is done during the month of May. Soot emitted following CRB, a serious environmental pollutant, affects cloud properties. Though important, it is poorly understood as an ice nucleating particle. During the summer season, on 13 May 2020, an unusually heavy rainfall event occurred over Rajasthan, India, which was studied using ground- and satellite-data. The sun photometer observations of the AERONET station on 12 May 2020 yielded an absorption angstrom ngstorm exponent value of 1.01. This value corresponds to black carbon (BC) and indicates its dominance as a fine aerosol associated with CRB. The HYSPLIT model indicated a downwind trajectory towards Rajasthan from Haryana and Punjab (source of CRB). Atmospheric ageing and oxygenation of BC probably increased the number of hydrophilic surface sites. Thus, soot comprising BC particles got activated into cloud droplets through the heterogeneous nucleation of water vapour. As a result, the prevailing sub-saturation condition with 80% RH led to the wetting of BC particles through the nucleation of water vapour and increased ice concentration in the cloud anvils in the late night of 12 May 2020 and precipitated on 13 May 2020 (up to 58.2 mm). AERONET data highlights that the region had an abundance of BC produced from CRB. Apart from its water affinity, other particle characteristics such as porosity and polarity also augmented ice nucleation.

TI  - A Remote Sensing View of the 2020 Extreme Lake-Expansion Flood Event into the Peace-Athabasca Delta Floodplain-Implications for the Future SWOT Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in western Canada is one of the largest inland deltas in the world. Flooding caused by the expansion of lakes beyond normal shorelines occurred during the summer of 2020 and provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the capabilities of remote sensing platforms to map surface water expansion into vegetated landscape with complex surface connectivity. Firstly, multi-source remotely sensed data via satellites were used to create a temporal reconstruction of the event spanning May to September. Optical synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and altimeter data were used to reconstruct surface water area and elevation as seen from space. Lastly, temporal water surface area and level data obtained from the existing satellites and hydrometric stations were used as input data in the CNES Large-Scale SWOT Simulator, which provided an overview of the newly launched SWOT satellite ability to monitor such flood events. The results show a 25% smaller water surface area for optical instruments compared to SAR. Simulations show that SWOT would have greatly increased the spatio-temporal understanding of the flood dynamics with complete PAD coverage three to four times per month. Overall, seasonal vegetation growth was a major obstacle for water surface area retrieval, especially for optical sensors.

TI  - Reviewing the Status of Droughts, Early Warning Systems and Climate Services in South India: Experiences Learned
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most challenging disasters that impact the natural and cultural ecosystems across the world, especially in the climate dependent sectors of arid and semi-arid areas. The aim of this article is to share the experiences gained and enhance the readers' awareness on the status of drought and process of the early warning systems (EWS) in south India. Drought status of three agroecologically different states is included in this article, such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. As far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, Karur, Thuthukudi, Krishnagiri, Namakkal, Trichy and Thirunelveli districts are water scarce compared to other districts in the state. The districts such as Wayanad, Thiruvananthapuram, Idukki and Palakkad in Kerala have received lesser rainfall compared to the other parts of the state during the period 1981 to 2019. In Telangana, the mandals such as Nagarkurnool, Jogulamba-Gadwal, Wanaparthy, Mahabubnagar Nalgonda and Yedadri are frequently hit by dry spells and droughts. As a case study, weather early warning dissemination, carried out at Parambikulam Aliyar basin, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, during Khariff and Rabi seasons, using IMDs medium and extended range forecast is also elaborated in particular in the article. As far as the accuracy of forecast is concerned, probability of false detection (false alarm rate) was found to be 0.81 for Khariff and 0.30 for Rabi season, indicating the need for better performance in the accuracy of dry spell early warning, disaster preparedness and response. In-spite of this, access to early warning has supported the farmers during harvest and land preparation with a utility score of 72% and 59%, respectively. In Parambikulam Aliyar basin, remote sensing products such as MODIS-NDVI, NDWI and TWI was also used to identify the real-time progression of monthly vegetative condition for Kharif and Rabi seasons. NDVI values were used to monitor the district level vegetation condition and compared it with the drought year 2016, the difference in area under barren land was 76% less during Khariff, 2021 and 44% during Rabi, 2021.This study is a compilation of lessons learned from different states and the existing knowledge and practice in early warnings, and recommends the need for a holistic approach in drought and dry spell monitoring along with better accuracy and dissemination to minimize climate-related shocks in agriculture.

TI  - Impact of STARFM on Crop Yield Predictions: Fusing MODIS with Landsat 5, 7, and 8 NDVIs in Bavaria Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate yield estimates at both field and regional levels remain the goal of sustainable agriculture and food security. Hereby, the identification of consistent and reliable methodologies providing accurate yield predictions is one of the hot topics in agricultural research. This study investigated the relationship of spatiotemporal fusion modelling using STRAFM on crop yield prediction for winter wheat (WW) and oil-seed rape (OSR) using a semi-empirical light use efficiency (LUE) model for the Free State of Bavaria (70,550 km(2)), Germany, from 2001 to 2019. A synthetic normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series was generated and validated by fusing the high spatial resolution (30 m, 16 days) Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) (2001 to 2012), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) (2012), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) (2013 to 2019) with the coarse resolution of MOD13Q1 (250 m, 16 days) from 2001 to 2019. Except for some temporal periods (i.e., 2001, 2002, and 2012), the study obtained an R-2 of more than 0.65 and a RMSE of less than 0.11, which proves that the Landsat 8 OLI fused products are of higher accuracy than the Landsat 5 TM products. Moreover, the accuracies of the NDVI fusion data have been found to correlate with the total number of available Landsat scenes every year (N), with a correlation coefficient (R) of +0.83 (between R-2 of yearly synthetic NDVIs and N) and -0.84 (between RMSEs and N). For crop yield prediction, the synthetic NDVI time series and climate elements (such as minimum temperature, maximum temperature, relative humidity, evaporation, transpiration, and solar radiation) are inputted to the LUE model, resulting in an average R-2 of 0.75 (WW) and 0.73 (OSR), and RMSEs of 4.33 dt/ha and 2.19 dt/ha. The yield prediction results prove the consistency and stability of the LUE model for yield estimation. Using the LUE model, accurate crop yield predictions were obtained for WW (R-2 = 0.88) and OSR (R-2 = 0.74). Lastly, the study observed a high positive correlation of R = 0.81 and R = 0.77 between the yearly R-2 of synthetic accuracy and modelled yield accuracy for WW and OSR, respectively.

T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 79th Annual Meeting of the Central-Surgical-Association
CL  - Milwaukee, WI
AB  - Background: The 2016 Society of Surgical Oncology Choosing Wisely guidelines recommended against routine sentinel iymph node biopsy in women >= 70 years old with favorable, early-stage breast cancer, as sentinel lymph node biopsy does not decrease recurrence or mortality in these patients. This study's objective was to evaluate the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy and its effect on management in elderly patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of female patients >= 70 years old with stage I-II clinically nodenegative, hormone receptor positive, HElt2-negative disease undergoing upfront breast cancer surgery between 2017 and 2019. Primary outcome was rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy. Secondary outcome was effect of sentinel lymph node biopsy on adjuvant therapy. Resplts: In total, 142 patients were included. Median age was 76 (interquartile range 73-81), and 71.8% underwent lumpectomy. On final pathology, 57.7% had invasive ductal carcinoma, and median tumor size was 15 mm (interquartile range 10-24.3). A total of 118 patients (83.1%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy; of these. 27 (22.9%) were positive for N1mi (7 patients) or N1a disease (20 patients). On multivariate regression analysis, patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy were more likely to be younger (odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.78-0.95). The major risk factor for sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity was lymphovascular invasion (odds ratio 13.4, 95% confidence interval 4.57- 40.1). atients with sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity were more likely to receive local adjuvant radiation therapy (odds ratio 4.66, 95% confidence interval 1.49-16.8) and tended to receive more adjuvant regional radiation therapy (75.0% if sentinel lymph node biopsy positive compared with 153% if sentinel lymph node biopsy negative, P < .001). Conclusion: Despite the 2016 Choosing Wisely guidelines, more than 80% of patients >= 70 years old underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy at our institution. If sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive, this is associated with over 4-fold higher rates of adjuvant radiation therapy. (c) 2022 blsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrated Approaches for Field Mapping by Traditional Investigation and Satellite PSInSAR Data: Results from the Montemartano Landslide (Central Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents an integrated investigation of a complex landslide based on multitemporal stereo aerial photographic interpretations, existing geotechnical monitoring data, and different PSInSAR datasets. The available information allowed for the quantification of the deformation history, also in periods with no monitoring in the field, making it possible to revise the geometry of the landslide compared to the official landslide mapping. Data from sparse inclinometers are compared with more spatially continuous satellite measurements, showing that the two monitoring techniques are consistent in terms of cumulative deformation trend and in terms of response to prolonged drought and wet periods. Therefore, reliable landslide mass displacements can be monitored using satellite products when ground instrumentations are no longer operating. Understanding the landslide behavior to rainfall conditions offers an important insight into the velocities and cumulative displacements expected during similar stages of enhanced landslide activity. The findings can be helpful to support urban planners in re-evaluating hazard and risk classification and implementing efficient mitigation techniques to reduce landslide damage.

TI  - STAEBLE: A Surface-Temperature- and Available-Energy-Based Lake Evaporation Model
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A mass transfer evaporation model is proposed that uses MODIS water surface temperature data and land-based meteorological data, and employs a new approach to calibrate the transfer coefficient via closure of the long-term energy budget of the lake. Some of the longstanding issues of developing and applying lake evaporation models are reviewed, including the adequacy of using land-based meteorological data, the difficulty of applying transfer coefficients with fixed values calibrated elsewhere, and the need to estimate rates of change of stored enthalpy when the model involves energy budget concepts. Publicly available data from a 5-year measurement campaign at Lake Mead allow quantification of the effect of using land-based data, and subsequent testing of the proposed model. We show that atmospheric stability effects are very important, and that their incorporation by means of existing stability functions in the literature produces good results with a one-parameter model that can be locally calibrated with the same input data used by the model, without the need for local measurements. The model is simple in its structure and data requirements, and can be widely applied.

Training and internal validation of the original algorithm included 15 clinical and tumor-related variables from a consecutive cohort of 800 breast cancer cases. The updated NILS tool included 10 top-ranked input variables from the original prototype. A workflow with four ANN pathways was additionally developed to allow different combinations of missing preoperative input values. Predictive performances were assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) and sensitivity/specificity values at defined cut-points. Clinical utility was presented by estimating possible sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) reduction rates. The principles of user-centered design were applied to develop an interactive web-interface to predict the patient's probability of healthy lymph nodes. A technical validation of the interface was performed using data from 100 test patients selected to cover all combinations of missing histopathological input values. ResultsANN algorithms for the prediction of nodal status have been implemented into the web-based NILS tool for personalized, noninvasive nodal staging in breast cancer. The estimated probability of healthy lymph nodes using the interface showed a complete concordance with estimations from the reference algorithm except in two cases that had been wrongly included (ineligible for the technical validation). NILS predictive performance to distinguish node-negative from node-positive disease, also with missing values, displayed AUC ranged from 0.718 (95% CI, 0.687-0.748) to 0.735 (95% CI, 0.704-0.764), with good calibration. Sensitivity 90% and specificity 34% were demonstrated. The potential to abstain from axillary surgery was observed in 26% of patients using the NILS tool, acknowledging a false negative rate of 10%, which is clinically accepted for the standard SLNB technique. ConclusionsThe implementation of NILS into a web-interface are expected to provide the health care with decision support and facilitate preoperative identification of patients who could be good candidates to avoid unnecessary surgical axillary staging.

TI  - A Wildfire Detection Algorithm Based on the Dynamic Brightness Temperature Threshold
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing plays an important role in wildfire detection. Methods using the brightness and temperature difference of remote sensing images to determine if a wildfire has occurred are one of the main research directions of forest fire monitoring. However, common wildfire detection algorithms are mainly based on a fixed brightness temperature threshold to distinguish wildfire pixels and non-wildfire pixels, which reduces the applicability of the algorithm in different space-time regions. This paper presents an adaptive wildfire detection algorithm, DBTDW, based on a dynamic brightness temperature threshold. First, a regression dataset, MODIS_DT_Fire, was constructed based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometry (MODIS) to determine the wildfire brightness temperature threshold. Then, based on the meteorological information, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) information, and elevation information provided by the dataset, the DBTDW algorithm was used to calculate and obtain the minimum brightness temperature threshold of the burning area by using the Planck algorithm and Otsu algorithm. Finally, six regression models were trained to establish the correlation between factors and the dynamic brightness temperature threshold of wildfire. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate the regression performance. The results show that under the XGBoost model, the DBTDW algorithm has the best prediction effect on the dynamic brightness temperature threshold of wildfire (leave-one-out method: RMSE/MAE = 0.0730). Compared with the method based on a fixed brightness temperature threshold, the method proposed in this paper to adaptively determine the brightness temperature threshold of wildfire has higher universality, which will help improve the effectiveness of satellite remote fire detection.

TI  - Performance of Multiple Models for Estimating Rodent Activity Intensity in Alpine Grassland Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rodents are a vital part of the natural succession chain of the alpine grassland ecosystem, and rodent activities have an important impact on alpine grassland ecology. Moderate rodent population activities positively improve soil permeability, promote nutrient cycling, and promote biodiversity. However, too much rodent population or excessive activity intensity will bring negative effects on the ecological environment. Therefore, it is of great significance to accurately grasp the rodent activity intensity (RAI) in alpine grassland to cope with the changes in rodent populations and maintain the stability of the alpine grassland ecosystem. The Zoige alpine grassland was used as the study area in this study. In addition, UAV was sent to sample the rodent activity area in the alpine grassland. With the aid of field survey data, the surface information of rodent activity in the experimental area was identified, and the RAI index in the sample plot was calculated. Then, based on Sentinel-2A satellite remote sensing multi-spectral data and spectral index, multiple linear regression (MLR), multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MPL neural nets), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to construct four models for RAI and Sentinel-2 datasets. The accuracy of the four models was compared and analyzed. The results showed that the RF model had the highest prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.8263, RWI = 0.8210, LCCC = 0.8916, RMSE = 0.0840, MAE = 0.0549), followed by the SVR model, the MLP neural nets model, and the MLR model. Overall, the nonlinear relationship between rodent activity intensity and satellite remote sensing images is obvious. Machine learning with strong nonlinear fitting ability can better characterize the RAI in alpine grassland. The RF model, with the best accuracy, can quantitatively estimate RAI in the alpine grassland, providing theoretical and technical support for monitoring RAI and rodent control in the alpine grassland.

TI  - Toward Improved Parameterizations of Reservoir Operation in Ungauged Basins: A Synergistic Framework Coupling Satellite Remote Sensing, Hydrologic Modeling, and Conceptual Operation Schemes
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessments of water and energy security over historical and future periods require hydrologic models that can accurately simulate reservoir operations. However, scare reservoir operation data limits the accuracy of current reservoir representations in simulating reservoir behaviors. Furthermore, the reliability of these representations under changing inflow regimes remains unclear, which makes their application for long future planning horizons questionable. To this end, we propose a synergistic framework to predict the release, storage, and hydropower production of ungauged reservoirs (i.e., reservoirs without in-situ inflow, release, storage, and operating rules) by combining remotely sensed reservoir operating patterns and model-simulated reservoir inflow with conceptual reservoir operation schemes within a land surface-hydrologic model. A previously developed reservoir operation scheme is extended with a storage anomaly based calibration approach to accommodate the relatively short time series and large time intervals of remotely sensed data. By setting up controlled experiments in the Yalong River Basin in China, we show that remote sensing can improve the parameter estimation and simulations of ungauged reservoirs for all selected reservoir operation schemes, thereby improving the downstream flood and streamflow simulations. However, most of these schemes show degraded accuracies of reservoir operation simulations under a changing inflow regime, which could lead to unreliable assessments of future water resources and hydropower production. In comparison, our newly extended reservoir operation scheme can be more adaptable to flow regime variations. Our study provides a practical framework for reservoir impact assessments and predictions with the ongoing satellite altimetry projects such as Surface Water and Ocean Topography.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution and Hysteresis Analysis of Drought Based on Rainfed-Irrigated Arable Land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought poses a serious threat to agricultural production and food security in the context of global climate change. Few studies have explored the response mechanism and lag time of agricultural drought to meteorological drought from the perspective of cultivated land types. This paper analyzes the spatiotemporal evolution patterns and hysteresis relationship of meteorological and agricultural droughts in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. Here, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index products and surface temperature products were selected to calculate the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) from 2010 to 2015. Furthermore, we obtained the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for the same period. Based on these indices, we analyzed the correlation and the hysteresis relationship between agricultural and meteorological drought in rainfed and irrigated arable land. The results showed that, (1) compared with SPEI, the high spatial resolution PDSI data were deemed more suitable for the subsequent accurate and scientific analysis of the relationship between meteorological and agricultural droughts. (2) When meteorological drought occurs, irrigated arable land is the first to experience agricultural drought, and then alleviates when the drought is most severe in rainfed arable land, indicating that irrigated arable land is more sensitive to drought events when exposed to the same degree of drought risk. However, rainfed arable land is actually more susceptible to agricultural drought due to the intervention of irrigation measures. (3) According to the cross-wavelet transform analysis, agricultural droughts significantly lag behind meteorological droughts by about 33 days during the development process of drought events. (4) The spatial distribution of the correlation coefficient between the PDSI and TVDI shows that the area with negative correlations of rainfed croplands and the area with positive correlations of irrigated croplands account for 77.55% and 68.04% of cropland areas, respectively. This study clarifies and distinguishes the details of the meteorological-to-agricultural drought relationship in rainfed and irrigated arable land, noting that an accurate lag time can provide useful guidance for drought monitoring management and irrigation project planning in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

TI  - Turgenev's context in the novel "The Story of an Unknown Man" by A. P. Chekhov
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers the question of Turgenev's influence on the novel of A. P. Chekhov "The Story of an Unknown Man." It is well known that Chekhov was affected by the works of his great predecessor. Scholars consider the novel under consideration to be the text with the most significant influence of Turgenev. Three works of Turgenev are mentioned or quoted in the short novel: "Fathers and Children," "On the Eve," and "Three Encounters. This work aimed to identify and analyze the Turgenev motifs in Chekhov's novel. The principal method of research is comparative-historical. Various types of artistic dialogue can be discussed, from direct quotations and reminiscences to a hidden dispute with Turgenev's worldview. Besides identifying the typological connection between the characters of Turgenev and Chekhov, an attempt was made to analyze the artistic vision of the world of both writers. It was found that Chekhov and Turgenev both agreed on the indisputable importance of parental love, despite their differing opinions on such fundamental concepts as the love between a man and a woman and the existence of entire and powerful people. Also, Turgenev and Chekhov proved to have a similar understanding of the sorrow and briefness of human life. Both writers share the ability to accept quiet as a response to the most pressing queries. Both writers had a preference for silence as an answer to the most pressing questions.

TI  - Evaluation of Aerosols Impact on Global and Direct Irradiance Attenuation Under Clear Sky Condition: a Case Study in Morocco
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY WATER AND ENVIRONMENT SYSTEMS-JSDEWES
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy is a promising alternative for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. However, solar potential depends on several atmospheric parameters. When no clouds are present, aerosols are the primary source of solar radiation attenuation. This study examines the impact of aerosol optical depth on the attenuation of solar irradiance under clear sky conditions. For this purpose, aerosol data from satellite databases and irradiance data from high-performance meteorological stations installed in two sites in Morocco were exploited. Under clear sky conditions, the results showed a decrease in global horizontal irradiance relative to the global irradiance at the top of the atmosphere of 24% for aerosol optical depth values of 0.02 and exceeding 53% for 0.6. Aerosols have a more significant impact on the direct normal irradiance under clear sky conditions; over the test data, a decrease of 66% was observed for the direct normal irradiance according to the extraterrestrial irradiance for aerosol optical depth of 0.2 and reaching 92% for 0.6.

TI  - The Arctic Amplification and Its Impact: A Synthesis through Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Arctic climate change has already resulted in amplified and accelerated regional warming, or the Arctic amplification. Satellite observations have captured this climate phenomenon in its development and in sufficient spatial details. As such, these observations have been-and still are-indispensable for monitoring of the amplification in this remote and inhospitable region, which is sparsely covered with ground observations. This study synthesizes the key contributions of satellite observations into an understanding and characterization of the amplification. The study reveals that the satellites were able to capture a number of important environmental transitions in the region that both precede and follow the emergence of the apparent amplification. Among those transitions, we find a rapid decline in the multiyear sea ice and subsequent changes in the surface radiation balance. Satellites have witnessed the impact of the amplification on phytoplankton and vegetation productivity as well as on human activity and infrastructure. Satellite missions of the European Space Agency (ESA) are increasingly contributing to amplification monitoring and assessment. The ESA Climate Change Initiative has become an essential provider of long-term climatic-quality remote-sensing data products for essential climate variables. Still, such synthesis has found that additional efforts are needed to improve cross-sensor calibrations and retrieval algorithms and to reduce uncertainties. As the amplification is set to continue into the 21st century, a new generation of satellite instruments with improved revisiting time and spectral and spatial resolutions are in high demand in both research and stakeholders' communities.

TI  - Polarimetric SAR Characterization of Mangrove Forest Environment in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This Mangrove forests in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) provide valuable ecosystem services such as coastal erosion protection, water purification and refuge for a wide variety of plants and animals. Therefore, the first step toward understanding the mangrove forests is the monitoring of this important ecological system. This paper proposes an original study to characterize the mangrove forest environment in the UAE by using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) remote sensing. Free access C-band dual-PolSAR Sentinel 1 data have been exploited. The elements as of the covariance matrix as well as the entropy/alpha decomposition parameters have been studied. Results show that the VH intensity, the coherence between VV and VH polarimetric channels, the entropy and alpha angle provide the most pronounced signatures that discern mangrove forests. Thus, these parameters could be exploited to improve the accuracy of the remote sensing monitoring and mapping techniques of mangrove forests in the UAE.

TI  - A Low-Cost and Reproductible Method to Obtain Mapping of Lymphatic Drainage in Patient with Early Endometrial Cancer
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Endometrial cancer is the most common form of gynecological cancer in developed countries. Current recommended therapeutic management takes into account a number of factors such as: TNM stage, justification for primary surgery, desire to preserve fertility. For primary operable cases, surgical staging has become an extremely important pillar, in which the status of the pelvic lymph nodes needs to be known (1-3). Materials and Methods: Between August 2015 and June 2021, a multicenter prospective observational study was performed in the "Prof. Dr. I. Chiricuta" Oncological Institute Cluj Napoca, 2nd Department of Surgery of "Pius Brinzeu" County Hospital Timisoara, 1st Department of General Surgery of Arad County Hospital, 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology "Dominic Stanca" Cluj Napoca and "Dr. Carol Davila" Central Military Emergency University Hospital Bucharest, Romania with the main aim of examining the sentinel lymph node detection rate using methylene blue as a tracer. Surgeries were performed by the team of surgeons of the mentioned clinics, and patients were informed about this study and signed an informed consent form for enrollment. Results: A total of 116 cases met the inclusion criteria for this prospective study. The mean age of the included patients was 62.3 years (minimum - 38, maximum - 83). The mean body mass index was 31.8 (minimum - 19.9, maximum - 48.2). In terms of histological type of the endometrial cancer, the majority of cases were endometrioid cancer, amounting to 72.5% of the total (n=84). A considerable number of cases were of mixed type, either with clear cell carcinoma (8.6%, n=10) or mixed carcinosarcoma (17.2%, n=20). The preferred approach for surgery was laparoscopic surgery rather than traditional surgery (72% vs 28%). Another element investigated from a histological point of view is the tumour grading, the degree of differentiation of cells with anarchic development, we note that 50% (n=58) were G2. Of the 116 cases of endometrial carcinoma included in the study, in 83% of cases (n=96) methylene blue tracer injection was successful and sentinel node was identified. The SLN technique continues to be of great interest and use in surgical centers around the world. The method of detecting sentinel lymph nodes varies depending on the individual. According to literature studies, indocyanine (ICG- Indocyanine green) is the gold standard for lymph node mapping, with superior detection rates when compared to other existing versions. Another key factor to consider when selecting a sentinel node identification method is cost-effectiveness. The use of methyl blue as a marker tracer is the most cost-effective option with equivalent detection rate outcomes. Conclusion: Based on the results of our study and other studies in the literature, lymphatic mapping using methylene blue as a tracer in endometrial cancer is a cost-effective method with a favourable detection rate. With this low-cost procedure we can achieve a correct tumor staging, avoiding overtreatment. There are multiple ways to identify the sentinel node using different tracers with higher accuracy, but the objective of the study was not to make a comparison between different tracers, but to present the feasibility of lymph node mapping using methylene blue as a low cost tracer with good reproducibility, short learning curve and optimal detection rate.

TI  - Effect of Transportation Operation on Air Quality in China Based on MODIS AOD during the Epidemic
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid growth of automobile numbers and the increased traffic congestion, traffic has increasingly significant effects on regional air quality and regional sustainable development in China. This study tried to quantify the effect of transportation operation on regional air quality based on MODIS AOD. This paper analyzed the space-time characteristics of air quality and traffic during the epidemic by series analysis and kernel density analysis, and quantified the relationship between air quality and traffic through a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. The main research conclusions are as follows: The epidemic has a great impact on traffic and regional air quality. PM2.5 and NO2 had the same trend with traffic congestion delay index (CDI), but they were not as obvious as CDI. Both cities with traffic congestion and cities with the worst air quality showed strong spatial dependence. The concentration areas of high AOD value in the east areas of the Hu line were consistent with the two gathering centers formed by cities with traffic congestion in space, and also consistent with the gathering center of cities with poor air quality. The concentration area of AOD decline was consistent with the gathering center formed by cities with the worst air quality. AOD had a strong positive correlation with road network density, and its GWR correlation coefficient was 0.68, then These provinces suitable for GWR or not suitable were divided. This study has a great significance for the transportation planning, regional planning, air quality control strategies and regional sustainable development, etc.

TI  - Compliance between Food and Feed Safety: Eight-Year Survey (2013-2021) of Aflatoxin M1 in Raw Milk and Aflatoxin B1 in Feed in Northern Italy
T2  - TOXINS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aflatoxins (AFs) are fungal metabolites that are found in feed and food. When ruminants eat feed contaminated with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), it is metabolised and aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is excreted in the milk. Aflatoxins can result in hepatotoxic, carcinogenic, and immunosuppressive effects. The European Union thus set a low threshold limit (50 ng/L) for presence of AFM1 in milk. This was in view of its possible presence also in dairy products and that quantification of these toxins is mandatory for milk suppliers. In the present study, a total of 95,882 samples of whole raw milk, collected in northern Italy between 2013 and 2021, were evaluated for presence of AFM1 using an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) method. The study also evaluated the relationship between feed materials collected from the same farms in the same area during the same period (2013-2021) and milk contamination. Only 667 milk samples out of 95,882 samples analysed (0.7%) showed AFM1 values higher than the EU threshold limit of 50 ng/L. A total of 390 samples (0.4%) showed values between 40 and 50 ng/L, thus requiring corrective action despite not surpassing the regulatory threshold. Combining feed contamination and milk contamination data, some feedingstuffs seem to be more effective in defying potential carryover of AFs from feed to milk. Combining the results, it can be concluded that a robust monitoring system that covers both feed, with a special focus on high risk/sentinel matrices, and milk is essential to guarantee high quality and safety standards of dairy products.

TI  - Remote sensing-based deformation monitoring and geological characterisation of an active deep-seated rock slide (Tellakopf/Cima di Tella, South Tyrol, Italy)
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a 5-year long field campaign combined with 75 years of remote sensing data on the active, deep-seated Tellakopf rock slide in South Tyrol, Italy. Detailed field data and remote sensing techniques from airborne and terrestrial laser scanning (ALS, TLS) and orthoimages from federal flight campaigns and a helicopter-based monitoring campaign, allowed the development of a geometrical-kinematical rock slide model to investigate the initial failure and temporal-variable deformation mechanisms. The rock compound slide formed in foliated, highly fractured metamorphic rock masses at the SE-facing Tellakopf slope, directly above the commuter-rich national road SS 41. A total volume of approximately 3-4 Mm(3) was estimated based on geographic information system (GIS) analysis by comparing the pre-failure surface topography and the reconstructed basal shear zone. Multi-temporal deformation analyses based on orthoimages, ALS and TLS data show alarmingly high velocities of at least 9 m/month during the initial formation phase in 2014, followed by a continuous velocity reduction to the current mean annual values of 1-2.5 m/year. Results indicate internal slab formation along discrete shear zones displayed on surface as main and minor scarps. These slabs show a translational movement behaviour along a fully persistent, slightly curvilinear basal shear zone. Rock mass yielding and fracturing conditions extensive mass loss manifested by high rock fall activity and large rock scree deposits at the rock slide toe. The cause for rock slide formation is attributed to retrogressive processes caused by long-term stress release due to topographical and hydrogeological changes by adjacent rock slides.

TI  - INTEGRATED USE OF OPTICAL AND RADAR DATA FOR CROPLAND MAPPING OVER THE MOUNTAIN SLOPE AREA IN BOYOLALI, INDONESIA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping agricultural land cover data is important as an effort to support national food security, especially in Boyolali, Central Java Province, Indonesia which is one of the national rice granaries. However, mapping in the mountain slope area using optical data only is challenging due to cloud cover. The development of remote sensing technology has encouraged the possibility to integrate data with different sensors. This data integration is needed to optimize the ability to detect and map cropland that has a variety of characteristics. Therefore, this study aims to identify the cropland through the integration of time-series optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Detection of cropland was carried out using 2021 data. Polarisation of VV, VH, and ratio of VV/VH data was derived from the Sentinel-1, whereas image indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) data were obtained from Sentinel-2. Data of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 was combined and several features were selected based on their importance score. Random Forest (RF) classification was then performed. The result show that the mapping using integrated data could improve the accuracy. This indicates the possibility of data to be implemented in further studies such as the cropland type mapping and the estimation of food productivity.

TI  - An integrated analysis of air pollution from US coal-fired power plants
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States is one of the world's leaders in electricity production, generating about 4116 billion kWh in 2021, of which coal accounted for 21.8% of the total. This study applies an integrated approach using both terrestrial and satellite data to specifically examine emissions from coal-fired power plants and its spatial extent. The study also highlights the effectiveness of government policies to reduce emis-sions. It was found that emission of pollutants from the country's energy sector has been steadily declin-ing, with annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) decreasing from the US electric power sector between 1990 and 2020 by 93.4% and 84.8%, respectively, and carbon dioxide (CO2) by 37% between 2007 and 2020. Although overall emissions from coal-fired power plants are declining, some individual plants have yet to install environmental equipment to control emissions. According to US government data, major emitters of SO2, NOx, and CO2 in the US are the Martin Lake power plant in East Texas, the Labadie power plant near St. Louis, Missouri, and the James H Miller Jr plant near Birmingham, Alabama. This study also integrates TROPOMI satellite data to detect point emis-sions from individual power plants. While the highest levels of measured pollutants were over the coun-try's major cities and areas of fossil fuel extraction, TROPOMI could clearly distinguish the pollution caused by power plants in more rural areas. Although the US has made great strides in reducing emis-sions from coal-fired power plants, these plants still represent a major source of pollution and remain a major concern. Totally eliminating coal as a power source will be difficult with the higher power demands resulting from the transition to electric automobiles.(c) 2022 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

TI  - Road Risk-Index Analysis Using Satellite Products
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a service called intelligent routing using satellite products (IRUS) that can be used in order to analyze risks to the road infrastructure during bad weather conditions, such as heavy rainfall, storms, or floods. By diminishing movement risk, rescuers can arrive safely at their destination. To analyze these routes, the application uses both data provided by Sentinel satellites from the Copernicus program and meteorological data from local weather stations. Moreover, the application uses algorithms to determine the night driving time. From this analysis we obtain a risk index for each road provided by Google Maps API and then we present the path alongside the risk index in a friendly graphic interface. In order to obtain an accurate risk index, the application analyzes both recent and past data (up to 12 months).

TI  - Glaciogenic Periglacial Landform in the Making-Geomorphological Evolution of a Rockfall on a Small Glacier in the Horlachtal, Stubai Alps, Austria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deglaciation in high mountain areas signifies the transition from glacial to periglacial conditioned landscapes. Due to the reduced melt rate of debris-covered glacier ice, these areas of the glacier may persist long after the surrounding glacier has melted, resulting in the formation of distinct post-glacial landforms. In this study, we examine the geomorphological evolution and potential future development of a 19,267 m(3) +/- 204 m(3) rockfall from the permafrost-affected headwall on the low-elevated Zwieselbachferner in the Horlachtal, Stubai Alps, Austria. The analysis uses multi-epochal remote sensing data, including photogrammetrically and airborne laser scanning-derived digital elevation models, orthophotos, and satellite data, covering a period from the initial rockfall in 2003/2004 to 2022. The data reveals that the rockfall event resulted in the formation of a supraglacial debris layer of varying thickness, spanning an area of 15,920 m(2). Subsequently, 13 further rockfalls ranging from 67 m(3) +/- 6 m(3) to 4250 m(3) +/- 121 m(3) were detected. The mean ice thickness of the debris-covered area only slightly decreased between 2006 and 2022, in contrast to the surrounding glacier, whose thickness and length have strongly decreased. This results in the formation of a steep front and flanks that become increasingly covered by debris redistribution. The study suggests that the glacier ice covered by rockfall-derived debris will remain as a periglacial landform of glacial origin after the complete melting of the surrounding glacier.

TI  - Reusing Remote Sensing-Based Validation Data: Comparing Direct and Indirect Approaches for Afforestation Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation is one of the most effective processes for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combating global warming. Landsat data and machine learning approaches can be used to map afforestation (i) indirectly, by constructing two maps of the same area over different periods and then predicting changes, or (ii) directly, by constructing a single map and analyzing observations of change in both the response and remotely sensed variables. Of crucial importance, no comprehensive comparisons of direct and indirect approaches for afforestation monitoring are known to have been conducted to date. Afforestation maps estimated through the analysis of remotely sensed data may serve as intermediate products for guiding the selection of samples and the production of statistics. In this and similar studies, a huge effort is dedicated to collecting validation data. In turn, those validation datasets have varying sampling intensities in different areas, which complicates their use for assessing the accuracies of new maps. As a result, the work done to collect data is often not sufficiently exploited, with some validation datasets being used just once. In this study, we addressed two main aims. First, we implemented a methodology to reuse validation data acquired via stratified sampling with strata constructed from remote sensing maps. Second, we used this method for acquiring data for comparing map accuracy estimates and the precision of estimates for direct and indirect approaches for country-wide mapping of afforestation that occurred in Italy between 1985 and 2019. To facilitate these comparisons, we used Landsat imagery, random forest classification, and Google Earth Engine. The herein-presented method produced different accuracy estimates with 95% confidence interval and for different map classes. Afforestation accuracies ranged between 53 +/- 5.9% for the indirect map class inside the buffer-defined as a stratum within 120 m of the forest/non-forest mask boundaries-and 26 +/- 3.4% for the direct map outside the buffer. The accuracy in non-afforestation map classes was much greater, ranging from 87 +/- 1.9% for the indirect map inside the buffer to 99 +/- 1.3% for the direct map outside the buffer. Additionally, overall accuracies (with 95% CI) were estimated with large precision for both direct and indirect maps (87 +/- 1.3% and 89 +/- 1.6%, respectively), confirming (i) the effectiveness of the method we introduced for reusing samples and (ii) the relevance of remotely sensed data and machine learning for monitoring afforestation.

TI  - Land Cover Changes Utilising Landsat Satellite Imageries for the Kumasi Metropolis and Its Adjoining Municipalities in Ghana (1986-2022)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest loss, unbridled urbanisation, and the loss of arable lands have become contentious issues for the sustainable management of land. Landsat satellite images for 1986, 2003, 2013, and 2022, covering the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly and its adjoining municipalities, were used to analyse the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes. The machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), was used for the satellite image classification that led to the generation of the LULC maps. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were analysed to assess the correlations between the indices. The image overlays of the forest and urban extents and the calculation of the annual deforestation rates were evaluated. The study revealed decreasing trends in forestlands, increased urban/built-up areas (similar to the image overlays), and a decline in agricultural lands. However, there was a negative relationship between the NDVI and NDBI. The results corroborate the pressing need for the assessment of LULC utilising satellite sensors. This paper contributes to the existing outlines for evolving land design for the promotion of sustainable land use.

TI  - A Decade from the Costa Concordia Shipwreck: Lesson Learned on the Contribution of Infrared Thermography during the Maritime Salvage Operations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 13 January 2012, the Italian vessel Costa Concordia wrecked on the shore of Giglio Island, about 15 km off the coast of southern Tuscany (Italy), causing the loss of 32 lives. It is considered one of the worst disasters in maritime history. Salvage operations started immediately after the wreck with the coordination of the Italian National Civil Protection Department and the technological support of several Research Centers, which were activated for the management of the consequent emergency phase. A multi-parametric and multiplatform monitoring system was promptly implemented, involving several advanced remote sensing techniques, among which was Infrared Thermography (IRT). In this framework, IRT monitoring was performed during a 35-day period (25 January-1 March 2012), using a terrestrial, hand-held thermal camera. Six different thermal images were acquired daily from the island's coastline in three different positions, both in daylight and night times. The aim was to detect thermal anomalies connected to possible deformations of the vessel and oil spills. Between 3-4 February, IRT successfully revealed on oil spill drifting from the stern of the wreck towards the island harbor. Furthermore, the wreck's thermal dilatation was also analyzed during a 24-day close-range monitoring, providing interesting insights for the interpretation of the deformation monitoring results. This paper presents the outcomes of these innovative and experimental monitoring activities, with the aim of testing the potential of IRT as a versatile and operative tool to be used in maritime and environmental disaster response.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Rice is one of the most essential food crops in the world and accurate estimation of rice yield is a major content of agricultural research. Recently, scholars have used machine learning algorithms for rice yield estimation. However, there are few studies on rice yield prediction based on rice phenological stages. In this study, a method for rice yield prediction on the basis of rice phenology analysis was proposed. For this study, the cumulative NDVI and EVI based Logistic regression curves were carried out to determine the phenological period. Comparing several regression models, the results of the random forest regression model developed using phenology-based regression analysis performed better. The R-2 of training and validation samples were 0.96 and 0.95, respectively, with RMSE of 0.06 ton/ha. This method is feasible for governments to predict rice yield and make farm risk management decisions.

TI  - Monitoring Land Degradation Dynamics to Support Landscape Restoration Actions in Remote Areas of the Mediterranean Basin (Murcia Region, Spain)
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop a workflow methodology for collecting substantial amounts of Earth Observation data to investigate the effectiveness of landscape restoration actions and support the implementation of the Above Ground Carbon Capture indicator of the Ecosystem Restoration Camps (ERC) Soil Framework. To achieve this objective, the study will utilize the Google Earth Engine API within R (rGEE) to monitor the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results of this study will provide a common scalable reference for ERC camps globally, with a specific focus on Camp Altiplano, the first European ERC located in Murcia, Southern Spain. The coding workflow has effectively acquired almost 12 TB of data for analyzing MODIS/006/MOD13Q1 NDVI over a 20-year span. Additionally, the average retrieval of image collections has yielded 120 GB of data for the COPERNICUS/S2_SR 2017 vegetation growing season and 350 GB of data for the COPERNICUS/S2_SR 2022 vegetation winter season. Based on these results, it is reasonable to asseverate that cloud computing platforms like GEE will enable the monitoring and documentation of regenerative techniques to achieve unprecedented levels. The findings will be shared on a predictive platform called Restor, which will contribute to the development of a global ecosystem restoration model.

TI  - Phytoplankton Patches at Oceanic Fronts Are Linked to Coastal Upwelling Pulses: Observations and Implications in the California Current System
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Locally enhanced biological production and increased carbon export are persistent features at oceanic density fronts. Studies often assume biological properties are uniform along fronts or hypothesize that along- and across-front gradients reflect physical-biological processes occurring in the front. However, the residence times of waters in fronts are often shorter than biological response times. Thus, an alternate-often untested-hypothesis is that observed biological patchiness originates upstream of a front. To test these two hypotheses, we explore an eddy-associated front in the California Current System sampled during two surveys, separated by 3 weeks. Patches of high phytoplankton biomass were found at the northern ends of both surveys, and phytoplankton biomass decreased along the front. While these patches occurred in similar locations, it was unclear whether the same patch was sampled twice, or whether the two patches were different. Using an advection-reaction framework combined with field and satellite data, we found that variations in along-front gradients in dissolved oxygen, particle biovolume, and salinity support the conclusion that the two phytoplankton patches were different. They were only coincidentally sampled in similar locations. Backward- and forward-in-time tracking of water parcels showed that these phytoplankton patches had distinct origins, associated with specific, strong coastal upwelling pulses upstream of the front. Phytoplankton grew in these recently upwelled waters as they advected into and along the frontal system. By considering both local and upstream physical-biological forcings, this approach enables better characterizations of critical physical and biogeochemical processes that occur at fronts across spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Tropical Dry Forest Dynamics Explained by Topographic and Anthropogenic Factors: A Case Study in Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems, and it is disappearing at an alarming rate. Shifting cultivation is commonly cited as a driver of tropical dry forest loss, although it helps to maintain the forest coverage but with less density. We investigated tropical dry forest dynamics and their contributing factors to find out if there is an equilibrium between these two processes. We classified multi-temporal Sentinel-2A images with machine learning algorithms and used a logistic regression model to associate topographic, anthropogenic, and land tenure variables as plausible factors in the dynamics. We carried out an accuracy assessment of the detected changes in loss and gain considering the imbalance in area proportion between the change classes and the persistence classes. We estimated a 1.4% annual loss rate and a 0.7% annual gain rate in tropical dry forest and found that the topographic variable of slope and the anthropogenic variable of distance to roads helped explain the occurrence probability of both tropical forest loss and tropical forest gain. Since the area estimation yielded a wide confidence interval for both tropical forest loss and gain despite the measures that we took to counterbalance the disproportion in areas, we cannot conclude that the loss process was more intense than the gain process, but rather that there was an equilibrium in tropical dry forest dynamics under the influence of shifting cultivation.

AB  - The tropical glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca have played host to some of the most significant mass movements ever recorded in the world and Peru; many proglacial lakes formed in this mountain range have natural dikes made of moraine material, which, if they collapse, would present a risk for the cities located downstream of a proglacial lake, where the proglacial lake Palcacocha has a remarkable background regarding floods. The Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument, Level-2A) has a specific band for snow probability mapping that indicates glaciers and snow cover; this is effective for recognizing proglacial lakes by calculating the NDWIice. It is also helpful for lithology with SWIR for granite moraine deposits and slate moraines in the proglacial environment Palcacocha; these deposits surround the proglacial lake, with NDWIice determining the perimeter where sediment interacts with the rocks and meltwater. In addition, there are high radon concentrations made by ice avalanche impacts on the proglacial lake. Unstable glacier blocks cause ice avalanches into this proglacial lake, and the radon responds to flow variations from these high-impact avalanches. We used the device RadonEye PLus2, which allows real-time detection of radon flux changes in the proglacial environment. Our results indicated that ice avalanches making a high impact in the proglacial lake cause turbulent flow and generate radon concentration marks with a rising magnitude, while the absence of ice avalanches in the lake will cause the values to go down. The relationships of radon concentrations in the atmosphere for a tropical proglacial environment are radon and temperature (R-2 = 0.364), radon and humidity (R-2 = 0.469). In a passive proglacial environment with prolonged rainfall, radon concentrations tend to decrease, with an inversely proportional relationship between humidity and radon in the tropical proglacial environment. Proglacial lakes in the tropical zone often have large volumes of freshwater with high slopes from tropical glaciers, and climate change effects are an imminent danger for nearby cities.

TI  - Monitoring Ash Dieback in Europe-An Unrevealed Perspective for Remote Sensing?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ash dieback pandemic, caused by the invasive fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, represents one of Europe's biggest threats to preserving natural biodiversity. To ensure the suppression of forest damage caused by fungi, timely recognition of the symptoms of ash dieback and further continuous monitoring on an adequate spatial scale are essential. Visual crown damage assessment is currently the most common method used for identifying ash dieback, but it lacks the spatial and temporal coverage required for effective disease suppression. Remote sensing technologies, with the capabilities of fast and repetitive retrieval of information over a large spatial scale, could present efficient supplementary methods for ash damage detection and disease monitoring. In this study, we provided a synthesis of the existing remote sensing methods and applications that considers ash dieback disease, and we described the lifecycle of the disease using the major symptoms that remote sensing technologies can identify. Unfortunately, although effective methods of monitoring biotic damage through remote sensing have been developed, ash dieback has only been addressed in two research studies in the United Kingdom and Germany. These studies were based on single-date hyperspectral and very-high-resolution imagery in combination with machine learning, using previously specified ground-truth information regarding crown damage status. However, no study exists using high-resolution imagery such as Sentinel-2 or radar Sentinel-1, although some preliminary project results show that these coarser sources of information could be applicable for ash dieback detection and monitoring in cases of Fraxinus angustifolia, which forms pure, more homogenous stands in Southern Europe.

TI  - Study of Land Cover Change in the City with the Fastest Economic Growth in China (Hefei) from 2000 to 2020 Based on Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hefei's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate ranks first among all cities in China, and it was the fastest-growing city in China from 2000 to 2020. The high-speed economic development inevitably led to rapid changes in land cover types, e.g., an increment in artificial features (built-up) and decrement in natural features (vegetation). However, (1) many previous studies focus on the land cover change in metropolis or at the global scale, yet few focus on underdeveloped but fast-growing cities; (2) land cover studies mainly focus on global variations, yet seldom on local characteristics. Thus, it is of great significance to monitor the land cover change for the city with the fastest economic growth in China based on the long time-series satellite images from both global and local perspectives. In this study, with support from huge amounts of data (including 719 Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI satellite images, land surface temperature, nighttime satellite images, DEM, multiple land cover products, and various auxiliary data), processing and parallel computing abilities of the GEE platform, classification maps of land cover in Hefei from 2000 to 2020 are produced based on a random forest machine learning method, and the spatio-temporal variations and driving factors are analyzed from both global and local viewpoints. The results show that: (1) the classification accuracy is excellent; the average overall accuracy is 93% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.88; (2) the general spatio-temporal variations in land cover in Hefei from 2000 to 2020 are obvious; the built-up area expanded from 419.72 km(2) to 1530.20 km(2), with a total growth rate of 264.58%. With the expansion of the built-up area, the vegetation coverage decreased by 16.61% (1652.56 km(2)); (3) the land surface temperature shows an increment trend in the new town yet a decrement trend in the old town due to the change in vegetation coverage and the decentration of administration centers; further analysis shows that the population and the social economy are two driving factors for land cover changes. It is worth noting that both the area and coverage of vegetation in the old town and water body area in Hefei increased significantly, although the fast urbanization inevitably caused a decrement in vegetation and water area in the whole city, indicating both the high-speed economic development and improvement in green surfaces simultaneously experienced in Hefei from 2000 to 2020.

TI  - Integrating Unsupervised Machine Intelligence and Anomaly Detection for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Mapping Using Remote Sensing Image Series
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The synergistic use of remote sensing and unsupervised machine learning has emerged as a potential tool for addressing a variety of environmental monitoring applications, such as detecting disaster-affected areas and deforestation. This paper proposes a new machine-intelligent approach to detecting and characterizing spatio-temporal changes on the Earth's surface by using remote sensing data and unsupervised learning. Our framework was designed to be fully automatic by integrating unsupervised anomaly detection models, remote sensing image series, and open data extracted from the Google Earth Engine platform. The methodology was evaluated by taking both simulated and real-world environmental data acquired from several imaging sensors, including Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and Terra MODIS. The experimental results were measured with the kappa and F1-score metrics, and they indicated an assertiveness level of 0.85 for the change detection task, demonstrating the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach when addressing distinct environmental monitoring applications, including the detection of disaster-affected areas and deforestation mapping.

TI  - STCD-EffV2T Unet: Semi Transfer Learning EfficientNetV2 T-Unet Network for Urban/Land Cover Change Detection Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection in urban areas can be helpful for urban resource management and smart city planning. The effects of human activities on the environment and ground have gained momentum over the past decades, causing remote sensing data sources analysis (such as satellite images) to become an option for swift change detection in the environment and urban areas. We proposed a semi-transfer learning method of EfficientNetV2 T-Unet (EffV2 T-Unet) that combines the effectiveness of composite scaled EfficientNetV2 T as the first path or encoder for feature extraction and convolutional layers of Unet as the second path or decoder for reconstructing the binary change map. In the encoder path, we use EfficientNetV2 T, which was trained by the ImageNet dataset. In this research, we employ two datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed method for binary change detection. The first dataset is Sentinel-2 satellite images which were captured in 2017 and 2021 in urban areas of northern Iran. The second one is the Onera Satellite Change Detection dataset (OSCD). The performance of the proposed method is compared with YoloX-Unet families, ResNest-Unet families, and other well-known methods. The results demonstrated our proposed method's effectiveness compared to other methods. The final change map reached an overall accuracy of 97.66%.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF SOIL AND GROUND SEALING IN ARID ZONE CITIES BASED ON REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the results of interpretation of sealed soils and grounds for the territory of cities in the arid zone of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan. As a result of the geoinformational analysis of the territory, it was found that the sealed surfaces may occupy from 10 to 54 % of the area of cities. The direct dependence of the level of sealed area on population density, age of formation and natural conditions of a particular city was revealed. The use of Sentinel 2 satellite data makes it possible to interpret the sealed, landscaped, open and water surfaces in various natural, climatic and socio-economic conditions of the cities under study with an error not exceeding 20 %. The analysis of the proportion of sealed, land-scaped, water and open areas of the studied cities suggested the existence of a direct dependence of these indicators on the popu-lation density, age of formation and natural conditions of each particular city. Cities of the steppe zone, namely Saratov, Volgo-grad and Elista have from 15 to 28 % of landscaped areas, while in the cities of semi-desert (Uralsk, Astrakhan) and desert (Ak-tau, Makhachkala) zones this indicator varies from 3 to 12 %. The relationship between the density of urban population and the proportion of sealed and open areas has been revealed. The cities of Saratov, Astrakhan and Aktau are the main industrial and residential facilities of the regions, as a consequence, the sealed urban area varies from 35 to 54 %. The city of Volgograd, de-spite the presence of major industrial facilities and developed road and transport network, sealed only 21 %. This is due to the fact that its territory is mainly occupied by agricultural land (Sovetsky District) and areas not involved in the process of urbaniza-tion (Sarpinsky Island in Kirovsky District). The obtained data on the proportion of sealed, landscaped and open areas in the studied cities can give an objective picture of the development of urban space and determine the promising directions of its de-velopment. This information in the future will allow to determine the zones of intensive heating of the territory and highlight the so-called "heat islands". The obtained information about the territory sealing of the studied cities can be in demand for the solu-tion of territorial planning tasks, in the implementation of works on landscaping and urban area improvement, and in the future will allow to determine the zones of intensive territory warming and to allocate the so-called "heat islands".

TI  - Large-Scale Reduction in the Extent of Agriculture around Stopover Sites of Migratory Geese in European Russia between 1990 and 2015
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Stopover sites are vital to the state of the population of many migratory bird species. The greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons is the most numerous Eurasian goose species, and migrates on a broad front over European Russia. Stopover and staging sites have specific habitat requirements. They are located near open water, have nearby (<5 km) foraging areas, must be open, and lie at least 500 m from the nearest woodland. Extensive agricultural land abandonment in European Russia since 1990 is leading to widespread land cover changes, and may be lowering the availability and perhaps the suitability of stopover sites for greater white-fronted geese. To measure the extent of land cover change, we compiled Landsat images of three areas in European Russia over which geese migrate. The images were taken May 1990, 2002 and 2014, and used to create a scene that covered completely each area in each of these years. We classified each pixel into one of six land cover classes (LCCs: urban, water, arable, grass, peat bog and forest), and tallied the number changing LCC between the successive maps. For ground truthing, we made field visits in June 2014 to 150 locations chosen randomly in advance, and among them, 64 identified as stopover sites recently used by geese. At each, we assessed vegetation composition and cover, successional stage and the duration (in years) since agriculture on the site had been abandoned. The extent of arable land that changed to another classification 1990-2014 was 56%, and was matched closely by the increase in the extent of the 'grassland' and 'forest' categories, as expected if agricultural abandonment allows vegetation succession to proceed. The magnitude of change around identified stopover sites was similar to that in the areas as a whole. The extent of land cover change in the northern part of European Russia is making migration by greater white-fronted geese more challenging, which is consistent with the documented southward shift in stopover site usage. This could lead to abandonment of the route across northern European Russia altogether, in favour of a longer migration around the expanding boreal forest, which is inhospitable for goose species.

TI  - Information Content Analysis on Passive Remote Sensing Imaging Retrieval of Aerosol Layer Height Based on Spaceborne Polarization Crossfire
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective As one of the spaceborne detection schemes with the strongest comprehensive aerosol capability at this stage, the polarization crossfire ( PCF) strategy is developed in China. It is composed of the particulate observing scanning polarimeter (POSP) and the directional polarimetric camera (DPC) and has been carried by China's Gaofen 5-02 and the Chinese Atmospheric Environmental Monitoring Satellite (DQ-1), which are launched in 2021 and 2022, respectively. To explore the detection ability of the POSP based on PCF in the ultraviolet (UV) band for aerosol layer height ( ALH), we study the sensitivity of ALH with the synthetic data in the UV and near-UV bands and further assess the impact of different conditions on the information content and posterior error of ALH. It is expected that our findings can be helpful for the retrieval algorithm development of ALH.Methods Optimal estimation (OE) theory and information content analysis are employed in this study. OE provides statistical indicators such as the averaging kernel matrix and the degree of freedom for signal (DFS), which can represent how much information on the retrieved parameters we can obtain from the satellite measurements. Therefore, combined with the forward modeling of specific satellite sensor observations, information content analysis is used to provide support for satellite sensor design and retrieval algorithm development. The advantage is that the retrieval capability can be quantified without the development of true inversion. Additionally, it provides top-level physics-based guidance on algorithm design. Firstly, the unified linearized vector radiative transfer model (UNL-VRTM) is used as the forward model to calculate the normalized radiance and polarized radiance at the top of the atmosphere ( TOA), as well as the Jacobians of TOA results with respect to corresponding parameters. Then, the DFS and posterior error are introduced to quantify the information content of ALH from the aspects of the intensity and polarization measurements, respectively. Under the assumption of different surface types, aerosol models, and different typical observation geometry cases, the sensitivity analysis results for different situations can be finally obtained.Results and Discussions We analyze the sensitivity variation of ALH with the scattering angle at the solar zenith angle of 40 degrees. The results show that a smaller scattering angle (within 90 degrees to 140 degrees) of the satellite observation geometry is accompanied by higher sensitivity of Stokes parameter I to scale height H (Fig. 10). After that, we choose a fixed observation geometry to calculate the DFS under different schemes. The research shows that the DFS of the bare soil is lower than that of the vegetation surface in the band of 380 nm ( Table 6). Generally, the surface reflectance has more impact on the information content of H in terms of POSP measurements than aerosol optical properties, which leads to the lowest information content over bare soil. Meanwhile, with the addition of multi-band measurements and constraints of polarization information, the DFS of ALH is significantly improved (Fig. 11). Different cases indicate that the addition of intensity and polarization measurements for the retrieval of ALH at 380 nm and 410 nm can improve the H information effectively, and the posterior error of the ALH retrieval is also reduced by 5-30 percentage points (Fig. 13). It is shown that the polarization measurement in the UV band has a good constraining effect on the posterior error of H. In addition, with the addition of intensity and polarization information in the near-UV band 410 nm, the posterior error is further reduced by 7- 10 percentage points, and the measurements particularly improve the retrieval of ALH when the H value is low (Fig. 14). Conclusions The UV and near- UV bands are important sources of information content for ALH in satellite remote sensing. Compared with the case only using intensity observations at 380 nm, the addition of polarization detection in the same band can provide an extra DFS of 0. 06- 0. 26 for the retrieval of ALH. Meanwhile, the posterior error is reduced by 5- 30 percentage points. Combined with near-UV detection information at 410 nm, the posterior error for the retrieval of ALH is further reduced by 7- 10 percentage points. In particular, the retrieval of ALH at low scale height is improved. In addition, the sensitivity of observation information to ALH decreases gradually with the increase in the corresponding scattering angle ranging from 90 degrees to 140 degrees. Moreover, the bare soil case with aerosols dominated by the coarse mode provides less content information on ALH than the vegetation surface case with aerosols dominated by the fine mode. Although ALH information between the two types of aerosols shows some distinctions because of their different singlescattering optical properties, the dependence of information on surface types and the impact of polarization measurements generally appear similar. The information content analysis shows that the potential capability of the POSP instrument is good over various surface types and aerosol models on the basis of the use of spaceborne PCF strategy.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with breast cancer using a photoacoustic/ultrasound dual-modality imaging system with carbon nanoparticles as the contrast agent: a pilot study
T2  - BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the metastatic status of axillary lymph nodes is a common clinical practice in the staging of early breast cancers. Yet sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are the regional lymph nodes believed to be the first stop along the lymphatic drainage path of the metastasizing cancer cells. Compared to axillary lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) helps reduce morbidity and side effects. Current SLNB methods, however, still have suboptimum properties, such as restrictions due to nuclide accessibility and a relatively low therapeutic efficacy when only a single contrast agent is used. To overcome these limitations, researchers have been motivated to develop a non-radioactive SLN mapping method to replace or supplement radionuclide mapping. We proposed and demonstrated a clinical procedure using a dual-modality photoacoustic (PA)/ultrasound (US) imaging system to locate the SLNs to offer surgical guidance. In our work, the high contrast of PA imaging and its specificity to SLNs were based on the accumulation of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) in the SLNs. A machine-learning model was also trained and validated to distinguish stained SLNs based on single-wavelength PA images. In the pilot study, we imaged 11 patients in vivo, and the specimens from 13 patients were studied ex vivo. PA/US imaging identified stained SLNs in vivo without a single false positive (23 SLNs), yielding 100% specificity and 52.6% sensitivity based on the current PA imaging system. Our machine-learning model can automatically detect SLNs in real time. In the new procedure, single-wavelength PA/US imaging uses CNPs as the contrast agent. The new system can, with that contrast agent, noninvasively image SLNs with high specificity in real time based on the unique features of the SLNs in the PA images. Ultimately, we aim to use our systems and approach to substitute or supplement nuclide tracers for a non-radioactive, less invasive SLN mapping method in SLNB for the axillary staging of breast cancer.(c) 2023 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - "Some Don't Even Know Where South Is!": Linguistic Strategies for Spatial Reference and Seasons in Ishigaki Yaeyaman and Their Disappearance
T2  - LANGUAGES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many inhabitants of the Yaeyama Archipelago continue to hold a low status view towards their heritage language despite current efforts to halt language shift. An ideology of inferiority stemming from the colonization of the mind renders them psychologically dependent on being Japanese and unable to see their own language as valuable. The problem is further compounded by the lack of ethnolinguistic and sociolinguistic research on the knowledge concepts of the language including the reference system despite it being a profound feature of the language. This paper first rectifies this by describing the unique conceptualizations in the orientation systems as well as the seasonal terms of Yaeyaman. The focus is then shifted to the situations and frequency of their use in Yaeyaman and in Ishigaki-substrate Japanese to look for how language shift has impacted these spatial and environmental viewpoints in the minds of Yaeyaman speakers. I show through the words of the speakers, while describing their use of these systems, how their minds have been unconsciously colonized and how this drives an automatic behavior of language accommodation towards the Japanese. I argue that language accommodation to speakers of Japanese is largely responsible for the disuse of the unique Yaeyaman worldview concepts as well as the decrease in domains where the language is spoken. As a consequence, a unique way of looking at the world and a feature to take pride in is falling into disuse.

TI  - Superpixel for seagrass mapping: a novel method using PlanetScope imagery and machine learning in Tauranga harbour, New Zealand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass ecosystem provides valuable ecosystem services and is significant blue carbon sink. This resource, however, has been degraded across the globe with a loss rate of 7% year(-1) to the end of twentieth century. The loss of seagrass meadows might lead to an unexpected emission of CO2 into the atmosphere, aggravating global warming and resulting in potential damages to regional ecology and economies. Accurate mapping of meadows extent in different coverages from remotely sensed data, therefore is in high demand as the first step in the strategy of monitoring, report, verification (MRV) that underpins large scale conservation of global seagrass. Despite the higher accuracy of seagrass mapping in recent years, several challenges still persist, particularly when dealing with degraded, sparse seagrass meadows. In this research, we propose a novel and high accuracy approach for mapping dense and sparse meadows of the small size Zostera muelleri seagrass, using high spatial resolution imagery (PlanetScope) at 3 m spatial resolution, and advanced machine learning (ML) models for a ten-fold cross-validation superpixel-based classification in Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. We archive high mapping accuracy (overall accuracy = 0.913, Kappa coefficient (kappa) = 0.786, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) = 0.796 and F-1 = 0.908) using the LightGBM model from a set of superpixel image coupled with the Bayesian optimization for hyper-parameter tuning. Our proposed approach is solid and reliable with evidences of improving kappa (10%) and MCC (11%) when compared with pixel-based image classification, and is expected to provide novel, effective techniques for quantifying the spatial distribution and area of seagrass ecosystem worldwide.

TI  - Non-Parametric Tomographic SAR Reconstruction via Improved Regularized MUSIC
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Height estimation of scatterers in complex environments via the Tomographic Synthetic Aperture Radar (TomoSAR) technique is still a valuable research field. The parametric spectral estimation approach constitutes a powerful tool to identify the superimposed scatterers with different complex reflectivities, located at different heights in the same range-azimuth resolution cell. Unfortunately, this approach requires prior knowledge about the number of scatterers for each pixel, which is not possible in practical situations. In this paper, we propose a method that analyzes the scree plot, generated from the spectral decomposition of the multidimensional covariance matrix, in order to estimate automatically the number of scatterers for each resolution cell. In this context, a properly improved regularization step is included during the reconstruction process, transforming the parametric MUSIC estimator into a non-parametric method. The experimental results on two data sets covering high elevation towers, with different facade coating characteristics, acquired by the TerraSAR-X satellite highlighted the effectiveness of the proposed regularized MUSIC for the reconstruction of high man-made structures compared with classical approaches.

TI  - Impact of Climate Change Parameters on Groundwater Level: Implications for Two Subsidence Regions in Iran Using Geodetic Observations and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate how changes in meteorological indicators affect groundwater resources, and hence to predict groundwater levels using these indicators, particularly in regions experiencing drought and subsidence. Precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration and precipitable water vapor (PWV) are important meteorological parameters to predict groundwater levels. Two subsidence areas with different weather conditions were selected to conduct a comprehensive study on the effect of temperature and precipitation on groundwater level changes. The correct locations of the two subsidence areas were determined by analyzing Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images of Sentinel-1A using the small baseline subset algorithm. The interferograms were processed to correct tropospheric effects using the advanced integration method. Specifying the exact locations of the two areas, the meteorological parameters were downscaled using the Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM), synoptic observations, meteorological data, and the General Circulation Model (GCM). An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was then employed to predict the groundwater level changes as a function of meteorological data, including Global Positioning System (GPS)-based PWV and the evapotranspiration index. The trained ANN, along with the downscaled meteorological indicators, was used to predict groundwater level changes over two time periods. In the first period, the prediction was performed over the current years to investigate the performance of the method using the available data, whereas in the second period, the prediction was performed for the coming years, up until 2030. The results confirmed the high performance of the prediction algorithm, and the importance of including PWV and evapotranspiration in groundwater level predictions. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to check the relationship between groundwater level changes and meteorological variables. The statistical significance of these coefficients was tested at the significance level a=0.05. In more than 80% of the cases, the correlation coefficients were statistically significant, reaching more than 0.70 in some of the months. It is also observed that an increase in the depth of groundwater level has an obvious relationship with an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall.

TI  - Building a bridge: characterizing major anthropogenic point sources in the South African Highveld region using OCO-3 carbon dioxide snapshot area maps and Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI nitrogen dioxide columns
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we characterize major anthropogenic point sources in the South African Highveld region using Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) Snapshot Area Map (SAM) carbon dioxide (CO2) and Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations. Altogether we analyze six OCO-3 SAMs. We estimate the emissions of six power stations (Kendal, Kriel, Matla, Majuba, Tutuka and Grootvlei) and the largest single emitter of greenhouse gas (GHG) in the world, Secunda CTL synthetic fuel plant. We apply the cross-sectional flux method for the emission estimation and we extend the method to fit several plumes at the same time. Overall, the satellite-based emission estimates are in good agreement (within the uncertainties) as compared to emission inventories, even for the cases where several plumes are mixed. We also discuss the advantages and challenges of the current measurement systems for GHG emission monitoring and reporting, and the applicability of different emission estimation approaches to future satellite missions such as the Copernicus CO2 Monitoring Mission (CO2M) and the Global Observing SATellite for GHGs and Water cycle (GOSAT-GW), including the joint analysis of CO2 and NO2 observations.

TI  - Latitudinal Trend Analysis of Land Surface Temperature to Identify Urban Heat Pockets in Global Coastal Megacities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent global warming has led to increased coastal disturbances through a significant transfer of heat between the land and the ocean surface. The polar regions show excessive temperature changes resulting in massive ice sheet melting. Mid-latitudinal storms pull heat away from the equator towards the poles; therefore, the global sea level is rising, making coastal cities the most vulnerable. In last few decades, rapid urbanization in big cities has drastically changed the land cover and land use due to deforestation, which has led to increased land surface temperatures (LSTs). This eventually leads to urban flooding due to oceanic storm surges frequently created by low pressure over the ocean during summer. This paper considered factors such as drastic unplanned urbanization to analyze coastal cities as the focal point of the generation of heat yielding the annihilation of the natural topography. Urban heat pockets (UHP) were studied for nine megacities, which were selected at an interval of 5 degrees of latitudinal difference in the northern hemisphere (NH) since 70% of densely populated megacities are located in coastal regions. A comparative surface temperature analysis was effectively carried out with the same latitudinal reference for nine mid-sized cities using the derived LST data from Landsat 8. The results provide a comparative classification of surface temperature variations across the coastal cities over the NH. This study infers that the issues pertaining to growing urbanization are very important for analyzing the proportional impact caused by the settlement hierarchy and lays a robust foundation for advanced studies of global warming in coastal urban environments.

TI  - Ground Surface Deformation Analysis Integrating InSAR and GPS Data in the Karstic Terrain of Cheria Basin, Algeria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Karstic terrains are usually dominated by aquifer systems and/or underground cavities. Overexploitation of groundwater in such areas often induces land subsidence and sometimes causes sinkholes. The Cheria basin in Algeria suffers from severe land subsidence issues, and this phenomenon has been increasing in recent years due to population expansion and uncontrolled groundwater exploitation. This work uses GPS data and persistent scatterer interferometry synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) techniques to monitor the land subsidence rate by employing Sentinel-1 satellite data for the period from 2016 to 2022. Our results demonstrate that the Cheria basin experiences both uplift and subsidence in places, with an overall substantial change in the land surface. The total cumulative subsidence over 6 years reached a maximum of 500 mm. Comparison of land deformation between PSI and GPS showed root mean square error (RMSE) values of about 2.83 mm/year, indicating that our analyzed results are satisfactorily reproducing the actual changes. Nonetheless, these results can be used to extract the susceptible zones for vertical ground displacement and evaluate the surface deformation inventory map of the region for reducing damages (e.g., human losses, economic impact, and environmental degradation) that may occur in the future (e.g., sinkholes) and can be further utilized in perspective for a sinkhole early warning system.

TI  - Recognition of Area without Understory Vegetation Based on the RGB-UAV Ultra-High Resolution Images in Red Soil Erosion Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understory vegetation plays an important ecological role in maintaining the diversity of the ecosystem, the stability of ecosystem services, and the accumulation of nutrient elements, as an important part of a forest ecosystem. In this study, a new method of recognizing areas without understory vegetation is proposed. The method makes full use of the advantages of spectral characteristics, spatial structure information and temporal resolution of UAV images, and can quickly and simply distinguish understory, without vegetation cover. Combined with fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and vegetation dispersion, understory, with no vegetation area, can be successfully recognized, and the Pr, Re and F1 are all above 85%. The proportion of bare soil under forest in our study area is 20.40%, 19.98% and even 41.69%. The study area is located in Changting County, Fujian Province, which is a typical red soil area in China where serious soil erosion is taking place in the forest. The method provides a promising, quick and economic way of estimating understory vegetation coverage with high spatial accuracy.

TI  - <i>Fusarium</i> diversity associated with diseased cereals in China, with an updated phylogenomic assessment of the genus
T2  - STUDIES IN MYCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusarium species are important cereal pathogens that cause severe production losses to major cereal crops such as maize, rice, and wheat. However, the causal agents of Fusarium diseases on cereals have not been well documented because of the difficulty in species identification and the debates surrounding generic and species concepts. In this study, we used a citizen science initiative to investigate diseased cereal crops (maize, rice, wheat) from 250 locations, covering the major cereal-growing regions in China. A total of 2 020 Fusarium strains were isolated from 315 diseased samples. Employing multi-locus phylogeny and morphological features, the above strains were identified to 43 species, including eight novel species that are described in this paper. A world checklist of cereal-associated Fusarium species is provided, with 39 and 52 new records updated for the world and China, respectively. Notably, 56 % of samples collected in this study were observed to have co-infections of more than one Fusarium species, and the detailed associations are discussed. Following Koch's postulates, 18 species were first confirmed as pathogens of maize stalk rot in this study. Furthermore, a high-confidence species tree was constructed in this study based on 1 001 homologous loci of 228 assembled genomes (40 genomes were sequenced and provided in this study), which supported the "narrow" generic concept of Fusarium (= Gibberella). This study represents one of the most comprehensive surveys of cereal Fusarium diseases to date. It significantly improves our understanding of the global diversity and distribution of cereal-associated Fusarium species, as well as largely clarifies the phylogenetic relationships within the genus.

TI  - Screening of differential circRNAs in the placenta of patients with preeclampsia and their regulatory mechanism
T2  - MINERVA BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOMOLECULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE) is a common disease seriously threatens the health of the mother and fetus. Studies have shown that there are a large number of differentially expressed circular RNAs in PE compared with normal pregnant women, suggesting they may be involved in regulation of pathogenesis of PE and are valuable for early prediction of PE. This study intends to explore the screening and regulatory mechanism of differential circRNAs in the placenta of PE patients. METHODS: The placenta of patients undergoing cesarean section delivery in the obstetrics department of our hospital was selected, and total RNA was extracted. Through high-throughput sequencing, combined with bioinformatics, PE-specific circRNAs were screened, and it was speculated that they were related to the physiological function of the placenta in PE. RESULTS: Two thousand thirty-five circular RNA expression abundances were detected in the three groups of samples. Taking P<0.05 and the fold difference >1.5 times as the screening criteria for differential genes, 488 differentially expressed circular RNA molecules were obtained. G0 and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially circRNA-derived genes indicated there were significant differences in ErbB signaling pathway, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling pathway, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. A total of 1214 circRNAs and 2649 miRNA were constructed a ceRNA regulatory networks in PE patients. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the normal pregnancy placenta, there are abnormally expressed circRNAs in the placenta of PE, and these abnormally expressed circRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of PE through certain pathways.

TI  - Evaluation of Global Land Use-Land Cover Data Products in Guangxi, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use-land cover (LULC) is an important feature for ecological environment research, land resource management and evaluation. Although global high-resolution LULC data sets are booming, their regional performances were still evaluated in limited regions. To demonstrate the local applicability of global LULC data products, six emerging LULC data products were evaluated and compared in Guangxi, China. The six products used are European Space Agency GlobCover (ESAGC), ESRI Land Use-Land Cover (ESRI-LULC), Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC), the China Land Cover Dataset (CLCD), the Global Land Cover product with Fine Classification System at 30 m (GLC_FCS30) and GlobeLand30 (GLC30). Reference data were obtained from the local government statistical yearbook and high-resolution remote sensing images on Google Earth. The results showed that CLCD, ESRI-LULC and GLC30 were found to agree well with the forest reference data, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.999. For the cropland areas, GLC30, CLCD and ESAGC agreed well with the reference data, and the highest correlation coefficient was 0.957. Combined with the comparison with the high-resolution images obtained by Google Earth, we finally concluded that ESAGC, CLCD and GLC30 can best represent the LULCs in Guangxi. Furthermore, the spatial consistency analysis showed that three or more products identified the same LULC type as high as 96.98% of the area. We suggest that majority voting might be applied to global LULC products to provide fused products with better performances on a regional or local scale to avoid the error caused by a single data product.

AB  - We obtained sixteen clear-sky remote sensing images of Landsat series data from 1973 to 2021 and extracted continental and island coastlines of the Salween River Delta based on the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and visual interpretation correction. We determined the overall evolution of coastlines with statistical and superposition analysis and applied the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to summarize the spatial and temporal evolution process and characteristics in the past 50 years. Experimental results show that (1) the overall change of the coastline was more rapid on the island than on the continent, and on the Indian Ocean side than on the continental side, (2) the total area of the island increased by 91.16 km(2) from 1973 to 2021, the area of Bilu Island increased by 50.38 km(2), the length of the continental coastline decreased by 0.39 km, and the length of the coastline of the Bilu Island increased by 6.43 km, (3) the Linear Regression Rate (LRR) were: 4.69 m/yr for the total coastline, 1.06 and -2.07 m/yr, respectively, for the western and southern branches of the continental coastline, and 0.83 and 21.52 m/yr, respectively, for the continental and Indian Ocean sides of Bilu Island, and (4) the dominant process in the Salween River Delta was accretion, with an overall accretion area of about 10 km(2), and an unstable accretion rate.

TI  - Prediction of Soil Moisture Content from Sentinel-2 Images Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is closely associated with food and water. Agriculture is the first source of food but the biggest consumer of freshwater. The population is constantly increasing. Smart agriculture is one of the means of achieving food and water security. Smart agriculture can help improve water management and increase agricultural production, thus counteracting rapid population growth requirements. Soil moisture estimation is a critical step in agricultural water management. Soil moisture measurement techniques in situ are point measurements, labor-intensive, time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. We propose, in this research, a new approach to predict soil moisture over vegetation-covered areas from Sentinel-2 images based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN architecture (3) consisting of six convolutional layers, one pooling layer, and two fully connected layers has achieved the highest prediction accuracy. Three well-known criteria including coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are utilized to measure the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The Red Edge 3, NIR, and SWIR 1 are the most appropriate Sentinel-2 bands for retrieving soil moisture in vegetation-covered areas. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are the best indicators. The use of the indicator is more proper than the use of the single Sentinel-2 band as input data for the proposed CNN architecture for predicting soil moisture. However, using combinations "that consist of some number of Sentinel-2 bands" as input data for CNN architecture is better than using each indicator separately or all of them as a group. The best values of the performance metrics were achieved using the sixth combination (R-2=0.7094, MAE=0.0277, RMSE=0.0418) composed of the Red, Red Edge 1, Red Edge 2, Red Edge 3, NIR, and Red Edge 4 bands as input data to the CNN architecture (3), as well as by using the fifth combination (R-2=0.7015, MAE=0.0287, RMSE=0.0424) composed of the Red Edge 3, NIR, Red Edge 4, and SWIR 1 bands.

TI  - Coupling Coordination Development of Urbanization and Ecological Environment in the Urban Agglomeration on the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid urbanization and increasingly prominent environmental issues, objective evaluation of the quality of the ecological environment is crucial for environmental protection and sustainable development. Most remote sensing ecological indices (RSEI) used for ecological environmental quality evaluation include only four indicators (greenness, humidity, heat, and dryness), and many studies have ignored the impact of air quality on urban ecological environmental quality in arid areas. This study used the urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains (UANSTM), China, as the research area based on the Google Earth Engine platform via Landsat remote sensing images and NPP/VIIRS data to establish a new remote sensing ecological index (RSEInew) and compounded night light index of urbanization level. The coupling coordination degree model was used to quantitatively analyze the characteristics of the coordinated development of the ecological environment and urbanization in UANSTM and major cities from 2015 to 2020. The results showed that: (1) compared to RSEI, RSEInew is more suitable for assessing the ecological quality of arid zones because it accounts for air quality; (2) the RSEInew value for the eco-environmental quality of UANSTM from 2015 to 2020 improved and then deteriorated with an overall declining trend. The variation in the RSEInew rating was between "strongly bad" and "neutral," and there were differences in the quality of the ecological environments among cities; (3) the level of urbanization in the economic zone of UANSTM from 2015 to 2020 increased significantly, and the degree of coordination between urbanization and ecological environmental quality coupling steadily increased but remained moderately imbalanced. The results of this study provide a scientific reference for the economic development and ecological environmental protection of the study area.

TI  - Accommodation of ash scattering in contemporary Norwegian governance of death and religion/worldview
T2  - APPROACHING RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the analysis of the scattering ashes in a Norwegian context as its point of departure, the article sets out to explore ash scattering and how it relates to the govern- ance of deathscape and religion/worldview in the public space. Referring to ethnographic study, the focus is on the bereaved and the de ceased in the governance process for ash scat tering and on critically rethinking the governance of ash scattering from the private actors' experiences. I argue that ash scattering is in the process of establishing a spatial ritual institution, deregulated vis-a-vis organized reli- gion/worldview, which, on the one hand, opens up the possibility for the privatization of death and provides ideals of individuality, privacy and discretion, and, on the other hand, this takes place paradoxically not in private but rather within public space.

TI  - Leveraging Electronic Health Record Data for Timely Chronic Disease Surveillance: The Multi-State EHR-Based Network for Disease Surveillance
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context:Electronic health record (EHR) data can potentially make chronic disease surveillance more timely, actionable, and sustainable. Although use of EHR data can address numerous limitations of traditional surveillance methods, timely surveillance data with broad population coverage require scalable systems. This report describes implementation, challenges, and lessons learned from the Multi-State EHR-Based Network for Disease Surveillance (MENDS) to help inform how others work with EHR data to develop distributed networks for surveillance. Program:Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), MENDS is a data modernization demonstration project that aims to develop a timely national chronic disease sentinel surveillance system using EHR data. It facilitates partnerships between data contributors (health information exchanges, other data aggregators) and data users (state and local health departments). MENDS uses query and visualization software to track local emerging trends. The program also uses statistical and geospatial methods to generate prevalence estimates of chronic disease risk measures at the national and local levels. Resulting data products are designed to inform public health practice and improve the health of the population. Implementation:MENDS includes 5 partner sites that leverage EHR data from 91 health system and clinic partners and represents approximately 10 million patients across the United States. Key areas of implementation include governance, partnerships, technical infrastructure and support, chronic disease algorithms and validation, weighting and modeling, and workforce education for public health data users. Discussion:MENDS presents a scalable distributed network model for implementing national chronic disease surveillance that leverages EHR data. Priorities as MENDS matures include producing prevalence estimates at various geographic and subpopulation levels, developing enhanced data sharing and interoperability capacity using international data standards, scaling the network to improve coverage nationally and among underrepresented geographic areas and subpopulations, and expanding surveillance of additional chronic disease measures and social determinants of health.

TI  - Extraction and Analysis of Soil Salinization Information in an Alar Reclamation Area Based on Spectral Index Modeling
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to explore the optimal remote sensing salinity monitoring index model for the inversion of soil salinization in the Alar reclamation area, based on the Sentinel-2 images and field measured data, the salinity index 1 (SI1), the normalized difference vegetation index in a green-red band (GRNDVI), the normalized vegetation index of greenness (GNDVI), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were selected to construct the remote sensing-based salinization 1 detection index (S1DI) model. Next, the cotton field soil salinization information in the Alar reclamation area was extracted, and the accuracy of the model was verified to obtain the optimal remote sensing salinity monitoring index model. The results show that the overall classification accuracy of the S1DI1 (SI1-GRNDVI), S1DI2 (SI1-GNDVI), S1DI3 (SI1-NDVI), and S1DI4 (SI1-DVI) models for salinity monitoring is 83.35%, 83.10%, 82.96%, and 80.25%, respectively. The S1DI1 model is most suitable for retrieving the degree of soil salinization in the cotton field in the Alar reclamation area, and the S1DI2, S1DI3, and S1DI4 models are also very useful for monitoring soil salinization in the Alar reclamation area. Using the S1DI1 model to invert the soil salinization level of the cotton fields in the Alar reclamation area, it was found that the cotton field in the reclamation area is dominated by non-saline soil, and the light saline soil and moderate saline soil are mainly distributed in the 9th and 12th clusters of the reclamation area. As the S1DI1 model possesses the highest accuracy in extracting the soil salinization information of the cotton fields in the Alar reclamation area, it can be used as a remote sensing salinity 1 monitoring index model for the inversion of the soil salinization of the cotton fields in the reclamation area, which is expected to provide an effective reference value for soil salinization monitoring.

TI  - A Review of Advances in Groundwater Evapotranspiration Research
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Groundwater evapotranspiration (ETg) is an important component of the hydrological cycle in water-scarce regions and is important for local ecosystems and agricultural irrigation management. However, accurate estimation of ETg is not easy due to uncertainties in climatic conditions, vegetation parameters, and the hydrological parameters of the unsaturated zone and aquifers. The current methods for calculating ETg mainly include the WTF method and the numerical groundwater model. The WTF method often requires data supplementation from the numerical unsaturated model to reduce uncertainty; in addition, it relies on point-monitoring data and cannot solve the spatial heterogeneity of ETg. The ETg calculation module of the numerical groundwater model is set up too simply and ignores the influence from the unsaturated zone and surface cover. Subsequent research breakthroughs should focus on the improvement of WTF calculation theory and the setting up of an aquifer water-table fluctuation monitoring network. The numerical groundwater model should couple the surface remote sensing data with the unsaturated zone model to improve the accuracy of ETg calculation.

TI  - Changes in Land Use Pattern and Structure under the Rapid Urbanization of the Tarim River Basin
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization not only affects a region's economic development but also impacts its land use structure. As the largest inland river basin in China, the Tarim River Basin has experienced rapid economic growth and urbanization in recent years, posing a serious threat to its soil and water resources and ecological sustainability. In this study, four remote sensing data products from 1990-2020 are selected to explore the distribution of land use types and their land structure changes in the basin in the context of rapid urbanization. The results show that the built-up land area increased by 2855.74 km(2) during 1990-2020, mainly from the transfer of grassland and barren land. Furthermore, the migration of the center of gravity of built-up land moved from the desert to oasis areas, indicating that the urbanization process intensified during the study period. The overall trend is toward a continuous increase in arable and built-up land area and a continuous decrease in barren land. Future trends in the Tarim River Basin predict that arable land will decrease and that built-up land will continue to increase. However, the increase in built-up land will level off, mainly due to the transfer of arable land and grassland, which accounts for 37.94% and 20.40%, respectively. The migration characteristics of the center of gravity of each land type in the basin varied widely during 1990-2020, but the land structure will tend toward a gradual balance in the future. Therefore, in the context of increasing urbanization, focusing on the sustainable development of regional soil and water resources and ecology is crucial for the coordinated development of regional resources and economy.

TI  - Temperature and Relative Humidity Profile Retrieval from Fengyun-3D/VASS in the Arctic Region Using Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a new technique is proposed to retrieve temperature and relative humidity profiles under clear sky conditions in the Arctic region based on the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm using Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) vertical atmospheric sounder suit (VASS: HIRAS, MWTS-II, and MWHS-II) observations. This technology combines infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) observations to improve retrieval accuracy in the middle and low troposphere by reducing the sensitivity of the neural networks (NNs) to cloud coverage. The approach was compared against other methods available in the literature on retrieving profiles only from FY-3D/HIRAS data. Furthermore, its retrieval performance was tested by comparing the NNs' prediction accuracy versus the corresponding FY-3D/VASS and Aqua/AIRS L2 products. The results showed that: (1) NNs retrieval accuracy is higher during the warm season and over the ocean; (2) the retrieval accuracy of NNs has been significantly improved compared with satellite L2 products; (3) referring to radiosonde observations, the retrieval accuracy of NNs below 600 hPa is effectively improved by adding the information of the MW channel, especially on land where cloud clearing is more difficult. The root mean square error (RMSE) of temperature and relative humidity in the cold season were reduced by 0.3 K and 2%, respectively. The advanced NNs proposed herein offer a more stable retrieval performance compared with NNs built only by FY-3D/HIRAS data. The study results indicated the potential value in time and space domain of the NN algorithm in retrieving temperature and relative humidity profiles of the Arctic region from FY-3D/VASS observations under clear-sky conditions. All in all, this work enhances our knowledge towards improving operational use of FY-3D satellite data in the Arctic region.

TI  - UAV-Based Remote Sensing for Soybean FVC, LCC, and Maturity Monitoring
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate monitoring of fractional vegetation cover (FVC), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and maturity of breeding material are essential for breeding companies. This study aimed to estimate LCC and FVC on the basis of remote sensing and to monitor maturity on the basis of LCC and FVC distribution. We collected UAV-RGB images at key growth stages of soybean, namely, the podding (P1), early bulge (P2), peak bulge (P3), and maturity (P4) stages. Firstly, based on the above multi-period data, four regression techniques, namely, partial least squares regression (PLSR), multiple stepwise regression (MSR), random forest regression (RF), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were used to estimate the LCC and FVC, respectively, and plot the images in combination with vegetation index (VI). Secondly, the LCC images of P3 (non-maturity) were used to detect LCC and FVC anomalies in soybean materials. The method was used to obtain the threshold values for soybean maturity monitoring. Additionally, the mature and immature regions of soybean were monitored at P4 (mature stage) by using the thresholds of P3-LCC. The LCC and FVC anomaly detection method for soybean material presents the image pixels as a histogram and gradually removes the anomalous values from the tails until the distribution approaches a normal distribution. Finally, the P4 mature region (obtained from the previous step) is extracted, and soybean harvest monitoring is carried out in this region using the LCC and FVC anomaly detection method for soybean material based on the P4-FVC image. Among the four regression models, GPR performed best at estimating LCC (R-2: 0.84, RMSE: 3.99) and FVC (R-2: 0.96, RMSE: 0.08). This process provides a reference for the FVC and LCC estimation of soybean at multiple growth stages; the P3-LCC images in combination with the LCC and FVC anomaly detection methods for soybean material were able to effectively monitor soybean maturation regions (overall accuracy of 0.988, mature accuracy of 0.951, immature accuracy of 0.987). In addition, the LCC thresholds obtained by P3 were also applied to P4 for soybean maturity monitoring (overall accuracy of 0.984, mature accuracy of 0.995, immature accuracy of 0.955); the LCC and FVC anomaly detection method for soybean material enabled accurate monitoring of soybean harvesting areas (overall accuracy of 0.981, mature accuracy of 0.987, harvested accuracy of 0.972). This study provides a new approach and technique for monitoring soybean maturity in breeding fields.

TI  - Fitness for Purpose of Several Fractional Vegetation Cover Products on Monitoring Vegetation Cover Dynamic Change-A Case Study of an Alpine Grassland Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-time series global fractional vegetation cover (FVC) products have received widespread international publication, and they supply the essential data required for eco-monitoring and simulation study, assisting in the understanding of global warming and preservation of ecosystem stability. However, due to the insufficiency of high-precision FVC ground-measured data, the accuracy of these FVC products in some regions (such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau) is still unknown, which brings a certain impact on eco-environment monitoring and simulation. Here, based on current international mainstream FVC products (including GEOV1 and GEOV2 at Copernicus Global Land Services, GLASS from Beijing Normal University, and MuSyQ from National Earth System Science Data Center), the study of the dynamic change of vegetation cover and its influence factors were conducted in the three-rivers source region, one of the core regions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, via the methods of trend analysis and partial correlation analysis, respectively. Our results found that: (1) The discrepancy in the eco-environment assessment results caused by the inconsistency of FVC products is reflected in the statistical value and the spatial distribution. (2) About 70% of alpine grassland in the three-rivers source region changing trend is controversial. (3) The limiting or driving factors of the alpine grassland change explained via different FVC products were significantly discrepant. Thus, before conducting these studies in the future, the uncertainties of the FVC products utilized should be validated first to acquire the fitness of the FVC products if the accuracy information of these products is unavailable within the study area. In addition, more high-precision FVC ground-measured data should be collected, helping us to validate FVC product uncertainty.

TI  - How Spatial Resolution of Remote Sensing Image Affects Earthquake Triggered Landslide Detection: An Example from 2022 Luding Earthquake, Sichuan, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude 6.8 Luding earthquake that occurred on 5 September 2022, triggered multiple large-scale landslides and caused a heavy loss of life and property. The investigation of earthquake-triggered landslides (ETLs) facilitates earthquake disaster assessments, rescue, reconstruction, and other post-disaster recovery efforts. Therefore, it is important to obtain landslide inventories in a timely manner. At present, landslide detection is mainly conducted manually, which is time-consuming and laborious, while a machine-assisted approach helps improve the efficiency and accuracy of landslide detection. This study uses a fully convolutional neural network algorithm with the Adam optimizer to automatically interpret the aerial and satellite data of landslides. However, due to the different resolutions of the remote sensing images, the detected landslides vary in boundary and quantity. In this study, we conducted an assessment in the study area of Wandong village in the earthquake-affected area of Luding. UAV images, GF-6 satellite images, and Landsat 8 satellite images, with a resolution of 0.2 m, 2 m, and 15 m, respectively, were selected to detect ETLs. Then, the accuracy of the results was compared and verified with visual detection results and field survey data. The study indicates that as the resolution decreases, the accuracy of landslide detection also decreases. The overall landslide area detection rate of UAV imagery can reach 82.17%, while that of GF-6 and Landsat 8 imagery is only 52.26% and 48.71%. The landslide quantity detection rate of UAV imagery can reach 99.07%, while that of GF-6 and Landsat 8 images is only 48.71% and 61.05%. In addition, for each landslide detected, little difference is found in large-scale landslides, and it becomes more difficult to correctly detect small-scale landslides as the resolution decreases. For example, landslides under 100 m(2) could not be detected from a Landsat 8 satellite image.

TI  - Leaf area index estimation of pergola-trained vineyards in arid regions using classical and deep learning methods based on UAV-based RGB images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate mapping of leaf area index (LAI) in vineyards plays an important role for management choices in precision agricultural practices. However, only a little work has been done to extract the LAI of pergola-trained vineyards using higher spatial resolution remote sensing data. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imageries to estimate the LAI of pergola-trained vineyards using shallow and deep machine learning (ML) methods. Field trials were conducted in different growth seasons in 2021 by collecting 465 LAI samples. Firstly, this study trained five classical shallow ML models and an ensemble learning model by using different spectral and textural indices calculated from UAV imageries, and the most correlated or useful features for LAI estimations in different growth stages were differentiated. Then, due to the classical ML approaches need the arduous computation of multiple indices and feature selection procedures, another ResNet-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model was constructed which can be directly fed by cropped images. Furthermore, this study introduced a new image data augmentation method which is applicable to regression problems. Results indicated that the textural indices performed better than spectral indices, while the combination of them can improve estimation results, and the ensemble learning method showed the best among classical ML models. By choosing the optimal input image size, the CNN model we constructed estimated the LAI most effectively without extracting and selecting the features manually. The proposed image data augmentation method can generate new training images with new labels by mosaicking the original ones, and the CNN model showed improved performance after using this method compared to those using only the original images, or augmented by rotation and flipping methods. This data augmentation method can be applied to other regression models to extract growth parameters of crops using remote sensing data, and we conclude that the UAV imagery and deep learning methods are promising in LAI estimations of pergola-trained vineyards.

TI  - Development of Hybrid Models to Estimate Gross Primary Productivity at a Near-Natural Peatland Using Sentinel 2 Data and a Light Use Efficiency Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands store up to 2320 Mt of carbon (C) on only similar to 20% of the land area in Ireland; however, approximately 90% of this area has been drained and is emitting up to 10 Mt C per year. Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a one of the key components of the peatland carbon cycle, and detailed knowledge of the spatial and temporal extent of GPP under changing management practices is imperative to improve our predictions of peatland ecology and biogeochemistry. This research assesses the relationship between remote sensing and ground-based estimates of GPP for a near-natural peatland in Ireland using eddy covariance (EC) techniques and high-resolution Sen-tinel 2A satellite imagery. Hybrid models were developed using multiple linear regression along with six widely used conventional indices and a light use efficiency model. Estimates of GPP using NDVI, EVI, and NDWI2 hybrid models performed well using literature-based light use efficiency parameters and showed a significant correlation from 89 to 96% with EC-derived GPP. This study also reports additional site-specific light use efficiency parameters for dry and hydrologically normal years on the basis of light response curve methods (LRC). Overall, this research has demonstrated the potential of combining EC techniques with satellite-derived models to better understand and monitor key drivers and patterns of GPP for raised bog ecosystems under different climate scenarios and has also provided light use efficiency parameters values for dry and wetter conditions that can be used for the estimation of GPP using LUE models across various site and scales.

TI  - Nail Apparatus Melanoma: Current Management and Future Perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Nail apparatus melanoma (NAM) is a rare type of cutaneous melanoma that belongs to the acral melanoma subtype. NAM is managed principally in accordance with the general treatment for cutaneous melanoma, but there is scarce evidence in support of this in the literature. Acral melanoma is genetically different from non-acral cutaneous melanoma, while recently accumulated data suggest that NAM also has a different genetic background from acral melanoma. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the management of NAM. Localized NAM should be surgically removed; amputation of the digit and digit-preserving surgery have been reported. Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be considered for invasive NAM for the purpose of accurate staging. However, it is yet to be clarified whether patients with metastatic sentinel lymph nodes can be safely spared completion lymph node dissection. Similar to cutaneous melanoma, immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF/MEK inhibitors are used as the first-line treatment for metastatic NAM, but data on the efficacy of these therapies remain scarce. The therapeutic effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors could be lower for NAM than for cutaneous melanoma. This review highlights the urgent need to accumulate data to better define the optimal management of this rare melanoma.

TI  - A Model of Mean Long-term Values of Atmospheric Aerosol Optical Depth at a 354 nm Wavelength in Russia in the Warm Season
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the results of satellite measurements using OMI instrumentation (NASA, USA) at 354 nm in 2005-2020 (http://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov) over nine populated areas in Russia, after the exclusion of cases of the smoke and dust registration in the atmosphere, approximations were obtained for temporal variations in average long-term values of atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) in April to September. The approximations obtained for four most spaced-apart areas made it possible to develop a spatiotemporal model of average long-term AOD in the ultraviolet band for the territory from 43 & DEG; to 60 & DEG; N and from 33 & DEG; to 133 & DEG; E for a warm season. A verification of the model using data for the other five areas that were not included in the model development and a comparison of the results with AERONET ground data confirmed a fairly good quality of the model. An analysis of the measurement data is indicative of significant negative annual linear trends in the mean April-September AOD for all analyzed areas

TI  - A Multi-Spectral Fractal Image Model and Its Associated Fractal Dimension Estimator
T2  - FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose both a probabilistic fractal model and fractal dimension estimator for multi-spectral images. The model is based on the widely known fractional Brownian motion fractal model, which is extended to the case of images with multiple spectral bands. The model is validated mathematically under the assumption of statistical independence of the spectral components. Using this model, we generate several synthetic multi-spectral fractal images of varying complexity, with seven statistically independent spectral bands at specific wavelengths in the visible domain. The fractal dimension estimator is based on the widely used probabilistic box-counting classical approach extended to the multivariate domain of multi-spectral images. We validate the estimator on the previously generated synthetic multi-spectral images having fractal properties. Furthermore, we deploy the proposed multi-spectral fractal image estimator for the complexity assessment of real remotely sensed data sets and show the usefulness of the proposed approach.

TI  - NEO-PAGANISM IN MODERN VISUAL ART IN THE CASE OF A.A. OSIPOVA'S LIFE-CREATION
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the interaction of neo-paganism and visual art by the example of life-creation of Anna Afanasyeva Osipova, who works with archeoart and magical realism. Her art has not previously been the subject of special research, but its analysis contributes to understanding the artistic thinking of early XXI century in Russian regions ( in particular, the specifics of Siberia and Far East) and the country as a whole, the peculiarities of art and neopaganism ideas interaction, the principles of incorporation of neo-paganism into artistic culture. The study of the artist's works and interviews with the help of biographical method, socio-cultural and axiological approaches, introduction of concept of "artistic nomadism" had brought to following conclusions.The interaction of visual art and neo-paganism can be described through the concept of "artistic nomadism", which means the author's way of artistic practice linked with a permanent change in search of artistic "ego" and a sense of belonging. Neo-paganism comes from a nomadic search for a different identity in the ethnic past or universal archaic, non-recognition of boundaries and hierarchy, the combination of indigenization and universalism, free interpretation of tradition. A.A. Osipova represents in her work a type of neo-paganism, defined as eclectic universalism. Such an existence in the artistic world is akin to lifecreating principle implemented by A.A. Osipova in fluctuations between the postmodern game and a sincere search for a Home. Archeoart and magical realism proved to be able to reflect this worldview.The nomadic thinking reflects in semantic infinity of immanent images and compositions. Osipova's visual art displays the new attitude to meaning and semantic determinacy: semiosis turns into process of free signification at the stages of both creation and perception of artistic utterance, thus creating an unlimited number of meanings.Neo-paganism and archaic art as forms of incorporation the archaic into modern culture are close phenomena, but not related originally. Both of them are the consequences of person's disillusionment with industrial and post-industrial civilization values and ideals that was repeatedly observed throughout the XIX-XX centuries. The "alternative spirituality" trend at the turn of XX-XXI centuries was perceived by A.A. Osipova and implemented in artistic practice.The revival of archetype in art is one of the possible intellectual and creative ways of self-organization of artistic activity subject in the context of cultural rhizome, which is not necessarily associated with the archaization of consciousness. Rhizomatic being stimulates the processes of self-organization and generates the alternative structure of sensations and new discourse in art, represented by the synthesis of traditional and modern and forms a new sincerity as opposed to postmodern irony.

TI  - Current evidences of the efficacy of mosquito mass-trapping interventions to reduce <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> populations and <i>Aedes</i>-borne transmission
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryOver the past decades, several viral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes-dengue, chikungunya, Zika-have spread outside of tropical areas. To limit the transmission of these viruses and preserve environment and human health, the use of mosquito traps has been developed as a complement or alternative to other vector control techniques.This review support the efficacy of mass trapping in combination with classical integrated vector control on the reduction in mosquito vector populations within several weeks of deployment. However, this research highlights gaps in the demonstration of the efficacy of mass trapping of mosquitoes in reducing viral transmission and disease. Thus, further studies are needed to establish scientific evidence for the reduction of viral transmission risk by mass trapping targeting gravid and/or host-seeking female mosquitoes.BackgroundOver the past decades, several viral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes-dengue, chikungunya, Zika-have spread outside of tropical areas. To limit the transmission of these viruses and preserve human health, the use of mosquito traps has been developed as a complement or alternative to other vector control techniques. The objective of this work was to perform a systematic review of the existing scientific literature to assess the efficacy of interventions based on adult mosquito trap to control Aedes population densities and the diseases they transmit worldwide. Methods and findingsFollowing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted using the PubMed and Scopus databases. Among the 19 selected papers, lethal ovitraps were used in 16 studies, host-seeking female traps in 3 studies. Furthermore, 16 studies focused on the control of Ae. aegypti. Our review showed great heterogeneity in the indicators used to assess trap efficacy: e.g., the number of host-seeking females, the number of gravid females, the proportion of positive containers, the viral infection rate in female mosquitoes or serological studies in residents. Regardless of the type of studied traps, the results of various studies support the efficacy of mass trapping in combination with classical integrated vector control in reducing Aedes density. More studies with standardized methodology, and indicators are urgently needed to provide more accurate estimates of their efficacy. ConclusionsThis review highlights gaps in the demonstration of the efficacy of mass trapping of mosquitoes in reducing viral transmission and disease. Thus, further large-scale cluster randomized controlled trials conducted in endemic areas and including epidemiological outcomes are needed to establish scientific evidence for the reduction of viral transmission risk by mass trapping targeting gravid and/or host-seeking female mosquitoes.

TI  - Exploratory Mapping of Blue Ice Regions in Antarctica Using Very High-Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping spatiotemporal changes in the distribution of blue ice regions (BIRs) in Antarctica requires repeated, precise, and high-resolution baseline maps of the blue ice extent. This study demonstrated the design and application of a newly-developed semi-automatic method to map BIRs in the Antarctic environment using very high-resolution (VHR) WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite images. We discussed the potential of VHR satellite data for the mapping of BIRs in the Antarctic environment using a customized normalized-difference blue-ice index (NDBI) method devised using yellow, green, and near-infrared spectral bands of WV-2 data. We compared the viability of the newly developed customized NDBI approach against state-of-the-art target detection (TD), spectral processing (SP) and pixel-wise supervised (PSC) feature extraction (FE) approaches. Four semi-automatic FE approaches (three existing plus one newly developed) consisting of 16 standalone FE methods (12 existing + four customized) were evaluated using an extensive quantitative and comparative assessment for mapping BIRs in the vicinity of Schirmacher Oasis, on the continental Antarctic coastline. The results suggested that the customized NDBI approach gave a superior performance and the highest statistical stability when compared with existing FE techniques. The customized NDBI generally rendered the lowest level of misclassification (average RMSE = 654.48 +/- 58.26 m(2)), followed by TD (average RMSE = 987.81 +/- 55.05 m(2)), SP (average RMSE = 1327.09 +/- 127.83 m(2)) and PSC (average RMSE = 2259.43 +/- 115.36 m(2)) for mapping BIRs. Our results indicated that the use of the customized NDBI approach can greatly improve the semi-automatic mapping of BIRs in the Antarctic environment. This study presents the first refined map of distribution of BIRs around the Schirmacher Oasis. The total area of blue ice in the study area was estimated to be 106.875 km(2), approximately 61% of the study area. The WV-2 derived BIR map area presented in this study locally refined the existing BIR map derived using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based mosaic of Antarctica (MOA) dataset by similar to 31% (similar to 33.40 km(2)). Finally, we discussed the practical challenges and future directions in mapping BIRs across Antarctica.

TI  - Increasing Accuracy of the Soil-Agricultural Map by Sentinel-2 Images Analysis-Case Study of Maize Cultivation under Drought Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The properties of soil constitute one of the most important features of the environment that determine the potential for food production in a given region. Knowledge of the soil texture and agroclimate allows for the proper selection of species and agrotechnics in plant production. However, in contrast to the agroclimate, the soil may show a large spatial variation of physical and chemical characteristics within the plot. In regions where the soil diversity is so high that the available soil maps are not sufficient, the only method that allows for precise mapping of the soil mosaic is remote sensing. This paper presents the concepts of using Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images to detail the available soil-agriculture map at a scale of 1:25,000. In the presented work, the following research hypothesis has been formulated: spatial and temporal analysis of high-resolution satellite images can be used to improve the quality of a large-scale archival soil-agriculture map. It is possible due to the spatial differentiation of the spectral reflection from the field (canopy), which is influenced by soil conditions-especially the differentiation of physical properties (granulometric composition) in soil profiles which determine the possibility of water retention during drought conditions. The research carried out as a case study of maize remote sensing confirmed the hypothesis. It was based on the selection of the most appropriate term (maize development period: BBCH 79, 6-decade drought index: CBW = -206 mm) and the vegetation index (NDVI). This made it possible to make the scale of the map 10 times more detailed. The obtained results are the first step in developing a general model (based on remote sensing) for detailing the soil-agriculture map for Poland, which will significantly improve the accuracy of the drought monitoring system developed by the Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation (Poland).

T2  - BIG DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a huge number of satellites revolve around the earth, a great probability exists to observe and determine the change phenomena on the earth through the analysis of satellite images on a real-time basis. Therefore, classifying satellite images plays strong assistance in remote sensing communities for predicting tropical cyclones. In this article, a classification approach is proposed using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), comprising numerous layers, which extract the features through a downsampling process for classifying satellite cloud images. DCNN is trained marvelously on cloud images with an impressive amount of prediction accuracy. Delivery time decreases for testing images, whereas prediction accuracy increases using an appropriate deep convolutional network with a huge number of training dataset instances. The satellite images are taken from the Meteorological & Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre, the organization is responsible for availing satellite cloud images of India and its subcontinent. The proposed cloud image classification shows 94% prediction accuracy with the DCNN framework.

TI  - CA-BIT: A Change Detection Method of Land Use in Natural Reserves
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural reserves play a leading role in safeguarding national ecological security. Remote sensing change detection (CD) technology can identify the dynamic changes of land use and warn of ecological risks in natural reserves in a timely manner, which can provide technical support for the management of natural reserves. We propose a CD method (CA-BIT) based on the improved bitemporal image transformer (BIT) model to realize the change detection of remote sensing data of Anhui Natural Reserves in 2018 and 2021. Resnet34-CA is constructed through the combination of Resnet34 and a coordinate attention mechanism to effectively extract high-level semantic features. The BIT module is also used to efficiently enhance the original semantic features. Compared with the overall accuracy of the existing deep learning-based CD methods, that of CA-BIT is 98.34% on the natural protected area CD datasets and 99.05% on LEVIR_CD. Our method can effectively satisfy the need of CD of different land categories such as construction land, farmland, and forest land.

TI  - Multi-Scale and Multi-Stream Fusion Network for Pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening refers to the use of a panchromatic image to improve the spatial resolution of a multi-spectral image while preserving spectral signatures. However, existing pansharpening methods are still unsatisfactory at balancing the trade-off between spatial enhancement and spectral fidelity. In this paper, a multi-scale and multi-stream fusion network (named MMFN) that leverages the multi-scale information of the source images is proposed. The proposed architecture is simple, yet effective, and can fully extract various spatial/spectral features at different levels. A multi-stage reconstruction loss was adopted to recover the pansharpened images in each multi-stream fusion block, which facilitates and stabilizes the training process. The qualitative and quantitative assessment on three real remote sensing datasets (i.e., QuickBird, Pleiades, and WorldView-2) demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Design of Integrated Cloud Detection Optical System from Visible to Terahertz Bands
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Clouds cover more than 60% of the Earth ' s surface and are an important factor in the Earth's radiation budget. However, the spatial and temporal distribution and microphysical parameters of clouds are complex and changeable, and the quantification is complicated. Uncertainties in cloud formation, interactions between cloud and radiation, and cloud parameters pose great challenges to the accuracy of general circulation models. Sensors in the visible and infrared spectral ranges have been developed earlier, and the technology is relatively mature. However, since the scale range of ice cloud particles is large, and the corresponding instrument has a short detection wavelength and is sensitive to small ice cloud particles or thin cirrus clouds, it cannot effectively detect ice clouds of large particles with a large scale range. Terahertz (THz) wavelength is close to the particle size of typical ice clouds, and THz wave has strong interactions, which can be used as an effective supplement to visible and infrared sensors, but the ability of THz wave to detect water clouds is insufficient due to the absorption of water vapor. Aiming at the insufficient coverage of cloud particle detection by existing satellite-borne remote-sensing instruments, this paper proposes an optical system design scheme suitable for multi- channel cloud detection spectral imagers with a wide spectrum from visible to THz bands, which can achieve more comprehensive cloud information detection. Moreover, the integrated observation can also provide more sufficient and convenient observation data for the simultaneous retrieval of cloud information in the visible, infrared, and THz bands.Methods According to the requirements of cloud parameter retrieval, the system channels are set. A total of 10 detection channels are selected, including four visible/near-infrared (VNIR) channels, two short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels, three thermal infrared (TIR) channels, and one THz channel. According to the orbit height (450 km) and pixel size of the detector, the focal length of the system is determined. Through the evaluation of the signal-to-noise ratio, the system aperture is determined. The aperture of the THz band is set as 150 mm, and F number is 3. For visible and infrared bands, the aperture is 42 mm and 68 mm, respectively, and F number is 2. The optical system adopts an off-axis catadioptric structure. In order to separate the THz band from visible and infrared bands, a method of split- field of view is developed. The THz wave is directly imaged by the off-axis three-mirror system, and the visible and infrared bands are imaged again by the rear optical path. The aperture of visible and infrared bands is separately set to solve the problem caused by the large aperture difference relate to the THz band. Finally, tolerance analysis of each subsystem is carried out step by step according to the degree of optical path overlap.Results and Discussions The imager operates in a push- broom imaging mode to acquire 10 channels ' spectrum information from visible to THz bands. The swath width is 100 km corresponding to the orbit of 450 km, and the nadir spatial resolution of THz, visible, and infrared bands are 10 km, 75 m, and 100 m, respectively (Table 1). The main optical system adopts a non-re- imaging three-mirror off-axis anastigmat structure [ Fig. 2(a)], the root-mean-square radius of point spot of visible and infrared bands is less than 2 mu m [Fig. 2( b)], and that of the THz band is less than 7 mu m [Fig. 2 (c)], which is much smaller than the pixel size. The rear optical path of the VNIR part adopts the off-axis three-mirror structure again [Fig. 3(a)]. The rear optical path of the SWIR adopts a five-piece transmission type [Fig. 4( a)], which is made of silicon or broadband ZnS. The rear optical path of the TIR adopts two materials, namely, germanium and ZnSe, with a total of four lenses [Fig. 5(a)]. The design results show that the modulation transfer function (MTF) of each subsystem is close to the diffraction limit, the spot diagrams are all smaller than the Airy disk, and the image quality is excellent. Finally, all the sub-optical systems are assembled, and the optical paths are folded (Fig. 6). The total length of the entire system is less than 800 mm, and the volume is relatively compact. The tolerance analysis shows that the MTF drop of each channel does not exceed 0. 16 at the Nesquit frequency. The tolerance of the entire system is loose, and the allocation is reasonable.Conclusions In this paper, an integrated cloud detection optical system with visible, infrared, and THz wide spectrum bands is designed. The THz band adopts the off-axis three-mirror structure, while VNIR, SWIR, and TIR bands use a secondary imaging structure. The aperture is set separately to realize the multi-channel integrated detection imaging with a large optical aperture difference, and the wide band separation is realized by split-field of view. The structure of the whole system is compact, the imaging quality is good, and the allocation of tolerances is reasonable, which meets the design requirements. The system can verify the development of space-borne THz ice cloud detection technology, and the wide spectrum integrated imaging technology is conducive to the realization of channel registration and remote sensing retrieval and application. In addition to cloud detection, this imaging scheme can also provide a certain reference for other broadband imaging systems.

AB  - This review discusses several research studies that employed comet assay to evaluate the environmental impact of genotoxins in aquatic environments. It focuses on in vivo and in situ studies of aquatic animals. New chemicals are being added each year to the existing burden of toxic substances in the environment. Excessive agricultural and industrial activities adversely affect biodiversity, threatening the survival of species in a particular habitat, as well as posing disease risks to humans. Some of the chemicals, e.g., pesticides and heavy metals, may be genotoxic to the sentinel species and/or to non-target species, causing deleterious effects in somatic or germ cells. Comet assay is a quick, sensitive, and low-cost technique for detecting DNA strand breakage. However, the comet assay has much more to offer than being an assay for testing DNA strand breaks in animal organs. The use of repair enzymes increases the range of DNA lesions that can be detected with the assay. Comparing data from studies that employed different approaches, such as empirical scoring or comet tail lengths, comet assay is one of the challenging techniques to be utilized in environmental studies. The relative amount of DNA in the comet tail indicates DNA break intensity. The assay has been modified to detect various base alterations by including the digestion of nucleoids with a lesion-specific endonuclease. The determination of DNA damage in these indicator species using the comet test would thus offer information on the genotoxic potential of their habitat at an early stage. This would enable intervention techniques to prevent or mitigate adverse health impacts in sentinel animals and humans.

TI  - The Impacts of Quality-Oriented Dataset Labeling on Tree Cover Segmentation Using U-Net: A Case Study in WorldView-3 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has emerged as a prominent technique for extracting vegetation information from high-resolution satellite imagery. However, less attention has been paid to the quality of dataset labeling as compared to research into networks and models, despite data quality consistently having a high impact on final accuracies. In this work, we trained a U-Net model for tree cover segmentation in 30 cm WorldView-3 imagery and assessed the impact of training data quality on segmentation accuracy. We produced two reference tree cover masks of different qualities by labeling images accurately or roughly and trained the model on a combination of both, with varying proportions. Our results show that models trained with accurately delineated masks achieved higher accuracy (88.06%) than models trained on masks that were only roughly delineated (81.13%). When combining the accurately and roughly delineated masks at varying proportions, we found that the segmentation accuracy increased with the proportion of accurately delineated masks. Furthermore, we applied semisupervised active learning techniques to identify an efficient strategy for selecting images for labeling. This showed that semisupervised active learning saved nearly 50% of the labeling cost when applied to accurate masks, while maintaining high accuracy (88.07%). Our study suggests that accurate mask delineation and semisupervised active learning are essential for efficiently generating training datasets in the context of tree cover segmentation from high-resolution satellite imagery.

TI  - A Study on Spatial and Temporal Dynamic Changes of Desertification in Northern China from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is of significant concern as one of the world's most serious ecological and environmental problems. China has made great achievements in afforestation and desertification control in recent years. The climate varies greatly across northern China. Using a long-time series of remote sensing data to study the effects of desertification will further the understanding of China's desertification control engineering and climate change mechanisms. The moist index was employed in this research to determine the climate type and delineate the potential occurrence range of desertification in China. Then, based on the Google Earth Engine platform, MODIS data were used to construct various desertification monitoring indicators and applied to four machine learning models. By comparing different combinations of indicators and machine learning models, it was concluded that the random forest model with four indicator combinations had the highest accuracy of 86.94% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.84. Therefore, the random forest model with four indicator combinations was used to monitor desertification in the study area from 2000 to 2020. According to our studies, the area of desertification decreased by more than 237,844 km(2) between 2000 and 2020 due to the impact of human activities and in addition to climatic factors such as the important role of precipitation. This research gives a database for the cause and control of desertification as well as a reference for national-scale desertification monitoring.

TI  - Long-term and seasonal variation of open-surface water bodies in the Yellow River Basin during 1990-2020
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Open-surface water bodies are essential terrestrial water sources and ecosystem service providers, and their evaluation is necessary for effective water management. In this study, 36 000 Landsat images of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) were collected, and a multiple index (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index, i.e. MNDWI, NDVI and EVI) method was used to identify open-surface water bodies in the flood and dry seasons during 1990-2020. Our results showed that during these 30 years, YRB surface waters were characterized by spatial and seasonal heterogeneities. The open-surface water coverage in the upper and middle reaches of the YRB was 8.74 parts per thousand and 4.24 parts per thousand, respectively, less than the average coverage in the whole YRB of 9.45 parts per thousand. Surface water area was significant larger in flood seasons than in dry seasons, while during 1990-2020, the surface water area increased by 27.5% in the flood season and by 58.9% in the dry season, reaching 7239.2 km(2) (flood season) and 6654.8 km(2) (dry season) in 2020. Meanwhile the seasonal variation has decreased. Climate factors (winter temperature and summer precipitation) positively correlated with open-surface water only in the source region of the YRB. In other regions, anthropic factors (e.g. water conservation projects) strongly affected open-surface water bodies by increasing their spatial area overall and decreasing seasonal differences in their coverage.

TI  - Forest Emissions Reduction Assessment Using Optical Satellite Imagery and Space LiDAR Fusion for Carbon Stock Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests offer significant climate mitigation benefits, but existing emissions reduction assessment methodologies in forest-based mitigation activities are not scalable, which limits the development of carbon offset markets. In this study, we propose a measurement method using optical satellite imagery and space LiDAR data fusion to assess forest emissions reduction. Compared with the ALS-based carbon stock density estimation method, our approach presented a strong scalability for mapping 10 m-resolution carbon stock at a large scale. It was observed that dense canopy top height estimated by combining GEDI and Sentinel-2 could accurately predict forest carbon stock measurements estimated by the ALS-based method (R2 = 0.72). By conducting an on-site experiment of an ongoing forest carbon project in China, we found the consistency between the emissions reduction assessed by the data fusion measurement method (589,169 tCO2e) and the official ex post-monitored emissions reduction in the monitoring report (598,442 tCO2e). Our results demonstrated that forest carton stock estimation using optical satellite imagery and space LiDAR data fusion is efficient and economical for forest emissions reduction assessment. The acquisition of the data was more efficient over large areas with high frequencies using space-based technology. We further discussed the challenge of building a near-real-time monitoring system for forest-based mitigation activities by utilizing optical satellite imagery and space LiDAR data and pointed out that a quality control framework should be established to help us understand the sources of uncertainty in LiDAR-based models and improve carbon stock estimation from individual trees to forest carbon projects to meet the requirements of carbon standards better.

TI  - Impacts of National Highway G214 on Vegetation in the Source Area of Yellow and Yangtze Rivers on the Southern Qinghai Plateau, West China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Engineering corridors on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have substantially modified the regional ecosystem functions and environment, resulting in changes in the alpine ecosystem. In addition, the building and operation of these engineering corridors have led to rapid permafrost degradation, which in turn has impacted local vegetation along these corridors. This study investigated vegetation changes and their driving factors by the methods of coefficient of variation, correlation analysis, and GeoDetector in a 30 km wide buffer zone at each side along the National Highway G214 (G214) at the northern and southern flanks of the Bayan Har Mountains in part of the source area of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers on the southern Qinghai Plateau, West China. The following results were obtained: (1) The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in Growing Season (NDVIgs) rose slightly in 2010-2019, with an average annual change rate of 0.006/a. Patterns of NDVIgs along the G214 exhibited "low at the northern flank and high at the southern flank of the Bayan Har Mountains". (2) Spatially, average NDVIgs increased from the first buffer zone at the distance of 0-10 km from the highway centerline to the second buffer zone at 20-30 km perpendicularly away from the G214. Furthermore, the first buffer zone had the lowest coefficient of variation, possibly due to a low vegetation recovery as a result of the greatest influence of the G214 on NDVIgs at 0-10 km. (3) Furthermore, annual precipitation (AP) was the dominant factor for significantly (p < 0.01) and positively influencing the variations in NDVIgs (R = 0.75, p < 0.01). Additionally, NDVIgs was more strongly influenced by the two combined factors than any single one, with the highest q-value (0.74) for the interactive influences of AP and annual average air temperature (AAAT) and followed by that of the AP and mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the depth of zero annual amplitude (15 m). Evidently, the construction and operation of the G214 have directly and indirectly affected vegetation through changing environmental variables, with significant impacts on NDVIgs extended at least 20 km outwards from the highway. This study helps better understand the environmental impacts along the engineering corridors in elevational permafrost regions at mid and low latitudes and their management.

TI  - Modeling Historical and Future Forest Fires in South Korea: The FLAM Optimization Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change-induced heat waves increase the global risk of forest fires, intensifying biomass burning and accelerating climate change in a vicious cycle. This presents a challenge to the response system in heavily forested South Korea, increasing the risk of more frequent and large-scale fire outbreaks. This study aims to optimize IIASA's wildFire cLimate impacts and Adaptation Model (FLAM)-a processed-based model integrating biophysical and human impacts-to South Korea for projecting the pattern and scale of future forest fires. The developments performed in this study include: (1) the optimization of probability algorithms in FLAM based on the national GIS data downscaled to 1 km(2) with additional factors introduced for national specific modeling; (2) the improvement of soil moisture computation by adjusting the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) to represent vegetation feedbacks by fitting soil moisture to daily remote sensing data; and (3) projection of future forest fire frequency and burned area. Our results show that optimization has considerably improved the modeling of seasonal patterns of forest fire frequency. Pearson's correlation coefficient between monthly predictions and observations from national statistics over 2016-2022 was improved from 0.171 in the non-optimized to 0.893 in the optimized FLAM. These findings imply that FLAM's main algorithms for interpreting biophysical and human impacts on forest fire at a global scale are only applicable to South Korea after the optimization of all modules, and climate change is the main driver of the recent increases in forest fires. Projections for forest fire were produced for four periods until 2100 based on the forest management plan, which included three management scenarios (current, ideal, and overprotection). Ideal management led to a reduction of 60-70% of both fire frequency and burned area compared to the overprotection scenario. This study should be followed by research for developing adaptation strategies corresponding to the projected risks of future forest fires.

TI  - Blue dye single labelling for colorimetric sentinel lymph node mapping in early endometrial cancer: A feasibility study.
T2  - Medical journal, Armed Forces India
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Surgical staging in endometrial cancer includes a systematic lymphadenectomy with significant morbidity, although its therapeutic role is unclear. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) study is a less morbid alternative to identify nodes most likely to be metastatic, permitting selective removal and thus reducing morbidity without compromising oncological safety. This study was done using blue dye single labelling to study the feasibility and utility in identifying SLN in early disease.Methods: Twenty-two patients of early-stage low-risk disease during surgical staging underwent cervical injection of methylene blue, SLN mapping, and sampling as per the standard algorithm, followed by a systematic lymphadenectomy in all cases. SLN were submitted separately for ultrastaging (US).Results: Twenty patients underwent the procedure, and SLN could be identified in 18 patients with an overall mapping rate of 90% with a bilateral mapping rate of 70%, and a negative mapping rate of 10%. 57 SLN were identified along with two suspicious non-sentinel nodes and 11 were metastatic on US with a sensitivity of 66.7% and NPV of 87.5%. All patients with metastatic nodes, however, could be identified by applying the standard SLN algorithm for sampling.Conclusion: SLN mapping algorithm with blue dye single labelling in early endometrial cancer, by identifying LN most likely to be metastatic enabling their selective removal may help avoid routine lymphadenectomies without compromising oncological safety. The procedure is simple and can be practiced at all centres and can also aid pathologists by pinpointing the likely metastatic nodes after a selective or complete lymphadenectomy.

TI  - A Drop-in Gamma Probe for Minimally Invasive Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer Preclinical Evaluation and Interim Results From a Multicenter Clinical Trial
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study evaluated the performance of a drop-in gamma probe for prostate cancer (PCa) sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in a pelvic phantom, porcine model, and in PCa patients as part of an ongoing prospective multicenter clinical trial.MethodsTwo design variants of the drop-in gamma probe (SENSEI; Lightpoint Medical Ltd) were assessed in the pelvic phantom, and the preferred design was evaluated in a porcine model with clinically representative volumes and Tc-99m activities. In the clinical trial, radical prostatectomy, SLND, and extended pelvic lymph node dissection were performed the day after Tc-99m-nanocolloid injection and imaging. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were detected with the drop-in probe and a rigid laparoscopic gamma probe (RLGP). An interim analysis was performed after 10 patients were recruited.ResultsThe narrow field of view probe design outperformed the wide field of view design in the pelvic phantom (detection rate, 100% vs 50%). In the porcine model, all activity concentrations could be successfully detected. The drop-in gamma probe successfully detected SLNs in all 10 patients (detection rate, 100%). Two of the SLNs identified by the drop-in gamma probe could not be found with the RLGP. No false-negative cases and no adverse events related to the SLND procedure or the drop-in gamma probe occurred.ConclusionThe drop-in gamma probe meets the usability and performance requirements for SLND in PCa and provides performance advantages over the RLGP. The final clinical study results will confirm the performance of the technique across multiple sites.

TI  - Automated delineation of salt-affected lands and their progress in coastal India using Google Earth Engine and machine learning techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of salt-affected land (SAL) is still a major challenging task worldwide, especially in developing nations. The advancement of remotely sensed digital satellite images of different spectral bands has enabled the assessment of soil salinity. Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 and 5 images of 2020, 2015 and 2009 and Shuttle Radar Topographical Mission data of 2014 were obtained from the Google Earth Engine data catalogue. Twenty spectral indices have been used which include four vegetation indices, twelve soil salinity indices, four topographical characteristics and their spectral bands. The Random Forest model was used to detect SAL. A total of 593 soil samples were used in the model. Of the electrical conductivity values of samples collected in the field, 70% of the soil samples were used for the model training, and the remaining 30% were used for validation. Also, fivefold cross-validation was carried out to validate the model prediction. The predicted SAL extent identified during 2020 was 134.4 sq. km with an overall accuracy of 93% using fivefold cross-validation. In 2015 and 2009, the total SAL was 128.42 and 120.41 sq. km, respectively. The total SAL has increased by 11.6% during the study period. The present study demonstrated the strength of remote sensing techniques to assess the SAL, which will help quantify the unproductive lands at the state or national level for reclamation or other productive use.

TI  - Determination of parameters for watershed delineation using various satellite derived digital elevation models and its accuracy
T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is an inevitable tool for many applications, such as natural resource management. At present scenario, it is available with various resolutions from meter to sub-meter accuracy. These data are used extensively to explore the river basin's physical features by detecting and extracting watershed boundaries, elevation points, drainage networks, flow directions, and morphological parameters. Although many researchers have used DEMs to delineate the watershed boundaries of the river basin, accuracy makes the significant distinction and usage of various DEMs. In this study, the accuracy of watershed delineation derived from various open-source DEMs such as Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Cartosat-1, and ALOS Palsar, in the vaigai river basin have been observed. The Arc SWAT hydrological modeling tool was used to delineate the watershed boundary using the DEMs mentioned above. Eventually, the outcome is validated with the help of base data received from TN-PWD (Tamilnadu Public Work Department). The results attained from the extraction of watershed boundary from various DEMs reveals that the watershed boundary delineated from ALOS - Palsar is closely matching with actual boundary of vaigai river basin. The regression analysis of the watershed on area and perimeter obtained from the ALOS Palsar DEM yielded R2 as 0.97 and 0.99. This R2 exhibits the close fitness of the predicted value with data obtained from TN-PWD data. The ALOS Palsar DEM provided low vertical errors and high vertical accuracy compared to other DEMs. Overall the ALOS Palsar DEM generated outcome exhibited comparatively better results than the rest of the DEMs.

TI  - Prediction of the flooding area of the northeastern Caspian Sea from satellite images
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the dynamic changes in the coastline of the northeastern Caspian Sea is significant since the level of the Caspian is unstable, and the coastline change can cause enormous damage to the ecology, economy, and population of the coastal part of Kazakhstan. In this work, we use remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies to study the changes in the coastline of the northeastern Caspian Sea and predict the extent of flooding with increasing water levels. The proposed methodology for creating dynamic maps can be used to monitor the coastline and forecast the extent of flooding in the area. As a result of this work, the main factors affecting changes in the coastline were identified. After analyzing the water level data from 1988 to 2019, it was revealed that the rise in water level was observed from 1980 to 1995. The maximum sea level rise was recorded at -26.04 m. After that, the sea level began to fall, and between 1996 and 2009, there were no significant changes; the water level fluctuated with an average of -27.18 m. Then, a map of the water level dynamics in the Caspian Sea from 1988 to 2019 was compiled. According to the dynamics map, water level rise and significant coastal retreat were revealed, especially in the northern part of the Caspian Sea and the northern and southern parts of Sora Kaydak. The method for predicting the estimated flooding area was described. As a result, based on a single map, the flooding area of the northeast coast was predicted. A comparative analysis of Landsat and SRTM data is presented.(c) 2022 Editorial office of Geodesy and Geodynamics. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co. Ltd.

This study investigated the use of remote sensing data and land surface phenology (LSP) parameters to evaluate the impacts of fire. The LSP parameters included the start of growing season (SOS), the length of the growing season (LOS), the end of the growing season (EOS), maximum greenness of the season (Gmax), and minimum greenery in the season (Gmin) in the fire-impacted, semiarid oak forests of Iran. These LSP parameters were extracted from multitemporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) data, acquired from MODIS sensor images in Zagros of the Ilam province in western Iran. By extracting LSP indices from the NDVI and EVI2 data, the indices were compared between burned forest areas, areas surrounding the burned forests, and unburned areas and for timesteps representing pre-fire, fire (i.e., year of fire), and post-fire (i.e., 2 years) conditions. It was found that for the burned area, there were significant differences in Gmax and the day that Gmax occurred. Furthermore, there was also a significant difference in Gmin between the pre- and post-fire conditions when NDVI was used and a significant difference between Gmax when EVI2 was used. The results also showed that in both time series there was a significant difference between the burned and control area in terms of Gmax. In general, the results showed that the fire had a negative effect on LSP, but in the two years after the fire, there were signs of forest restoration. This study provides necessary information to inform forest and resource conservation and restoration programs.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Yield Estimation of Winter Wheat Using Vegetation and Soil Indices in Jalilabad, Azerbaijan
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerns about the expanding human population's adequate supply of food draw attention to the field of Food Security. Future-focused analysis and processing of agricultural data not only improve planning capabilities in this field but also enables the required precautions to be taken beforehand. However, given the breadth and number of these regions, field research would be an expensive and time-consuming endeavour. With the advent of remote sensing and optical sensors, it is now possible to acquire diverse data remotely, quickly, and inexpensively. This study investigated the limitations and capabilities of remote sensing data application in the field of planning Food Security. As a result, Sentinel 2 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data were used to estimate winter wheat yields with a high degree of accuracy (98.03%) using the Mamatkulov technique and the MEDALUS model, which was both free and widely available. This method can make it possible to make predictions about the productivity of newly created crop fields or for which we do not have information about the productivity of previous years, without the need to wait for building regression models or any field studies. Considering the outcome, wide-range and larger analyses on this topic can be carried through.

TI  - Annual Mangrove Vegetation Cover Changes (2014-2020) in Indian Sundarbans National Park Using Landsat 8 and Google Earth Engine
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems have high ecological and economic value mainly because of their ability to sequester large amounts of carbon and protect shorelines. Monitoring such ecosystems with earth observation data analytics is necessary to achieve deeper insight and subsequent conservation strategies. The Sundarbans is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest, and Sundarbans National Park is a part of this world-famous mangrove forest in India. To examine vegetation change in this region, we used a planetary-scale tool, the Google Earth Engine. A time series of the surface reflectance product of Landsat 8 between 2014 and 2020 was analysed using annual median images. NDVI and dNDVI were derived to monitor vegetation cover change. While we noticed no major changes in the vegetation cover throughout the study area, the coastal regions, especially the southern end, showed significant changes. There were both mangrove vegetation gains due to land accretion and mangrove loss due to erosion and cyclone damage. This study will be useful for long-term monitoring of the imperiled Sundarbans ecosystem to measure any major changes.

TI  - An Adaptive Method for the Estimation of Snow-Covered Fraction with Error Propagation for Applications from Local to Global Scales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow can cover over 50% of the landmass in the Northern Hemisphere and has been labelled as an Essential Climate Variable by the World Meteorological Organisation. Currently, continental and global snow cover extent is primarily monitored by optical satellite sensors. There are, however, no large-scale demonstrations for methods that (1) use all the spectral information that is measured by the satellite sensor, (2) estimate fractional snow and (3) provide a pixel-wise quantitative uncertainty estimate. This paper proposes a locally adaptive method for estimating the snow-covered fraction (SCF) per pixel from all the spectral reflective bands available at spaceborne sensors. In addition, a comprehensive procedure for root-mean-square error (RMSE) estimation through error propagation is given. The method adapts the SCF estimates for shaded areas from variable solar illumination conditions and accounts for different snow-free and snow-covered surfaces. To test and evaluate the algorithm, SCF maps were generated from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI data covering various mountain regions around the world. Subsequently, the SCF maps were validated with coincidentally acquired very-high-resolution satellite data from WorldView-2/3. This validation revealed a bias of 0.2% and an RMSE of 14.3%. The proposed method was additionally tested with Sentinel-3 SLSTR/OLCI, Suomi NPP VIIRS and Terra MODIS data. The SCF estimations from these satellite data are consistent (bias less than 2.2% SCF) despite their different spatial resolutions.

TI  - A Decolonial Perspective on the Practice of Unveiling Tombstones in Pentecostal and Charismatic Churches in South Africa
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tombstone, the practice of demarcating a grave and unveiling it in some instances, has been common since ancient times. The practice is related to marking the grave in order to remember its geographical location, and subsequently for future generations to identify with it. This practice is very common in a South African context, especially in African traditional religion (ATR). In addition, they would have other ceremonies to revisit the grave and/or the tombstone of their loved one as a way of remembering them. However, some Pentecostal and Charismatic churches prohibit this practice as ancestral worship. This article argues that the erection and unveiling of tombstones does not necessarily need to be understood as ancestral worship. A distinction needs to be made between ancestral worship and ancestral commemoration in an African context. The conclusion is that when the practice of unveiling tombstones is carried out as a way of remembering and showing respect to our ancestors, but not worshiping and revering them, this practice should be supported by Christians from Pentecostal and Charismatic churches as well. There is therefore a need, from a decolonial perspective, to use the missional hermeneutics of discernment and naked truth to provide a proper biblical and acceptable Christian practice of the unveiling of the tombstone in the South African context.

TI  - Subarctic Vegetation under the Mixed Warming and Air Pollution Influence
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Siberian Arctic, worldwide largest forest mortality was caused by chronical (since the 1940s) influence of SO2 emissions on the larch-dominant communities. We hypothesized that warming might mitigate SO2 influence by increasing trees' vigor and growth. We studied trees (larch, Larix sibirica; spruce, Picea obovate; birch, Betula pendula) and bushes (willow, Salix sp., alder, Duschekia fruticosa) growth dependence on SO2, air temperature, soil temperature and moisture, and precipitation. We sampled woods in severely damaged larch and moderately damaged mixed larch, spruce and birch forests. We generated tree ring chronologies and growth indices (GI). We used Terra/MODIS satellite data for mapping trends of vegetation (NDVI) and productivity (GPP, NPP) indexes. In the larch forest, we found a strong decrease in GI and tree mortality, which lasted until the end of 1990s. In the mixed forest, larch and birch were more resistant to SO2 influence compared to spruce. SO2, air and soil temperatures were mediators of all woody species growth. Winter precipitation stimulated trees growth by mitigating spring water stress. Warming onset in the 2000s led to a pronounced increase of all woody species growth. June-July air and soil temperatures, together with a moderate decrease in SO2 emissions, were the primary drivers of that phenomenon. Increasing trends of GPP, NPP, and NDVI were observed within the large part of earlier damaged forests, which was attributed to trees GI increase together with the expansion of SO2-resistant grasses and bushes.

TI  - A Spatial and Temporal Correlation between Remotely Sensing Evapotranspiration with Land Use and Land Cover
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, remote sensing technology has enabled researchers to fill the existing statistics and research gaps on evapotranspiration in different land use classes. Thus, a remotely sensed-based approach was employed to investigate how evapotranspiration rates changed in different land use/cover classes across the Lake Urmia Basin from 2016 to 2020. This was accomplished by applying the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and the maximum likelihood algorithm. Results showed that from 2016 to 2020, grassland, savanna, and wetland decreased by 1%, 0.58%, and 1%, respectively, whereas an increase of 0.4%, 0.4%, 2.5%, and 1.2% occurred in cropland, urban, shrubland, and water bodies, respectively. Based on the model's results, over 98, 63, 90, 93, and 91% of the studied area, respectively, experienced a value of evapotranspiration between 0-6, 3-8, 0-4, 0-4, and 0-6 mm from 2016 to 2020. It was also found that these values are more closely related to water bodies and wetlands, followed by cropland, urban areas, savanna, non-vegetated, grassland, and shrubland. A strong correlation with R-2 > 70% was observed between the SEBS and the ground-measured values, while this value is lower than 50% for the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16A2). The findings suggest that evapotranspiration and land use/cover can be extracted on a large-scale using SEBS and satellite images; thus, their maps can be presented in an accurate manner.

TI  - Tracing Archaeological Places via the Context of Paleo Geomorphic Footprints Using SAR/InSAR Data Fusion: A Case on Southern Mesopotamia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the deployment of EO resources into orbit, archaeological surveys have made extensive use of space imaging. In particular, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data have often proved useful in many geomorphic investigations. In this study, we tested the potential of SAR/InSAR datasets for archaeological applications, which were conducted for southern Mesopotamia. While identifying the embedded human settlements, we attempted to reconstruct the paleoclimatic conditions and the paleotopography imprinted onto contemporary geography as key features of the environmental context of ancient human activity. First, Sentinel-1 and PALSAR-2 SAR/InSAR time-series data were compiled and used to identify the paleoshoreline and other ancient hydrologic backgrounds in southern Mesopotamia. We defined regions of interest (ROI) based on this and further used a rotational decomposition of the time-series signature to detect shallow subsurface features in predefined ROI. SAR/InSAR data processing identified ancient channels and shorelines that match the historical/archaeological records of key Sumerian cities. Our findings in Eridu and Larsa-Uruk-Umma, as well as their hydrological contexts, are archaeologically significant and suggest the need for more ground surveys. In terms of global coverage and resolving power, this study shows that the potential of SAR/InSAR for probing the background environment of ancient civilizations is comparable to high-resolution commercial optical imaging. Longer wavelength and higher resolution SAR/InSAR time-series datasets are highly anticipated for such applications.

TI  - Untangling the importance of dynamic and thermodynamic drivers for wet and dry spells across the Tropical Andes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Andean vegetation and agriculture depend on the patterns of rainfall during the South American monsoon. However, our understanding on the importance of dynamic (upper-level wind circulation) as compared to thermodynamic (Amazon basin moisture) drivers for Andes rainfall remains limited. This study examines the effect of these drivers on 3-7 day wet and dry spells across the Tropical Andes and assesses resulting impacts on vegetation. Using reanalysis and remote sensing data from 1985-2018, we find that both dynamic and thermodynamic drivers play a role in determining the rainfall patterns. Notably, we show that the upper-level wind is an important driver of rainfall across the entire Tropical Andes mountain range, but not in the Amazon lowlands, suggesting a crucial role of topography in this relationship. From thermodynamic perspective, we find wet spell conditions to be associated with increased moisture along the Andes' eastern foothills accompanied by a strengthened South American low-level jet, with moisture lifted into the Andes via topography and convection for all considered regions. Our results suggest that while changes in Amazon basin moisture dominate rainfall changes on daily time scales associated with three day spells, upper-level dynamics play a more important role on the synoptic time scale of 5-7 day spells. Considering impacts on the ground, we find that only 5-7 day spells in the semi-arid Andes have a prolonged effect on vegetation. Our study emphasizes the need to consider both dynamic and thermodynamic drivers when estimating rainfall changes in the Tropical Andes, including in the context of future climate projections.

TI  - Effects of outliers on remote sensing-assisted forest biomass estimation: A case study from the United States national forest inventory
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Large-scale ecological sampling networks, such as national forest inventories (NFIs), collect in situ data to support biodiversity monitoring, forest management and planning, and greenhouse gas reporting. Data harmonization aims to link auxiliary remotely sensed data to field-collected data to expand beyond field sampling plots, but outliers that arise in data harmonization-questionable observations because their values differ substantially from the rest-are rarely addressed. In this paper, we review the sources of commonly occurring outliers, including random chance (statistical outliers), definitions and protocols set by sampling networks, and temporal and spatial mismatch between field-collected and remotely sensed data. We illustrate different types of outliers and the effects they have on estimates of above-ground biomass population parameters using a case study of 292 NFI plots paired with airborne laser scanning (ALS) and Sentinel-2 data from Sawyer County, Wisconsin, United States. Depending on the criteria used to identify outliers (sampling year, plot location error, nonresponse, presence of zeros and model residuals), as many as 53 of the 292 Forest Inventory and Analysis plot observations (18%) were identified as potential outliers using a single criterion and 111 plot observations (38%) if all criteria were used. Inclusion or removal of potential outliers led to substantial differences in estimates of mean and standard error of the estimate of biomass per unit area. The simple expansion estimator, which does not rely on ALS or other auxiliary data, was more sensitive to outliers than model-assisted approaches that incorporated ALS and Sentinel-2 data. Including Sentinel-2 predictors showed minimal increases to the precision of our estimates relative to models with ALS predictors alone. Outliers arise from many causes and can be pervasive in data harmonization workflows. Our review and case study serve as a note of caution to researchers and practitioners that the inclusion or removal of potential outliers can have unintended consequences on population parameter estimates. When used to inform large-scale biomass mapping, carbon markets, greenhouse gas reporting and environmental policy, it is necessary to ensure the proper use of NFI and remotely sensed data in geospatial data harmonization.

TI  - Automated Detection of Glacier Surges from Sentinel-1 Surface Velocity Time Series-An Example from Svalbard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though surge-type glaciers make up only a small percentage of all glaciers, related research contributes considerably to the general understanding of glacier flow mechanisms. Recent studies based on remote sensing techniques aimed to disentangle underlying processes related to glacier surges. They have proven the possibilities yielded by combining high performance computing and earth observation. In addition, modelling approaches to surges have seen increasing popularity, yet large spatial and temporal data about timing of surge incites are missing. We aimed to develop an algorithm that not only detects surge type glaciers but also determines the timing of a surge onset, while being computationally inexpensive, transferable, and expandable in time and space. The algorithm is based on time series analyses of glacier surface velocity derived from Sentinel-1 data. After seasonal and trend decomposition, outlier detection is performed by the General Studentized Extreme Deviate Test, an iterative algorithm well suited for outlier detection in univariate time series. To determine surges, cluster analysis is performed to identify outlier clusters, which are linked to glacier surges. We demonstrate the viability on the Svalbard archipelago for the period 2015 to 2021 where we have identified 18 glacier surges and the timing of their active phase.

TI  - CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T Cell NRF2 Signaling Improves Liver Transplantation Outcomes by Modulating T Cell Activation and Differentiation
T2  - ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: Innate and adaptive immune responses regulate hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). While the mechanism of how nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) plays a role in liver IRI has been studied, the contribution of T cell-specific NRF2 in OLT remains unknown. In the current translational study, we investigated whether and how CD4(+) T cell-specific NRF2 signaling affects liver transplant outcomes in mice and humans.Results: In the experimental arm, cold-stored (4 degrees C/18 h) wild-type (WT) mouse livers transplanted to NRF2-deficient (NRF2-knockout [NRF2-KO]) recipients experienced greater hepatocellular damage than those in Nrf2-proficient (WT) counterparts, evidenced by Suzuki's histological scores, frequency of TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)(+) cells, and elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) levels. In vitro studies showed that NRF2 signaling suppressed CD4(+) T cell differentiation to a proinflammatory phenotype (Th1, Th17) while promoting the regulatory (Foxp3(+)) T cell lineage. Furthermore, OLT injury deteriorated in immune-compromised RAG2-KO test recipients repopulated with CD4(+) T cells from NRF2-KO compared with WT donor mice. In the clinical arm of 45 human liver transplant patients, the perioperative increase of NRF2 expression in donor livers negatively regulated innate and adaptive immune activation, resulting in reduced hepatocellular injury in NRF2-proficient OLT.Innovation and Conclusion: CD4(+) T cell population expressing NRF2 attenuated ischemia and reperfusion (IR)-triggered hepatocellular damage in a clinically relevant mouse model of extended donor liver cold storage, followed by OLT, whereas the perioperative increase of NRF2 expression reduced hepatic injury in human liver transplant recipients. Thus, CD4(+) T cell NRF2 may be a novel cytoprotective sentinel against IR stress in OLT recipients.

TI  - Cyanobacteria Index as a Tool for the Satellite Detection of Cyanobacteria Blooms in the Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea have been studied for years due to their toxicity, which negatively affects all biota, along with the influence of these floating colonies on surface fluxes. However, mapping these blooms is still a challenge since their high dynamics, wide coverage, and specific radiometric footprint hinder atmospheric correction and negatively affect the quality of satellite images. In this study, we assessed the use of an alternative approach called the cyanobacteria index (CI), which is based on the reflectance spectral shape and which does not require comprehensive atmospheric correction. We demonstrated a close relationship between the positive CI values, indicating the presence of blooms, and the concentration of phycocyanin, the marker pigment of filamentous cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea. We proved that the CI index could efficiently identify cyanobacteria-dominated blooms where colonies floated near the surface. Therefore, this index represents a valuable complement to the previous monitoring methods, suitable for extreme bloom events. The analysis of a time series of satellite images obtained between 2002 and 2018 using the CI index revealed the elongation of the bloom season, which may have been a consequence of the water temperature remaining within the cyanobacteria's tolerance range for a longer time.

Maps were generated to determine changes in land use classifications between 1986, 1991, 1996, 2000, 2005, 2011, 2015, and 2020. The supervised classification of Landsat 5 and 8 images used the maximum likelihood algorithm. Satellite spatial data on land use downloaded from the United States Geological Survey were validated according to 1477 locations, where our research team categorized land use in the field during 2020. The growth in agricultural crops (+643%) and pasture (+250%) from 1986 to 2020 were detrimental to natural areas, such as the rainforest and savannah. The percentage increase in the agricultural areas between the evaluated years peaked around 1996 and stabilized in 2020 at 40% of the Teles Pires River basin's land area. Land use change patterns were related to political/economic events in Brazil, forest/pasture conversions until 2011, and the change from pasture to crops from 2011 to 2020. There was greater intensity in the changes in the upper Teles Pires River basin toward the south, which expanded northward over time. Sustainable agricultural intensification is needed in such stabilized, frontier areas.

TI  - Cultural basis in the image of the topos of Moscow in the play "The Pilot" by N. N. Sadur
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper examines the image of Moscow in the play "The Pilot" (2009) by the modern playwright N. Sadur. The study reveals how the author represents the image of Moscow in the late period of her creativity. The space of Moscow is found to have different levels in the play. First, Moscow, a direct place of action, is both an actual city and its artistic representation. Second, Moscow serves as the space of the characters' consciousness. Third, Moscow represents the space of the author's consciousness and symbolization. Sadur is seen to deconstruct traditional cultural ideas about Moscow. Moscow is transformed from a holistic space of life in close connection with the cultural and historical memory into an atomic space of unsupported existence, a total substitution and simulation. "The Pilot" recreates the game reality generated by the dream of a living city. The specifics of spatial images allow drawing a conclusion about the image of the world and the author's worldview. According to Sadur, the modern reality is "flawed:" the ties between people existing outside the home are broken. However, the idea is put forward that the main thing for the author is not to declare the inferiority of the modern world but to long for an ideal past and refer to the individual myth created on its basis. Therefore, for Sadur, it is not postmodern deconstruction that comes to the fore but the modernist construction of a new myth about the world.

TI  - '<i>Candidatus</i> Rickettsia andeanae' and Probable Exclusion of <i>Rickettsia parkeri</i> in Ticks from Dogs in a Natural Area of the Pampa Biome in Brazil
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spotted fever illness caused by the tick-borne pathogen Rickettsia parkeri has emerged in the Pampa biome in southern Brazil, where the tick Amblyomma tigrinum is implicated as the main vector. Because domestic dogs are commonly parasitized by A. tigrinum, this canid is also a suitable sentinel for R. parkeri-associated spotted fever. Herein, we investigate rickettsial infection in ticks, domestic dogs and small mammals in a natural reserve of the Pampa biome in southern Brazil. The ticks A. tigrinum, Amblyomma aureolatum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus were collected from dogs. Molecular analyses of ticks did not detect R. parkeri; however, at least 34% (21/61) of the A. tigrinum ticks were infected by the non-pathogenic agent 'Candidatus Rickettsia andeanae'. Serological analyses revealed that only 14% and 3% of 36 dogs and 34 small mammals, respectively, were exposed to rickettsial antigens. These results indicate that the study area is not endemic for R. parkeri rickettsiosis. We tabulated 10 studies that reported rickettsial infection in A. tigrinum populations from South America. There was a strong negative correlation between the infection rates by R. parkeri and 'Candidatus R. andeanae' in A. tigrinum populations. We propose that high infection rates by 'Candidatus R. andeanae' might promote the exclusion of R. parkeri from A. tigrinum populations. The mechanisms for such exclusion are yet to be elucidated.

TI  - Using High-Resolution UAV Imaging to Measure Canopy Height of Diverse Cover Crops and Predict Biomass
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing data has become essential for site-specific farming methods. It is also a powerful tool for monitoring the agroecosystem services offered by integrating cover crops (CC) into crop rotations. This study presents a method to determine the canopy height (CH), defined as the average height of the crop stand surface, including tops and gaps, of heterogeneous and multi-species CC using commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Images captured with red-green-blue cameras mounted on UAVs in two missions varying in ground sample distances were used as input for generating three-dimensional point clouds using the structure-from-motion approach. These point clouds were then compared to manual ground measurements. The results showed that the agreement between the methods was closest when CC presented dense and smooth canopies. However, stands with rough canopies or gaps showed substantial differences between the UAV method and ground measurements. We conclude that the UAV method is substantially more precise and accurate in determining CH than measurements taken with a ruler since the UAV introduces additional dimensions with greatly increased resolution. CH can be a reliable indicator of biomass yield, but no differences between the investigated methods were found, probably due to allometric variations of different CC species. We propose the presented UAV method as a promising tool to include site-specific information on CC in crop production strategies.

TI  - An Ensemble Approach of Feature Selection and Machine Learning Models for Regional Landslide Susceptibility Mapping in the Arid Mountainous Terrain of Southern Peru
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the utility of the ensemble framework of feature selection and machine learning (ML) models for regional landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) in the arid climatic condition of southern Peru. A historical landslide inventory and 24 different landslide influencing factors (LIFs) were prepared using remotely sensed and auxiliary datasets. The LIFs were evaluated using multi-collinearity statistics and their relative importance was measured to select the most discriminative LIFs using the ensemble feature selection method, which was developed using Chi-square, gain ratio, and relief-F methods. We evaluated the performance of ten different ML algorithms (linear discriminant analysis, mixture discriminant analysis, bagged cart, boosted logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forest, rotation forest, and C5.0) using different accuracy statistics (sensitivity, specificity, area under curve (AUC), and overall accuracy (OA)). We used suitable combinations of individual ML models to develop different ensemble ML models and evaluated their performance in LSM. We assessed the impact of LIFs on ML performance. Among all individual ML models, the k-nearest neighbors (sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.82, AUC = 0.86, OA = 78%) and artificial neural network (sensitivity = 0.71, specificity = 0.85, AUC = 0.87, OA = 79%) algorithms showed the best performance using the top five LIFs, while random forest, rotation forest, and C5.0 (sensitivity = 0.76-0.81, specificity = 0.87, AUC = 0.90-0.93, OA = 82-84%) outperformed other models when developed using all twenty-four LIFs. Among ensemble models, the ensemble of k-nearest neighbors and rotation forest, k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural network, and artificial neural network and rotation forest outperformed other models (sensitivity = 0.72-0.73, specificity = 0.83-0.84, AUC = 0.86, OA = 79%) using the top five LIFs. The landslide susceptibility maps derived using these models indicate that similar to 2-3% and similar to 10-12% of the total study area fall within the "very high" and "high" susceptibility. The obtained susceptibility maps can be efficiently used to prioritize landslide mitigation activities.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEXT-GENERATION COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) is crucial for geographical change studies such as vegetation, forestry, agriculture, urbaniza-tion, and other land use/land cover (LU/LC) applications. The RS satellite imagery provides crucial geospatial information for observation and analysis of the entire earth's surface. In the proposed study, Multitemporal and multispectral Landsat satellite imagery is used to feature extraction of LU/LC of the Haridwar region. The pre-processing of used imagery is essential for accurately classify the land cover features using image preprocessing methods (geometric correction, atmospheric correction, and image transform). It helps to classify and change detection of land cover features accurately. After preprocessing of imagery, land cover features are divided into seven feature classes using the region of interest (ROI) tool with google earth image and topographic map. The Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning method used to classify the land cover features of the study area. SVM classifier accurately classifies the imagery of the different years 2017, 2010, 2003, and 1996 with accuracy percentages of 90.00, 82.75, 86.37, and 83.38. The post-classification method is used to detect changes in land cover features. From 1996 to 2017, orchards and vegetation are rapidly decreased by 13,698.36 ha and 1,638.81 ha due to unplanned development in urban and industrial areas of the Haridwar region. The resultant LU/LC change information is important for monitoring and analyzing land cover changes of the study area.

AB  - The zig-zag leafhopper, Maiestas dorsalis (Motschulsky, 1859) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), is a minor pest of rice in Asia. To investigate the fauna of egg parasitoids associated with leafhoppers in rice field, we deployed sentinel egg traps of M. dorsalis on rice seedlings in Fukuoka Prefecture, Kyushu Island, Japan. Females of two fairyflies, Lymaenon aureus (Girault, 1911) and L. litoralis (Haliday, 1833) (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) were reared from the deployed sentinel eggs. This is a new host record for L. aureus. Additionally, new distributional records of both species from Honshu Island are presented.

TI  - Relationship between Crustal Deformation and Thermal Anomalies in the 2022 Ninglang Ms 5.5 Earthquake in China: Clues from InSAR and RST
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 2 January 2022, an earthquake of M-s 5.5 occurred in Ninglang County, Lijiang City, the earthquake-prone area of northwestern Yunnan. Whether this earthquake caused significant deformation and thermal anomalies and whether there is a relationship between them needs further investigation. Currently, multi-source remote sensing technology has become a powerful tool for long-time-series monitoring of earthquakes and active ruptures which mainly focuses on single crustal deformation and thermal anomaly. This study aims to reveal the crustal deformation and thermal anomaly characteristics of the Ninglang earthquake by using both Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Robust Satellite Techniques (RST). First, Sentinel-1A satellite SAR data were selected to obtain the coseismic deformation field based on Differential InSAR (D-InSAR), and the Small Baseline Set InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique was exploited to invert the pre- and post-earthquake displacement sequences. Then, RST was used to extract the thermal anomalies before and after the earthquake by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land Surface Temperature (MODIS LST). The results indicate that the seismic crustal deformation is dominated by subsidence, with 23 thermal anomalies before and after the earthquake. It is speculated that the Yongning Fault in the deformation area is the main seismogenic fault of the Ninglang earthquake, which is dominated by positive fault dip-slip motion. Meanwhile, the seismic fault system composed of NE- and NW-oriented faults is an important factor in the formation of thermal anomalies, which are accompanied by changes in stress at different stages before and after the earthquake. Moreover, the crustal deformation and seismic thermal anomalies are correlated in time and space, and the active rupture activities in the region produce deformation accompanied by changes in thermal radiation. This study provides clues from remote sensing observations for analyzing the Ninglang earthquake and provides a reference for the joint application of InSAR and RST for earthquake monitoring.

TI  - Estimating Fragmentation and Connectivity Patterns of the Temperate Forest in an Avocado-Dominated Landscape to Propose Conservation Strategies
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of avocado cultivation in Michoacan, Mexico, is one of the drivers of deforestation. We assessed the degree of fragmentation and functional connectivity of the remaining temperate forest within the Avocado Belt and prioritized patches that contribute the most to connectivity using a network-based approach and modelling different seed and pollen dispersal scenarios, including two types of patch attributes (size and degree of conservation). As landscape transformation in the region is rapid and ongoing, we updated the land-use and land-cover maps through a supervised classification of Sentinel-2 imagery, improving the reliability of our analyses. Temperate forest is highly fragmented within the region: most patches are small (<30 ha), have a reduced core-area (28%), and irregular shapes. The degree of connectivity is very low (0.06), dropping to 0.019 when the degree of conservation of patches was considered. The top 100 ranked patches of forest that support the connectivity of seeds and pollen have different characteristics (i.e., size and topology) that may be considered for implementing conservation and management strategies. Seed dispersal seems to be more threatened by fragmentation than pollen dispersal, and patches that are important for maintaining seed connectivity are embedded in the denser zone of avocado orchards.

T2  - MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of opinion columns in the Egyptian-state newspaper Al-Ahram during Mohamed Morsi's 2012-13 presidency, this article argues that columnists substantially shifted to critical commentary on government policies and advanced an oppositional political agenda. Seeking to delegitimize the Muslim Brotherhood, the newspaper's columns continued to promote the worldview of the non-Islamist elite that had been privileged under the prerevolutionary regime. Only a small number of columns sided with Morsi and his allies. These findings support the claim that Egypt's established political institutions helped undermine Morsi's electoral legitimacy.

TI  - Challenges in the Complex Management of Neglected Cutaneous Melanomas in the Head and Neck Area: A Single Center Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Familiar controversies in the management of head and neck melanomas are more remarkable in locally advanced cases, and they represent a treatment challenge both surgically and oncologically. In our retrospective study, patients with surgically treated primary malignant melanoma of the head and neck region larger than 3 cm in diameter were included. Five patients met our inclusion criteria. In all cases, wide excision and immediate reconstruction were performed without sentinel lymph node biopsy. The defect on the scalp was covered by a split skin graft, with local flaps chosen for reconstruction on the face on an individual basis. After a 2-6 year follow-up, a good oncological, functional, and esthetic result was achieved. Our results show that in the case of large, locally advanced melanomas, surgical treatment still plays a crucial role that can provide long-term local control and support the effect of systemic treatment.

TI  - Irrigation Timing Retrieval at the Plot Scale Using Surface Soil Moisture Derived from Sentinel Time Series in Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The difficulty of calculating the daily water budget of irrigated fields is often due to the uncertainty surrounding irrigation amounts and timing. The automated detection of irrigation events has the potential to greatly simplify this process, and the combination of high-resolution SAR (Sentinel-1) and optical satellite observations (Sentinel-2) makes the detection of irrigation events feasible through the use of a surface soil moisture (SSM) product. The motivation behind this study is to utilize a large irrigation dataset (collected during the ESA Irrigation + project over five sites in three countries over three years) to analyze the performance of an established algorithm and to test potential improvements. The study's main findings are (1) the scores decrease with SSM observation frequency; (2) scores decrease as irrigation frequency increases, which was supported by better scores in France (more sprinkler irrigation) than in Germany (more localized irrigation); (3) replacing the original SSM model with the force-restore model resulted in an improvement of about 6% in the F-score and narrowed the error on cumulative seasonal irrigation; (4) the Sentinel-1 configuration (incidence angle, trajectory) did not show a significant impact on the retrieval of irrigation, which supposes that the SSM is not affected by these changes. Other aspects did not allow a definitive conclusion on the irrigation retrieval algorithm: (1) the lower scores obtained with small NDVI compared to large NDVI were counter-intuitive but may have been due to the larger number of irrigation events during high vegetation periods; (2) merging different runs and interpolating all SSM data for one run produced comparable F-scores, but the estimated cumulative sum of irrigation was around -20% lower compared to the reference dataset in the best cases.

TI  - Exploring the spatial patterns of soil salinity and organic carbon in agricultural areas of Lesvos Island, Greece, using geoinformation technologies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The salt-affected soils national map of Greece was recently made available within the initiative of the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) of Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO. The present study explores the development of higher resolution soil property maps included in this national scale product adopting a modified version of the FAO methodology and a logistic regression (LR) method based on ground and satellite data. Furthermore, it also investigates the correlation between saline soils and soil organic carbon (SOC) using geospatial analysis methods. The island of Lesvos in Greece has been selected as a case study. A probabilistic model for saline soils in the agricultural land of Lesvos is produced by exploiting geoinformation technologies. As a result, the spatial distribution of saline soils in the croplands of Lesvos was obtained. Indicatively, areas with p > 0.80 for the occurrence of saline soils accounting for similar to 20% of a total area of 169.51 km(2) of the croplands in Lesvos. The Nagelkerke R-2 coefficient showed that the probabilistic model interprets 11.3% of the variance of the dependent variable from the independent factors. The model accuracy was assessed adopting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which showed a reasonable adaptability with area under curve (equal to 0.73). The methodological approach proposed herein can support decision-making on agricultural land protection and planning activities which are key priority today due to environmental instability, food security, and climate change.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Improvement of Aerosol Optical Depth from CHIMERE Simulations Using MODIS Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a supervised machine learning (ML) approach to improve the accuracy of the regional horizontal distribution of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulated by the CHIMERE chemistry transport model over North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD satellite observations. Our method produces daily AOD maps with enhanced precision and full spatial domain coverage, which is particularly relevant for regions with a high aerosol abundance, such as the Sahara Desert, where there is a dramatic lack of ground-based measurements for validating chemistry transport simulations. We use satellite observations and some geophysical variables to train four popular regression models, namely multiple linear regression (MLR), random forests (RF), gradient boosting (XGB), and artificial neural networks (NN). We evaluate their performances against satellite and independent ground-based AOD observations. The results indicate that all models perform similarly, with RF exhibiting fewer spatial artifacts. While the regression slightly overcorrects extreme AODs, it remarkably reduces biases and absolute errors and significantly improves linear correlations with respect to the independent observations. We analyze a case study to illustrate the importance of the geophysical input variables and demonstrate the regional significance of some of them.

TI  - Monitoring of Paddy and Maize Fields Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data and NGB Images: A Case Study in Papua, Indonesia
T2  - PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses the question of how to evaluate the growth stage of food crops, for instance, paddy (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays), from two different sensors in selected developed areas of Papua Province of Indonesia. Level-1 Ground Range Detected (L1 GRD) images from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were used to investigate the growth of paddy and maize crops. An NGB camera was then used to obtain the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and the Enhanced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI) as in situ measurement. Afterwards, the results were analyzed based on the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and the Vertical-Vertical (VV) and Vertical Horizontal (VH) band backscatters at incidence angles of 30.55(degrees)-45.88(degrees), and 30.59(degrees)-46.16(degrees) in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The findings showed that Sigma0_VV_db and sigma0_VH_db had a strong correlation (R-2 above 0.900); however, polarization modification is required, specifically in the maize field. The RVI calculated and backscatter changes in this study were comparable to the in situ measurements, specifically those of paddy fields, in 2022. Even though the results of this study were not able to prove the RVI values from the two relative orbits (orbit31 and orbit155) due to the different angle incidences and the availability of the Sentinel-1 SAR data set over the study area, the division of SAR image data based on each relative orbit adequately represents the development of crops in our study areas. The significance of this study is expected to support food crop security and the implementation of development plans that contribute to the local government's goals and settings.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations in remote sensing phenology of vegetation and its responses to temperature change of boreal forest in tundra-taiga transitional zone in the Eastern Siberia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is an important indicator of climate change. Studying spatiotemporal variations in remote sensing phenology of vegetation can provide a basis for further analysis of global climate change. Based on time series data of MODIS-NDVI from 2000 to 2017, we extracted and analyzed four remote sensing phenological parameters of vegetation, including the Start of Season (SOS), the End of Season (EOS), the Middle of Season (MOS) and the Length of Season (LOS), in tundra-taiga transitional zone in the East Siberia, using asymmetric Gaussian function and dynamic threshold methods. Meanwhile, we analyzed the responses of the four phenological parameters to the temperature change based on the temperature change data from Climate Research Unit (CRU). The results show that: in regions south of 64 degrees N, with the rise of temperature in April and May, the SOS in the corresponding area was 5-15 days ahead of schedule; in the area between 64 degrees N and 72 degrees N, with the rise of temperature in May and June, the SOS in the corresponding area was 10-25 days ahead of schedule; in the northernmost of the study area on the coast of the Arctic Ocean, with the drop of temperature in May and June, the SOS in the corresponding area was 15-25 days behind schedule; in the northwest of the study area in August and the southwest in September, with the drop of temperature, the EOS in the corresponding areas was 15-30 days ahead of schedule; in regions south of 67 degrees N, with the rise of temperature in September and October, the EOS in the corresponding area was 5-30 days behind schedule; the change of the EOS in autumn was more sensitive to the change of the SOS in spring, because the smaller temperature fluctuation can cause the larger change of the EOS; the growth season of vegetation in the study area was generally moving forward, and the LOS in the northwest was shortened, while the LOS in the middle and south of the study area was prolonged.

TI  - Cross Comparison Between Landsat New Land Surface Temperature Product and the Corresponding MODIS Product
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 Surface Temperature (LC2L2ST) was formally released in December 2020 by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS). However, there are few reports on this new land surface temperature (LST) product. As this product will be the only LST data provided by the USGS starting in 2022, it is necessary to evaluate the product timely. Among various satellite LST products, the quality of the MODIS LST product is well recognized, and widely used. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, performed a cross-comparison between the new Landsat LST product and the MODIS LST product to examine the quality of the new product. Different regions in China (Fuzhou, Taihu, Yinchuan and Dunhuang) were selected as the test areas, and 20 pairs of LC2L2ST and MODIS LST synchronous images were used for the comparison. The images cover different land types, such as vegetation, water, town and deserts across different seasons. A total of 560 homogeneous regions of interest (ROI) were selected from the images of the test areas. The regression analysis was carried out to examine the fit of the ROIs and the quantitative relationship between the two LST products. The conversion model between them was also developed. The results showed that the new LC2L2ST product is highly correlated with the MODIS LST product. Each of the four test areas can achieve a coefficient of determination (R-2) greater than 0. 98. Integrating the 560 samples from the four test areas also obtain an R-2 close to 0. 98. Nevertheless, differences between the two products have also been founded. The LC2L2ST is 0. 90 degrees C averagely higher than the MODIS LST (RMSE = 2. 29 degrees C). However, LC2L2ST can be slightly lower than MODIS LST in late fall and winter seasons but significantly higher than extremely hot summer seasons with a bias close to 7 degrees C. The analysis revealed that the differences were related to spatial resolution, sensor viewing angles, land cover types and seasons. In general, the new LC2L2ST product strongly correlates with the MODIS LST, but significant differences were also observed in the summer months. Therefore, the new Landsat LST product must be further tested with in-situ measured LST data. Due to the differences in this paper, the two LST data products need to be converted when they must be collaboratively used. This study developed the conversion equation between the two LSTs based on the 560 ROIs. The verification found that the differences between the two data after conversion were greatly reduced. It is conducive to the cooperative use of the two LST data and providing continuous remote sensing data for long-term LST monitoring.

TI  - Evaluation of the High-Resolution MuSyQ LAI Product over Heterogeneous Land Surfaces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the retrieval and validation of remotely-sensed leaf area index (LAI) products over complex land surfaces have received much attention due to the high-precision land surface model simulations and applications in global climate change. However, most of these related researches mainly focus on coarse resolution products. This is because few products have been specifically designed for solving the problems derived from complex land surfaces in mountain areas until now. MuSyQ LAI is a new product derived from Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite data. This product is characterized with a temporal resolution of 10 days and a spatial resolution of 16 m. As is well known, high-resolution products have less uncertainties because of the homogeneities of sub-pixel. Therefore, to evaluate the precision and uncertainty of MuSyQ LAI, an up-scaling strategy was employed here to validate MuSyQ LAI for three mountain regions in Southwest China. The validation strategy can be divided into three parts. First, a regression model was built by in situ LAI measured by LAI-2200 and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images to obtain a 0.5 m resolution LAI map. Second, an up-scaled LAI map with a spatial resolution consistent with MuSyQ LAI was calculated by the pixel-averaging method from the UAV-based LAI map. Third, the MuSyQ LAI was validated by the up-scaled UAV-based LAI in pixel scale. Simultaneously, the sources of uncertainty were analyzed and compared from the view of data source, retrieval model, and scale effects. The results suggested that MuSyQ LAI in the study areas are significantly underestimated by 53.69% due to the complex terrain and heterogeneous land cover. There are three main reasons for the underestimation. The differences between GF-1 reflectance and UAV-based reflectance employed to estimate LAI are the largest factors for the validation results, even accounting for 61.47% of the total bias. Subsequently, the scale effects led to about 28.44% bias. Last but not least, the models employed to retrieve LAI contributed merely 10.09% uncertainties to the total bias. In conclusion, the accuracy of MuSyQ LAI still has a large space to be improved from the view of reflectance over complex terrain. This study is quite important for applications of MuSyQ LAI products and also provides a reference for the improvement and application of other high-resolution remotely sensed LAI products.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image of The Landsat 8-9 Compressive Sensing via Non-Local Low-Rank Regularization with the Laplace Function
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilizing low-rank prior data in compressed sensing (CS) schemes for Landsat 8-9 remote sensing images (RSIs) has recently received widespread attention. Nevertheless, most CS algorithms focus on the sparsity of an RSI and ignore its low-rank (LR) nature. Therefore, this paper proposes a new CS reconstruction algorithm for Landsat 8-9 remote sensing images based on a non-local optimization framework (NLOF) that is combined with non-convex Laplace functions (NCLF) used for the low-rank approximation (LAA). Since the developed algorithm is based on an approximate low-rank model of the Laplace function, it can adaptively assign different weights to different singular values. Moreover, exploiting the structural sparsity (SS) and low-rank (LR) between the image patches enables the restored image to obtain better CS reconstruction results of Landsat 8-9 RSI than the existing models. For the proposed scheme, first, a CS reconstruction model is proposed using the non-local low-rank regularization (NLLRR) and variational framework. Then, the image patch grouping and Laplace function are used as regularization/penalty terms to constrain the CS reconstruction model. Finally, to effectively solve the rank minimization problem, the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) is used to solve the model. Extensive numerical experimental results demonstrate that the non-local variational framework (NLVF) combined with the low-rank approximate regularization (LRAR) method of non-convex Laplace function (NCLF) can obtain better reconstruction results than the more advanced image CS reconstruction algorithms. At the same time, the model preserves the details of Landsat 8-9 RSIs and the boundaries of the transition areas.

TI  - Flood risk assessment by using an interpretative structural modeling based Bayesian network approach (ISM-BN): An urban-level analysis of Shenzhen, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasingly uncertain environmental conditions under global change, it is rather important for water security management to evaluate the flood risk, which is influenced by the compound effect of severe weather events and strong anthropogenic activities. In this paper, a risk assessment model in the framework of Bayesian network (BN) was proposed through incorporating with the Interpretative Structural Modeling method (ISM), which would produce an integrated ISM-BN model for reliable flood assessments. The ISM is employed to identify the relations among multiple risk factors, and then helps to configure the BN structure to conduct a risk inference. The established model was further demonstrated in Shenzhen city of China to perform an urban-level risk analysis of the flood disaster, and the Enhanced Water Index (EWI) was introduced to derive model parameters for training and verification. The obtained results of risk assessment lead to an accuracy of 76% with the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.82, and spatial distribution of risk levels also showed a satisfactory performance. In addition, it was found that the maximum daily rainfall among ten risk factors play a key part in flood occurrence, while the elevation and storm frequency are also sensitive indicators for the study area. Besides, the spatial flood risk map generated under various design rainfall scenarios would contribute to identifying potential areas that are worth paying particular attention. Thus, the developed assessment model would be a useful tool for supporting flood risk governance to achieve reliable urban water security.

TI  - Mapping Maize Tillage Practices over the Songnen Plain in Northeast China Using GEE Cloud Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the population grows, the development of conservation tillage offers a means of promoting the sustainability of agricultural engineering. Remote sensing images with high spatial and temporal resolutions enable the accurate monitoring of conservation tillage on a broad spatial scale, further promoting conservation tillage research. This paper describes using streamlined time series Sentinel-2 images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform for mapping maize tillage practices in the Songnen Plain region of Northeast China. Based on the correlation with the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) and maize residue coverage (MRC) data, the optimal time series and streamlining functions in the GEE cloud platform are determined. Estimates of MRC and the mapping of tillage practices in the Songnen Plain for 2019-2022 are then determined using GEE and a previous model. Geostatistical analysis using ArcGIS is applied to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of MRC and conservation tillage over the Songnen Plain. The results show that time series images from 20-30 May achieve an r value of 0.902 and an R-2 value of 0.8136 when using the median streamlining function. The mean MRC for the study area in 2022 is 2.3%, and an overall upward trend in conservation tillage is observed (from 0.08% in 2019 to 0.25% in 2022). Our analysis shows that MRC monitoring and conservation tillage mapping can be performed over a broad spatial scale using remote sensing technology based on the GEE cloud platform. Spatial and temporal information on farm practices provides a theoretical basis for agricultural development planning efforts, which can promote sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - Estimating Effects of Natural and Anthropogenic Activities on Trophic Level of Inland Water: Analysis of Poyang Lake Basin, China, with Landsat-8 Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensification of anthropogenic activities has led to the infiltration of enormous quantities of pollutants into rivers and lakes, resulting in significant deterioration in water quality and a more prominent occurrence of eutrophication. Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is facing a severe challenge related to eutrophication, which seriously threatens the delivery of the ecosystem service and the safety of drinking water. To address this challenge, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB) from May 2013 to December 2020 were used. Since inland water bodies with complex optical characteristics, we developed a semi-analytical algorithm to assess the trophic state of the water based on two cruise field measurements in 2016 and 2019. Combining the semi-analytical trophic level index (TLI) with an atmospheric correction model is the most suitable model for OLI images of the PLB, this model was then applied to Landsat-8 time series observations. The trends of the trophic state of water bodies in PLB were revealed, and the annual, quarterly and monthly percentages of eutrophic water bodies were calculated. Natural and anthropogenic factors were then used to explain the changes in the trophic state of the PLB waters. The main findings are as follows: (1) From the 8-year observation results, it can be seen that the variation of trophic level of water in PLB showed obviously spatial and temporal variations, characterized by higher in the north than in the south and higher in winter than in summer. (2) Temperature promoted the growth of harmful algae and plays an essential role in affecting changes in the trophic level of the water. (3) Changes in the trophic level of water bodies in PLB were mainly affected by human activities. The results of spatial and temporal variation of the trophic level of water and the driving factors in PLB can extend our knowledge of water quality degradation and provide essential references for relevant policy-making institutions.

TI  - PolSAR Image Building Extraction with G<SUP>0</SUP> Statistical Texture Using Convolutional Neural Network and Superpixel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has unique advantages in building extraction due to its sensitivity to building structures and all-time/all-weather imaging capabilities. However, the structure of buildings is complex, and buildings are easily confused with other objects in polarimetric SAR images. The speckle noise of SAR images will affect the accuracy of building extraction. This paper proposes a novel building extraction approach from PolSAR images with statistical texture and polarization features by using a convolutional neural network and superpixel. A feature space that is sensitive to building, including G(0) statistical texture and PualiRGB features, is constructed and used as CNN input. Considering that the building boundary of the CNN classification result is inaccurate due to speckle noise, the simple linear iterative cluster (SLIC) superpixel is utilized to constrain the building extraction result. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by experimenting with PolSAR images from three different sensors, including ESAR, GF-3, and RADARSAT-2. Experiment results show that compared with the other five PolSAR building extraction methods including threshold, SVM, RVCNN, and PFDCNN, our method without superpixel constraint, the F1-score of this method is the highest, reaching 84.22%, 91.24%, and 87.49%, respectively. The false alarm rate of this method is at least 10% lower and the F1 index is at least 6% higher when the building extraction accuracy is comparable. Further, the discussion and method parameter analysis results show that increasing the use of G(0) statistical texture parameters can improve building extraction accuracy and reduce false alarms, and the introduction of superpixel constraints can further reduce false alarms.

TI  - Comparison and Impact Factor Analysis of Ground PM2.5 Retrieved by Aqua and Himawari-8 Satellite Products in Guangdong, China
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (particles sizes <2.5 mu m; PM2.5) concentrations can be obtained at high spatial resolutions using satellite remote sensing. Previous studies on PM2.5 concentrations in Guangdong have used the aerosol optical depth (AOD) determined by MODIS sensors on the Terra and Aqua satellites, which both have a transit time of once per day. In this study, based on AOD data obtained from the Aqua and Himawari-8 (H8) satellites and ground-based measurements, ground PM2.5 concentrations were compared using radiation theory and a semi-empirical model. The temporal resolution of PM2.5 concentrations retrieved by the H8 satellite improved from once per day to once per hour when compared with the temporal resolution of those retrieved by the Aqua satellite. The data from both satellites were consistent with ground-based measurements (R >= 0.65 and reaching 0.96 for the annual mean), indicating that the retrieved data could characterize the spatial and temporal variations in ground PM2.5 concentrations in Guangdong Province. The two satellites had similar performances for the annual mean, dry season mean, and hourly data; however, H8 performed better than Aqua for the wet season and monthly averages. The performances of both satellites decreased when relative humidity increased and visibility decreased. H8 performed better at high relative humidity, low visibility, and during the PM2.5 pollution process, thus reflecting the advantage of geostationary satellite in capturing PM2.5 pollution distributions. In addition, the data retrieved by both satellites exhibited higher PM2.5 concentrations near the junctions of some cities and regions, indicating a new pollution distribution pattern after the industrial shift that cannot be observed by ground-based measurements. Aerosol scale height is the most important parameter for retrieving PM2.5 concentrations. Thus, improving the computational accuracy of aerosol scale height may improve the effectiveness of satellite-based PM2.5 concentration retrievals.

TI  - Analysis of Seismic Impact on Hailuogou Glacier after the 2022 Luding Ms 6.8 Earthquake, China, Using SAR Offset Tracking Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An Ms 6.8 earthquake struck Luding County, Ganzi Prefecture, Sichuan Province on 5 September 2022, with the epicenter about 10 km away from Hailuogou Glacier. How Hailuogou Glacier was affected by the earthquake was of major concern to society. Sentinel-1 SAR satellite imaging was used to monitor the glacier surface velocity during different periods before and after the Luding earthquake based on pixel offset tracking (POT) technology, which applies a feature-tracking algorithm to overcome the phase co-registration problems commonly encountered in large displacement monitoring. The results indicated that the velocity had a positive correlation with the average daily maximum temperature and the slope gradient on the small-slope surfaces. The correlation was not apparent on the steeper surfaces, which corresponded spatially with the identified ice avalanche region in the Planet images. It was deduced that this may be because of the occurrence of ice avalanches on surfaces steeper than 25 degrees, or that the narrower front channel impeded the glacier's movement. The Luding earthquake did not cause a significant increase in the velocity of Hailuogou Glacier within a large range, but it disturbed the front area of the ice cascade, where the maximum velocity reached 2.5 m/d. Although the possibility of directly-induced destruction by ice avalanches after the earthquake was low, and the buffering in the downstream glacier tongue further reduced the risk of ice avalanches, the risk of some secondary hazards such as debris flow increased. The proposed method in this study might be the most efficient in monitoring and evaluating the effects of strong earthquakes on glaciers because it would not be limited by undesirable weather or traffic blockage.

TI  - Construction of high-resolution precipitation dataset and its implication to drought over the Tianshan Mountains, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the drought characteristics of mountainous areas in northwest China with sparse rainfall stations requires high precision, as well as high-resolution precipitation data. Considering the spatial relationship of precipitation and environmental factors, this study downscales Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) based on the geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models integrated with interpolation. A high-resolution (1 kmx1 km) precipitation dataset during 1979-2020 is reconstructed in the Tianshan Mountains, and the drought characteristics are analyzed by using the optimal dataset. The results show that: 1) Compared with GWR, MGWR model has higher downscaling accuracy; 2) The optimal MSWEP downscaling dataset (CC = 0.93, |BIAS| = 0.48%) compared to GPM (CC = 0.81, |BIAS| = 1.87%) is closer to the observed precipitation; 3) In the past 40 years, 71% and 9% of the Tianshan Mountains show significant wetting and drying trends respectively, and 16 drought events are identified. 4) The West subregion of the Tianshan Mountains is characterized by low frequency, long duration and high severity of drought events. The characteristics of the East are opposite to those of the West. Occasional extreme drought events occur in the North and South. This paper provides data support and method reference for the study of water-vapor balance and regional ecohydrological process in the arid area of Northwest China.

TI  - Identifying the Responses of Vegetation Gross Primary Productivity and Water Use Efficiency to Climate Change under Different Aridity Gradients across China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the fact that gross primary productivity (GPP) and water use efficiency (WUE) have been widely used as indicators to evaluate the water-carbon cycle, uncertainties exist in the patterns of GPP and WUE responses to climate variability along different aridity gradients. In this study, the aridity index was used to divide China into four arid-humid zones. The spatiotemporal variability of multiple vegetation types GPP and WUE in response to climate change under different arid-humid zones were investigated based on remote sensing data. The results indicated that the increasing trend of WUE in the four arid-humid zones of China was less pronounced than GPP from 2001 to 2021. The GPP value decreased gradually from the humid to the arid zone, and the WUE value in the arid zone was slightly higher than in the semi-arid zone. The GPP of all vegetation types in China showed a tendency to increase, while shrubland and wetland WUE tended to decrease. The major vegetation types (e.g., forest, cropland and grassland) in each aridity gradient contributed to the changes in local GPP and WUE. However, in individual arid-humid zones, wetland and shrubland also exhibited high GPP and WUE values that were not inferior to forest and cropland. Temperature and precipitation were the main climatic factors responsible for the increase in vegetation GPP in different aridity gradients, with a higher positive correlation for temperature than precipitation. WUE showed a distinct positive and negative correlation with the thermal factors (temperature and net radiation) and the moisture factors (precipitation and relative humidity); this pattern was more pronounced in the humid and semi-humid zones. Net radiation and precipitation may be the main climatic factors causing a slight upward trend in WUE across the arid-humid zones, while the decrease in shrubland and wetland WUE may be related to relative humidity and precipitation.

TI  - Study on land subsidence characteristics and deformation evolution mechanism in Caofeidian New Area, Bohai Bay
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence caused by natural or human factors is a very serious geological hazard. Ground buildings and environments are affected by land subsidence in some large cities and new economic development zones worldwide. The most direct cause of land subsidence are complex geological conditions and excessive mining of underground resources. It will have great significance for disaster prevention and controlling to understand the formation mechanism and evolution rule of land subsidence. In this research, the small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) was used to analyse land subsidence of Caofeidian in Bohai Bay, which could monitor the surface deformation velocity and displacement spatiotemporal evolution through the acquired SAR image dataset. A total of 43 sentinel images from January 2019 to December 2021 were used to calculate the time series of surface deformations. The results showed that there was an obvious subsidence deformation in the central and southern parts of Caofeidian, while the abnormal local subsidence was mainly reflected in the northern part. Geological conditions, groundwater exploitation and engineering disturbance were the main influencing factors of land subsidence. Combining the evolution results with the geological conditions, the surface deformation mechanism and subsidence mode in different regions of Caofeidian were concluded. Subsequently, the environmental effects and potential hazards were analysed. Our research proposed and established sequences of spatiotemporal evolutionary, analysis methods on mechanism and evolution of land subsidence, which is of great significance for regional disaster control.

TI  - Mapping seagrasses on the basis of Sentinel-2 images under tidal change.
T2  - Marine environmental research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Tidal variations make the water bodies in satellite remote sensing images on different shooting dates have different inundation ranges and depths. Although the underwater substrates do not change, the spectral properties differ due to attenuation effects. These differences have an impact on the results when multi-temporal remote sensing images are used to analyze seagrasses. This paper proposes a remote sensing mapping method for seagrasses taking the tidal influence, using the seagrasses growth area in Xincun Bay, Hainan Province, China as a case study. a) The seagrasses growth area was determined from remote sensing images. The seagrasses were divided into two types: the seagrasses exposed to water surface or tidal flats (non-submerged seagrasses) and the seagrasses submerged in water (submerged seagrasses). b) The spectral features of seagrasses in Sentienl-2 image were analyzed. We found that the spectral characteristics of non-submerged seagrasses were similar to terrestrial vegetation and these seagrasses could be extracted by using NDVI. The submerged seagrasses spectral was different, forming a reflection peak at the first vegetation red edge band (i.e.705nm) in Sentinel-2 images. This reflection peak was used to design the Submerged Seagrasses Identification Index (SSII) for extracting underwater seagrass. c) The extraction results of non-submerged seagrasses and submerged seagrasses were merged to map the seagrasses in the study area. The experimental results show that the mapping method proposed in this study can fully consider the influence of tidal changes in remote sensing images on seagrasses identification. The SSII constructed based on Sentinel-2 images extracted submerged seagrasses effectively. This study will provide references to remote sensing mapping of seagrasses and integrated ecological management in coastal zones.

TI  - A point-surface fusion method for vegetation water content retrievalconsidering optimization of GNSS sites and modeling elements
T2  - MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized microwave reflectance index (NMRI) based on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interferometric reflectometry has been proven to reflect the changes in vegetation water content (VWC) effectively, but it is limited to point data. A spatially continuous NMRI product can be obtained by fusing NMRI data (point) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (surface). However, the time resolution of the existing results is limited to 16 d, and the research on the selection of modeling elements is not deep enough. In this paper, a point-surface fusion method for VWC retrieval considering the optimization of GNSS sites and elements is proposed. This method is aimed at using MODIS multi-band to synthesize vegetation indices with 8 d spatial-temporal resolution and establishing the initial element set by combining meteorological elements, followed by optimizing the GNSS sites and modeling elements for best modeling scheme, finally constructing the point-surface fusion method for VWC retrieval, and comprehensively evaluating the performance of the method. The results indicate that optimizing GNSS sites and modeling elements are particularly critical to improving modeling accuracy. Compared with other vegetation elements, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gross primary productivity, and leaf area index are essential elements that affect the modeling effect. Among them, NDVI is the critical element. The NMRI products with 8 d/500 m resolution obtained by GA-BPNN can better reflect the change of VWC. Furthermore, the spatial performance of NMRI products is consistent with the fire forecast products and is suitable for drought and fire forecasts.

TI  - Semantic segmentation model for land cover classification from satellite images in Gambella National Park, Ethiopia
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work uses machine learning approaches to present semantic segmentation for land cover classification in Gambella National Park (GNP). Land cover classification has become more accurate due to developments in remote sensing data. Land cover classification from satellite images has been studied, but the methodologies and satellite data employed so far are not suitable for research regions with the possibility to find heterogeneous land cover classes within small areas. Previous studies found issues with the satellite images coarser spatial resolution, the use of standard statistical methods as classifiers, and the difficulty in optimal patch size selection when patch-based classification is used. To address these issues, we suggested a deep learning-based semantic segmentation model that could be utilized as a pixel-level land cover classification technique. The suggested technique employed high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images of our study area (GNP) as a dataset and constructed and assessed pixel-level classification models. As a deep learning-based classification model, we have used the Link-Net architecture and its encoder part was modified further to incorporate the state-of-the-art architecture called ResNet34. The developed models, support vector machine with CNN features (CNN-SVM), random forest with CNN features (CNN-RF), LinkNet model with ResNet-34 as encoder (LinkNet-ResNet34), attain average F1-Score values of 81%,82%, and 87.4% respectively.

AB  - This article suggests a literary way to look at religious discourses through a hypothesis about the presence of biblical narrativity in fundamentalist religious imaginaries. Studying the most remarkable patterns of biblical narratives and defending their presence of this literature (both in form and content) in contemporary Western culture, we will be said that the worldview of fundamentalist Christian groups is constructed narratively, following the shapes defined by biblical narrators. The analytical apparatus used to reach the expected results are Literary Analysis, which highlights the features of biblical narrativity, and Discourse Analysis, which focuses on the narrative level of religious communication to show the imposition of biblical fiction on the fundamentalist way of creating order and meaning for our existence.

TI  - Ultrasound-assisted carbon nanoparticle labeling of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast-conserving surgery in breast cancer
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has gradually become an important means of breast cancer treatment; however, tumor regression following chemotherapy remains a concern. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of ultrasound-assisted carbon nanoparticle labeling in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast-conserving surgery in breast cancer.Methods: This was a prospective clinical trial study (clinical registration number: ChiCTR-OOC-15006844). Sixty-eight breast cancer patients confirmed by biopsy between July 2015 and January 2017 were randomly selected from the clinical data. Of these, 32 patients were screened for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, forming a consecutive, random series. An ultrasound-guided carbon nanotube was used to mark the original tumor, and sentinel lymph node biopsies were performed. After 4-6 cycles of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 26 patients were selected for breast-conserving surgery. The feasibility and validity of carbon nanoparticle labeling were analyzed through the negative rate of incision margin, the volume of resected tumors, the detection rate of black-stained sentinel lymph nodes, the recurrence rate of ipsilateral breast, and postoperative survival.Results: In all, 32 patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, 29 cases were detected (90.6%), the false-negative rate was 3.8% (1/26), and 0-4 sentinel lymph nodes (mean 1.8 +/- 1.1) were detected. A total of 26 patients underwent breast-conserving surgery, 5 underwent secondary excision, and 1 underwent subcutaneous adenectomy due to a positive margin. The minimum margin between the resected site and the infiltrated part was 1.0-2.1 cm (1.3 +/- 0.3 cm). The diameter of resected tumors ranged from 2.2 to 4.5 cm (3.1 +/- 0.6 cm). No recurrence or distant metastasis of ipsilateral breast tumors was observed during follow-up (the median follow-up time was 9 months).Conclusions: Ultrasound-assisted carbon nanoparticle labeling is effective for sentinel lymph node tracing before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and has a high detection rate for metastatic lymph nodes. During breast-conserving surgery, it can determine the extent of tumor resection to achieve precision surgical treatment.

TI  - A Lake Extraction Method Combining the Object-Oriented Method with Boundary Recognition
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is the pilot area of the Belt and Road, where glaciers and lakes are widely distributed. Recent years, global warming has accelerated the expansion of glacier lakes, which increased the risk of natural disasters such as glacier lake outburst. It is important to monitor the glacier lakes in this region. In this paper, we propose a method combining the object-oriented image analysis with boundary recognition (OOBR) to extract lakes in several study areas of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This method recognized the lake boundary with the symmetrical characteristic according to the principle of seed growth of watershed algorithm, which can correct the boundary extracted by the object-oriented method. The overall accuracy of the proposed method is up to 98.5% with Landsat series images. The experiments also show that the overall accuracy of our method is always higher than that of the object-oriented method with different segmentation scales mentioned in this paper. The proposed method improved the overall accuracy on the basis of the results obtained by the object-oriented method, and the results with the proposed method are more robust to the seeds than that with the boundary correction method of the watershed algorithm. Therefore, the proposed method can obtain a high extraction accuracy while reducing the complexity of the object-oriented extraction.

TI  - Global Comparison of Leaf Area Index Products over Water-Vegetation Mixed Heterogeneous Surface Network (HESNet-WV)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial land surface heterogeneities are widespread at various scales and represent a great challenge to leaf area index (LAI) retrievals and product validations. In this paper, considering the mixed water and vegetation pixels prevalent at moderate and low resolutions, we propose a methodological framework for conducting global comparisons of heterogeneous land surfaces based on criterion setting and a global search of high-resolution data. We construct a global network, Heterogeneous Surface Network aiming Water and Vegetation Mixture (HESNet-WV), comprised of three vegetation types: grassland, evergreen broadleaf forests (EBFs), and evergreen needle forests (ENFs). Validation is performed using the MCD15A3H Global 500-m/4-day and GLASS 500-m/8-day LAI products. As the water area fraction (WAF), LAI values and LAI inversion errors increase in the MODIS and GLASS products, the GLASS product errors (relative LAI error (RELAI): 94.43%, bias: 0.858) are lower than the MODIS product errors (RELAI: 124.05%, bias: 1.209). The result indicates that the proposed framework can be applied to evaluate the accuracy of LAI values in mixed water-vegetation pixels in different global LAI products.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Arctic Winter Snow/Ice with Moonlight Remote Sensing: Systematic Evaluation in Svalbard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow and ice is essential for under-standing and predicting the impacts of climate change on Arctic ecosystems and their feedback on global climate. Traditional optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing still have limitations in the long-time series observation of polar regions. Although several studies have demonstrated the potential of moonlight remote sensing for mapping polar snow/ice covers, systematic evaluation on applying moonlight remote sensing to monitoring spatiotemporal dynamics of polar snow/ice covers, especially during polar night periods is highly demanded. Here we present a systematic assessment in Svalbard, Norway and using data taken from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) Day/Night Band (DNB) sensor to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow/ice covers during dark Arctic winters when no solar illumination available for months. We successfully revealed the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow/ice covers from 2012 to 2022 during polar night/winter periods, using the VIIRS/DNB time series data and the object-oriented Random Forests (RF) algorithm, achieving the average accuracy and kappa coefficient of 96.27% and 0.93, respectively. Our findings indicate that the polar snow/ice covers show seasonal and inter-seasonal dynamics, thus requiring more frequent observations. Our results confirm and realize the potential of moonlight remote sensing for continuous monitoring of snow/ice in the Arctic region and together with other types of remote sensing data, moonlight remote sensing will be a very useful tool for polar studies and climate change.

TI  - MCBAM-GAN: The Gan Spatiotemporal Fusion Model Based on Multiscale and CBAM for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limitations of current technology and budget, as well as the influence of various factors, obtaining remote sensing images with high-temporal and high-spatial (HTHS) resolution simultaneously is a major challenge. In this paper, we propose the GAN spatiotemporal fusion model Based on multiscale and convolutional block attention module (CBAM) for remote sensing images (MCBAM-GAN) to produce high-quality HTHS fusion images. The model is divided into three stages: multi-level feature extraction, multi-feature fusion, and multi-scale reconstruction. First of all, we use the U-NET structure in the generator to deal with the significant differences in image resolution while avoiding the reduction in resolution due to the limitation of GPU memory. Second, a flexible CBAM module is added to adaptively re-scale the spatial and channel features without increasing the computational cost, to enhance the salient areas and extract more detailed features. Considering that features of different scales play an essential role in the fusion, the idea of multiscale is added to extract features of different scales in different scenes and finally use them in the multi loss reconstruction stage. Finally, to check the validity of MCBAM-GAN model, we test it on LGC and CIA datasets and compare it with the classical algorithm for spatiotemporal fusion. The results show that the model performs well in this paper.

TI  - Pansharpening Model of Transferable Remote Sensing Images Based on Feature Fusion and Attention Modules
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the panchromatic sharpening of remote sensing images is to generate high-resolution multispectral images through software technology without increasing economic expenditure. The specific method is to fuse the spatial information of a high-resolution panchromatic image and the spectral information of a low-resolution multispectral image. This work proposes a novel model for generating high-quality multispectral images. This model uses the feature domain of the convolution neural network to fuse multispectral and panchromatic images so that the fused images can generate new features so that the final fused features can restore clear images. Because of the unique feature extraction ability of convolution neural networks, we use the core idea of convolution neural networks to extract global features. To extract the complementary features of the input image at a deeper level, we first designed two subnetworks with the same structure but different weights, and then used single-channel attention to optimize the fused features to improve the final fusion performance. We select the public data set widely used in this field to verify the validity of the model. The experimental results on the GaoFen-2 and SPOT6 data sets show that this method has a better effect in fusing multi-spectral and panchromatic images. Compared with the classical and the latest methods in this field, our model fusion obtained panchromatic sharpened images from both quantitative and qualitative analysis has achieved better results. In addition, to verify the transferability and generalization of our proposed model, we directly apply it to multispectral image sharpening, such as hyperspectral image sharpening. Experiments and tests have been carried out on Pavia Center and Botswana public hyperspectral data sets, and the results show that the model has also achieved good performance in hyperspectral data sets.

TI  - Headland and Field Edge Performance Assessment Using Yield Maps and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Headland and field edges have a higher traffic frequency compared to the field centre, which causes more compaction. Most repeated compaction is located at the field entrance area and headland during machinery turning and material transporting that takes place during the fertilisation, herbicide laying, and harvesting of fields, which could cause soil structure destruction and yield reduction. In this study, the differences between headland, field edges, and field centre were studied using yield maps and the vegetation indices (VIs) calculated by the Google Earth Engine (GEE). First, thirteen yield maps from 2019 to 2022 were used to measure the yield difference between headland, field edges, and field centre. Then, one hundred and eleven fields from northern Italy were used to compare the vegetation indices (VIs) differences between headland, field edges, and field centre area. Then, field size, sand, and clay content were calculated and estimated from GEE. The yield map showed that headland and field edges were 12.20% and 2.49% lower than the field centre. The results of the comparison of the VIs showed that headlands and field edges had lower values compared to the field centre, with reductions of 4.27% and 2.70% in the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), 4.17% and 2.67% in the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and 5.87% and 3.59% in the normalised difference red edge (NDRE). Additionally, the results indicated that the yield losses in the headland and field edges increased as the clay content increased and sand content decreased. These findings suggest that soil compaction and structural damage caused by the higher traffic frequency in the headland and field edges negatively affect crop yield.

TI  - Mapping the Distribution and Dynamics of Coniferous Forests in Large Areas from 1985 to 2020 Combining Deep Learning and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the distribution of coniferous forests is of great importance to the sustainable management of forests and government decision-making. The development of remote sensing, cloud computing and deep learning has provided the support of data, computing power and algorithms for obtaining large-scale forest parameters. However, few studies have used deep learning algorithms combined with Google Earth Engine (GEE) to extract coniferous forests in large areas and the performance remains unknown. In this study, we thus propose a cloud-enabled deep-learning approach using long-time series Landsat remote sensing images to map the distribution and obtain information on the dynamics of coniferous forests over 35 years (1985-2020) in the northwest of Liaoning, China, through the combination of GEE and U-2-Net. Firstly, to assess the reliability of the proposed method, the U-2-Net model was compared with three Unet variants (i.e., Resnet50-Unet, Mobile-Unet and U-Net) in coniferous forest extraction. Secondly, we evaluated U-2-Net's temporal transferability of remote sensing images from Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI. Finally, we compared the results obtained by the proposed approach with three publicly available datasets, namely GlobeLand30-2010, GLC_FCS30-2010 and FROM_GLC30-2010. The results show that (1) the cloud-enabled deep-learning approach proposed in this paper that combines GEE and U-2-Net achieves a high performance in coniferous forest extraction with an F1 score, overall accuracy (OA), precision, recall and kappa of 95.4%, 94.2%, 96.6%, 95.5% and 94.0%, respectively, outperforming the other three Unet variants; (2) the proposed model trained by the sample blocks collected from a specific time can be applied to predict the coniferous forests in different years with satisfactory precision; (3) Compared with three global land-cover products, the distribution of coniferous forests extracted by U-2-Net was most similar to that of actual coniferous forests; (4) The area of coniferous forests in Northwestern Liaoning showed an upward trend in the past 35 years. The area of coniferous forests has grown from 945.64 km(2) in 1985 to 6084.55 km(2) in 2020 with a growth rate of 543.43%. This study indicates that the proposed approach combining GEE and U-2-Net can extract coniferous forests quickly and accurately, which helps obtain dynamic information and assists scientists in developing sustainable strategies for forest management.

TI  - Comparing Water Indices for Landsat Data for Automated Surface Water Body Extraction under Complex Ground Background: A Case Study in Jilin Province
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Derived from Landsat imagery and capable of enhancing the contrast between surface water bodies and the background, water indices are widely used in surface water body extraction. Whether one index and its optimal threshold can maintain the best all year round is a question. At present, however, little research has considered the effect of time or conducted experiments with data from different months. To identify the best index for surface water body extraction, two regions in Jilin Province were selected for the case study and a comprehensive comparative analysis considering the imagery acquisition time was conducted. Ten water indices were selected and calculated based on the 30 m spatial resolution Landsat TM/OLI imagery acquired in 1999 and 2001 and 2019 and 2021 from May to October. The indices included the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI3 and MNDWI), Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) for images with and without shadow, Multi-Band Water Index (MBWI), New Water Index (NWI), Water Ratio Index (WRI), Sentinel-2 Water Index (SWI) originally calculated based on the Sentinel-2 imagery, New Comprehensive Water Index (NCIWI), Index of Water Surfaces (IWS), and Enhanced Water Index (EWI). The OTSU algorism was adopted to adaptively determine the optimal segmentation threshold for each index and the indices were compared in terms of inter-class separability, threshold sensitivity, optimal threshold robustness, and water extraction accuracy. The result showed that NWI and EWI performed the best in different months and years, with the best water enhancement effect that could suppress background information, especially for the water-related land use types and cloud pollution. Their optimal segmentation thresholds throughout the study period were more stable than others, with the ranges of -0.342 to -0.038 and -0.539 to -0.223, respectively. Based on the optimal thresholds, they achieved overall accuracies of 0.952 to 0.981 and 0.964 to 0.981, commission errors of 0 to 28.2% and 0 to 7.7%, and omission errors of 0 to 15% and 0 to 8%, with a kappa coefficient above 0.8 indicating good extraction results. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of NWI and EWI combined with the OTSU algorithm in better monitoring surface water during different water periods and offering reliable results. Even though this study only focuses on the lakes within two regions, the indices have the potential for accurately monitoring the surface water over other regions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution and driving factors of regional green spaces during rapid urbanization in Nanjing metropolitan area, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In China, regional green spaces (RGSs) are green spaces outside urban built-up areas and have a wide distribution, large scale, and outstanding ecological function. RGSs have become increasingly important as urban clusters expand and increase in number. However, studies on RGSs are rare and it remains unclear what drives their distribution in the context of rapid urbanization. This study used integrated approaches to explore the distribution and driving factors of RGSs in the Nanjing metropolitan area (NMA) between 2000 and 2020, using Landsat image data. Spatiotemporal variations in the distribution of RGSs were obtained using the net change rate index and standard deviational ellipse. The driving factors were identified using Pearson correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS), and geographically weighted regression (GWR). We found that: (1) More RGSs are in the south of the NMA, and less in the north region. A "V" pattern of RGSs area change was observed, with substantial losses shifting from Yangtze River coastline to hilly and mountainous regions from 2000 to 2020. (2) The distribution of RGSs was affected by a combination of physical geographic, socioeconomic, and policy management factors. The functions of these influencing factors have pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity in direction or magnitude. Physical geographic factors including slope and annual precipitation exhibited the strongest correlation with RGSs distribution, and the regression coefficients showed relatively stable spatial performance. Among the socioeconomic factors, the distance from built-up areas and GDP played an important role. Policy management has played a guiding role, and the positive influence generated by dedicated financial expenditure and statutory green space area tends to increase and maintain a balance. The results of this study can help further understand the spatial distribution of RGSs and provide theoretical support for green space construction and ecological management of metropolitan areas during rapid urbanization.

TI  - A Partial Reconstruction Method for SAR Altimeter Coastal Waveforms Based on Adaptive Threshold Judgment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to land contamination and human activities, the sea surface height (SSH) data retrieved from altimeter coastal waveforms have poor precision and cannot provide effective information for various tasks. The along-track high-resolution characteristic of the new synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter makes the retracking methods of traditional coastal waveforms difficult to apply. This study proposes a partial reconstruction method for SAR altimeter coastal waveforms. By making adaptive threshold judgments of model matching errors and repairing the contaminated waveforms based on the nearest linear prediction, the success rate of retracking and retrieval precision of SSH are significantly improved. The data from the coastal experimental areas of the Sentinel-3B satellite altimeter are processed. The results indicate that the mean proportion of waveform quality improvement brought by partial reconstruction is 80.30%, the mean retracking success rate of reconstructed waveforms is 85.60%, and the mean increasing percentage is 30.98%. The noise levels of SSH data retrieved by different methods are calculated to evaluate the processing precision. It is shown that the 20 Hz SSH precisions of the original and reconstructed coastal waveforms are 12.75 cm and 6.32 cm, respectively, and the corresponding 1 Hz SSH precisions are 2.85 cm and 1.41 cm, respectively. The results validate that the proposed partial reconstruction method has improved the SSH precision by a factor of two, and the comparison results with mean sea surface (MSS) model data further verify this conclusion.

TI  - Lithium quantification based on random forest with multi-source geoinformation in Coipasa salt flats, Bolivia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the widespread use of Lithium (Li) batteries, there is an urgent demand to explore Li deposits. This study aims to apply efficient remote sensing methodologies with multi-resolution images of Sentinel-2, ASTER, and JILIN GP and soil geoinformation to locate Li by mapping its alterations and directly identifying the minerals that contain it. The principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the satellite bands to gain an initial under-standing and analysis of the temporal and spatial behaviour in the Coipasa salt flats in western Bolivia. Then, we employed the Random Forest (RF) method for defining repeatable mineral exploration targets and predictive modelling of mineral prospecting using geographical information system (GIS) tools. Predictive maps are created that contemplate the source, sediment transport, and chemical deposition processes crucial to produce this mineral. The predictive models used satellite bands and physical and chemical soil grid maps; the training data is extracted from sixteen soil and salt samples evaluated using the results of a laboratory test utilizing Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. The results demonstrate the high reliability of our predictive models: the values of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) are between 0.90 and 0.92. The results also show that the combination of PCA on satellite images and terrain information, such as physical, chemical, and morphological properties of the terrain, improves the model to predict the formation of Li ore within the Coipasa salt flats.

TI  - Safety and Accuracy of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Alone in Clinically Node-Positive Patients Undergoing Upfront Surgery for Invasive Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Landmark trials (Z0011 and AMAROS) have demonstrated that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be safely omitted in patients with breast cancer and 1-2 positive sentinel nodes. Extrapolating from these and other cardinal studies such as NSABP B-04, guidelines state that patients with 1-2 needle biopsy-proven positive lymph nodes undergoing upfront surgery can have sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the literature to identify studies examining the direct application of SLNB in such patients. EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE were searched from inception to 3 May 2022. Studies including patients with nodal involvement confirmed on pre-operative biopsy and undergoing SLNB were identified. Studies with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Search resulted in 2518 records, of which 68 full-text studies were reviewed, ultimately yielding only 2 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Both studies used targeted axillary surgery (TAS) with pre-operative localization of the biopsy-proven positive node in addition to standard SLNB techniques. In a non-randomized single-center prospective study, Lee et al. report no regional recurrences in patients undergoing TAS or ALND, and no difference in distant recurrence or mortality at 5 years. In the prospective multicenter TAXIS trial by Webber et al., the median number of positive nodes retrieved with TAS in patients undergoing upfront surgery was 2 (1, 4 IQR). Within the subset of patients who underwent subsequent ALND, 61 (70.9%) had additional positive nodes, with 26 (30.2%) patients having >= 4 additional positive nodes. Our review demonstrates that there is limited direct evidence for SLNB alone in clinically node-positive patients undergoing upfront surgery. Available data suggest a high proportion of patients with residual disease in this setting. While the totality of the data, mostly indirect evidence, suggests SLNB alone may be safe, we call on clinicians and researchers to prospectively collect data on this patient population to better inform decision-making.

TI  - Constraining Mountain Streamflow Constituents by Integrating Citizen Scientist Acquired Geochemical Samples and Sentinel-1 SAR Wet Snow Time-Series for the Shimshal Catchment in the Karakoram Mountains of Pakistan
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Upper Indus Basin (UIB) streamflow originates largely from glacier and snow melt in the upstream Himalaya, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush mountain ranges and is extremely vulnerable because of its projected climate changes, dense populations, and hydropolitical tensions. Accurate knowledge of streamflow constituents is required for resilient water resources management; this is precluded by a paucity of measurement as well as climatological and topographic complexity. Here we integrate citizen scientist acquired geochemical samples, collected from October 2018 through September 2019 in the Shimshal watershed of the Karakoram Mountains of Pakistan, with Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived wet snow maps, to better understand streamflow constituents for the high altitude and heavily glaciated catchment. We use Bayesian end-member mixture analysis to separate river flows into baseflow and meltwater constituents, using fixed and time-variant melt end-member values. We compare river hydrograph separation results with S1 wet snow time series maps for the same timeframe. We then utilize S1 imagery to inform end-member mixture analysis to separate meltwaters into snow and glacier melt. For the Shimshal catchment, we find that about 85% of annual river flows are derived from snow and glacier melt; 45% of annual flows are derived from snow melt and 40% glacier melt. Engaged and committed citizen scientists enabled geochemical sample collection and analysis on a significant temporal and spatial scale. In the future, co-produced knowledge that both implements local expertise and that is also planned and utilized by diverse stakeholders may increase climatological awareness and resilience in the UIB.

TI  - Estimation of Grassland Green Biomass Using Sentinel-1A SLC Image Spectral Characteristics
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland green biomass is an important index for monitoring the grassland ecosystem, and it is of great significance to estimate green biomass efficiently and accurately. Remote sensing technology has been widely used in biomass estimation due to its convenience and low cost advantages. However, traditional optical remote sensing technology is susceptible to the cloud and climatic conditions and unsuitable for high-density vegetation areas. Therefore, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology, which is less affected by the external environment and has certain penetration, has been promoted in biomass estimation. However, the current SAR technology is mostly used to estimate forest biomass and crop biomass, and there are few studies on estimating grassland green biomass. Therefore, the Inner Mongolia grassland was selected as the research area, and 11 radar indices, including backscattering coefficient, texture characteristics and polarization decomposition, were extracted from Sentinel -1A SLC images. Two radar vegetation indices (sigma(l) and sigma' (1)) were introduced based on the existing radar vegetation indices (sigma(l) and sigma'(0)). Based on the measured data of grassland green biomass, 15 radar indices were modeled and analyzed respectively. The results showed that the mean value and the backscattering coefficient avH in the texture feature were the best radar indices for estimating grassland green biomass, and their estimation models R-2 were 0. 54 and 0. 60, respectively. RMSE were 47. 3 and 44. 3 g center dot m(2), respectively. In addition, radar vegetation indices sigma(o) and sigma(1) can also be used to estimate green biomass of grassland with high accuracy, with R-2 of 0. 53 and 0. 42, RMSE of 47. 6 and 53.0 g center dot m (2), respectively. This study proved that SAR technology has strong application potential in high-efficiency and high-precision estimation of grassland green biomass, but it still needs improvement in error elimination.

TI  - A Joint Seismic and Space-Based Investigation of the 2016 Lamplugh Glacier and 2017 Wrangell Mountains (Alaska) Landslides
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides commonly occur in areas with steep topography and abundant precipitation and pose a significant hazard to local communities. Some of the largest known landslides occur in Alaska, including several that caused local tsunamis. Many landslides may have gone undetected in remote areas due to lack of observations. Here, we develop a semiautomated workflow using both seismic and geodetic observations to detect, locate, validate, and characterize landslides in Alaska. Seismic observations have shown promise in continuously monitoring landslide occurrence, while remote sensing techniques are well suited for verification and high-resolution imaging of landslides. We validate our procedure using the 28 June 2016, Lamplugh Glacier landslide. We also present observations of a previously unknown landslide occurred on 22 September 2017 in the Wrangell Mountains region. The Wrangell Mountains landslide generated a coherent surface wavefield recorded across Alaska and the contiguous United States. We used Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar and Sentinel-2 optical imagery to map the respective mass deposit. To investigate the landslide dynamics, we inverted regional seismic surface wave data for a centroid single force failure model. Our model suggests that the Wrangell Mountains landslide lasted for about 140 s and had two subevents involving at least five distinct stages. We estimate that the landslide had displaced 3.1-13.4 million tons of rocks over a distance of similar to 2 km. Our results suggest that combining seismic and geodetic observations can vastly improve the detection and characterization of landslides in remote areas in Alaska and elsewhere, providing new insights into the landslide dynamics.

TI  - Mapping the Forest Height by Fusion of ICESat-2 and Multi-Source Remote Sensing Imagery and Topographic Information: A Case Study in Jiangxi Province, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height is defined as the distance between the highest point of the tree canopy and the ground, which is considered to be a key factor in calculating above-ground biomass, leaf area index, and carbon stock. Large-scale forest canopy height monitoring can provide scientific information on deforestation and forest degradation to policymakers. The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) was launched in 2018, with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument taking on the task of mapping and transmitting data as a photon-counting LiDAR, which offers an opportunity to obtain global forest canopy height. To generate a high-resolution forest canopy height map of Jiangxi Province, we integrated ICESat-2 and multi-source remote sensing imagery, including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and forest age data of Jiangxi Province. Meanwhile, we develop four canopy height extrapolation models by random forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) to link canopy height in ICESat-2, and spatial feature information in multi-source remote sensing imagery. The results show that: (1) Forest canopy height is moderately correlated with forest age, making it a potential predictor for forest canopy height mapping. (2) Compared with GBDT, SVM, and KNN, RF showed the best predictive performance with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.61 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.29 m. (3) Elevation, slope, and the red-edge band (band 5) derived from Sentinel-2 were significantly dependent variables in the canopy height extrapolation model. Apart from that, Forest age was one of the variables that the RF moderately relied on. In contrast, backscatter coefficients and texture features derived from Sentinel-1 were not sensitive to canopy height. (4) There is a significant correlation between forest canopy height predicted by RF and forest canopy height measured by field measurements (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 4.02 m). In a nutshell, the results indicate that the method utilized in this work can reliably map the spatial distribution of forest canopy height at high resolution.

TI  - A Novel Two-Step Method for Enforcing Water Budget Closure and an Intercomparison of Budget Closure Correction Methods Based on Satellite Hydrological Products
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Enforcing terrestrial water budget closure is critical for obtaining consistent data sets of budget components to understand the changes and availability of water resources over time. However, most existing budget closure correction methods (BCCs) are significantly affected by errors in the budget-component products. Moreover, these existing BCCs do not fully account for the preselection of high-precision input data sets before enforcing the water budget closure, resulting in uncertainties in the budget-corrected data sets. In this study, a two-step method was proposed to enforce the water budget closure of satellite-based hydrological products. First, high-precision budget-component data sets were selected and second, the water budget closure of the selected high-precision data sets was then enforced by proposing an improved BCC strategy, that is, the Minimized Series Deviation method (MSD). The performance of the proposed two-step method was verified in 24 global basins by comparing it to three existing BCCs of varying complexity, that is, Proportional Redistribution (PR), Constrained Kalman Filter (CKF), and Multiple Collocation (MCL). The results showed that compared to the existing BCCs, the proposed two-step method significantly improved the accuracy of budget-corrected data sets in the range of 2%-19% (statistical analysis was based root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with estimated observation (EO) as a reference). This study also summarized the main factors influencing the performance of the existing BCCs and their further development prospects based on the results. This provides insight into the expansion of theories and methods related to closing the terrestrial water budget.

TI  - Fatigue Test and Unified Fatigue Life Calculation of Q460C Steel Notched Plates
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, a total of 20 fatigue tests on notched plates of Q460C steel were carried out, where the effects of relative stress amplitude, Delta sigma/f(y), and relative nominal maximum stress, sigma(max)/f(y), on the fatigue life of these notched plates were carefully examined. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations were subsequently conducted, based on an ellipsoidal fracture model originally proposed by the second author, which has been validated for use as a fracture criterion of fatigue crack, to investigate the fatigue cracking in the Q460C steel notched plates. The theoretical model was further developed to estimate the fatigue life of the Q460C steel notched plates using a unified crack growth approach originally proposed by the second author. Based on the theoretical and simulated results, the accuracy of the unified crack growth approach, and the allowable stress fatigue life formula recommended in China's code GB50017-2017, were assessed. The comparisons indicate that the unified crack growth approach is able to provide a reliable fatigue life assessment for the Q460C steel notched plates.

TI  - Air Quality Index (AQI) Did Not Improve during the COVID-19 Lockdown in Shanghai, China, in 2022, Based on Ground and TROPOMI Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lockdowns from the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have led to a reduction in anthropogenic activities and have hence reduced primary air pollutant emissions, which were reported to have helped air quality improvements. However, air quality expressed by the air quality index (AQI) did not improve in Shanghai, China, during the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2022. To better understand the reason, we investigated the variations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3), PM2.5 (particular matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mu m), and PM10 (particular matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 mu m) by using in situ and satellite measurements from 1 March to 31 June 2022 (pre-, full-, partial-, and post-lockdown periods). The results show that the benefit of the significantly decreased ground-level PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 was offset by amplified O-3 pollution, therefore leading to the increased AQI. According to the backward trajectory analyses and multiple linear regression (MLR) model, the anthropogenic emissions dominated the observed changes in air pollutants during the full-lockdown period relative to previous years (2019-2021), whereas the long-range transport and local meteorological parameters (temperature, air pressure, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation) influenced little. We further identified the chemical mechanism that caused the increase in O-3 concentration. The amplified O-3 pollution during the full-lockdown period was caused by the reduction in anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) under a VOC-limited regime and high background O-3 concentrations owing to seasonal variations. In addition, we found that in the downtown area, ground-level PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 more sensitively responded to the changes in lockdown measures than they did in the suburbs. These findings provide new insights into the impact of emission control restrictions on air quality and have implications for air pollution control in the future.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of Typhoon Nangka Based on the Satellite Data from the GPM, CloudSat and Himawari-8
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A typhoon or hurricane is one of the most destructive high-impact weather events. In this study, the genesis and development processes of Typhoon Nangka (2015), which occurred over the Western Pacific in 2015, were investigated based on the comprehensive observation data from three satellites, i.e., the Himawari-8 satellite, the CloudSat satellite and the Global Precipitation Measurement mission satellite (GPM), focusing on the characteristics of typhoon structure, precipitation and cloud. The results (Results) show that during the developing stage of Typhoon Nangka, the cloud system was relatively complex and changed significantly, with large raindrops dominating the precipitation around the eyewall in the first quadrant, and the convection in the eyewall and outer rainband burst upward to 17 km. In addition, three features were obvious: stratiform precipitation was dominant in the inner rainband, both the precipitation type (stratiform or convective) and intensity were distributed unevenly in the outer rainband, and large water content was located in the warm layer of clouds. Moreover, the collision growth and breakup of water droplets tended to be stable. The precipitation in the typhoon eyewall, inner rainband and outer rainband was significantly different; stratiform precipitation mainly occurred in the inner rainband, while convective precipitation mainly appeared in the eyewall and outer rainband. The cloud system was distributed asymmetrically, and the upper-layer and lower-layer clouds were closely related, dominated by single-layer clouds. There were deep convective clouds in the eyewall, and cirrus clouds with the broadest range across the eyewall. The coverage range of cirrus clouds was close to the radius of the typhoon. There were stratocumulus, altostratus and cumulus in the low levels.

TI  - Regional Stem Volume Mapping: A Feasibility Assessment of Scaling Tree-Level Estimates
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially detailed monitoring of forest resources is important for sustainable management but limited by a lack of field measurements. The increasing availability of multisource datasets offers the potential to characterize forest attributes at finer resolutions with regional coverage. This study aimed to assess the potential of mapping stem volume at a 30 m scale in eastern Texas using multisource datasets: airborne lidar, Landsat and LANDFIRE (Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project) datasets. Gradient-boosted trees regression models relating total volume, estimated from airborne lidar measurements and allometric equations, and multitemporal Landsat and LANDFIRE predictors were developed and evaluated. The fitted models showed moderate to high correlation (R-2 = 0.52-0.81) with reference stem volume estimates, with higher correlation in pine forests (R-2 = 0.70-0.81) than mixed forests (R-2 = 0.52-0.67). The models were also precise, with relative percent mean absolute errors (pMAE) of 13.8-21.2%. The estimated volumes also consistently agreed with volumes estimated in independent sites (R-2 = 0.51, pMAE = 34.7%) and with US Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis county-level volume estimates (R-2 = 0.93, pBias = -10.3%, pMAE = 11.7%). This study shows the potential of developing regional stem volume products using airborne lidar and multisource datasets, supporting forest productivity and carbon modeling at spatially detailed scales.

TI  - General Five-Component Scattering Power Decomposition with Unitary Transformation (G5U) of Coherency Matrix
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) provides us with a two-by-two scattering matrix data set. The ensemble averaged coherency matrix in an imaging window derived using a scattering matrix has all non-zero elements in its three-by-three matrix. It is a full 3 x 3 matrix that bears nine real-valued and independent polarimetric parameters inside. In the proposed decomposition method, G5U, we preprocess observed coherency matrix [T] by using two consecutive unitary transformations to become an ideal form for five-component decomposition. The transformation reduces nine parameters to seven, which is the best fit for five-component scattering model expansion. We can retrieve five powers corresponding to surface scattering, double bounce scattering, volume scattering, oriented dipole scattering, and compound dipole scattering, directly. These powers can be calculated easily and used to display superb polarimetric RBG images as never before, and are further applicable for polarimetric calibration, classification, validation, etc.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Striping Noise between FY-3E MWTS-3 and FY-3D MWTS-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 5 July 2021, China launched the world's first early morning orbit meteorological satellite, which was equipped with China's newest-generation microwave instrument, the Microwave Temperature Sounder-3 (MWTS-3). MWTS-3 has 17 detection channels, which can detect temperature profiles from near the ground to approximately 2 hPa. However, similar to the newest-generation microwave temperature instruments in other countries, MWTS-3 may also suffer from striping noise. In this paper, a principal component analysis (PCA) is combined with ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to extract the striping noise from the brightness temperatures observed by MWTS-3, and a comparative analysis is performed with its predecessor (MWTS-2). This paper analyzes the characteristics of the striping noise of both instruments and its possible impact on their observations. The results show that the striping noise of MWTS-3 has been significantly reduced in most of the 17 channels. In particular, the striping noise of MWTS-3's channel 3 is reduced by nearly half compared to the channel of MWTS-2 with the same frequency. Furthermore, the interchannel correlations for MWTS-3 are significantly lower than those for MWTS-2. After noise mitigation, the interchannel correlations of both MWTS-2 and MWTS-3 are obviously reduced. In addition, striping noise mitigation can reduce observation errors to some extent, especially for channels above the middle troposphere.

TI  - Natura 2000 Grassland Habitats Mapping Based on Spectro-Temporal Dimension of Sentinel-2 Images with Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat mapping is essential for the management and monitoring of Natura 2000 sites. Time-consuming field surveys are still the most frequently used solution for the implementation of the European Habitats Directive, but the use of remote sensing tools for this is becoming more common. The high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 data, registering the visible, near, and shortwave infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, makes them valuable material in this context. In this study, we aimed to use multitemporal Sentinel-2 data for mapping three grassland Natura 2000 habitats in Poland. We performed the classification based on spectro-temporal features extracted from data collected from eight different terms within the year 2017 using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and we also tested other widely used machine learning algorithms for comparison, such as Random Forests (RFs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Based on ground truth data, we randomly selected training and validation polygons and then performed the evaluation iteratively (100 times). The best resulting median F1 accuracies that we obtained for habitats were as follows: 6210, 0.85; 6410, 0.80; and 6510, 0.84 (with SVM). Finally, we concluded that the accuracy of the results was comparable, but we obtained the best results using SVM (median OA = 88%, with 86% for RF and 84% for CNNs). In this work, we confirmed the usefulness of the spectral dimension of Sentinel-2 time series data for mapping grassland habitats, and researchers of future work can further develop the use of CNNs for this purpose.

TI  - Estimating the Impact of Assimilating Cirrus Cloud-Contaminated Hyperspectral Infrared Radiances for Numerical Weather Prediction
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of hyperspectral infrared sounders (HIS) observations aboard Earth-observing satellites has become vital to numerical weather prediction, yet this assimilation is predicated on the assumption of clear-sky obser-vations. Using collocated assimilated observations from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), it is found that nearly 7.7% of HIS observations assimilated by the Naval Research Laboratory Variational Data Assimilation System-Accelerated Representer (NAVDAS-AR) are contaminated by cirrus clouds. These contaminating clouds primarily exhibit visible cloud optical depths at 532 nm (COD532nm) below 0.10 and cloud-top temperatures between 240 and 185 K as expected for cirrus clouds. These contamination statistics are consistent with simulations from the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) model showing a cirrus cloud with a COD532nm of 0.10 imparts brightness temperature differences below typical innovation thresholds used by NAVDAS-AR. Using a one-dimensional variational (1DVar) assimilation system coupled with RTTOV for forward and gradient radiative transfer, the analysis temperature and moisture impact of assimilating cirrus-contaminated HIS observations is estimated. Large differences of 2.5 Kin temperature and 11 Kin dewpoint are possible for a cloud with COD532nm of 0.10 and cloud-top temperature of 210 K. When normalized by the contamination statistics, global differences of nearly 0.11 K in tempera-ture and 0.34 K in dewpoint are possible, with temperature and dewpoint tropospheric root-mean-squared errors (RMSDs) as large as 0.06 and 0.11 K, respectively. While in isolation these global estimates are not particularly concerning, differ-ences are likely much larger in regions with high cirrus frequency.

TI  - Wolf Is Back: A Novel Sensitive Sentinel Rejoins the <i>Trichinella</i> Cycle in the Western Alps
T2  - VETERINARY SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Trichinellosis is a foodborne disease caused by the nematode Trichinella. Human trichinellosis represents a public health hazard with a great socioeconomic impact in food safety, and it occurs by consumption of raw or undercooked infected meat. As apex predators, wolves may represent important actors in maintaining this parasite, although to date, there is a lack of information on Trichinella prevalence in the Western Alps where wolves have recently made return. The main aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of Trichinella infection in grey wolves and discuss the epidemiological role played by this apex predator in the early phases of their return. During the period 2017-2022, we analyzed 130 muscle samples from individual wolves found dead in the Western Alps. Trichinella larvae were found in 15 wolves. Results suggest that, after recolonization of Northern Italy, the wolf has rejoined the Trichinella cycle and already plays a sensitive sentinel role for this zoonotic pathogen. The possible role played as new maintenance host is discussed and knowledge gaps are highlighted. Trichinella is a foodborne parasite whose wildlife reservoirs are represented by carnivores and omnivores with predatory and scavenger behavior. The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of Trichinella infection in grey wolves (Canis lupus) that recolonized the Western Alps from the end of the past century, and discuss the epidemiological role played by this apex predator in the early phases of its return. During the period 2017-2022, diaphragm samples were obtained from 130 individuals collected in the frame of a wolf mortality survey. Trichinella larvae were found in 15 wolves (11.53%) with a parasite intensity of 11.74 larvae per gram. Trichinella britovi was the only species identified. This is the first prevalence survey of Trichinella in wolves recolonizing the Alps. Results suggest that, in this particular biotope, the wolf has rejoined the Trichinella cycle and has the potential to play an increasingly important role as maintenance host. Arguments in favor and against this perspective are discussed and knowledge gaps highlighted. The calculated Trichinella larval biomass in the estimated wolf population roaming in Northwest Italy will serve as baseline value to explore possible shifts in the relative importance of wolves as Trichinella reservoir within the regional carnivore community. Finally, wolves re-colonizing the Alps already appear as sensitive sentinels to monitor the risk of Trichinella zoonotic transmission by infected wild boar meat.

TI  - Feasibility Study of Detection of Ochre Spot on Almonds Aimed at Very Low-Cost Cameras Onboard a Drone
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drones can be very helpful in precision agriculture. Currently, most drone-based solutions for plant disease detection incorporate multispectral, hyperspectral, or thermal cameras, which are expensive. In addition, there is a trend nowadays to apply machine learning techniques to precision agriculture, which are computationally complex and intensive. In this work, we explore the feasibility of detecting ochre spot disease in almond plantations based on conventional techniques of computer vision and images from a very low-cost RGB camera that is placed on board a drone. Such an approach will allow the detection system to be simple and inexpensive. First, we made a study of color on the ochre spot disease. Second, we developed a specific algorithm that was capable of processing and analyzing limited-quality images from a very low-cost camera. In addition, it can estimate the percentage of healthy and unhealthy parts of the plant. Thanks to the GPS on board the drone, the system can provide the location of every sick almond tree. Third, we checked the operation of the algorithm with a variety of photographs of ochre spot disease in almonds. The study demonstrates that the efficiency of the algorithm depends to a great extent on environmental conditions, but, despite the limitations, the results obtained with the analyzed photographs show a maximum discrepancy of 10% between the estimated percentage and the ground truth percentage of the unhealthy area. This approach shows great potential for extension to other crops by making previous studies of color and adaptations.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work reveals the potential of Landsat 8 and ASTER imagery in the lithological discrimination and structural lineaments extraction in the Tiwit region (Jbel Saghro). Various remote sensing and image processing techniques were applied to the Landsat 8 and ASTER scenes: False-color composites (RGB 751 & 531), Principal Component Analysis (PCA 653 & 821), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF 643 & 541), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA 137 & 235). These techniques discriminate the granitic formations (Isk-n-Alla, Mimasmarane, Ibantarn, and Ikniwn), the rhyolitic and ignimbrite formation (Amtattouch, Ouzarzamand Assaka), and other various rock types (aphanitic basalts, sandstones, conglomerates, etc.). Maximum Likelihood, Spectral Angle Mapper, and Mahalanobis distance classifiers show an overall accuracy of 88%, 56%, and 82.6%, respectively, for Landsat 8. ASTER data show a better result in classification with an overall accuracy of 90.6%, 84%, and 88% for the same classifiers. Structural lineaments are extracted using manual (visual interpretation) and automatique (LINE algorithm) approaches on both datasets. The extracted lineaments show NE-SW, E-W, and ENE-WSW trends for ASTER and Landsat 8 data, these results are consistent with the geologic map of Tiwit. Ultimately, the study demonstrates that ASTER data is more effective for lithological discrimination and structural lineaments mapping.

TI  - Inter-Seasonal Estimation of Grass Water Content Indicators Using Multisource Remotely Sensed Data Metrics and the Cloud-Computing Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Indicators of grass water content (GWC) have a significant impact on eco-hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration and rainfall interception. Several site-specific factors such as seasonal precipitation, temperature, and topographic variations cause soil and ground moisture content variations, which have significant impacts on GWC. Estimating GWC using multisource data may provide robust and accurate predictions, making it a useful tool for plant water quantification and management at various landscape scales. In this study, Sentinel-2 MSI bands, spectral derivatives combined with topographic and climatic variables, were used to estimate leaf area index (LAI), canopy storage capacity (CSC), canopy water content (CWC) and equivalent water thickness (EWT) as indicators of GWC within the communal grasslands in Vulindlela across wet and dry seasons based on single-year data. The results illustrate that the use of combined spectral and topo-climatic variables, coupled with random forest (RF) in the Google Earth Engine (GEE), improved the prediction accuracies of GWC variables across wet and dry seasons. LAI was optimally estimated in the wet season with an RMSE of 0.03 m(-2) and R-2 of 0.83, comparable to the dry season results, which exhibited an RMSE of 0.04 m(-2) and R-2 of 0.90. Similarly, CSC was estimated with high accuracy in the wet season (RMSE = 0.01 mm and R-2 = 0.86) when compared to the RMSE of 0.03 mm and R-2 of 0.93 obtained in the dry season. Meanwhile, for CWC, the wet season results show an RMSE of 19.42 g/m(-2) and R-2 of 0.76, which were lower than the accuracy of RMSE = 1.35 g/m(-2) and R-2 = 0.87 obtained in the dry season. Finally, EWT was best estimated in the dry season, yielding a model accuracy of RMSE = 2.01 g/m(-2) and R-2 = 0.91 as compared to the wet season (RMSE = 10.75 g/m(-2) and R-2 = 0.65). CSC was best optimally predicted amongst all GWC variables in both seasons. The optimal variables for estimating these GWC variables included the red-edge, near-infrared region (NIR) and short-wave infrared region (SWIR) bands and spectral derivatives, as well as environmental variables such as rainfall and temperature across both seasons. The use of multisource data improved the prediction accuracies for GWC indicators across both seasons. Such information is crucial for rangeland managers in understanding GWC variations across different seasons as well as different ecological gradients.

TI  - Evaluation of the Linkages between Ecosystem Services and Land Use/Land Cover Changes in Matenchose Watershed, Rift Valley Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - QUATERNARY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global ecosystem services that are essential to sustaining life on the planet have been disrupted by different anthropogenic activities. This study's objective is to examine how ecosystem services vary with changes in land use and land cover (LULC) across 29 years at the Matenchose watershed. Landsat images for 1991 (TM), 2003 (ETM+), and 2020 (OLI-8) were used for the categorization of LULC. To evaluate the changes in ecosystems service valuations (ESVs) as a result of LULC changes in combination with ArcGIS, the value transfer valuation approach was utilized. Farmlands, towns, and bare land exhibited growing trends among the five major LULC classes, but forest and grassland showed declining trends. From 1991 to 2020, ESVs decreased by a total of US $157.24 million due to the LULC modifications. In terms of ESV functions, provisional services (US $89.23 million) and cultural services (US $69.36 million) made up the majority of the loss of ESV. Overall, the reduction of ESV showed the environment is degrading because of existing LULC changes, this calls for immediate sustainable land management intervention by responsible actors. To attain sustainable development goals regarding food and life on the land, it is imperative to reverse the loss of ecosystem services.

TI  - Ideographic dictionary of architecture and design terminology of the Russian language
T2  - VOPROSY LEKSIKOGRAFII-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses reasons for compiling a dictionary of architectural and design terms in the Russian language. The topicality of creating it is connected with the brisk growth of design activity, the branching out of a new training program, Design of Architectural Environment, and the absence of a linguistic terminological dictionary of this professional sphere. The aim of the article is to describe the conception of an ideographic dictionary of Russian architectural and design terminology. The dictionary is based on the special language of architecture and design selected from terminological reference books, educational materials and research literature, commercial catalogues, professional weblogs, websites, and e-commerce sites. The dictionary defines not only terms, but also terminoids, preterms and quasi-terms, and pays special attention to the foreign terminological units and neologisms. This is caused by the under-investigated functional lexis of the architectural environment design sphere, variability and movability of its concepts and terms. The research methods and techniques used in the study are: the lexicographical method with the research techniques of thematic (ideographic) arrangement, definition, componential and contextual analyses. The chosen type of an ideographic dictionary defined its marco-structure: it is represented by a system of thematic groups, subgroups and microgroups, contributes to the development of a holistic professional worldview, and facilitates work with the dictionary. The microstructure shows the content of a lexical entry including core and optional components as well as its design. The core components include the headword with its variants, their stresses and pronunciation features, information on the word's grammar, its definition and examples of its usage in professional speech. The optional components (etymology, derivatives, terminological collocations with the headword, analogues, synonyms and illustrations) are used as supplementary characteristics of a lexical item if available. Definitions are made by the principle of generic, genetic, operational and contextual explanations with elements of encyclopedic information. The dictionary is intended for linguists, terminologists, students and teachers of the disciplines of the Design of the Architectural Environment training programs, and is of interest to professionals in this field.

TI  - Lymph node metastatic patterns and the development of multidisciplinary treatment for esophageal cancer
T2  - DISEASES OF THE ESOPHAGUS
M3  - Review
AB  - Abundant lymphatic flow and the anatomical location of the esophagus can result in the widespread distribution of lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer from the cervical to the abdominal field. Historically, the Japan Esophageal Society and American Joint Committee on Cancer offer two different classifications of lymph node group location surrounding the esophagus. The location of sentinel lymph nodes in midthoracic esophageal cancer reflects the variety of lymphatic drainage routes. In fact, in cT1N0 esophageal cancer, pathological lymph node metastasis has been observed from the cervical to the abdominal field, and the locations were shown to be closely linked to the primary tumor location in advanced stages. While the impact of histology on the distribution of LN metastasis has been extensively debated, a recent prospective study on esophagogastric junction cancer found that metastatic patterns did not differ by histology. Thoracic duct lymph nodes were defined as one of the regional lymph node stations in the mediastinum. Although lymph node metastasis around the thoracic duct has occasionally been observed, the oncologic impact of thoracic duct lymph node dissection has not been fully elucidated. To eradicate tumors locoregionally, three-field lymph node dissection, a strategy for extended lymph node clearance, has been established. In esophagectomy, three-field lymph node dissection is defined as a procedure for complete regional cervico-thoraco-abdominal lymph node dissection. However, its therapeutic efficacy must be evaluated based on the balance between oncological outcomes and possible added surgical risk. To further improve survival, multidisciplinary treatment consisting of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy has been established worldwide as a standard treatment for esophageal cancer. Now that neoadjuvant therapy followed by esophagectomy is the standard, adding adjuvant therapy including immunotherapy could be a promising treatment option. The ideal combination of various multidisciplinary treatment approaches and extensive LN dissection need to be established to improve the oncological outcomes for EC patients.

TI  - A field parcel-oriented approach to evaluate the crop cover- management factor and time-distributed erosion risk in Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The crop cover-management (C-) factor in arable landscapes describes the soil erosion susceptibility associated with seasonally cultivated crops. Previous informatic and computational limitations have led many modelling studies to prescribe C-factor values and assume spatial and temporal stationarity. However, the multiple influencing factors ranging from parcel-scale crop cultivation and management to regional-scale rainfall regimes motivates new methods to capture this variation when identifying at-risk areas. Here, we define a multi-component method to derive the C-factor by associating time series of canopy and residue surface cover from Sentinel-2 and climate-specific rainfall erosivity with Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) field parcel data from European Union member states. A scalable and standardised method is emphasised to increase the future interoperability and inter -comparability of soil erosion modelling studies deploying the C-factor. Additionally, field parcel simu-lation units with associated crop declarations provide a new reference scale to link predictions of soil erosion risk with specific management decisions and declarations by farmers. After implementing the method on a homogenised subsample of 8600 field parcels covering available IACS regions, several key findings are outlined: 1) time series information provides new opportunities to predict the time -criticality of erosion in specific crop cultivations, 2) the varying (a-)synchronicity between seasonal crop canopy cover and heavy rainstorms means that spatial variability is inherent within the C-factor across Europe, and 3) the addition of agricultural management practices (e.g. tillage practice de-scriptions) to open-access IACS repositories can facilitate more comprehensive evaluations of the C -factor and soil erosion risk.

TI  - Cardiovascular, respiratory and all-cause (natural) health endpoint estimation using a spatial approach in Malaysia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide were attributable to exposure to particulate matter 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). This study assessed the environmental burden of disease attributable to PM2.5 at the national level in Malaysia. We estimated the population-weighted exposure level (PWEL) of PM10 concentrations in Malaysia for 2000, 2008, and 2013 using aerosol optical density (AOD) data from publicly available remote sensing satellite data (MODIS Terra). The PWEL was then converted to PM2.5 using Malaysia's WHO ambient air conversion factor. We used AirQ+ 2.0 software to calculate all-cause (natural), ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer (LC), and acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) excess deaths from the National Burden of Disease data for 2000, 2008 and 2013. The average PWELs for annual PM2.5 for 2000, 2008, and 2013 were 22 mu g m-3, 18 mu g m-3 and 24 mu g m-3, respectively. Using the WHO 2005 Air Quality Guideline cut-off point of PM2.5 of 10 mu g m-3, the estimated excess deaths for 2000, 2008, and 2013 from all-cause (natural) mortality were between 5893 and 9781 (95 a/o CI: 3347-12,791), COPD was between 164 and 957 (95 a/o CI: 95-1411), lung cancer was between 109 and 307 (95 a/o CI: 63-437), IHD was between 3 and 163 deaths, according to age groups (95 % CI: 2-394) and stroke was between 6 and 155 deaths, according to age groups (95 % CI: 3-261). An increase in estimated health endpoints was associated with increased estimated PWEL PM2.5 for 2013 compared to 2000 and 2008. Adhering the ambient PM2.5 level to the Malaysian Air Quality Standard IT-2 would reduce the national health endpoints mortality.

TI  - An Urban Scheme for the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System: Global Forecasts and Residential CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of urbanization on local weather patterns affects over half the global population. Global numerical weather prediction systems have reached a resolution at which urban conurbations can be spatially resolved, justifying their representation within land surface parameterizations with the aim of improving local predictions. Additionally, real-time atmospheric monitoring of trace gas emissions can utilize weather variables relevant for urban areas. We investigated whether a simple single-layer urban canopy scheme can be used within a global forecast model to jointly improve predictions of near-surface weather variables and residential CO2 emissions. The scheme has been implemented in the Integrated Forecast System used operationally at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts running at similar to 9 km horizontal resolution. First, we selected a suitable urban land cover map (ECOCLIMAP-SG) based on comparisons with regional data and land surface temperature MODIS retrievals. The urban scheme is verified by providing improved 2 m temperature (similar to 10%) and 10 m wind (similar to 17%) RMSE values for both summer and winter months around urban environments. The influence of the scheme was most noticeable at night. Additionally, we have implemented a simple temperature-dependent residential emissions model to calculate real-time CO2 heating emissions. These were validated against existing offline products, national reporting and by comparing atmospheric simulations with total column CO2 observations. The results show an improved temporal variability of emissions, which arise from synoptic scale temperature changes. Given the improved predictability from the urban scheme for both weather and emissions, it will be operationally implemented in an upcoming model cycle.

AB  - The global community faces challenges of agroecosystem sustainability in the face of changing climate and intensified agriculture, particularly in Africa. In this study, annual and seasonal cropland Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) trends and phonological variations, and associated key drivers in North-East Africa were generated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectral-radiometer NDVI of 8-day satellite images and climate data between 2001 and 2020, which were further analyzed by a modified dynamic threshold method. The results showed that the annual cropland NDVI increased at an average rate of 0.0106 per year. The seasonal cropland NDVI was positive for the most significant changes observed in the boreal autumn season across the region. The start of the season and end of the season cropland NDVI in the boreal autumn season increased at an average rate of 0.015 (13.4% significant, p < 0.05), and 0.0151 x (12.8% significant, p < 0.05), respectively. The findings indicated that the boreal autumn season was getting longer, whereas the boreal summer season was becoming shorter during the last two decades. The most rapid cropland NDVI changes and maximum farmland NDVI variability were observed in the sub-tropic warm arid and tropic warm semiarid agro-ecological zones. The land surface temperature was found to be the main driving factor for the cropland NDVI and associated agroecosystem changes. This study provides essential information on the cropland productivity and shifting of greening patterns, which will support climate change mitigation measures at national and regional scales, contributing to sustainable agriculture.Plain Language Summary Climate change and land use change impose various impacts on agricultural productivity and agroecosystem services in Africa. In this research, we analyzed annual and seasonal cropland changes using time series Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) as monthly image composites from 2001 to 2020. We assessed key transition stages in the vegetation and crop phenology trends including annual cropland NDVI, the start of the growing season (SOS), and the end of the growing season (EOS). At an annual time-step, there were more greening patterns across large parts of North-East Africa with the highest greening trends in the croplands of Egypt followed by Uganda and South Sudan, while more browning patterns were in Djibouti, Eritrea, and Somalia. The most greening and significant SOS trends were shown in the boreal autumn season, while negative EOS trends were common in the boreal summer season. The boreal summer was getting shorter as the boreal autumn experienced longer periods. The sub-tropic warm arid and tropic warm semiarid agro-ecological zones showed the highest farmland productivity changes. The cropland NDVI changes was strongly associated with land surface temperature. The study provides important phonological information, which is helpful to understand the challenges of food security at a regional scale.

TI  - Machine Learning for Detection of Macroalgal Blooms in the Mar Menor Coastal Lagoon Using Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mar Menor coastal lagoon in southeastern Spain has experienced a decline in water quality due to increased nutrient input, leading to the eutrophication of the lagoon and the occurrence of microalgal and macroalgal blooms. This study analyzes the macroalgal bloom that occurred in the lagoon during the spring-summer of 2022. A set of machine learning techniques are applied to Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in order to obtain indicators of the presence of macroalgae in specific locations within the lagoon. This is supported by in situ observations of the blooming process in different areas of the Mar Menor. Our methodology successfully identifies the macroalgal bloom locations (accuracies above 98%, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficients above 78% in all cases), and provides a probabilistic approach to understand the likelihood of occurrence of this event in given pixels. The analysis also identifies the key parameters contributing to the classification of pixels as algae, which could be used to develop future algorithms for detecting macroalgal blooms. This information can be used by environmental managers to implement early warning and mitigation strategies to prevent water quality deterioration in the lagoon. The usefulness of satellite observations for ecological and crisis management at local and regional scales is also highlighted.

TI  - Spatiotemporal subsidence over Pabdana coal mine Kerman Province, central Iran using time-series of Sentinel-1 remote sensing imagery
T2  - EPISODES
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental monitoring of mining regions using sat-ellite imagery is crucial for sustainable exploitation and preventing geohazards. Movements due to the failure of the roof in underground coal mining, by migrating upwards and outwards from the seam being mined, could eventu-ally appear as ground deformation. To investigate the mat-ter further, the surface deformation that occurred over the Pabdana mining area was monitored in three time periods, between October 2, 2014, and July 27, 2019. Persistent scat-terer interferometry (PSI) was used based on 150 ascending and descending Sentinel-1A images. The maximum min-ing subsidence rate during the studied periods was about 30 to 35 mm/yr. The PSI analysis shows that the subsid-ence rate varied both temporally and spatially during the three studied periods. The time series and the displacement rate for various cross-sections highlight a clear quantitative relationship between coal extraction progress and sub-sidence, which proceeded southward throughout the three study periods. So, considering coal mining subsidence as a geohazard, land developments and structures over the mining area may be safeguarded. The approach used in this investigation can be implemented in other similar coal mining zones.

TI  - Response of the Thick and Thin Debris-Covered Glaciers between 1971 and 2019 in Ladakh Himalaya, India-A Case Study from Pensilungpa and Durung-Drung Glaciers
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to broadly understand the response of glaciers to thick and thin debris cover from one of the less explored regions (Zanskar) of the Himalaya. The present study is based on ground-based measurements (from 2015 to 2019), satellite data (since 1971), and available topographic maps (at a 1:50,000 scale). The study includes snout retreat, changes in equilibrium line altitude (ELA), surface elevation, and modeled mass balance of thick and thin debris-covered Pensilungpa (Suru River basin) and Durung-Drung (Doda River basin) glaciers in the western Indian Himalaya, Ladakh, for the past five decades. The Durung-Drung Glacier (DDG) receded similar to-624 +/- 547 m with an average rate of -12 +/- 11 m a(-1) between 1971 and 2019. The frontal part of the DDG is broad (similar to 2 km wide), which shows wide discrepancies in its retreat. Compared to DDG, the small and narrow snout of the Pensilungpa Glacier (PG) retreated -270.5 +/- 27.5 m (1971 to 2019), with an average rate of -5.6 +/- 0.57 m a(-1). Similarly, the four years (2015-2019) of field observations suggest that the retreat rate of PG and DDG is -6.7 +/- 3 and -18 +/- 15 m a(-1), and the rate of modeled glacier mass loss is -0.29 +/- 0.3 and -0.3 +/- 0.3 m w.e. a(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the ELA of the DDG and PG between 1971 and 2019 increased by similar to 59 +/- 38 and similar to 23 +/- 19 m, respectively. The change in the longitudinal profile of the glaciers along the centerline between 2000 and 2017 shows the DDG and PG lost similar to 17 and 15 m surface ice thickness. The change in debris cover plays a critical role in the glacier surface lowering, shrinkage, retreat, and mass balance. Hence, we quantitatively evaluated the influence of the debris cover on summer ablation and terminus recession on two different characteristic glaciers (DDG and PG) with its potential effect on the mass balance process (area-volume loss).

TI  - Spatial and temporal sampling strategy connecting NEON Terrestrial Observation System protocols
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Ecological Observatory Network Terrestrial Observation System (NEON TOS) produces open-access data products that allow data users to investigate the impact of change drivers on key "sentinel " taxa and soils. The spatial and temporal sampling strategy that coordinates implementation of these protocols enables integration across TOS products and with products generated by NEON aquatic, remote sensing, and terrestrial instrument subsystems. Here, we illustrate the plots and sampling units that make up the physical foundation of a NEON TOS site, and we describe the scales (subplot, plot, airshed, and site) at which sampling is spatially colocated across protocols and subsystems. We also describe how moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer-enhanced vegetation index (MODIS-EVI) phenology data are used to temporally coordinate TOS sampling within and across years at the continental scale of the observatory. Individually, TOS protocols produce data products that provide insight into populations, communities, and ecosystem processes. Within the spatial and temporal framework that guides cross-protocol implementation, the ability to draw inference across data products is enhanced. To illustrate this point, we develop an example using R software that links two TOS data products collected with different temporal frequencies at both plot and site spatial scales. A thorough understanding of how TOS protocols are integrated with each other in space and time, and with other NEON subsystems, is necessary to leverage NEON data products to maximum effect. For example, a researcher must understand the spatial and temporal scales at which soil biogeochemistry data, soil microbe biomass data, and plant litter production and chemistry data may be combined to quantify soil nutrient stocks and fluxes across NEON sites. We present clear links among TOS protocols and across NEON subsystems that will enhance the utility of NEON TOS data products for the data user community.

TI  - Monitoring groundwater storage in a fractured volcanic aquifer system
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of groundwater resources is under increasing pressure to meet the demands of the society. Despite this, the understanding of its availability is still limited when compared to other water reserves. The aquifer studied was the volcanic Serra Geral Aquifer System (SASG) located in a humid subtropical region. This research aims to explore in a pioneering way the large-scale hydrogeological processes taking place at the SASG using a unique and complementary tool of intensive field monitoring, remote sensing data, and hydrological modeling. Results showed a fast response of groundwater levels to rainfall, with an average of 29 days of lag times. We also identified areas in the southern region of the basin with higher depletion rates, with GRACE results indicating a negative trend (- 57 mm year(-1)) associated with a major recharge event that occurred in the region before the period monitored. Also, the interflow calculated using the MGB hydrological model showed that the flow within the limits between the soil and the volcanic rocks (different in hydraulic conductivity) varies spatially, influencing the baseflow of rivers as for slopes and soil capacity to store water.

TI  - Random Forest Classification of Multitemporal Landsat 8 Spectral Data and Phenology Metrics for Land Cover Mapping in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial data and tools evolve as new technologies are developed and landscape change occurs over time. As a result, these data may become outdated and inadequate for supporting critical habitat-related work across the international boundary in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts Bird Conservation Region (BCR 33) due to the area's complex vegetation communities and the discontinuity in data availability across the United States (US) and Mexico (MX) border. This research aimed to produce the first 30 m continuous land cover map of BCR 33 by prototyping new methods for desert vegetation classification using the Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) method. The developed RF classification model utilized multitemporal Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager spectral and vegetation index data from the period of 2013-2020, and phenology metrics tailored to capture the unique growing seasons of desert vegetation. Our RF model achieved an overall classification F-score of 0.80 and an overall accuracy of 91.68%. Our results portrayed the vegetation cover at a much finer resolution than existing land cover maps from the US and MX portions of the study area, allowing for the separation and identification of smaller habitat pockets, including riparian communities, which are critically important for desert wildlife and are often misclassified or nonexistent in current maps. This early prototyping effort serves as a proof of concept for the ML and data fusion methods that will be used to generate the final high-resolution land cover map of the entire BCR 33 region.

TI  - Impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the normalized difference vegetation index of desertified areas in northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in maintaining ecosystem stability, promoting biodiversity conservation, serving as windbreaks, and facilitating sand fixation in deserts. Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS NDVI) and climate data, a Theil-Sen median trend analysis combined with the Mann-Kendall test and partial correlation and residual analyses were employed to explore spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation dynamics and key drivers in the Badain Jaran and Tengger deserts and Mu Us Sandy Land. Data were collected during the growing season between 2001 and 2020. Further analyses quantified the relative contribution of climate variation and anthropogenic activities to NDVI changes. Results revealed a predominantly increasing trend for average NDVI. The spread of average annual NDVI and growth trends of the vegetation were determined to be influenced by spatial differences. The area with improved vegetation was greater than that of the degraded region. Climate variability and human activities were driving forces controlling vegetation cover changes, and their effects on vegetation dynamics varied by region. The response of vegetation dynamics was stronger for precipitation than temperature, indicating that precipitation was the main climate variable influencing the NDVI changes. The relative role of human activities was responsible for > 70% of the changes, demonstrating that human activities were the main driving factor of the NDVI changes. The implementation of ecological engineering is a key driver of increased vegetation coverage and has improved regional environmental quality. These results enhance our knowledge regarding NDVI change affected by climate variation and human activities and can provide future theoretical guidance for ecological restoration in arid areas.

TI  - Death anxiety and mental health: Requiem for a dreamer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, there has been an increased interest in the role of death anxiety in a broad range of mental health disorders. It has been argued that the fear of death may be a transdiagnostic variable contributing to the development and maintenance of many chronic mental health problems. Further, it has been suggested that death anxiety may be responsible for relapse and the emergence of new disorders in patients that have received successful treatment for earlier conditions in their lives. Given this, the purpose of the present selective review is to: (1) explore contemporary theoretical accounts of the role of death anxiety in a broad range of human be-haviours; (2) examine evidence for death anxiety as a key variable in mental health disorders; (3) examine evidence on the treatment of death anxiety in both non-clinical and clinical populations; (4) describe the limi-tations of the current literature, and; (5) provide a detailed description of the critical future directions for this field.

TI  - comparison of Czech and Slovak lexical nuclei using vocabulary parametric analysis
T2  - VOPROSY LEKSIKOGRAFII-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article suggests a solution to the problem of the sister languages ' vocabulary comparison. The subject of research is Czech and Slovak vocabulary given in small bilingual dictionaries. The same metalanguage (Russian) of the definitions in such dictionaries makes the semantic analysis of vocabulary easy. The basic method is parametric analysis. It implies the ranking of words of a language according to four system parameters: functional, syntagmatic, paradigmatic, and epidigmatic ones. For each parameter, it is necessary to distinguish a local nucleus, which includes about 1000 words. Local parametric vocabulary nuclei make it possible to identify (1) the shortest, i.e. non-derivative and common (frequently used) vocabulary in these Slavonic languages; (2) vocabulary most commonly used in various fixed expressions and collocations; ( 3) vocabulary that forms the largest synonymic chains; (4) the most polysemantic vocabulary. The addition of local nuclei allows forming a big parametric nucleus. It includes words, which possess parametric weight values based on at least three parameters (out of four). For Czech, the big parametric nucleus comprises 279 words. For Slovak, it comprises 282 words. These lexical sets present the subject of the further analysis aimed at classifying the meanings of the words. At first, the authors establish that Czech and Slovak nuclei contain 61 words meaning the same in both languages. Besides, among them, there are 30 words that possess not only the same meaning but the same form as well. The big parametric nuclei do not contain false friends, i.e. words that look similar but differ in meaning. Then the authors do qualitative analysis of nuclear lexemes ' semantics. They find out that, in Czech and Slovak, basic semantic groups are formally similar, but they differ in intragroup distribution. Language data illustrate the fact that such semantic groups as '' Activity '', '' Abstract Notions '', '' Human Being '' are the dominant semantic groups in both languages. In the Slovak big parametric nucleus, a quantitative gap between them is less perceptible than in the Czech one. Besides, the semantic group '' Human Being '' occupies a higher position in the Slovak parametric nucleus. The dominance of the semantic group '' Activity '' and of the big parametric nucleus, as well as a negligible percent of words in the subgroup '' Imitating Activity '', justifies the fact that, for Czech native speakers, not a person but a person-agent is of a particular importance. At the same time, the high percents of the semantic group '' Nature '' and of subgroup '' A Person of Nature '' prove that great attention to nature objects is a feature of Slovak native speakers ' worldview.

TI  - Effects of Solar Resource Sampling Rate and Averaging Interval on Hourly Modeling Errors
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy modeling errors due to time-averaged hourly inputs are significant where solar resource variability and inverter loading ratio are both high. However, predictions of photovoltaic (PV) system performance are most frequently made with hourly solar resource inputs, typically computed from satellite data obtained every 15 or 30 min. Therefore, we studied the effects of solar resource sampling rate and time-averaging interval on hourly modeling errors by using high-frequency measurements from eight different locations across the United States. When we selected minute-average measurements at various sampling rates and averaged them to hourly data, we observed increasing modeling errors for sampling rates 30 min or shorter. At a 30-min sampling rate averaged hourly, we observed an error that was 50% of 1-min samples averaged hourly. As sampling rate approached 60 min, modeling errors decreased, partially canceling out due to the randomness of the low-frequency sampled data. We examined PV systems with dc-ac ratios > 1.3 and observed that clipping errors dominated modeling errors from other sources like transposition to plane-of-array irradiance at sites with greater solar variability. Based on our analysis, we recommend that an hourly modeling correction be applied whenever hourly inputs are used, especially at sites with high solar variability and dc-ac ratios greater than one.

TI  - Country-Level Modeling of Forest Fires in Austria and the Czech Republic: Insights from Open-Source Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are becoming a serious concern in Central European countries such as Austria (AT) and the Czech Republic (CZ). Mapping fire ignition probabilities across countries can be a useful tool for fire risk mitigation. This study was conducted to: (i) evaluate the contribution of the variables obtained from open-source datasets (i.e., MODIS, OpenStreetMap, and WorldClim) for modeling fire ignition probability at the country level; and (ii) investigate how well the Random Forest (RF) method performs from one country to another. The importance of the predictors was evaluated using the Gini impurity method, and RF was evaluated using the ROC-AUC and confusion matrix. The most important variables were the topographic wetness index in the AT model and slope in the CZ model. The AUC values in the validation sets were 0.848 (AT model) and 0.717 (CZ model). When the respective models were applied to the entire dataset, they achieved 82.5% (AT model) and 66.4% (CZ model) accuracy. Cross-comparison revealed that the CZ model may be successfully applied to the AT dataset (AUC = 0.808, Acc = 82.5%), while the AT model showed poor explanatory power when applied to the CZ dataset (AUC = 0.582, Acc = 13.6%). Our study provides insights into the effect of the accuracy and completeness of open-source data on the reliability of national-level forest fire probability assessment.

TI  - Unrecorded Tundra Fires of the Arctic Slope, Alaska USA
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Few fires are known to have burned the tundra of the Arctic Slope north of the Brooks Range in Alaska, USA. A total of 90 fires between 1969 and 2022 are known. Because fire has been rare, old burns can be detected by the traces of thermokarst and distinct vegetation they leave in otherwise uniform tundra, which are visible in aerial photograph archives. Several prehistoric tundra burns have been found in this way. Detection of tundra fires in this sparsely populated and remote area has been historically inconsistent and opportunistic, relying on reports by aircraft pilots. Fire reports have been logged into an administrative database which, out of necessity, has been used to scientifically evaluate changes in the fire regime. To improve the consistency of the record, we completed a systematic search of Landsat Collection 2 for the Brooks Range Foothills ecoregion over the period 1972-2022. We found 57 unrecorded tundra burns, about 41% of the total, which now numbers 138. Only 15% and 33% of all fires appear in MODIS and VIIRS satellite-borne thermal anomaly products, respectively. The fire frequency in the first 37 years of the record is 0.89 y(-1) for natural ignitions that spread >= 10 ha. Frequency in the last 13 years is 2.5 y(-1), indicating a nearly three-fold increase in fire frequency.

TI  - Assessing variations in land cover-land use and surface temperature dynamics for Dehradun, India, using multi-time and multi-sensor landsat data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation and industrialisation coupled with overpopulation have altered land cover/land use (LCLU) and surface temperature (ST) patterns in Dehradun. Monitoring these changes through satellite-based remote sensing is required to ensure the sustained development of this ecologically fragile region. Here, LU and ST dynamics of the Dehradun municipal area have been estimated using Landsat-5 datasets for 1991, 1998, and 2008 and Landsat-8 dataset for 2018. LU maps have been extracted using a Gaussian Maximum Likelihood classifier with an overall accuracy of over 88% and Kappa coefficients above 0.85. Results reveal that the urban region expanded by 80.6% in the 27 years while dense vegetation and dry river bed classes have declined sharply. Sparse vegetation has risen by 3 km(2), whereas bare ground has decreased by about 4.3 km(2). Mean ST has increased above 9 degrees C from 1991 to 2018 in every season. A seasonal influence is evident on the mean ST per LU class's trend, which rose between 8 degrees C and 12 degrees C for every LU class, indicating significant warming across each LU class. ST probably has non-linear relationships with its causal factors represented by spectral indices, elevation, and population density. Urban heat island (UHI) formation is thus evinced, promulgating the administration's urgent action to save the environment and redrawing policies for ambitious projects like smart cities.

TI  - Accounting for Correlated AMV Satellite Observation Errors in the Ensemble Data Assimilation System
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of considering correlated errors in AMV (Atmospheric Motion Vectors) satellite observations of wind in the local ensemble transform Kalman filter data assimilation system is studied. It is customary to use a diagonal covariance matrix of errors in observations taking part in assimilation. When assimilating satellite data with correlated errors, the data are thinned, and the values of diagonal elements of the error covariance matrix are often overestimated. This is accompanied by the loss of useful information about the correlation between the errors. The present study uses a different method: the elements of the error covariance matrix for AMV satellite observations are simulated using a second-order autoregressive function. It is shown that such approach reduces the root-mean-square error in initial data for a numerical weather prediction model, in particular on small scales, and improves the forecast quality. It is found that the application of the non-diagonal AMV observation error covariance matrix increases the accuracy of analysis and forecast fields.

TI  - Eddies in the Arctic Ocean Revealed from MODIS Optical Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we investigate properties of ocean eddies in the key Arctic region of the northern Greenland Sea and the Fram Strait using visible and infrared Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua data acquired from April to September in 2007 and 2018-2020. We infer eddy properties using visual identification and automated processing of their signatures in sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) maps, and their gradients. Altogether, 450 (721) eddies were identified in SST (chl-a) data. Their radii span from 2 to 40 km (mean value 12 km). Most eddies are elliptical with a mean aspect ratio (eccentricity) of their axes equal 0.77 (0.64). Cyclones are smaller than anticyclones and prevail in both data sources. Cyclones tend to be more prevalent over shallow shelves, and anticyclones over deep water regions. Peak eddy activity is registered in June, while chl-a data also possess a second peak in April. In SST, the highest eddy probability is found along the East Greenland Current in the Nordbukta region at 76-78 degrees N and along the West Spitsbergen Current at 78-80 degrees N. In chl-a, most of them are observed in the central Fram Strait. The overall number of eddies with a positive chl-a anomaly, dominated by cyclones, is larger (62%) than that with a negative one (similar to 38%). The number of eddies with positive and negative SST anomalies is nearly equal. Eddy translation velocities are 0.9-9.6 km/day (mean value 4.2 km/day). Despite frequent cloud and ice cover, MODIS data is a rich source of information on eddy generation hot-spots, their spatial properties, dynamics and associated SST and chl-a anomalies in the Arctic Ocean.

TI  - Forest, Crop and Grassland Leaf Area Index Estimation Using Remote Sensing: A Review of Current Research Methods, Sensors, Estimation Models and Accomplishments
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter in plant ecophysiology; it can be used to quantify foliage directly and as a measure of the photosynthetic active area and, thus, the area subject to transpiration in vegetation. The aim of this paper was to review work on remote sensing methods of estimating LAI across different forest ecosystems, crops and grasslands in terms of remote sensing platforms, sensors and models. To achieve this aim, scholarly articles with the title or keywords "Leaf Area Index estimation" or "LAI estimation" were searched on Google Scholar and Web of Science with a date range between 2010 and 2020. The study's results revealed that during the last decade, the use of remote sensing to estimate and map LAI increased for crops and natural forests. However, there is still a need for more research concerning commercial forests and grasslands, as the number of studies remains low. Of the 84 studies related to forests, 60 were related to natural forests and 24 were related to commercial forests. In terms of model types, empirical models were most often used for estimating the LAI of forests, followed by physical models.

TI  - Monitoring Illegal Logging Using Google Earth Engine in Sulawesi Selatan Tropical Forest, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest destruction has been found to be the cause of natural disasters in the form of floods, landslides in the rainy season, droughts in the dry season, climate change, and global warming. The high rate of forest destruction is caused by various factors, including weak law enforcement efforts against forestry crimes, such as illegal logging events. However, in Indonesia, illegal logging is only discovered when the perpetrator has distributed the wood products. The lack of monitoring of the overall condition of the forest has an impact on the current high level of forest destruction. Through this research, the problems related to environmental damage due to illegal logging will be described through remote sensing technology, which is currently mainly developed on the basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning, namely Google Earth Engine (GEE). Monitoring of illegal logging events will be analysed using Sentinel 1 and 2 data. Obtaining satellite imagery with relatively small cloud cover for tropical regions, such as Indonesia, is remarkably difficult. This difficulty is due to the presence of a radar sensor on Sentinel 1 images that can penetrate clouds, allowing for observation of the forest condition even in the presence of clouds. Using the random forest classification algorithm of the GEE platform, data on forest conditions in 2021 were obtained, covering an area of 2,843,938.87 ha or 63% of the total area of Sulawesi Selatan Province. An analysis using a map of the function of forest areas revealed that of the current forest area, 38.46% was non-forest estates and 61.54% was forest areas. The continued identification of illegal logging events also found 1971 spots of forest change events in the vulnerable time of the first period (January-April) with the second period (April-August), and 1680 spots of forest change events in the vulnerable period of the second period (April-August) with the third period (September-December), revealing a total incident area of 7599.28 ha.

TI  - Impact of Topography on Rural Cycling Patterns: Case Study of Bugesera District, Rwanda
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural mobility in Africa is an under-researched issue. Rural communities have often suffered from reduced mobility that has hampered their access to essential services and facilities such as education, health care, food, and clean water. In many rural communities, a more affordable mobility option, such as non-motorized mobility (cycling and walking), is the preferred way for people to travel. Apart from its well-known advantages, little is known about the impact of topography and routes on the mobility options adopted by rural communities. Therefore, this study aims to use Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) to analyze the impact of topography and routes on rural mobility patterns at the level of formal and informal cycle track networks in the Bugesera District, focusing on the Nyamata and Mayange sectors, Rwanda. This study used GPS devices given to 50 participants to collect mobility patterns in the two previously mentioned sectors. Then, the study imposed a 30-m buffer on the official road networks of Rwanda collected by the Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA). These data were joined to GPS tracks to highlight official and unofficial roads (tracks that did not fall within the 30-m buffer). In addition, Digital Elevation Models were applied to analyze the SRTM (30 m resolution) and ALOS PALSAR (12.5 m resolution) elevation data of the Bugesera region. The findings revealed an elevation range of 1333 to 1535 for SRTM and 1323 to 1641 for ALOS PALSAR. The study calculated the slope to find the slope percentage (m) and length (m). The findings from the DEMs and the slope calculation revealed that Bugesera has a relatively flat surface, favorable for cycling. The slope percentage was further classified into five levels of slope ranging from steep to very steep. And the Van Zuidam classification results confirmed that Bugesera has "a flat or nearly flat surface, without significant denudation processes". With a favorable topography and a higher bicycle ownership ratio, residents of the Bugesera district favor cycling in their daily activities more than any district in Rwanda. Cycling in Nyamata or Mayange links residents to areas with higher social, educational, administrative, and economic activities.

TI  - Allah has told us everything: An interpretative phenomenological analysis exploring the lived experiences of British Muslims
T2  - ARCHIVE FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION-ARCHIV FUR RELIGIONSPSYCHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a need to better understand how individuals in different religious groups construct and maintain their worldviews. This study explores how religious practices, beliefs, and relationships create and sustain the worldviews of five British Muslims. Semi-structured interviews were inductively analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to idiographically explore the participants' lived experiences. This analysis developed multiple subordinate themes that formed two superordinate themes: "Submitting to Allah" and "Being a British Muslim." The participants' experiences of being raised in Muslim families strongly shaped their beliefs and they each strongly identify themselves as both Muslim and British. These important relationships taught them to follow the teachings of the Qur'an and to live their lives in submission to God. The analysis suggests the belief that the Qur'an is the authoritative and enduring revelation of God to mankind provided the core of their worldview and that this belief had far-reaching implications for every aspect of their lives. Their social relationships and religious practices both continually affirmed this fundamental belief in their sacred text and created a social reality in which the participants experienced God and submitted to the will of Allah. The combination of many different religious practices, social relationships, and personal experiences imbued the Qur'an with the power and authority to shape the participants' lives and sustained their religious community. The participants' intratextually fundamentalist approach to the Qur'an helped them create coherent worldviews that were filled with meaning and purpose.

TI  - Salinity Properties Retrieval from Sentinel-2 Satellite Data and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate monitoring of soil salinization plays a key role in the ecological security and sustainable agricultural development of semiarid regions. The objective of this study was to achieve the best estimation of electrical conductivity variables from salt-affected soils in a south Mediterranean region using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. In order to realize this goal, a test was carried out using electrical conductivity (EC) data collected in central Tunisia. Soil electrical conductivity and leaf electrical conductivity were measured in an olive orchard over two growing seasons and under three irrigation treatments. Firstly, selected spectral salinity, chlorophyll, water, and vegetation indices were tested over the experimental area to estimate both soil and leaf EC using Sentinel-2 imagery on the Google Earth Engine platform. Subsequently, estimation models of soil and leaf EC were calibrated by employing machine learning (ML) techniques using 12 spectral bands of Sentinel-2 images. The prediction accuracy of the EC estimation was assessed by using k-fold cross-validation and computing statistical metrics. The results of the study revealed that machine learning algorithms, together with multispectral data, could advance the mapping and monitoring of soil and leaf electrical conductivity.

TI  - Impacts of Land Cover Changes on Catches of Nile Perch and Nile Tilapia on Lake Kyoga, Uganda
T2  - FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - In East Africa, Nile perch and Nile tilapia are major commercial fish species, providing reliable protein and income sources. However, their stocks are dwindling on Lake Kyoga due to land use and land cover (LULC) changes within the surrounding catchment. Thus, this paper aims at assessing the land use land cover on Lake Kyoga and its immediate catchment and how those changes affect the water quality and the local fish catches. The Iso-Cluster tool in ArcGIS was used to analyze Landsat images from the years 1989 to 2021 to obtain LULC information. The LULC classes were classified into water, wetland, agricultural land, rangeland, and settlements. Correction using a 2-tailed test of the water quality parameters with the LULC classes indicated a strong positive correlation of TN with water (0.71), a strong negative correlation of TP with rangelands (-0.83), and a strong positive correlation of Chl-a with settlement (0.98) at a 0.05 confidence level. The correlation of the recorded fish catch data with fishing gear showed a strong negative correlation with cast and monofilament nets. Continued use of illegal fishing gear was ranked number 1 of the causes of LULC by the stakeholders. Thus, the fisheries managers should collaborate with local stakeholders to boost declining fish catches for improved livelihoods and sustainable management.

TI  - The Pakistan Flood of August 2022: Causes and Implications
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The risk of floods has increased in South Asia due to high vulnerability and exposure. The August 2022 Pakistan flood shows a glimpse of the enormity and devastation that can further rise under the warming climate. The deluge caused by the floods in 2022, which badly hit the country's southern provinces, is incomparable to any recent events in terms of the vast spatial and temporal scale. The flood event is ranked second in human mortality, while this was the top event that displaced about 33 million people in Pakistan. Using observations and climate projections, we examine the causes and implications of the 2022 flood in Pakistan. Multiday (& SIM;15 days) extreme precipitation on wet antecedent soil moisture conditions was the primary driver of the flood in August 2022. The extreme precipitation in August was caused by two atmospheric rivers that passed over southern Pakistan. Streamflow simulations from the multiple hydrological models show that multiday extreme precipitation was the primary driver of floods. Several flood-affected stations experienced anomalously higher flow than the upstream stations. The 2022 Pakistan flood highlights the adaptation challenges South Asia is facing along with the substantial need for climate mitigation to reduce the risk of such events. Plain Language Summary The Pakistan flood of 2022 received a considerable attention. However, the causes and implications of the events have not been examined. Using observations, satellite data, and reanalysis products, we show that the event was caused by multiday extreme rainfall on wet antecedent conditions. The extreme rainfall was associated with the two atmospheric rivers that transported significant moisture from the Arabian Sea. The flood was primarily driven by the extreme precipitation and other factors (glacier-melt) played a secondary role. Extreme precipitation is projected to increase in a warming climate, which highlight the strong need of adaptation and mitigation.

TI  - A Methodological Framework for Mapping Canopy Cover Using ICESat-2 in the Southern USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides exceptional opportunities for characterizing the structure of ecosystems through the acquisition of along-track, three-dimensional observations. Focusing on canopy cover as a fundamental parameter for assessing forest conditions, the overall goal of this study was to establish a framework for generating a gridded 30 m canopy cover product with ICESat-2. Specifically, our objectives were to (1) Determine and compare ICESat-2-derived canopy cover with airborne lidar-derived and the 2016 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) cover product estimates, and (2) Evaluate a methodology for wall-to-wall mapping of canopy cover. Using two Southern US sites, the Sam Houston National Forest (SHNF) in south-east Texas and the Solon Dixon Forestry Education Center (SDFEC) in southern Alabama, four measures of canopy cover estimated with ICESat-2 ' s Land-Vegetation Along-Track Product, or ATL08, were evaluated at the 30 m pixel scale. Comparisons were made using spatially coinciding NLCD pixels and airborne lidar-derived reference canopy cover. A suite of Landsat and Landsat-derived parameters were then used as predictors to model and map each measure of canopy cover with Random Forests (RF), and their accuracies were assessed and compared. Correlations (r) between ICESat-2-derived and airborne lidar canopy cover at the pixel scale ranged from 0.57 to 0.78, and R-2 up to 0.81 was produced between NLCD and ICESat-2-derived canopy cover. RF models developed for extrapolating ICESat-2-derived canopy cover estimate yielded R-2 values between 0.50 and 0.61 (RMSEs between 16% and 20%) when evaluated with airborne lidar-derived canopy cover. With a demonstrated capability of ICESat-2 to estimate vegetation biophysical parameters, the findings serve to support the spatially comprehensive mapping of other vegetation attributes, especially forest aboveground biomass, and contribute to the development of an up-to-date gridded canopy cover product.

TI  - Advanced Detections of Norway Lobster (Nephrops Norvegicus) Burrows using Deep Learning Techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine experts are facing lot of challenges in habitat monitoring of marine species. One of the biggest challenges is the underwater environment and species movement. The other challenge is the data collection of marine species. People used the camera sensors and satellite data in the past for data collection but in this era the scientists are using underwater Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), the Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), and certain sledges with high -definition still and video cameras to record the underwater footages. The ocean is composed of thousands of species which make the environment more challenging to monitor any specific specie. This work will focus on specie named Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). The Nephrops norvegicus is one of the commercial specie in the Europe and generates millions of dollars yearly. This specie lives under the seabed and leaves behind the burrow structure on the sea ground. The Nephrops spend most of their time under the seabed. The scientists are currently monitoring the habitat of Nephrops norvegicus by underwater television (UWTV) surveys that is collected yearly on many European grounds. The collected data is reviewed manually by the experts who count the burrows on the sheet. This work focuses on the automatic detection of Nephrops burrows from underwater videos using the deep learning techniques. This work trained the Faster R-CNN models Inceptionv2, MobileNetv2, ResNet50, and ResNet101. Instead of training the models from scratch we used the transfer learning technique to fine tune these networks. The data is obtained from the Gulf of Cadiz (FU30) station. Twenty-eight different set of experiments are performed. The models are evaluated quantitatively using the mean Average Precision (mAP), precision and recall curves. Also, the models are qualitatively analyzed by visually presenting the output. The results prove that deep learning techniques are very helpful for marine scientists to assess the Nephrops norvegicus abundance.

TI  - Effect of Land Use and Land Cover Change on Plant Diversity in the Ghodaghodi Lake Complex, Nepal
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ghodaghodi Lake Complex is a Ramsar site, Nepal's first bird sanctuary, and has significant ecological and economic values. The lake complex is in the western part of the lowland of the Terai region. Numerous studies indicate a relation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, and land cover with plant diversity. However, the association between terrestrial plant diversity and NDVI in the Ghodaghodi Lake Complex is unknown but has important implications due to potential land use changes. We aimed to understand the relationship between plant diversity and NDVI in the Ghodaghodi Lake Complex. We performed a vegetation survey using a simple random sampling methodology. Shannon-Wiener's diversity index (H') was calculated from the field data, and Landsat images were used to compare land use and land cover changes and calculate NDVI values for 2000 and 2022. The image classification shows that forest cover in April and December 2000 was 71.1% and 58.5%, respectively, and was the dominant land cover in the study area. In contrast, agriculture occupied 18.8% and 27.3% in April and December 2000, respectively, and was the primary land use. Forests covered the most land in April (64.8%) and December (65.3%) of 2022. Likewise, agriculture was a widespread land use. We found a significant correlation (r = 0.80, p < 0.05) between the NDVI and plant species diversity, as the NDVI explained 65% of plant species diversity. There was a decrease in forest cover from 2000 to 2022. The strong correlation between the NDVI and vegetation species diversity shows that the NDVI can be a substitute for plant diversity. Our findings show that increased NDVI corresponds to increased plant species diversity and that the lake complex had more plant diversity in 2022 than in 2000, despite a decrease in forested lands.

TI  - Cotton cultivated area detection and yield monitoring combining remote sensing with field data in lower Indus River basin, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the Earth's population continuously increase with the passage of time, the demand for agricultural raw material for human need increases. It is critical to maintaining updated and accurate information about the dynamics and properties of the world agricultural systems. As cash crop, the updated information of the spatial distribution of cotton field is necessary to monitor the crop area and growth changes at regional level. We used 8-day enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series to detect cotton crop area and binomial probabilistic approach to obtain the probability distribution of cotton crop occurrence. We used Gaussian kriging to derive cotton yield inside the detected cotton crop areas through crop reporting data. We also used field data from farmers to validate the cotton yield results. A strong correlation between the MODIS-derived cotton cultivated area and statistical data at the tehsil level were achieved (R-2 = 0.84) for all study years (2004-2019). The total accuracy for the cotton crop area detection was 84.6% and yield prediction was 92.1%. Our study presents new approaches to map cotton area and yield, which are applicable to other regions through machine learning.

TI  - A Geo-Hazard Risk Assessment Technique for Analyzing Impacts of Surface Subsidence within Onyeama Mine, South East Nigeria
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a geo-hazard risk assessment technique to analyze the impacts of surface subsidence monitored in a major coal mine in Nigeria. In many developing countries, disaster risk management schemes have mainly focused on traditional singular hazard assessment, vulnerability assessment, or risk assessment. However, it is difficult to use a singular application to adequately address hazard assessment due to the variation in data requirements, factors associated with the hazards, and the various elements at risk. Most times, hazard assessment schemes heavily rely on data and techniques from different global organizations that collate data on disasters, using various scales and objectives to make informed decisions. Several challenges seemingly arise from total reliance on these kinds of data due to standardization, the exact number of potential victims, and the purpose of the data collection. This makes disaster information collected at the local level unique and assessment schemes more complete; however, the coverage is limited worldwide. The proposed approach combines the spatial relationship between vulnerability assessment and elements at risk to highlight the grave consequences of potential disasters. Thus, the aim is to underscore the importance of integrating local-level inputs in analyzing risk factors and vulnerability indicators for hazard assessment. This study was conducted at the Onyeama coal mine in South East Nigeria. This area has experienced severe negative impacts of subsidence over the years. We exploit data from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Satellites and Small-Baseline Subset Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-DInSAR) technique to map the study area. The results generate an elements-at-risk database with a particular focus on population density, road networks, and building networks identified as indices for loss estimation.

TI  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) Technique for the Identification and Monitoring of Critical Landslide Areas in a Regional and Mountainous Road Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A reliable road network is a vital local asset, connecting communities and unlocking economic growth. Every year landslides cause serious damage and, in some cases, the full disruption of many road networks, which can last from a few days to even months. The identification and monitoring of landslides with conventional methods on an extended and complex road network can be a rather difficult process, as it requires a significant amount of time and resources. The road network of the Chania regional unit on the island of Crete in Greece is a typical example, as it connects, over long distances, many remote mountainous villages with other local communities, as well as with the main urban centers, which are mainly located across the shore. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is a remote-sensing technique that can provide a reliable and cost-effective solution, as it can be used to identify and monitor slow-moving and ongoing landslides over large and complex areas such as those of the mountainous road networks. This study applied PSI in the Chania regional unit, using the novel parallelized PSI (P-PSI) processing chain, developed by the Operational Unit Center for Earth Observation Research and Satellite Remote Sensing BEYOND of the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing of the National Observatory of Athens (BEYOND) for the rapid identification of the areas, most critical to landslide in a local road network. The application of P-PSI speeded up the total required processing time by a factor of five and led to the rapid identification and monitoring of 235 new slow-moving landslides. The identified landslides were correlated with a pre-existing landslide inventory and open access visual data to create a complete landslide inventory and a relative landslide inventory map, thus offering a valuable tool to local stakeholders.

TI  - The Prosperity Message as a Syncretistic Deviation to the Gospel of Jesus
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The prosperity message preached mainly by independent apostles and prophets in Network Christianity's new prophetic churches with some Pentecostal leanings has become popular among many Africans. The link between the American prosperity message and its African nephew is discussed to disclose the unique African elements, such as Africa's traditional emphasis on a holistic spirituality which includes attaining health and prosperity by pacifying evil spirits and angry ancestors. One of the reasons for the popularity of the prosperity message is that it links closely with the African enchanted worldview and the spirituality that characterizes African traditional religion. This challenges Pentecostals to consider its compatibility with the gospel of Jesus Christ, based on the discipleship of the cross and servanthood, and suggests that the neo-Pentecostal prophet and apostle have become the modern equivalent of Africa's diviner and healer. Their message of prosperity deviates from the essence of the gospel of Christ in several respects: firstly, it entails a distorted view of God and the Bible, described in almost pantheistic terms; secondly, its anthropology and Christology view relegates Christ to a man empowered by the Spirit and elevates human beings' union with God; lastly, its view of revelation authorizes extrabiblical revelation to the same extent as the biblical text. This paper concludes that the prosperity message represents a dangerous fallacy based on a syncretistic contextualization of the gospel to African spirituality.

TI  - Satellite-based interferometry for monitoring structural deformations of bridge portfolios
T2  - AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The multi-temporal satellite-based differential interferometry (MTInSAR) is a well-known remote-sensing tech-nique aimed at detecting displacements of persistent scatterers (PSs) on the terrestrial surface. Recent studies motivate research effort on developing efficient and automatic procedures for structural monitoring via MTIn-SAR. This paper proposes a methodology for the portfolio-scale detection of structural deformations of bridges via MTInSAR. The displacement time-series associated with persistent scatterers on the investigated bridges are used to supply a geoprocessing chain leading to the automatic interpretation of bridge-specific deformation scenarios and the definition of monitoring/assessment priority classes. The methodology is applied to two highway networks in Roma and Bari (Italy) by using Sentinel-1 (C-band) and COSMO-SkyMed (X-band) satellite datasets. Although most of the bridges can be assumed stable, a relevant number of bridges affected by ongoing deformation phenomena are associated with high inspection priority. The PSs and the deformation scenarios related to some specific test bridges subjected to subsidence phenomena are analysed and described in detail. Finally, the deformation scenarios detected through the proposed methodology for two collapsed bridges in Italy are illustrated.

TI  - Vegetation Cover Dynamics in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1990s, Morocco's agriculture has been characterized by the co-existence and transformation of both modern and traditional smallholder systems. In the Atlas Mountains, the effects of rural-urban transformation have led to intensified irrigated agriculture in some agricultural areas, while others were abandoned. To better understand these effects, this study aimed at (1) analyzing the land use and land cover (LULC) changes, (2) assessing the structure and dynamics of vegetation, and (3) comparing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification approach with a seasonal rules-based approach. We, therefore, employed a semi-automatic supervised classification of LULC using Landsat data from the 1990s to the 2020s to distinguish between Open Canopy Vegetation, Bareland, Forest, and Water. Overall accuracies achieved ranged from 88% to 90% in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. SVM results indicated the share of Bareland as >80% of the landscape in all periods. With the seasonal rules-based approach, 10% less Bareland was detected than with the SVM approach. Our findings indicate the limitation of detecting vegetation reflectance in semi-arid mountainous regions such as that prevailing in Morocco using a single machine learning method.

TI  - Subinertial Sea Surface Heights Anomalies Estimated Using High Frequency Radar Surface Current Data in the Mississippi Bight
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level studies in the Mississippi Bight (MSB) are less abundant than in other coastal waters of USA. This study investigates the subinertial (time scales > 2 days) sea level anomalies in the MSB shelf. The diagnostics of the terms in the invariant form of the momentum equation were computed to determine which terms have the most influence on the anomalies in sea level. It was determined that at subinertial scales the geostrophic balance is the dominant balance in the MSB while the non-linear and time derivative terms are insignificant relative to the Coriolis term. A Least Squares procedure was applied to the subinertial surface currents data from high frequency radar surface currents (filtered with a window of 2-day Butterworth filter) to extract subinertial sea level anomalies in the MSB shelf using both geostrophic balance and the invariant form of Reynolds' averaged momentum equations. The resulting subinertial sea level anomalies were validated using sea level observations from an offshore buoy and Sentinel-3 along-track satellite altimeter data. The estimated sea level anomalies were reasonably close to observations (more than half had root mean square difference of < 0.04 m) and mostly influenced by geostrophic balance. Analysis of the empirical orthogonal functions showed that the first two modes explained the majority (85%) of the variance in the sea level anomalies estimated using the geostrophic approximation. Absolute sea level could be estimated if Global Navigation Satellite System buoys are deployed in the radar footprint.

TI  - RadWet: An Improved and Transferable Mapping of Open Water and Inundated Vegetation Using Sentinel-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the spatial and temporal dynamics of tropical herbaceous wetlands is vital for a wide range of applications. Inundated vegetation can account for over three-quarters of the total inundated area, yet widely used EO mapping approaches are limited to the detection of open water bodies. This paper presents a new wetland mapping approach, RadWet, that automatically defines open water and inundated vegetation training data using a novel mixture of radar, terrain, and optical imagery. Training data samples are then used to classify serial Sentinel-1 radar imagery using an ensemble machine learning classification routine, providing information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of inundation every 12 days at a resolution of 30 m. The approach was evaluated over the period 2017-2022, covering a range of conditions (dry season to wet season) for two sites: (1) the Barotseland Floodplain, Zambia (31,172 km(2)) and (2) the Upper Rupununi Wetlands in Guyana (11,745 km(2)). Good agreement was found at both sites using random stratified accuracy assessment data (n = 28,223) with a median overall accuracy of 89% in Barotseland and 80% in the Upper Rupununi, outperforming existing approaches. The results revealed fine-scale hydrological processes driving inundation patterns as well as temporal patterns in seasonal flood pulse timing and magnitude. Inundated vegetation dominated wet season wetland extent, accounting for a mean 80% of total inundation. RadWet offers a new way in which tropical wetlands can be routinely monitored and characterised. This can provide significant benefits for a range of application areas, including flood hazard management, wetland inventories, monitoring natural greenhouse gas emissions and disease vector control.

TI  - Contrasting Dynamics of Littoral and Riparian Reed Stands within a Wetland Complex of Lake Cerknica
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution discusses the use of field measurements and remotely sensed data in an exploration of the effects of environmental parameters on the riparian and littoral stands of the common reed (Phragmites australis) in an intermittent wetland in Slovenia. For this purpose, we created a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series extending from 2017 to 2021. Data were collected and fitted to a unimodal growth model, from which we determined three different stages relating to the reed's growth. The field data consisted of the above-ground biomass harvested at the end of the vegetation season. Maximal NDVI values at the peak of the growing season exhibited no useful relationship with the above-ground biomass at the end of the season. Intense and long-lasting floods, especially during the period of intense culm growth, hindered the production of common reeds, while dry periods and temperatures were helpful before reed growth began. Summer droughts exhibited little effect. Water level fluctuations exerted a greater effect on reeds at the littoral site due to more pronounced extremes. In contrast, more constant and moderate conditions at the riparian site benefited the growth and productivity of the common reed. These results can prove useful for decision making regarding common reed management at the intermittent lake Cerknica.

TI  - Deep ResU-Net Convolutional Neural Networks Segmentation for Smallholder Paddy Rice Mapping Using Sentinel 1 SAR and Sentinel 2 Optical Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is a globally significant staple food crop. Therefore, it is crucial to have adequate tools for monitoring changes in the extent of rice paddy cultivation. Such a system would require a sustainable and operational workflow that employs open-source medium to high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery and efficient classification techniques. This study used similar phenological data from Sentinel-2 (S2) optical and Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery to identify paddy rice distribution with deep learning (DL) techniques. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) segmentation, a workflow that accurately delineates smallholder paddy rice fields using multi-temporal S1 SAR and S2 optical imagery was investigated. The study ' s accuracy assessment results showed that the optimal dataset for paddy rice mapping was a fusion of S2 multispectral bands (visible and near infra-red (VNIR), red edge (RE) and short-wave infrared (SWIR)), and S1-SAR dual polarization bands (VH and VV) captured within the crop growing season (i.e., vegetative, reproductive, and ripening). Compared to the random forest (RF) classification, the DL model (i.e., ResU-Net) had an overall accuracy of 94% (three percent higher than the RF prediction). The ResU-Net paddy rice prediction had an F1-Score of 0.92 compared to 0.84 for the RF classification generated using 500 trees in the model. Using the optimal U-Net classified paddy rice maps for the dates analyzed (i.e., 2016-2020), a change detection analysis over two epochs (2016 to 2018 and 2018 to 2020) provided a better understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of paddy rice agriculture in the study area. The results indicated that 377,895 and 8551 hectares of paddy rice fields were converted to other land-use over the first (2016-2018) and second (2018-2020) epochs. These statistics provided valuable insight into the paddy rice field distribution changes across the selected districts analyzed. The proposed DL framework has the potential to be upscaled and transferred to other regions. The results indicated that the approach could accurately identify paddy rice fields locally, improve decision making, and support food security in the region.

TI  - Long-Term Analysis of Internal Exposure Dose-Reduction Effects by Food Regulation and Food Item Contribution to Dose after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Accident
T2  - FOODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 10 years have passed since the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. This study verifies the efficacy of longitudinal regulation on internal exposure doses and analyzes food group contributions to radiation doses using accumulated monitoring test results. The committed effective doses in 10,000 virtual persons from fiscal year (FY) 2012 to 2021, with and without regulation, were estimated as products of radioactivity concentrations randomly sampled from the test results, food intake, and dose coefficient. The distributed values of food intake rather than a mean value in dose estimation were assumed to reflect food intake variations and avoid underestimation of internal exposure doses for high-intake consumers. Furthermore, the ingestion of radioactive cesium from the calculation was analyzed per food group. The 95th percentile of the internal exposure dose (the dose of a "representative person") was less than 1 mSv/year in both FYs. The regulation effect was substantial in FY 2012, and no noticeable difference in radiation doses was found between the regulation and no regulation conditions after FY 2016. Internal exposure doses decreased until approximately FY 2016 and then remained constant. It was also shown that not only radioactivity concentration but also food intake is a major factor affecting cesium intake. In summary, it was confirmed that Japan had ensured food safety regarding radioactive materials.

TI  - On the Interpretation of Synthetic Aperture Radar Images of Oceanic Phenomena: Past and Present
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - In 1978, the SEASAT satellite was launched, carrying the first civilian synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The mission was the monitoring of ocean: application to land was also studied. Despite its short operational time of 105 days, SEASAT-SAR provided a wealth of information on land and sea, and initiated many spaceborne SAR programs using not only the image intensity data, but also new technologies of interferometric SAR (InSAR) and polarimetric SAR (PolSAR). In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI), such as deep learning, has also attracted much attention. In the present article, a review is given on the imaging processes and analyses of oceanic data using SAR, InSAR, PolSAR data and AI. The selected oceanic phenomena described here include ocean waves, internal waves, oil slicks, currents, bathymetry, ship detection and classification, wind, aquaculture, and sea ice.

TI  - Summer maize LAI retrieval based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area of Index (LAI) refers to half of the total leaf area of all crops per unit area. It is an important index to represent the photosynthetic capacity and biomass of crops. To obtain LAI conditions of summer maize in different growth stages quickly and accurately, further guiding field fertilization and irrigation. The Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) multispectral data, growing degree days, and canopy height model of 2020-2021 summer maize were used to carry out LAI inversion. The vegetation index was constructed by the ground hyperspectral data and multispectral data of the same range of bands. The correlation analysis was conducted to verify the accuracy of the multispectral data. To include many bands as possible, four vegetation indices which included R, G, B, and NIR bands were selected in this study to test the spectral accuracy. There were nine vegetation indices calculated with UAV multispectral data which were based on the red band and the near-infrared band. Through correlation analysis of LAI and the vegetation index, vegetation indices with a higher correlation to LAI were selected to construct the LAI inversion model. In addition, the Canopy Height Model (CHM) and Growing degree days (GDD) of summer maize were also calculated to build the LAI inversion model. The LAI inversion of summer maize was carried out based on multi-growth stages by using the general linear regression model (GLR), Multivariate nonlinear regression model (MNR), and the partial least squares regression (PLSR) models. R2 and RMSE were used to assess the accuracy of the model. The results show that the correlation between UAV multispectral data and hyperspectral data was greater than 0.64, which was significant. The Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Plant Biochemical Index (PBI), Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), CHM and GDD have a higher correlation with LAI. By comparing the models constructed by the three methods, it was found that the PLSR has the best inversion effect. It was based on OSAVI, GDD, RVI, PBI, CHM, NDVI, and WDRVI, with the training model's R2 being 0.866 3, the testing model's R2 being 0.710 2, RMSE was 1.1755. This study showed that the LAI inversion model based on UAV multispectral vegetation index, GDD, and CHM improves the accuracy of LAI inversion effectively. That means the growing degree days and crop population structure change have influenced the change of maize LAI certainly, and this method can provide decision support for maize growth monitoring and field fertilization.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network-Driven Improvements in Global Cloud Detection for Landsat 8 and Transfer Learning on Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A stable and reliable cloud detection algorithm is an important step of optical satellite data preprocessing. Existing threshold methods are mostly based on classifying spectral features of isolated individual pixels and do not contain or incorporate the spatial information. This often leads to misclassifications of bright surfaces, such as human-made structures or snow/ice. Multi-temporal methods can alleviate this problem, but cloud-free images of the scene are difficult to obtain. To deal with this issue, we extended four deep-learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to improve the global cloud detection accuracy for Landsat imagery. The inputs are simplified as all discrete spectral channels from visible to short wave infrared wavelengths through radiometric calibration, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) global Landsat 8 Biome cloud-cover assessment dataset is randomly divided for model training and validation independently. Experiments demonstrate that the cloud mask of the extended U-net model (i.e., UNmask) yields the best performance among all the models in estimating the cloud amounts (cloud amount difference, CAD = -0.35%) and capturing the cloud distributions (overall accuracy = 94.9%) for Landsat 8 imagery compared with the real validation masks; in particular, it runs fast and only takes about 41 +/- 5.5 s for each scene. Our model can also actually detect broken and thin clouds over both dark and bright surfaces (e.g., urban and barren). Last, the UNmask model trained for Landsat 8 imagery is successfully applied in cloud detections for the Sentinel-2 imagery (overall accuracy = 90.1%) via transfer learning. These prove the great potential of our model in future applications such as remote sensing satellite data preprocessing.

TI  - Causes and Impacts of Decreasing Chlorophyll-a in Tibet Plateau Lakes during 1986-2021 Based on Landsat Image Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is one of the important components of the lake ecosystem. Numerous studies have analyzed Chl-a in ocean and inland water ecosystems under pressures from climate change and anthropogenic activities. However, little research has been conducted on lake Chl-a variations in the Tibet Plateau (TP) because of its harsh environment and limited opportunities for in situ data monitoring. Here, we combined 95 in situ measured lake Chl-a concentration data points and the Landsat reflection spectrum to establish an inversion model of Chl-a concentration. For this, we retrieved the mean annual Chl-a concentration in the past 35 years (1986-2021) of 318 lakes with an area of > 10 km(2) in the TP using the backpropagation (BP) neural network prediction method. Meteorological and hydrological data, measured water quality parameters, and glacier change in the lake basin, along with geographic information system (GIS) technology and spatial statistical analysis, were used to elucidate the driving factors of the Chl-a concentration changes in the TP lakes. The results showed that the mean annual Chl-a in the 318 lakes displayed an overall decrease during 1986-2021 (-0.03 mu g/L/y), but 63%, 32%, and 5% of the total number exhibited no significant change, significant decrease, and significant increase, respectively. After a slight increase during 1986-1995 (0.05 mu g/L/y), the mean annual lake Chl-a significantly decreased during 1996-2004 (-0.18 mu g/L/y). Further, it decreased slightly during 2005-2021 (-0.02 mu g/L/y). The mean annual lake Chl-a concentration was significantly negatively correlated with precipitation (R-2 = 0.48, p < 0.01), air temperature (R-2 = 0.31, p < 0.01), lake surface water temperature (LSWT) (R-2 = 0.51, p < 0.01), lake area (R-2 = 0.42, p < 0.01), and lake water volume change (R-2 = 0.77, p < 0.01). The Chl-a concentration of non-glacial-meltwater-fed lakes were higher than those of glacial-meltwater-fed lakes, except during higher precipitation periods. Our results shed light on the impacts of climate change on Chl-a variation in the TP lakes and lay the foundation for understanding the changes in the TP lake ecosystem.

TI  - Permission to Wonder: The Palimpsestic Interplay of H.D. & Freud
T2  - MODERNIST CULTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - The modernist writer H.D. was Freud's analysand in 1933 and 1934 and friend until his death in 1939. This article examines letters, biographies, memoirs, and archival material to trace the interplay between H.D.'s palimpsestic poetics in Trilogy (1973) and Freud's writing of his last book, Moses and Monotheism (1939) - a work that he was composing throughout the duration of his friendship with the poet. In this book, Freud situates Jewish history as a survival narrative centred on the figure of Moses. Known as one of his most 'literary' texts, Moses and Monotheism retraces the life of Moses in a multi-layered narrative that shares in the palimpsestic impulses of H.D.'s writing. This article argues that Freud draws from the revisionist strategies so central to H.D.'s worldview and writerly ethos in order to place creativity and resilience at the heart of Moses and Monotheism.

TI  - ReUse: REgressive Unet for Carbon Storage and Above-Ground Biomass Estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has recently established the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) program, which requires countries to report their carbon emissions and sink estimates through national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGI). Thus, developing automatic systems capable of estimating the carbon absorbed by forests without in situ observation becomes essential. To support this critical need, in this work, we introduce ReUse, a simple but effective deep learning approach to estimate the carbon absorbed by forest areas based on remote sensing. The proposed method's novelty is in using the public above-ground biomass (AGB) data from the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative Biomass project as ground truth to estimate the carbon sequestration capacity of any portion of land on Earth using Sentinel-2 images and a pixel-wise regressive UNet. The approach has been compared with two literature proposals using a private dataset and human-engineered features. The results show a more remarkable generalization ability of the proposed approach, with a decrease in Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error over the runner-up of 16.9 and 14.3 in the area of Vietnam, 4.7 and 5.1 in the area of Myanmar, 8.0 and 1.4 in the area of Central Europe, respectively. As a case study, we also report an analysis made for the Astroni area, a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) natural reserve struck by a large fire, producing predictions consistent with values found by experts in the field after in situ investigations. These results further support the use of such an approach for the early detection of AGB variations in urban and rural areas.

TI  - Large-Scale <i>Populus euphratica</i> Distribution Mapping Using Time-Series Sentinel-1/2 Data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficient large-scale mapping of P. euphratica distribution is of great importance for managing and protecting P. euphratica forests, policy making, and realizing sustainable development goals in the ecological environments of desert areas. In large regions, numerous types of vegetation exhibit spectral characteristics that closely resemble those of P. euphratica, such as Tamarix, artificial forests, and allee trees, posing challenges for the accurate identification of P. euphratica. To solve this issue, this paper presents a method for large-scale P. euphratica distribution mapping. The geographical distribution characteristics of P. euphratica were first utilized to rapidly locate the appropriate region of interest and to further reduce background complexity and interference from other similar objects. Spectral features, indices, phenological features, and backscattering features extracted from all the available Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-1 SAR data from 2021 were regarded as the input for a random forest model used to classify P. euphratica in the GEE platform. The results were then compared with the results from the method using only spectral features and index features, the results from the method that only added phenological features, and the results from the method that added phenological features and backscattering features by visually and quantitatively referencing field-surveyed samples, UAV data, and high-spatial-resolution data from Google Earth Data and Map World. The comparison indicated that the proposed method, which adds both phenological and time-series backscattering features, could correctly distinguish P. euphratica from other types of vegetation that have spectral information similar to P. euphratica. The rates of omission errors (OEs), commission errors (CEs), and overall accuracy (OA) for the proposed method were 12.53%, 11.01%, and 89.32%, respectively, representing increases of approximately 9%, 17%, and 13% in comparison with the method using only spectral and index features. The proposed method significantly improved the accuracy of P. euphratica classification in terms of both omission and, especially, commission.

TI  - In Vitro Activity of Ceftolozane-Tazobactam against <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Obtained from Blood Cultures from Sentinel Public Hospitals in South Africa
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for the majority of healthcare-associated infections and pose a serious threat as they complicate and prolong clinical care. A novel cephalosporin-beta-lactamase-inhibitor combination, ceftolozane-tazobactam (C/T) was introduced in 2014, which improved the treatment of MDR pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate the activity of C/T against Escherichia coli (n = 100), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 100), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 100) blood culture isolates in South Africa (SA). Isolates were sequentially selected (2010 to 2020) from the Group for Enteric, Respiratory, and Meningeal Diseases Surveillance (GERMS) programme in SA. Organism identification was performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) instrument (Microflex, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), and antibiotic susceptibility was performed using the Sensititre instrument (Trek Diagnostic Systems, East Grinstead, UK). C/T resistance was reported in 16 E. coli, 28 K. pneumoniae and 13 P. aeruginosa isolates. Fifty percent of the C/T resistant isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). According to the whole genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, the E. coli isolates (n = 8) belonged to sequence type (ST)10, ST131, ST405, and ST410, the K. pneumoniae isolates (n = 14) belonged to ST1, ST37, ST73, ST101, ST231, ST307, ST336 and ST6065 (novel ST), and the P. aeruginosa isolates (n = 7) belonged to ST111, ST233, ST273, and ST815. The WGS data also showed that all the E. coli isolates harboured aminoglycoside (aph (3 '')-Ib, aph (6)-Id), macrolide (mdfA, mphA), and sulphonamide (sul2) antibiotic resistance genes, all the K. pneumoniae isolates harboured beta-lactam (bla(CTX-M-15)), and sulphonamide (sul2) antibiotic resistance genes, and all the P. aeruginosa isolates harboured aminoglycoside (aph (3 ')-IIb), beta-lactam (PAO), fosfomycin (fosA), phenicol (catB7), quinolone (crpP), and disinfectant (qacE) antibiotic resistance genes. It is evident that E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa can adapt pre-existing resistance mechanisms to resist newer beta-lactam molecules and inhibitors, since these isolates were not exposed to ceftolozane-tazobactam previously.

TI  - IMPACT OF DIGITAL SOCIALIZATION ON SCHOOL EDUCATION: PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS
T2  - REVISTA CONRADO
M3  - Article
AB  - The current context of child socialization is predominantly condi-tioned by the digitalization of society, in which the age at which children begin to interact with digital technology is constantly lowering. The purpose of the study is to define and thoroughly describe the main problems of school education in the era of digital socialization. The authors analyze the major problems facing today's school education, such as the technological di-vide between the generations of students and teachers, the in-dividualization of education, the divide between the visual and textual cultures in education, digital inequality, gamification, and information noise. The context for the analysis is the need to develop new strategies for the education of modern school students, whose worldview is formed amid the accelerated de-velopment of digital technology. The authors conclude that the leading form of socialization for today's generation of school students is digital socialization, which forms network identities. This generation independently forms and controls their informal educational strategies aimed at the formation and development of a "digital human". For this reason, when constructing edu-cation for the new generation, it is vital to look for educational practices that meet the requirements and demands of the digital socialization era.

TI  - A Global Remote-Sensing Assessment of the Intersite Variability in the Greening of Coastal Dunes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, the vegetation on many coastal dunes has expanded spatially, which is attributed, among other things, to global-scale climate change. The intersite variability in this dune greening has not yet been substantially investigated, nor is it known whether it is consistent with intersite variability in climate change. Therefore, the objectives of this work were firstly to quantify and analyse the change in vegetation cover from multitemporal NDVI time series at a large number (186) of dune fields worldwide, calculated from Landsat satellite imagery available between 1984 and 2021 and secondly, to correlate the identified trends with trends in the main climate variables influencing vegetation growth (temperature, precipitation and wind speed). We show that greening is strongest in cool temperate climates (35 degrees to 66.5 degrees north/south latitudes) and that the rate of greening is accelerating at many sites. We find no dependence between the rate of greening and the local temporal change in temperature, precipitation and/or wind speed. Based on existing literature, sand supply and anthropogenic activities are discussed as possible reasons for the absence of a clear global relationship between variability in dune greening and climate change.

TI  - An Operational Processing Framework for Spaceborne SAR Formations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper proposes a flexible and efficient wavenumber domain processing scheme suited for close formations of low earth orbiting (LEO) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors hosted on micro-satellites or CubeSats. Such systems aim to generate a high-resolution image by combining data acquired by each sensor with a low pulse repetition frequency (PRF). This is usually performed by first merging the different channels in the wavenumber domain, followed by bulk focusing. In this paper, we reverse this paradigm by first upsampling and focusing each acquisition and then combining the focused images to form a high-resolution, unambiguous image. Such a procedure is suited to estimate and mitigate artifacts generated by incorrect positioning of the sensors. An efficient wave-number method is proposed to focus data by adequately coping with the orbit curvature. Two implementations are provided with different quality/efficiency. The image quality in phase preservation, resolution, sidelobes, and ambiguities suppression is evaluated by simulating both point and distributed scatterers. Finally, a demonstration of the capability to compensate for ambiguities due to a small across-track baseline between sensors is provided by simulating a realistic X-band multi-sensor acquisition starting from a stack of COSMO-SkyMed images.

TI  - Automated Mapping of Wetland Ecosystems: A Study Using Google Earth Engine and Machine Learning for Lotus Mapping in Central Vietnam
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems with the capability of carbon sequestration, providing an effective solution for climate change. Recent advancements in remote sensing have improved the accuracy in the mapping of wetland types, but there remain challenges in accurate and automatic wetland mapping, with additional requirements for complex input data for a number of wetland types in natural habitats. Here, we propose a remote sensing approach using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) to automate the extraction of water bodies and mapping of growing lotus, a wetland type with high economic and cultural values in central Vietnam. Sentinel-1 was used for water extraction with the K-Means clustering, whilst Sentinel-2 was combined with the machine learning smile Random Forest (sRF) and smile Gradient Tree Boosting (sGTB) models to map areas with growing lotus. The water map was derived from S-1 images with high confidence (F-1 = 0.97 and Kappa coefficient = 0.94). sGTB outperformed the sRF model to deliver a growth map with a high accuracy (overall accuracy = 0.95, Kappa coefficient = 0.92, Precision = 0.93, and F-1 = 0.93). The total lotus area was estimated at 145 ha and was distributed in the low land of the study site. Our proposed framework is a simple and reliable mapping technique, has a scalable potential with the GEE, and is capable of extension to other wetland types for large-scale mapping worldwide.

TI  - Monitoring Land Use/Land Cover and Landscape Pattern Changes at a Local Scale: A Case Study of Pyongyang, North Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One method of understanding landscape pattern changes is through an understanding of land use/land cover (LULC) changes, which are closely related to landscape pattern changes. Previous studies have monitored LULC changes across North Korea but did not consider landscape changes at a local scale. Using multiple LULC products to construct sample points, the LULC was classified using a random-forest algorithm and Landsat satellite dataset. The overall accuracy of the classification was 97.66 +/- 1.36%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.95 +/- 0.03. Based on the classification results, landscape indices were used to quantify and monitor landscape pattern changes. The results showed that, from 2000 to 2020, there was an increasing trend in built-up and forest areas in Pyongyang, while cropland showed a decreasing trend, and landscape fragmentation increased. However, urban expansion was not the main factor affecting fragmentation. The main factors were forest recovery and cropland reduction, leading to an increase in landscape fragmentation in Pyongyang.

TI  - Modelling coastal upwelling off NW Iberian Peninsula: New insights on the fate of phytoplankton blooms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The northwestern coast of the Iberian Peninsula is a region characterized by pronounced hydrologic and biogeochem-ical activity, resulting in important fish and shellfish resources whose exploitation has a strong local socioeconomic impact. This high biological diversity is strongly dependent on coastal upwelling induced by favourable winds, which presents seasonal variability. This motivates the present study, which aims to understand the relation between local circulation, hydrography and Chl-a concentration under summer upwelling events of different intensities and clarify their effects in the region. To achieve this purpose, a coupled physical-biological model was developed and val-idated for the northwestern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, based on the use of MOHID modelling system and the ap-plication of a nested domains methodology. Comparison of predictions with observations demonstrated the model's accuracy in reproducing the physical and biogeochemical properties of the study region, both at the surface and along the water column. The study of different summer upwelling events shows that the local phytoplankton patterns are dependent on the characteristics of the event. Results show that under high upwelling favourable winds, a surface southwestward flow and an equatorward flow through the water column develop near the coast, inducing offshore ad-vection of nutrient and phytoplankton-rich waters. Otherwise, under light upwelling favourable winds, surface cur-rents are weak, a poleward flow develops, and phytoplankton is retained near the coast.

TI  - Multi-Channel Spectral Band Adjustment Factors for Thermal Infrared Measurements of Geostationary Passive Imagers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The newest and upcoming geostationary passive imagers have thermal infrared channels comparable to those of more established instruments, but their spectral response functions still differ significantly. Therefore, retrievals developed for a certain type of radiometer cannot simply be applied to another imager. Here, a set of spectral band adjustment factors is determined for MSG/SEVIRI, Himawari-8/AHI, and MTG1/FCI from a training dataset based on MetOp/IASI hyperspectral observations. These correction functions allow to turn the observation of one sensor into an analogue observation of another sensor. This way, the same satellite retrieval-that has been usually developed for a specific instrument with a specific spectral response function-can be applied to produce long time series that go beyond one single satellite/satellite series or to cover the entire geostationary ring in a consistent way. It is shown that the mean uncorrected brightness temperature differences between corresponding channels of two imagers can be >1 K, in particular for the channels centered around 13.4 mu m in the carbon dioxide absorption band and even when comparing different imager realizations of the same series, such as the four SEVIRI sensors aboard MSG1 to MSG4. The spectral band adjustment factors can remove the bias and even reduce the standard deviation in the brightness temperature difference by more than 80%, with the effect being dependent on the spectral channel and the complexity of the correction function. Further tests include the application of the spectral band adjustment factors in combination with (a) a volcanic ash cloud retrieval to Himawari-8/AHI observations of the Raikoke eruption 2019 and a comparison to an ICON-ART model simulation, and (b) an ice cloud retrieval to simulated MTG1/FCI test data with the outcome compared to the retrieval results using real MSG3/SEVIRI measurements for the same scene.

TI  - The Burden of Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Checks in the Peri-MRI Setting: The CHECK-MRI Study
T2  - HEART LUNG AND CIRCULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Most modern cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) systems are now compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The requirement for both pre-and post-MRI CIED checks imposes sig-nificant workload to the cardiac electrophysiology service. Here, we sought to determine the burden of CIED checks associated with MRI scans.Methods We identified all CIED checks performed peri-MRI scans at our institution over a 3-year period between 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2020, comprising three separate financial years (FY). Device check reports, MRI scan reports and clinical summaries were collated. The workload burden was determined by assessing the occasions and duration of service. Analysis was performed to determine cost burden/projections for this service and identify factors contributing to the workload.Results A total of 739 CIED checks were performed in the peri-MRI scan setting (370 pre-and 369 post-MRI scan), including 5% (n=39) that were performed outside of routine hours (weekday <8 am or .5 pm, and weekends). MRIs were performed for 295 patients (75613 years old, 64% male) with a CIED (88% per-manent pacemaker, and 12% high voltage device), including 49 who had more than one MRI scan. The proportion of total MRI scans for patients with a CIED in-situ increased each FY (from 0.5% of all MRIs in FY1, to 0.9% in FY2, to 1.0% in FY3). The weekly workload increased (R2=0.2, p<0.001), but with week-to-week variability due to ad hoc scheduling (209 days with only one MRI vs 78 days with >2 MRIs for CIED patients). The projected annual cost of this service will increase to AUD$161,695 in 10 years for an estimated annual 546 MRI scans for CIED patients.Conclusions There is an increasing workload burden and expense associated with CIED checks in the peri-MRI setting. Appropriate budgeting, staff allocation and standardisation of automated CIED pre-programming features among manufacturers are urgently needed.

TI  - Integration of Farm Financial Accounting and Farm Management Information Systems for Better Sustainability Reporting
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmers face an increasing administrative burden as agricultural policies and certification systems of trade partners ask for more sustainability reporting. Several indicator frameworks have been developed to measure sustainability, but they often lack empirical operationalization and are not always measured at the farm level. The research gap we address in this paper is the empirical link between the data needs for sustainability reporting and the developments in data management at the farm level. Family farms do not collect much data for internal management, but external demand for sustainability data can partly be fulfilled by reorganizing data management in the farm office. The Farm Financial Accounts (FFAs) and Farm Management Information Systems (FMISs) are the main data sources in the farm office. They originate from the same source of note-taking by farmers but became separated when formalized and computerized. Nearly all European farms have a bank account and must keep financial accounts (e.g., for Value-Added Tax or income tax) that can be audited. Financial accounts are not designed for environmental accounting or calculating sustainability metrics but provide a wealth of information to make assessments on these subjects. FMISs are much less frequently used but collect more technical and fine-grained data at crop or enterprise level for different fields. FMISs are also strong in integrating sensor and satellite data. Integrating data availability and workflows of FFAs and FMISs makes sustainability reporting less cumbersome regarding data entry and adds valuable data to environmental accounts. This paper applies a design science approach to design an artifact, a dashboard for sustainability reporting based on the integration of information flows from farm financial accounting systems and farm management information systems. The design developed in this paper illustrates that if invoices were digitized, most data-gathering needed for external sustainability reporting would automatically be done when the invoices is paid by a bank transfer. Data on the use of inputs and production could be added with procedures as in current FMISs, but with less data entry, fewer risks of differences in outcomes, and possibilities of cross-checking the results.

TI  - Environmental Factors Linked to Reporting of Active Malaria Foci in Thailand
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thailand has made substantial progress towards malaria elimination, with 46 of the country's 77 provinces declared malaria-free as part of the subnational verification program. Nonetheless, these areas remain vulnerable to the reintroduction of malaria parasites and the reestablishment of indigenous transmission. As such, prevention of reestablishment (POR) planning is of increasing concern to ensure timely response to increasing cases. A thorough understanding of both the risk of parasite importation and receptivity for transmission is essential for successful POR planning. Routine geolocated case- and foci-level epidemiological and case-level demographic data were extracted from Thailand's national malaria information system for all active foci from October 2012 to September 2020. A spatial analysis examined environmental and climate factors associated with the remaining active foci. A logistic regression model collated surveillance data with remote sensing data to investigate associations with the probability of having reported an indigenous case within the previous year. Active foci are highly concentrated along international borders, particularly Thailand's western border with Myanmar. Although there is heterogeneity in the habitats surrounding active foci, land covered by tropical forest and plantation was significantly higher for active foci than other foci. The regression results showed that tropical forest, plantations, forest disturbance, distance from international borders, historical foci classification, percentage of males, and percentage of short-term residents were associated with the high probability of reporting indigenous cases. These results confirm that Thailand's emphasis on border areas and forest-going populations is well placed. The results suggest that environmental factors alone are not driving malaria transmission in Thailand; rather, other factors, including demographics and behaviors that intersect with exophagic vectors, may also be contributors. However, these factors are syndemic, so human activities in areas covered by tropical forests and plantations may result in malaria importation and, potentially, local transmission, in foci that had previously been cleared. These factors should be addressed in POR planning.

TI  - Combining Historical, Remote-Sensing, and Photogrammetric Data to Estimate the Wreck Site of the USS <i>Kearsarge</i>
T2  - HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Colombia has hundreds of historical shipwrecks, but systematic research on this topic is scarce, which makes locating wreck sites problematic. Colombia is home to the Caribbean archipelago of San Andres, Old Providence, and Santa Catalina. Its complex environmental conditions make it a "ship trap". On 2 February 1894, the USS Kearsarge ran aground on Roncador Cay, one of the Archipelago's islets, and the location of the wreck site remains uncertain. Due to its role in the American Civil War, the Kearsarge is important naval heritage. Based on historical and cartographic records, orthophotographs, Landsat images, and light-detection-and-ranging (LiDAR) data, this study aimed to estimate the location of the wreck site in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Court-martial records, particularly nautical data and astronomical coordinates, were reviewed, including a study from 1894 indicating the wreck's location on a map without coordinates. Nautical charts were also analyzed to find the Kearsarge wreck symbol. To identify the wreck site's ordnance, logbooks and information on previous salvage efforts were examined. The analysis of nautical charts revealed a few shipwrecks, but not the Kearsarge. Historical and remote-sensing data were processed in a GIS, along with the most recent nautical chart of Roncador Cay from 2017, to obtain a possible geographical location. This resulted in coordinates, which were used to detect features associated with the USS Kearsarge in the processed data. Although the wreck was not detected, the data helped to estimate the approximate coordinates for where the wreck could be located, quantifying our degree of uncertainty.

TI  - Particulate Levels Underneath Landscape Fire Smoke Plumes in the Sydney Region of Australia
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke pollution from landscape fires is a major health problem, but it is difficult to predict the impact of any particular fire. For example, smoke plumes can be mapped using remote sensing, but we do not know how the smoke is distributed in the air-column. Prescribed burning involves the deliberate introduction of smoke to human communities but the amount, composition, and distribution of the pollution may be different to wildfires. We examined whether mapped plumes produced high levels of particulate pollution (PM2.5) at permanent air quality monitors and factors that influenced those levels. We mapped 1237 plumes, all those observed in 17 years of MODIS imagery over New South Wales, Australia, but this was only similar to 20% of known fires. Prescribed burn plumes tended to occur over more populated areas than wildfires. Only 18% of wildfire plumes and 4% of prescribed burn plumes passed over a monitor (n = 115). A minority of plumes caused a detectable increase in PM2.5: prescribed burn plumes caused an air quality exceedance for 33% of observations in the daytime and 11% at night, wildfire plumes caused exceedances for 48% and 22% of observations in the day and night-time, respectively. Thus, most plumes remained aloft (did not reach the surface). Statistical modelling revealed that wind speed, temperature, and mixing height influenced whether a plume caused an exceedance, and there was a difference between prescribed and wild fires. In particular, in wind speeds below 1 kmhr(-1), exceedance was almost certain in prescribed burns. This information will be useful for planning prescribed burning, preparing warnings, and improving our ability to predict smoke impacts.

TI  - LAVINIA FONTANA AND LUISA ROLDAN: RELIGIOUS THEMES IN WORKS OF WOMEN-MASTERS OF THE XVI-XVII CENTURIES
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of women artists appeared in Europe in the Early Modern Age, who received wide recognition from their contemporaries and confidently established themselves in the patriarchal world. Among them were L. Fontana and L. Roldan. This article is dedicated to their work. Both of them received their artistic education from their fathers and later became the main breadwinners of their families thanks to commissions these women artists received. By analyzing some of religious works made by these artists the author of this paper explores these masters' work in the socio-cultural context, identifies the sources that influenced them and analyzes the individual characteristics of their artistic manner. Their works embody principles which are important in religious art from the point of view of the Catholic Church. The latter ones can be seen in the decrees of the Council of Trent and the work of Italian cardinal and archbishop of Bologna G. Palleotti " Discorso intorno alle immagini e profane" (1582).L. Fontana was one of the first female painters who executed altarpieces for Italian churches. The religious paintings by L. Fontana demonstrate her interest in external beauty. She depicted very carefully rich clothing and jewelry. Thus L. Fontana stressed significance and dignity of represented scenes. Her religious works also demonstrate L. Fontana's tendency to naturalism. L. Fontana liked to combine features of different genres in her paintings, expanding boundaries of each of them. She often used her contemporaries as models. So her religious paintings also had characteristics of portrait painting and genre art. L. Fontana's works demonstrate influence of works of her compatriots and northern masters.L. Roldan was the first known female sculptor in Spain. She manifested herself as a master with dramatic talent and an artist who saw great importance of family ties, love and mutual understanding between members of the family and demonstrated these feelings in her works dedicated to Holy family and childhood of Christ and Mary. Her sculptures are characterized by idealization, decoration and demonstrate L. Roldan's careful study of anatomy. L. Roldan paid great attention to the feelings of the characters, which were often complex in nature due to the Baroque worldview.L. Fontana and L. Roldan not only expand the boundaries of contemporaries' ideas about women's art, but also push the boundaries of the religious genre, introducing elements of portrait genre and genre art into it as their male colleagues do. The aim of the article is to expand understanding of the evolution of European art of the XVI-XVII centuries.

TI  - First Detection and Molecular Characterization of Usutu Virus in <i>Culex pipiens</i> Mosquitoes Collected in Romania
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Usutu virus (USUV) is an emergent arbovirus in Europe causing mortality in bird populations. Similar to West Nile virus (WNV), USUV is maintained in sylvatic cycles between mosquito vectors and bird reservoirs. Spillover events may result in human neurological infection cases. Apart from indirect evidence provided by a recent serological study in wild birds, the circulation of USUV in Romania was not assessed. We aimed to detect and molecular characterize USUV circulating in mosquito vectors collected in South-Eastern Romania-a well-known WNV endemic region-during four transmission seasons. Mosquitoes were collected from Bucharest metropolitan area and Danube Delta, pooled, and screened by real-time RT-PCR for USUV. Partial genomic sequences were obtained and used for phylogeny. USUV was detected in Culex pipiens s.l. female mosquitoes collected in Bucharest, in 2019. The virus belonged to Europe 2 lineage, sub-lineage EU2-A. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high similarity with isolates infecting mosquito vectors, birds, and humans in Europe starting with 2009, all sharing common origin in Northern Italy. To our knowledge, this is the first study characterizing a strain of USUV circulating in Romania.

TI  - Study of Ionospheric Bending Angle and Scintillation Profiles Derived by GNSS Radio-Occultation with MetOp-A Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a dedicated campaign by MetOp-A satellite is conducted to monitor the ionosphere based on radio-occultation (RO) measurements provided by the onboard GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding (GRAS). The main goal is to analyze the capabilities of the collected data to represent the bending angle and scintillation profiles of the ionosphere. We compare the MetOp-A products with those generated by other RO missions and explore the spatial/temporal distributions sensed by the MetOp-A campaign. Validation of dual frequency bending angles at the RO tangent points, S4 index, and Rate of the Total electron content Index (ROTI) is performed against independent products from Fengyun-3D and FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 satellites. Our main findings constitute the following: (1) bending angle profiles from MetOp-A agree well with Fengyun-3D measurements; (2) bending angle distributions show a typical S-shape variation along the altitudes; (3) signatures of the sporadic E-layer and equatorial ionization anomaly crests are observed by the bending angles; (4) sharp transitions are observed in the bending angle profiles above similar to 200 km due to the transition of the daytime/nighttime in addition to the transition of the bottom-side/top-side; and (5) sporadic E-layer signatures are observed in the S4 index distributions by MetOp-A and FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2, with expected differences in magnitudes between the GPS (Global Positioning System) L1 and L2 frequencies.

TI  - Assessing Moisture Content and Its Mitigating Effect in an Urban Area Using the Land Surface Temperature-Vegetation Index Triangle Method
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, climate change and heat extremes are becoming highly challenging problems in many cities across the globe. One of the solutions to overcome this problem is the use of vegetation, and, in particular, extending the range of overgrown areas, which are sometimes referred to as "urban green areas." In this paper, the moisture condition and its mitigating effect on Land Surface Temperature in urban areas were examined in Warsaw, Poland, using satellite data. To do so, the so-called "Triangle Method" was employed. The triangle method is based on a Land Surface Temperature-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (LST-NDVI) scatterplot to calculate the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) and its modification-quadratic Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (qTVDI). This article discusses, in detail, the usefulness of the triangle method for the analyses of built-up areas. The drought satellite indices TVDI and qTVDI compared with those of LST, NDVI, and NDBI (Normalized Difference Building Index). The study shows that the triangle method based on LST-NDVI scatterplot analysis is a promising tool for establishing moisture conditions over urban areas and for studying the effect of vegetation impact on urban heat islands. Detailed analysis shows that over an urban area, qTVDI shows better agreement with LST than classic TVDI.

TI  - ALWAYS A WHITE CHRISTMAS IN THE BAHAMAS: TEMPERATURE AND HYDRODYNAMICS LOCALIZE WINTER MUD PRODUCTION ON GREAT BAHAMA BANK
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Whitings, or occurrences of fine-grained carbonate in the water column, have been observed in modern environments with salinities ranging from fresh to marine conditions, and thick deposits of lime mud are described throughout the geological record. Despite their ubiquity, the trigger for whitings has been debated for more than eighty years. Satellite data reveal that most whitings are restricted to the northwestern part of Great Bahama Bank (GBB) which occupies < 10% of the platform area. Even here, whitings are further focused. More than 35% of them occur in a zone which occupies just 1% of the platform. We propose a three-step process for the existence of this zone of peak whitings and why the whitings in it are both more frequent and larger in winter than summer. First, the temperature differential between on-and off-platform waters is highest in the winter, setting up a disparity between dissolved CO2 concentrations in the two water masses. Second, hydrodynamic mixing of these two water masses increases the degree of aragonite saturation of the platform-top waters, as colder on-platform waters with theoretically higher concentrations of dissolved gases are warmed via mixing with the warmer off-platform waters. Finally, spatial heterogeneity in the degree of aragonite saturation is higher in the winter, and the zone of peak whitings is situated in an area of locally enhanced saturation state. Hydrodynamic simulation suggests that the whitings zone is located by tidal inflow of off-platform waters across the western margin of GBB, as well as inflow from the Tongue of the Ocean to the north of Andros Island. Despite thermodynamic forcing mechanisms that predict higher frequency of whitings in the summer, the environmental, hydrodynamic, geochemical, and kinetic conditions in the whitings zone appear to support the Goldilocks configuration that enhances the formation of wintertime whitings on Great Bahama Bank. This phenomenon has implications for the interpretation of whitings mud in the geological record, including the geochemical signatures within it.

TI  - Detection of Soil Erosion Hotspots in the Croplands of a Typical Black Soil Region in Northeast China: Insights from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global efforts to restore the world's degraded croplands require knowledge on the degree and extent of accelerated soil organic carbon (SOC) loss induced by soil erosion. However, the methods for assessing where and to what extent erosion takes place are still inadequate for precise detection of erosion hotspots at high spatial resolution. Drawing on recent advances in multitemporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing to create a bare soil composite that reflects erosion-induced variations in soil spectral signatures, this study attempted to develop a spectra-based soil erosion mapping approach to pinpoint eroded hotspots in a typical catchment located in the black soil region of northeast China as characterized by undulating landscapes. We built a ground-truth dataset consisting of three classes of soils representing Severe, Moderate and Low erosion intensity because of their inter-class contrasts in estimated erosion rates from Cs-137 tracing. The spectral separability of different erosion classes was first tested by a combined principal component and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) against laboratory hyperspectral data and then validated against Sentinel-2-derived broadband spectra. The results show that PCA-LDA produced excellent classification accuracy (Kappa coefficient > 0.9) for both data sources and even more so for Sentinel-2 spectra, highlighting the effectiveness of the multitemporal approach to extract bare soil pixels. Further investigations into the spectral curves enabled identification of distinctive spectral features representative of shifting soil albedo and biochemical composition due to erosion-induced SOC mobilization. A classification scheme comprising the spectral features was applied to the Sentinel-2 bare soil composite for pixel-wise soil erosion mapping, in which 15.9% of the cropland area was detected as erosion hotspots, while the Moderate class occupied 65.4%. Comparing the erosion map to a NDVI map demonstrated the negative impact of soil erosion on crop growth from a spatial perspective, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach to aid targeted cropland management for food security and climate.

TI  - Tree-Species Classification and Individual-Tree-Biomass Model Construction Based on Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate classification of tree species is essential for forest resource monitoring, management, and conservation. Based on the classification of tree species, the biomass model at the individual-tree scale of each tree species can be accurately estimated, which can improve the estimation efficiency of individual-tree biomass. In this study, we first extracted four categories of indicators: canopy height model, spectral features, vegetation indices, and texture features from airborne-laser-scanning (ALS) data and hyperspectral data. We used these features as inputs to the random forest algorithm and screened out the optimal variable combination for tree-species classification, with an overall accuracy of 84.4% (kappa coefficient = 0.794). Then, we used ALS data to perform tree segmentation in forest plots to extract tree height, crown size, crown projected area, and crown volume. According to multivariate nonlinear fitting, the parameters of the individual-tree structure were introduced into the constant allometric ratio (CAR) biomass model to establish the biomass models of three tree species: Douglas fir, Red alder, and Bigleaf maple. The results showed that the model-fitting effects were improved after introducing the crown parameters. In addition, we also found that better tree segmentation results led to more accurate structural parameters.

TI  - Sentinel-2 MSI Observations of Water Clarity in Inland Waters across Hainan Island and Implications for SDG 6.3.2 Evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater on islands represents a precious resource and highly vulnerable ecosystem. For monitoring freshwater, satellite remote sensing is efficient and has large-scale application. This study proposed a modified model of the quasi-analytical algorithm (Z(SD)-QAAv6m) to retrieve the water clarity of inland waters (>1 km(2)) across Hainan Island, China using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument data. By adjusting the threshold of R-rs(665), the proposed model could accurately estimate water clarity with diverse optical properties on the island and avoid underestimation in moderately clear waters. Based upon this, the first spatiotemporal analysis of recent water clarity in Hainan Island was conducted. The results show that lake water clarity in the central region was generally higher (with average value of 1.4 m) than that of coastal regions (with average value of 1.2 m). Seasonally, the water clarity during the wet season was usually lower than that in the dry season, with average values of 1.1 m and 1.3 m across the island respectively. From 2017 to 2021, the proportion of water bodies with water clarity > 0.5 m increased from 60% to 100%. The overall spatial pattern of water clarity was correlated to the regional vegetation cover in Hainan Island, with higher clarity associated with higher vegetation cover in the central regions. The seasonal variation of water clarity may be attributed to heavy rainfall and runoff during the wet season; while the distinct annual variation may be benefited from the strengthened surface water protections in Hainan Province in recent years. This study provides a practical approach for evaluating the SDG 6.3.2 indicator in Hainan Island using remote sensed water clarity as a comprehensive water quality indicator and the findings could facilitate the island's water resource management and conservation.

TI  - An Unsupervised Saliency-Guided Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Accurate Burn Mapping from Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR data provide sufficient information for burned area detection in any weather condition, making it superior to optical data. In this study, we assess the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR images for precise forest-burned area mapping using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). Accurate mapping with DCNN techniques requires high quantity and quality training data. However, labeled ground truth might not be available in many cases or requires professional expertise to generate them via visual interpretation of aerial photography or field visits. To overcome this problem, we proposed an unsupervised method that derives DCNN training data from fuzzy c-means (FCM) clusters with the highest and lowest probability of being burned. Furthermore, a saliency-guided (SG) approach was deployed to reduce false detections and SAR image speckles. This method defines salient regions with a high probability of being burned. These regions are not affected by noise and can improve the model performance. The developed approach based on the SG-FCM-DCNN model was investigated to map the burned area of Rossomanno-Grottascura-Bellia, Italy. This method significantly improved the burn detection ability of non-saliency-guided models. Moreover, the proposed model achieved superior accuracy of 87.67% (i.e., more than 2% improvement) compared to other saliency-guided techniques, including SVM and DNN.

TI  - Approaches to Forecasting Damage by Invasive Forest Insects and Pathogens: A Cross-Assessment
T2  - BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonnative insects and pathogens pose major threats to forest ecosystems worldwide, greatly diminishing the ecosystem services trees provide. Given the high global diversity of arthropod and microbial species, their often unknown biological features or even identities, and their ease of accidental transport, there is an urgent need to better forecast the most likely species to cause damage. Several risk assessment approaches have been proposed or implemented to guide preventative measures. However, the underlying assumptions of each approach have rarely been explicitly identified or critically evaluated. We propose that evaluating the implicit assumptions, optimal usages, and advantages and limitations of each approach could help improve their combined utility. We consider four general categories: using prior pest status in native and previously invaded regions; evaluating statistical patterns of traits and gene sequences associated with a high impact; sentinel and other plantings to expose trees to insects and pathogens in native, nonnative, or experimental settings; and laboratory assays using detached plant parts or seedlings under controlled conditions. We evaluate how and under what conditions the assumptions of each approach are best met and propose methods for integrating multiple approaches to improve our forecasting ability and prevent losses from invasive pests.

TI  - Satellite Image Classification Using a Hybrid Manta Ray Foraging Optimization Neural Network
T2  - BIG DATA MINING AND ANALYTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A semi supervised image classification method for satellite images is proposed in this paper. The satellite images contain enormous data that can be used in various applications. The analysis of the data is a tedious task due to the amount of data and the heterogeneity of the data. Thus, in this paper, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) trained using Manta Ray Foraging Optimization algorithm (MRFO) is proposed. RBFNN is a three-layer network comprising of input, output, and hidden layers that can process large amounts. The trained network can discover hidden data patterns in unseen data. The learning algorithm and seed selection play a vital role in the performance of the network. The seed selection is done using the spectral indices to further improve the performance of the network. The manta ray foraging optimization algorithm is inspired by the intelligent behaviour of manta rays. It emulates three unique foraging behaviours namelys chain, cyclone, and somersault foraging. The satellite images contain enormous amount of data and thus require exploration in large search space. The spiral movement of the MRFO algorithm enables it to explore large search spaces effectively. The proposed method is applied on pre and post flooding Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of New Brunswick area. The method was applied to identify and classify the land cover changes in the area induced by flooding. The images are classified using the proposed method and a change map is developed using post classification comparison. The change map shows that a large amount of agricultural area was washed away due to flooding. The measurement of the affected area in square kilometres is also performed for mitigation activities. The results show that post flooding the area covered by water is increased whereas the vegetated area is decreased. The performance of the proposed method is done with existing state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of Soil Properties and Nutrient Uptake for Sustainable Intensification of Rainfed Pigeon Pea (<i>Cajanus cajana</i>) in Semi-Arid Tropics of India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A study was conducted at Kalamandari Tanda-1 micro-watershed, Karnataka, India, to assess the spatio-temporal variability of surface soil properties sampled from 23 varied soil-phase units, delineated using IRS P6 LISS-IV merged Cartosat-I imagery (2.5 m spatial resolution). Three sets of surface soil samples (231 in each set) were collected, analyzed, and interpolated to evaluate the soil spatio-temporal variability. Further soil-phase-wise composite representative samples (23 in each set) were collected before the sowing and after the harvest of pigeon peasin January 2019 and 2020. Results showed that the soil OC with N, Mg with Ca, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) with Mn and K2O have a significantly positive association (p < 0.01) during both years. Similarly, a significantly positive association (p < 0.05) was observed among soil OC and N with Cu, Mn with CEC, and Zn with Fe, while a negative association was seen between available P2O5 and Na. Skewness from descriptive statistics revealed that pH, EC, Cu, Mg, B, and ESP distribution varied temporally, whereas other parameters remained almost unchanged. Geo-statistically, the spatial distribution of measured soil properties was best fitted to exponential, stable, and K-Bessel models. The available N in 2018 and the ESP in 2019 have shown weak spatial dependency, whereas the rest of the soil parameters showed moderate and strong spatial dependency. These interpolated maps were exported as vector layers to quantify soil-phase-wise spatio-temporal variability of soil properties.

TI  - Temporal changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and local climate in the Krueng Peusangan Watershed (KPW) area, Aceh, Indonesia
T2  - BULLETIN OF GEOGRAPHY-SOCIO-ECONOMIC SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Watersheds are important sources of various ecosystem services. The Krueng Peusangan Watershed (KPW), one of the watersheds in Aceh Province, is expected to become the "lungs" of the ecology of the north-central part of Aceh. Currently, the KPW is one of the watersheds that suffers from severe or critical damage, especially that caused by changes in forest cover. Spatiotemporal monitoring of changes in landscape patterns (composition and configuration) is needed to inform policy and support planning for sustainable watershed management. This study aims to: 1) determine the pattern of changes in LULC in KPW in two decades (1999- 2009 and 2009-2019, and 2) determine the impact of changes in the LULC pattern on the local climate. Landsat Satellite Imagery for three years (1999, 2009, and 2019) is used to classify LULC. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and remote sensing are used to analyze it. Each satellite image is classified into six categories: built-up area, forest, agriculture, bare land, wetland, and water body. This classification resulted in LULC maps for 1999, 2009, and 2019 with kappa coefficients of 0.84, 0.88, and 0.84. It is found that between 1999-2009 and 2009-2019, there has been a consistent decrease in forest cover area and an increase in built-up area. Local climate change is also occurring in this KPW. Continuous monitoring of LULC changes in KPW is also necessary to keep management planning up to date.

TI  - Early Identification and Influencing Factors Analysis of Active Landslides in Mountainous Areas of Southwest China Using SBAS-InSAR
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Potential landslides in the mountainous areas of southwest China pose a serious threat to the lives and property of local residents. Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technology has the advantages of wide coverage, all weather applicability, and low cost and can quickly and accurately identify large range of active landslides, making it a useful geodetic tool for the early identification and prevention of landslides. This paper employed small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technology and ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data from January 2019 to December 2021 to early identify active landslides in the Maoxian County to Li County National Highway (G317 and G213). The InSAR deformation results were verified by geometric distortion analysis, optical remote sensing interpretation, and field investigation, and 115 active landslides were successfully determined, among which 23 active landslides were identified by ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data together. In addition, InSAR deformation results show that fault, stratigraphic lithology, and rainfall are the three main factors that accelerate the deformation of active landslides and can trigger new active landslides. This study can provide an important reference for the early identification and prevention of landslides in mountainous areas.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Assessment Policy and Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation causes the 'heat island' problem in megacities worldwide. The industrialisation has fuelled the increase in the urbanisation in Indian cities. This work measures and characterises Ahmedabad's heat island variations (India). The study uses two satellite passes of the MODIS sensor over the summer for the last three years to assess urban heat island intensity (UHII). Sentinel-2B records are used to create a land-use map. The study considers the impact of land-use patterns on summer UHII diurnal fluctuations. Daily diurnal changes in land surface temperature (LST) are being analysed. Locations and land-use land-cover patterns affect UHII. Satellite observations show greater LST values during the day than at night, however, UHII is stronger at night. Urban UHII is stronger rural UHII. Lower vegetation cover area is one of the key causes of UHII development, as seen in the region's Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Properties and Types over Southern Africa and Reunion Island Determined from Ground-Based and Satellite Observations over a 13-Year Period (2008-2021)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires occur seasonally in Southern Africa, from June to November, increasing tropospheric aerosol loading and triggering harmful consequences for the environment and human health. This study aims to examine 13 years of aerosol optical characteristics and types over Southern Africa and Reunion Island. Using AERONET sun photometers and MODIS observations, we found that a high aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent are associated with two predominant types of aerosols (biomass burning/urban industrial and mixed type) throughout the spring season. According to CALIOP observations, the major aerosol types with occurrence frequencies above 10% are polluted continental/smoke, polluted dust, and elevated smoke, whereas dust, clean continental, and dusty marine have occurrence frequencies below 1%. In comparison to other seasons, the vertical profiles of elevated smoke have different shapes in spring, with a seasonal shift in the peak altitude (from 3-4 km), when fire activity is at its maximum. At these altitudes, the northern regions presented occurrence frequencies of 32% on average, while lower values were found for the southern or farthest regions (<10-20% on average). The Lagrangian HYSPLIT model back-trajectories demonstrated eastward transport, with air masses from South America and the Atlantic Ocean that recirculate around the study sites. The aerosols are mainly derived from active biomass burning areas near the study sites and, to a lesser extent, from remote sources such as South America.

TI  - Abstracts of Presentations to the Working Session on Improving Predictive Modeling of Mycotoxin Risk for Africa Held at the 3rd ASM2022 on 7 September 2022, in Stellenbosch, South Africa
T2  - TOXINS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2008, the African Postharvest Losses Information Systems project (APHLIS, accessed on 6 September 2022) developed an algorithm for estimating the scale of cereal postharvest losses (PHLs). The relevant scientific literature and contextual information was used to build profiles of the PHLs occurring along the value chains of nine cereal crops by country and province for 37 sub-Saharan African countries. The APHLIS provides estimates of PHL figures where direct measurements are not available. A pilot project was subsequently initiated to explore the possibility of supplementing these loss estimates with information on the aflatoxin risk. Using satellite data on drought and rainfall, a time series of agro-climatic aflatoxin risk warning maps for maize was developed covering the countries and provinces of sub-Saharan Africa. The agro-climatic risk warning maps for specific countries were shared with mycotoxin experts from those countries for review and comparison with their aflatoxin incidence datasets. The present Work Session was a unique opportunity for African food safety mycotoxins experts, as well as other international experts, to meet and deepen the discussion about prospects for using their experience and their data to validate and improve agro-climatic risk modeling approaches.

TI  - Secondary trauma response in emergency services systems (STRESS) project: quantifying and predicting vicarious trauma in emergency medical services personnel.
T2  - British paramedic journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: There is a lack of literature exploring vicarious trauma (VT) in emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. VT is emotional countertransference that occurs between the clinician and patient. The presence of trauma- or stressor-related disorders could be a factor in the rising suicide rate in these clinicians.Methods: This was a cross-sectional statewide study of American EMS personnel, using one-stage area sampling. Nine EMS agencies were selected to participate based on geographic area, who then provided data about annual call volume and mix. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised was used to quantify VT. Univariate analyses used chi-square and ANOVA to evaluate the relationship between VT and various psychosocial and demographic characteristics. Factors significant in the univariate analyses were included in a logistic regression to determine predictors of VT while controlling for potential confounders.Results: A total of 691 respondents participated in the study, of which 44.4% were female and 12.3% were minorities. Overall, 40.9% had VT. Of those, 52.5% scored high enough to potentially illicit immune system modulation. Compared to those without VT, more than four times as many EMS professionals with VT self-reported as currently in counselling (9.2% v. 2.2%; p < 0.01). Approximately one in four EMS professionals (24.0%) had considered suicide, while nearly half (45.0%) knew an EMS provider who had died by suicide. There were multiple predictors of VT, including female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.55; p = 0.02) and childhood exposure to emotional neglect (OR 2.28; p < 0.01) or domestic violence (OR 1.91; p = 0.05). Those with other stress syndromes, such as burnout or compassion fatigue, were 2.1 and 4.3 times more likely to have VT, respectively.Conclusions: Among study participants, 41% suffered from VT, and 24% had considered suicide. As a largely understudied phenomenon in EMS professionals, additional research on VT should focus on causality and the mitigation of sentinel events experienced in the workplace.

TI  - Estimating Land Subsidence and Gravimetric Anomaly Induced by Aquifer Overexploitation in the Chandigarh Tri-City Region, India by Coupling Remote Sensing with a Deep Learning Neural Network Model
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilizes surface displacement data from Persistent Scatterer SAR Interferometry (PSInSAR) of Sentinel-1 satellite and groundwater storage change data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission to understand land subsidence in the Chandigarh tri-city region. The satellite datasets are used along with the groundwater level data obtained from wells over the study area. Since the GRACE data are available at a much coarser spatial resolution of 1o by 1o, challenges remain in correlating the dataset with PSInSAR displacement that has been multi-looked at 14 m by 14 m resolution. Therefore, multiple sources of data (i.e., the monthly average of GRACE data, groundwater storage change and monthly average PSInSAR displacement per pixel, and interpolated groundwater level data from wells for 2017 to 2022) have been deployed into a deep learning multi-layer perceptron (DLMLP) model to estimate the groundwater storage change at the urban level. This has an indirect downscaling method that is carried out successfully using the DLMLP model for the estimation of groundwater storage changes at the urban level, which is usually complicated by applying direct downscaling methods on the GRACE data. Thus, the DLMLP model developed here is a distinctive approach considered for estimating the changes in groundwater storage using PSInSAR displacement, groundwater data from wells, and GRACE data. The DLMLP model gives an R-2-statistics value of 0.91 and 0.89 in the training and testing phases, respectively, and has a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.23 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87.

TI  - A Contribution to Critique of 'Global Crisis Situation': Critical Dialogue Between Cultural-Historical Activity Theory and Iranian Marxist Tradition
T2  - HUMAN ARENAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, based on mutual appropriation of concepts from cultural-historical activity theory (especially Andy Blunden's works) and Iranian Marxist tradition (especially Kamal Khosravi's ideas), I have elaborated two crises which, we believe, are main characteristics of our historical stage and other crises are manifestations of them: (a) crisis of historical perspective on human self-emancipation and (b) crisis of theory in emancipatory social science. Crisis of historical perspective indicates lack of integrated worldview and concept about emancipated future, while crisis of theory addresses the fundamental problem of theoretical categories in expressing relations between elements and factors of reality. Categories of mode of existence (Marx, Khosravi) and mode of collaboration (Blunden) are proposed in order to solve these crises. Based on the mutual appropriation of mode of existence and mode of collaboration, I have tried to formulate three modes of existence of projects (class-project, project, and life-project) which can explain the totality of a social reality. These crises and proposed categories have been elaborated in this article, in critical dialogue with some theoretical frameworks like feminist account of intersectionality and German-Scandinavian Critical Psychology's main concept: conduct of everyday life.

TI  - Integrative Assessment of Sediment Quality in the Sao Francisco River (Mina Gerais, Brazil)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sao Francisco River (one of the most important South American rivers) has many contamination sources, but just a few environmental assessments have been conducted. A weight-of-evidence approach identified the pollution sources (industrial activities, mineral processing, fisheries, and tourism) in the river and the city of Tres Marias based on two different lines of evidence: the structure of the benthic community (biological monitoring working party score system, abundance of taxa, number of individuals, Margalef species richness, Pielou evenness, and Shannon-Wiener diversity) and the physicochemical determination of sediments (%fines, TOC, nitrate, ammonium, ammonia, ammoniacal nitrogen, metalloids, and SEM/AVSs). The results show that the wastewater treatment plant was the most important source of pollution. A factory was also detected as a source of contamination, with related adverse effects having been measured downstream. Other sources of contamination and stress were detected in the studied area. The macro-benthic identification study identified three different sentinel species (Tanytarsus sp., Crytochironomus sp., and Polypedilum sp.) for future monitoring assessments of the sediment quality in riverine areas. Thus, an improvement in the management of river effluents and more measures focused on cutting contaminant emissions from the waste treatment plant are recommended.

TI  - Resurrection Reading: Margaret Cavendish Drafts the Afterlife
T2  - ENGLISH LITERARY RENAISSANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Margaret Cavendish's quest for intellectual and literary fame garnered infamy during her own lifetime-so she extended her pursuit of favorable renown into the afterlife, envisioning "a glorious resurrection in following ages" ("To the Two Universities," in Philosophical and Physical Opinions [1655]). She sought to impart a residue of herself in her texts which could then be reanimated in the minds of readers: "I am industrious," she declares, in Sociable Letters (1664), "to do some Work, wherein I may leave my Idea, or live in an idea, or my Idea may Live in Many Brains." This essay situates Cavendish's vision of living in the "many brains" of future readers within both her natural philosophical and fictional works. From the notions of perception, conception, and the composition of matter put forth in her Observations upon Experimental Philosophy (1666), I extrapolate a theory of reading consonant with Cavendish's vitalist-materialist worldview. From the speculative appendix of her Grounds of Natural Philosophy (1668), I piece together a theory of resurrection and the mechanisms by which a fully material authorial afterlife might plausibly arise. These operations remain tentative in Cavendish's explicitly scientific works, but they are more centrally enacted in her fictional Blazing World (co-published with Observations in 1666). I suggest that this text's famously baffling scenes of soul-swapping, body-hopping, and world-building coalesce in modeling the kind of vulnerable authorship, collaborative readership, and intersubjective relationships that could produce the "glorious resurrection" in the minds of others to which Cavendish aspires.

TI  - Mechanical Washing Prevents Transmission of Bacterial, Viral, and Protozoal Murine Pathogens from Cages
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Infectious agents have varying susceptibilities to thermal inactivation and/or mechanical removal from cages by the use of heated, pressurized water. In this study, we tested whether 5 specific infectious organisms (Candidatus savagella [segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB)], Helicobacter sp., mouse norovirus (MNV), Tritrichomonas sp., and Entamoeba muris) could survive the cage wash process and still infect naive mice. These 5 organisms were chosen due to their prevalence in rodent colonies, environmental stability, and/or potential to influence experimental outcomes. Cages that had housed mice shedding all 5 organisms were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1) sanitization in a tunnel washer followed by autoclaving (121 degrees C [250 degrees F] for 20 min; n = 40 cages); 2) sanitization in a tunnel washer (82 degrees C [180 degrees F] for an average of 30 s; n = 40 cages); or 3) control (bedding change only; n = 40 cages). The presence of these agents in the cage was assessed by performing PCR on swabs of the empty soiled cage interior before and after the treatment. In addition, to determine if any residual nucleic acid was infectious, 2 Swiss outbred (J:ARC(S)) female mice were housed for 7 d in cages from each treatment group. The above procedures were then repeated so that every week each pair of J:ARC(S) mice (n = 10 pairs of mice/treatment group) were housed in another cage that underwent the same treatment; this was done for a total of 4 consecutive, 1-wk-long periods. Swabs collected from soiled cages were PCR-positive for SFB, Helicobacter, MNV, Tritrichomonas, and Entamoeba in 99%, 97%, 39%, 63%, and 73% of the cages tested, respectively. Cages in the tunnel wash group that were PCR-positive for SFB, Helicobacter, Tritrichomonas, and Entamoeba before treatment remained PCR-positive in 8%, 15%, 43%, and 10% of positive cages, respectively. None of the cages from the autoclave group were PCR-positive for any of the agents after treatment. None of the mice housed in cages in either the autoclave or tunnel wash groups became infected with any of the agents. However, 80%, 60%, and 100% of the pairs of mice housed in untreated cages were PCR-positive for SFB, MNV, and Entamoeba, respec-tively. None of the mice housed in untreated cages were positive for Helicobacter or Tritrichomonas. Our results suggest that nucleic acids from these bacterial and protozoal organisms may remain in cages after mechanical cage washing, but these nucleic acids are not infectious, and autoclaving is not necessary to prevent transmission.

T2  - CONSULTING PSYCHOLOGY JOURNAL-PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - While leaders are scrambling to take up the issue of diversity and inclusion in the context of the heightened consciousness of systemic and structural racism prompted by the Black Lives Matter campaign, the world of coaching has been slow to engage with the issue of racial justice. This year-long qualitative study responds to a gap in coaching literature, which is currently silent on the impact of systemic racism on coaching practice. In this paper we focus on the views and experiences of coaches who identify as Black, Indigenous, or people of color (BIPOC). The coaches are from five countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Kenya, South Africa, and New Zealand), offering a global perspective on how this issue shows up in coaching. Focus groups were convened virtually with coaches from each region. We asked the question, "What would need to change in the world of coaching for it to adopt an anti-racist approach?" The data, which was analyzed using thematic analysis, revealed that the BIPOC coaches in this study experience the world of coaching as a White space in which colorblindness reinforces and reproduces the power dynamics of structural racism. The BIPOC coaches' testimonies suggests that an anti-racist approach oriented toward decoloniality could be much more effective in breaking the patterns of underrepresentation and exclusion at senior-leadership levels across organizations.

TI  - Lineament analysis as a seismic precursor: The El Mayor Cucapah earthquake of April 4, 2010 (MW7.2), Baja California, Mexico
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An earthquake called the MW7.2 "El Mayor Cucapah" earthquake on April 4, 2010 has been analyzed for seismic precursor. The changes in the lineament system concerning its pattern and time intervals were analyzed during the earthquake preparation period and occurrence using the automated lineament detection method. The Landsat 5 TM images were processed using LESSA and ADALGEO software obtaining similar results. The statistical analysis revealed the stress accumulation due to plate interaction during earthquake formation. The study shows that the number of extracted lineaments changes rapidly about 23 months before the earthquake, and the systems return to the initial stage after 23 months. Most lineaments coincide with the extension of the San Andreas Fault as NW direction is the dominant trend. Thus, it can be concluded that the featural changes within the Rose diagram corresponding to the different strokes direction along with oriented elongation lines as disclosed in the present study using satellite images could be identified as a mid-term and/or short-term precursors of the earthquake. However, even though the dynamism of the El Mayor Cucapah earthquake is found in the extracted lineaments, it is possible to isolate more significant earthquakes even if new ones appear near the zone. Moreover, using two algorithms for lineament detection allows for the tectonics to corroborate the obtained lineaments and dynamism.(c) 2022 Editorial office of Geodesy and Geodynamics.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - &lt;b&gt;Background and Objective:&lt;/b&gt; Coral reefs on Samalona Island have been under pressure both by natural events and by human (anthropogenic) activities, which have caused area degradation. Research on changes in the area of coral reefs is urgently needed. Hence, the objective of this research was to determine changes in the area of coral reefs from 2017, 2020 and 2023 and to determine the percentage of coral reef cover on Samalona Island. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; The method used to determine changes in the area of coral reef is the (unsupervised) method using Sentinel 2-A imagery and processed with ArcMap 10.8 while determining the percentage of coral reef cover (UPT) and processing with CPCe software. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; From the results of image processing, it was found that changes occur every 3 years, namely 0.22 Ha, while the results of the accuracy test from the results of image interpretation with a ground check were 87.44%. The results of the percentage of coral reef cover obtained at station I, amounted to 6.99%, at station II 20.55% and at station III, 29.39%. The percentage of coral reef cover on Samalona Island in poor condition refers to the Decree of the Minister of State for the Environment No. 4 of 2001 concerning standard criteria for damage to coral reefs. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; There is a change in the area of coral reefs on Samalona Island which is heading to a damaged or declining condition every three years from 2017, 2020 to 2023.

TI  - Indicators of the effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems, including lakes, streams, and wetlands, are responsive to climate change and other natural and anthropogenic stresses. These ecosystems are frequently hydrologically and ecologically connected with one another and their surrounding landscapes, thereby integrating changes throughout their watersheds. The responses of any given freshwater ecosystem to climate change depend on the magnitude of climate forcing, interactions with other anthropogenic and natural changes, and the characteristics of the ecosystem itself. Therefore, the magnitude and manner in which freshwater ecosystems respond to climate change are difficult to predict a priori. We present a conceptual model to elucidate how freshwater ecosystems are altered by climate change. We identify eleven indicators that describe the response of freshwater ecosystems to climate change, discuss their potential value and limitations, and describe supporting measurements. Indicators are organized in three interrelated categories: hydrologic, water quality, and ecosystem structure and function. The indicators are supported by data sets with a wide range of temporal and spatial coverage, and they inform important scientific and management needs. Together, these indicators improve the understanding and management of the effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Cloud Mesoscale Cellular Classification and Diurnal Cycle Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine stratocumulus (MSC) clouds are important to the climate as they cover vast areas of the ocean's surface, greatly affecting radiation balance of the Earth. Satellite imagery shows that MSC clouds exhibit different morphologies of closed or open mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) but many limitations still exist in studying MCC dynamics. Here, we present a convolutional neural network algorithm to classify pixel-level closed and open MCC cloud types, trained by either visible or infrared channels from a geostationary SEVIRI satellite to allow, for the first time, their diurnal detection, with a 30 min. temporal resolution. Our probability of detection was 91% and 92% for closed and open MCC, respectively, which is in line with day-only detection schemes. We focused on the South-East Atlantic Ocean during months of biomass burning season, between 2016 and 2018. Our resulting MCC type area coverage, cloud effective radii, and cloud optical depth probability distributions over the research domain compare well with monthly and daily averages from MODIS. We further applied our algorithm on GOES-16 imagery over the South-East Pacific (SEP), another semi-permanent MCC domain, and were able to show good prediction skills, thereby representing the SEP diurnal cycle and the feasibility of our method to be applied globally on different satellite platforms.

TI  - Combining Multi-Dimensional SAR Parameters to Improve RVoG Model for Coniferous Forest Height Inversion Using ALOS-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers extinction coefficient changes with height caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of scatterers in heterogeneous forests and uses the InSAR phase center height histogram and Gaussian function to fit the normalized extinction coefficient curve so as to reflect the vertical structure of the heterogeneous forest. Combining polarization decomposition based on the physical model and the PolInSAR parameter inversion method, the ground and volume coherence matrices can be separated based on the polarization characteristics and interference coherence diversity. By combining the new abovementioned parameters, the semi-empirical improved RVoG inversion model can be used to both quantify the effects of temporal decorrelation on coherence and phase errors and avoid the effects of small vertical wavenumbers on the large temporal baseline of spaceborne data. The model provided robust inversion for the height of the coniferous forest and enhanced the parameter estimation of the forest structure. This study addressed the influence of vertical structure differences on the extinction coefficient, though the coherence of the ground and volume in sparse vegetation areas could not be accurately estimated, and the oversensitivity of temporal decorrelation caused by inappropriate vertical wavenumbers. According to this method we used spaceborne L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR data on the Saihanba forest in Hebei Province acquired in 2020 for the purpose of height inversion, with a temporal baseline range of 14-70 days and the vertical wavenumber range of 0.01-0.03 rad/m. The results are further validated using sample data, with R-2 reaching 0.67.

TI  - Optimal Land-cover Classification Feature Selection in Arid Areas based on Sentinel-2 Imagery and Spectral Indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Adding spectral indices to Sentinel-2 spectral bands to improve land-cover (LC) classification with limited sample size can affect the accuracy due to the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we compared the performance metrics of Random Forest (RF) classifier with three different combinations of features for land cover classification in an urban arid area. The first combination used the ten Sentinel-2 bands with 10 and 20 m spatial resolution. The second combination consisted of the first combination in addition to five common spectral indices (15 features). The third combination represented the best output of features in terms of performance metrics after applying recursive feature elimination (RFE) for the second combination. The results showed that applying RFE reduced the number of features in combination 2 from 15 to 8 and the average F1-score indicator increased by nearly 8 and 6 percent in comparison with using the other two combinations respectively. The findings of this study confirmed the importance of feature selection in improving LC classification accuracy in arid areas through removing the redundant variable when using limited sample size and using spectral indices with spectral bands, respectively.

TI  - Estimation of seasonal influenza disease burden using sentinel site data in Pakistan 2017-2019: A cross-sectional study
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic highlighted the need for reliable disease burden estimation from low- and middle-income countries like Pakistan. We designed retrospective age-stratified estimation of influenza-related severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) incidence in Islamabad Pakistan 2017-2019. Materials and MethodsThe catchment area was mapped on SARI data from one designated influenza sentinel site and other healthcare facilities in the Islamabad region. The incidence rate was calculated as per 100,000 for each age group with 95% confidence interval. ResultsThe catchment population for the sentinel site was 0.7 million against the total denominator of 1.015 million, and incidence rates were adjusted. During January 2017 to December 2019, among 13,905 hospitalizations, 6715 (48%) patients were enrolled; 1208 of these (18%) were positive for influenza. During 2017, influenza A/H3 dominated with 52% detections followed by A(H1N1)pdm09 (35%) and influenza B (13%). Furthermore, elderly 65+ years age group had highest hospitalizations and influenza positive. The incidence rates of all cause respiratory and influenza-related SARI were highest among children >5 years; highest incidence was found in 0 to 11 month/year group with 424/100,000 cases and lowest in 5-15 years 56/100,000. The estimated average annual influenza-associated hospitalization percentage was 29.3% during the study period. ConclusionInfluenza accounts for a significant proportion of respiratory morbidity and hospitalization. These estimates would enable governments for evidence-based decisions and priority allocation of health resources. It is necessary to test for other respiratory pathogens for more clear disease burden estimation.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) to identify their impacts from 2000 to 2020 along the coast of Kanyakumari district, India using remote sensing techniques. Landsat images are used to estimate the LULC changes and the MODIS data for LST. The Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) method is used, and the LULC is classified into six cate-gories: Agriculture Land, Barren Land, Salt Pan, Sandy Beach, Settlement, and Waterbody. Within the two decades of the present change detection study, upheave in the Settlement area of 49.89% is noticed, and the Agriculture Land is exploited by 20.09%. Salt Pan emits a high LST of 31.57 degrees C, and the Waterbodies are noticed with a low LST of 28.9 degrees C. However, the overall rate of LST decreased by 0.56 degrees C during this period. This study will help policymakers make appropriate planning and management to overcome the impact of LULC and LST in the forthcoming years.(c) 2022 Editorial office of Geodesy and Geodynamics.

TI  - Spontaneously Ruptured Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Computed Tomography-Based Assessment
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Spontaneously ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma (SRHCC) is an uncommon and life-threatening complication in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is usually associated with chronic liver disease and has a poor prognosis with a high mortality rate during the acute phase. SRHCC can cause a severe and urgent condition of acute abdomen disease and requires a correct diagnosis to achieve adequate treatment. Clinical presentation is related to the presence of hemoperitoneum, and abdominal pain is the most common symptom (66-100% of cases). Although the treatment approach is not unique, trans-arterial (chemo)embolization (TAE/TACE) followed by staged hepatectomy has shown better results in long-term survival. A multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scan is a pivotal technique in the diagnosis of SRHCC due to its diagnostic accuracy and optimal temporal resolution. The correct interpretation of the main CT findings in SRHCC, such as active contrast extravasation and the sentinel clot sign, is fundamental for a prompt and correct diagnosis. Furthermore, CT also plays a role as a post-operative control procedure, especially in patients treated with TAE/TACE. Therefore, a multi-phase CECT scan should be the diagnostic tool of choice in SRHCC since it suggests an immediate need for treatment with a consequent improvement in prognosis.

TI  - Estimating Double Cropping Plantations in the Brazilian Cerrado through PlanetScope Monthly Mosaics
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado are increasing grain production by cultivating second crops during the same crop growing season. The release of PlanetScope (PS) satellite images represents an innovative opportunity to monitor double cropping production. In this study, we analyzed the potential of six PS monthly mosaics from the 2021/2022 crop growing season to discriminate double cropping areas in the municipality of Goiatuba, Goias State, Brazil. The four multispectral bands of the PS images were converted into normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), green-red normalized difference index (GRNDI), and textural features derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The ten most important combinations of these attributes were used to map double cropping systems and other land use and land cover classes (cultivated pasture, sugarcane, and native vegetation) of the municipality through the Random Forest classifier. Training and validation samples were obtained from field campaigns conducted in October 2021 and April 2022. PS mosaic from February 2022 was the most relevant data. The overall accuracy and Kappa index of the final map were 92.2% and 0.892, respectively, with an accuracy confidence of 81%. This approach can be expanded for mapping and monitoring other agricultural frontiers in the Cerrado biome.

TI  - Multiscale Observation Product (MOP) for Temporal Flood Inundation Mapping of the 2015 Dallas Texas Flood
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new data fusion multiscale observation product (MOP) for flood emergencies. The MOP was created by integrating multiple sources of contributed open-source data with traditional spaceborne remote sensing imagery in order to provide a sequence of high spatial and temporal resolution flood inundation maps. The study focuses on the 2015 Memorial Day floods that caused up to USD 61 million dollars of damage. The Hydraulic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model was used to simulate water surfaces for the northern part of the Trinity River in Dallas, using reservoir surcharge releases and topographic data provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. A measure of fit assessment is performed on the MOP flood maps with the HEC-RAS simulated flood inundation output to quantify spatial differences. Estimating possible flood inundation using individual datasets that vary spatially and temporally allow to gain an understanding of how much each observational dataset contributes to the overall water estimation. Results show that water surfaces estimated by MOP are comparable with the simulated output for the duration of the flood event. Additionally, contributed data, such as Civil Air Patrol, although they may be geographically sparse, become an important data source when fused with other observation data.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma is an aggressive malignant skin tumor with high recurrence and low survival. Lymph nodal metastases are associated with a worse overall prognosis. Our aim was to assess how lymph node procedures and positivity are influenced by demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics. The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database was searched for all cases of Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin between 2000 and 2019. Univariable analysis was conducted using the chi-squared test with the aim of identifying differences in lymph node procedures and lymph node positivity for each variable. We identified 9182 patients, of which 3139 had sentinel lymph node biopsy/sampling, and 1072 had therapeutic lymph node dissection. Increasing age, increasing tumor size, and truncal location were associated with higher positive lymph node rates.

People were drawn to Christ groups because they were different from the surrounding culture. Christianity would not have survived if it did not offer a counter-cultural ethical stance; a new social imaginary; alternative membership options; a flexible organizational structure; a holistic worldview; and a creative, innovative communication style-in one phrase: a new way of life.

TI  - Radiometric Re-Compensation of Sentinel-1 SAR Data Products for Artificial Biases due to Antenna Pattern Changes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR data products for Sentinel-1 have been freely available and delivered operationally on behalf of the European Space Agency since the routine operation of Sentinel-1A in 2014. These products were delivered using the best knowledge at their processing time, in particular with respect to the radiometric calibration. As reprocessing of SAR data products is not foreseen in the nominal processing chain of Sentinel-1, changes of applied processing parameters impact the SAR data quality and can be a disturbing factor for long-term monitoring of radiometric features. In particular, antenna pattern updates produce artificial radiometric steps which are visible in radar backscatter time series, especially in case of monitoring radiometric stable reference targets. This paper introduces a method for correcting changes due to such updates without the need of reprocessing SAR data products. The method was applied to long-lasting time series of data acquisitions which are used to monitor the radiometric performance with reference targets at the DLR calibration site. It has been shown that artificial steps due to antenna pattern updates disappear in backscatter timelines after correct application. Furthermore, the derived absolute radiometric accuracy was improved for the joint observation period of S1A and S1B for almost five years until December 2021.

TI  - Current Approaches to the Management of Sentinel Node Procedures in Early Vulvar Cancer in Germany: A Web-Based Nationwide Analysis of Practices
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymph node involvement is the most important prognostic factor for recurrence and survival in vulvar cancer. Sentinel node (SN) procedure can be offered in well-selected patients with early vulvar cancer. This study aimed to assess current management practices with respect to the sentinel node procedure in women with early vulvar cancer in Germany. Methods: A Web-based survey was conducted. Questionnaires were e-mailed to 612 gynecology departments. Data were summarized as frequencies and analyzed using the chi-square test. Results: A total of 222 hospitals (36.27%) responded to the invitation to participate. Among the responders, 9.5% did not offer the SN procedure. However, 79.5% evaluated SNs by ultrastaging. In vulvar cancer of the midline with unilateral localized positive SN, 49.1% and 48.6% of respondents, respectively, would perform ipsilateral or bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection. Repeat SN procedure was performed by 16.2% of respondents. For isolated tumor cells (ITCs) or micrometastases, 28.1% and 60.5% of respondents, respectively, would perform inguinal lymph node dissection, whereas 19.3% and 23.8%, respectively, would opt for radiation without further surgical intervention. Notably, 50.9% of respondents would not initiate any further therapy and 15.1% would opt for expectant management. Conclusions: The majority of German hospitals implement the SN procedure. However, only 79.5% of respondents performed ultrastaging and only 28.1% were aware that ITC may affect survival in vulvar cancer. There is a need to ensure that the management of vulvar cancer follows the latest recommendations and clinical evidence. Deviations from state-of-the-art management should only be after a detailed discussion with the concerned patient.

TI  - Evaluation of <i>Leptospira</i> infection and exposure in free-roaming cat populations in northern California and southern Texas
T2  - JOURNAL OF FELINE MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesLeptospirosis is a re-emergent zoonotic bacterial disease associated with renal and hepatic injury. In free-roaming cats in some regions, a high prevalence of Leptospira antibodies has been identified, and pathogenic leptospires have been detected in renal tissue, indicating that they may play a role in Leptospira epidemiology. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Leptospira seroreactivity and urinary shedding of Leptospira DNA in free-roaming cats from northern California and southern Texas. A secondary objective was to compare the results of a point-of-care (POC) assay, designed to detect Leptospira antibodies, with the results of the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) when applied to serum samples from feral cats. MethodsSpecimens were obtained from free-roaming cats from northern California (n = 52; 2020) and southern Texas (n = 75; 2017). Leptospira quantitative PCR was performed on blood and urine specimens from Californian cats. Serum samples from Californian and Texan cats were subjected to MAT to categorize them as Leptospira antibody-positive or antibody-negative. The performance of the POC assay was assessed using the MAT as the gold standard. ResultsLeptospira DNA was not detected in the blood or urine of any cats tested. The results of the MAT were positive in 17.3% (n = 9) of Californian cats and 10.7% (n = 8) of Texan cats (P = 0.3). The median MAT titer was 1:100 (range 1:100-1:200) in Californian cats and 1:200 (range 1:100-1:800) in Texan cats. The POC assay was negative in all specimens. Conclusions and relevanceFree-roaming cats in California and Texas are exposed to Leptospira species and may have the potential to act as sentinel hosts. No cats had evidence of current infection, as determined using PCR on blood and urine specimens. The POC test did not reliably detect anti-Leptospira antibodies in these cats. The role of cats in the maintenance or shedding of pathogenic leptospires requires further investigation.

TI  - Climate Change Attitudes and Fossil Fuel Extraction and Distribution in Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely accepted that the burning of fossil fuels is a major contributor to climate change. Our question is: How are the related extraction and distribution activities viewed in Canada? This article analyzes Canadian public opinion data on five supply-side energy policies: expanding the oil sands, drilling for oil in the Arctic, fracking, expanding an oil pipeline, and shipping oil by rail. It applies social psychological models to identify factors associated with support for and opposition to these policies. Climate change attitudes have typically been found to be significant predictors of climate policy support. Instead, this study finds that having an ecological worldview is a strong predictor for each of the policies. This suggests that these policies are seen as having an effect on the environment but less so as affecting climate change. Contextual factors, such as region of residence and political orientation, are relevant predictors, suggesting that framing by political parties, industry, and social movement organizations has had a significant effect on support and opposition.

TI  - The Urban Heat Island Analysis for the City of Zagreb in the Period 2013-2022 Utilizing Landsat 8 Satellite Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a phenomenon specific to urban areas where higher air temperatures manifest in the city area in relation to its surrounding rural landscape. Currently, UHI is one of the most dangerous environmental conditions for cities as well as their residents. It is expected that the intensity of UHI will increase with climate change. This work presents an analysis of the UHI phenomenon for the City of Zagreb, Croatia in the summertime period 2013-2022. In order to explore UHI, Land Surface Temperature (LST) was calculated using Landsat 8 (OLI TIRS sensor) satellite imagery. After the delineation of UHI, calculated temperatures were put in relation to NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) and NDBI (Normalised Difference Built-Up Index) indices for the study area. Results show the similarity of mean temperatures over the observed period. However, the influence of external variables on UHI's spatial expression was observed. Forest-covered areas and other green parts of the city's infrastructure express the lowest temperatures, while built-up sites are the hottest points in cities. Results confirm the importance of urban green infrastructure for resilient cities and present the results of a long-term UHI observation in a Southeast European city.

TI  - An enhanced approach to mangrove forest analysis in the Colombian Pacific coast using optical and SAR data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of land cover is crucial for effectively planning and managing territories. For example, the Colombian Pacific Coast (CPC), a biodiversity hotspot, is home to mangrove forests that provide environmental services to local communities. This study utilized robust multi-sensor and multi-annual satellite data, combined with machine learning in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, to improve the detection of mangrove forests in the CPC. Satellite images from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 missions were utilized along with L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) to quantify changes in mangrove cover between 2009 and 2019. Optical indices and SAR textures were used to identify mangrove cover, and a Random For-est supervised machine learning algorithm was applied for image classification. The multisensory composites produced moderate to high overall accuracies (OA) classifications. Our findings indi-cate that between 2009 (155,394.3 ha) and 2019 (144,704.3 ha), there was a net reduction of 6.88% in mangrove forest cover in the CPC. This study provides important insights into the con-servation and management of Colombian coastal territories and demonstrates the effectiveness of using optical and radar data to accurately recognize coastal forest cover, specifically in tropical mangrove forests.

TI  - A Random Forest-Based Multi-Index Classification (RaFMIC) Approach to Mapping Three-Decadal Inundation Dynamics in Dryland Wetlands Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Australian inland riparian wetlands located east of the Great Dividing Range exhibit unique, hydroecological characteristics. These flood-dependent aquatic systems located in water-limited regions are declining rapidly due to the competitive demand for water for human activities, as well as climate change and variability. However, there exist very few reliable data to characterize inundation change conditions and quantify the impacts of the loss and deterioration of wetlands. A long-term time record of wetland inundation maps can provide a crucial baseline to monitor, assess, and assist the management and conservation of wetland ecosystems. This study presents a random forest-based multi-index classification algorithm (RaFMIC) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to efficiently construct a temporally dense, three-decadal time record of inundation maps of the southeast Australian riparian inland wetlands. The method was tested over the Macquarie Marshes located in the semiarid region of NSW, Australia. The results showed a good accuracy when compared against high-spatial resolution imagery. The total inundated area was consistent with precipitation and streamflow patterns, and the temporal dynamics of vegetation showed good agreement with the inundation maps. The inundation time record was analysed to generate inundation probability maps, which were in a good agreement with frequently flooded areas simulated by a hydrodynamic model and the distribution of flood-dependent vegetation species. The long-term, time-dense inundation maps derived from the RaFMIC method can provide key information to assess the condition and health of wetland ecosystems and have the potential to improve wetland inventory with spatially explicit water regime information. RaFMIC can be adapted over other dryland wetlands, as an effective semiautomated method of mapping long-term inundation dynamics.

TI  - Application of the Vegetation Condition Index in the Diagnosis of Spatiotemporal Distribution of Agricultural Droughts: A Case Study Concerning the State of Espirito Santo, Southeastern Brazil
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We applied a robust framework for agricultural drought identification in the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil, by employing the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) based on data obtained through the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). By doing so, we analyzed the interrelationships between the VCI and anomalies in the Land Surface Temperature (LST), along with connections between the VCI and data considering water deficits in vulnerable areas. When it came to image processing, we focused on the use of analytics and GIS algorithms, while the Scott-Knott method elucidated the statistical analyses. Consequently, we identified drought areas followed by periods susceptible to their occurrence, indicating 2016 as the driest year. The North macroregion presented the lowest average values regarding VCI values in the most vulnerable periods, followed by the Central one. We also call attention to the highest LST averages observed in 2015 and 2016, as strong El Nino events marked the same timeframe periods. The methodological approach was efficient for the identification, analysis, and characterization of agricultural drought occurrences, enabling mitigation actions, as well as the management of the exploitation and protection of water resources. Moreover, further research should be conducted by incorporating other indices to enhance the understanding of agricultural drought and its effects on vegetation.

TI  - The Impact of Land Cover Change on Surface Water Temperature of Small Lakes in Eastern Ontario from 1985 to 2020
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Cover Change (LCC) has been shown to significantly impact the magnitude and trend of Land Surface Temperature (LST). However, the influence of LCC near waterbodies outside of an urban environment remain less understood. Waterbodies serve as local climate moderators where nearby LCC has the potential to decrease their cooling ability. Altered water surface temperatures can lead to altered species migration and distribution in aquatic species depending on a given species thermal boundary. In this study, using remotely sensed land cover and surface temperature data, we investigate the role that LCC around small lakes (500 m) plays on the surface water temperature change of nine small lakes in the Cataraqui Region Conservation Authority's watershed, located in Eastern Ontario, from 1985 to 2020. The Continuous Change Detection Classification (CCDC) algorithm was used alongside the Statistical Mono-Window (SMW) algorithm to calculate LCC and LST, respectively. Results indicated a strong positive relationship (R2 = 0.81) between overall LCC and lake surface water temperature (LSWT) trends, where LSWT trends in all inland small lakes investigated were found to be positive. The land cover class sparse vegetation had a strong positive correlation with water temperature, whereas dense vegetation displayed a strong negative correlation. This 35-year study contributes to the broader understanding of the impact that LCC has on the surface water temperature trends of inland lakes.

TI  - Modeling land use/cover change based on LCM model for a semi-arid area in the Latian Dam Watershed (Iran)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring and modeling of changes, based on a time-series LULC approach, is fundamental for planning and managing regional environments. The current study analyzed the LULC changes as well as estimated future scenarios for 2027 and 2037. To achieve accuracy in predicting LULC changes, the Land Change Modeler (LCM) was used for the Latian Dam Watershed, which is located approximately in the northeast of Tehran. The LULC time-series technique was specified utilizing four atmospherically endorsed surface reflectance Landsat images for the years t(1) (1987), t(2) (1998), t(3) (2007), and t(4) (2017) to authenticate the LULC predictions, so to obtain estimates for t(5) (2027) and t(6) (2037). The LULC classes identified in the watershed were water bodies, build-up areas, vegetated areas, and bare lands. The dynamic modeling of the LULC was based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), the neural network in LCM, which presented good results with an average accuracy rate equivalent to 84.89 percent. The results of the LULC change analysis showed an increase in the build-up area and a decrease in bare lands and vegetated areas within the duration of the study period. The results of this research could help in the formulation of public policies designed to conserve environmental resources in the Latian Dam Watershed and, consequently, minimize the risks of the fragmentation of orchards and vegetated areas. Also, careful regional planning ensuring the preservation of natural landscapes and open spaces is critical to creating a resilient regional environment and sustainable development.

TI  - Potential Assessment of PRISMA Hyperspectral Imagery for Remote Sensing Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral imagery plays a vital role in precision agriculture, forestry, environment, and geological applications. Over the past decade, extensive research has been carried out in the field of hyperspectral remote sensing. First introduced by the Italian Space Agency ASI in 2019, space-borne PRISMA hyperspectral imagery (PHSI) is taking the hyperspectral remote sensing research community into the next era due to its unprecedented spectral resolution of <= 12 nm. Given these abundant free data and high spatial resolution, it is crucial to provide remote sensing researchers with information about the critical attributes of PRISMA imagery, making it the most viable solution for various land and water applications. Hence, in the present study, a SWOT analysis was performed for PHSI using recent case studies to exploit the potential of PHSI for different remote sensing applications, such as snow, soil, water, natural gas, and vegetation. From this analysis, it was found that the higher reflectance spectra of PHSI, which have comprehensive coverage, have greater potential to extract vegetation biophysical parameters compared to other applications. Though the possible use of these data was demonstrated in a few other applications, such as the identification of methane gases and soil mineral mapping, the data may not be suitable for continuous monitoring due to their limited acquisition, long revisiting times, noisy bands, atmospheric interferences, and computationally heavy processing, particularly when executing machine learning models. The potential applications of PHSI include large-scale and efficient mapping, transferring technology, and fusion with other remote sensing data, whereas the lifetime of satellites and the need for interdisciplinary personnel pose challenges. Furthermore, some strategies to overcome the aforementioned weaknesses and threats are described in our conclusions.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Downward Longwave Radiation and Cloud Base Height Based on Infrared Multichannel Data of Himawari-8
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) is significant with regard to surface energy budgets and climate research. The uncertainty of cloud base height (CBH) retrieval by remote sensing induces the vast majority of SDLR estimation errors under cloudy conditions; reliable CBH observation and estimation are crucial for determining the cloud radiative effect. This study presents a CBH retrieval methodology built from 10 thermal spectral data from Himawari-8 (H-8) observations, utilizing the random forest (RF) algorithm to fully account for each band's contribution to CBH. The algorithm utilizes only infrared band data, making it possible to obtain CBH 24 h a day. Considering some factors that can significantly affect the CBH estimation, RF models are trained for different clouds using inputs from multiple H-8 channels together with geolocation information to target CBH derived from CloudSat/CALIPSO combined measurements. The validation results reveal that the new methodology performs well, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of only 1.17 km for all clouds. To evaluate the effect of CBH on SDLR estimation, an all-sky SDLR estimation algorithm based on previous CBH predictions is proposed. The new SDLR product not only has a resolution that is noticeably higher than that of benchmark products of the SDLR, such as the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the next-generation reanalysis (ERA5) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), but it also has greater accuracy, with an RMSE of 21.8 W m(-2) for hourly surface downward longwave irradiance (SDLI).

TI  - Environmental Variables in Predictive Soil Mapping: A Review
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - In the well-known conceptual model SCORPAN, a given soil property is considered as dependent on the following environmental factors: soil, climate, organisms, topography, time, and space. Predictive mapping of soils in digital soil mapping is based on similar ideas, but environmental factors may include not only factors of soil formation, but also, for example, remote sensing data. At present, predictive mapping has found wide application not only in soil science but also in ecology, agriculture, and geomorphology. This paper provides a review of environmental factors that are used in predictive mapping with a special attention to situations, when wide sets of environmental factors may be used and a part of them are not quantitative, such as vegetation types. The systems of quantitative variables for topography and climate description are most developed, so special attention is paid to them. Land surface description is performed using both local and non-local variables that need integration. In climate description, variables, which give estimates of dry or wet terrain features, such as moisture ratio or water deficit, are essential. They need evaluation of potential evapotranspiration that is not measured by weather stations, but can be calculated. The possibilities of accounting for these and other environmental factors, including non-quantitative ones, in quantitative statistical models of predictive mapping are described together with principles of their construction, verification, comparison, and choice of appropriate models. Examples of predictive soil mapping applications are given for various scales, and their specificity for different scales is outlined. Some aspects of remote sensing data usage are discussed.

TI  - Surface Subsidence Characteristics and Causes in Beijing (China) before and after COVID-19 by Sentinel-1A TS-InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface subsidence is a serious threat to human life, buildings and traffic in Beijing. Surface subsidence is closely related to human activities, and human activities in Beijing area showed a decreasing trend during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To study surface subsidence in Beijing before and after the COVID-19 outbreak and its causes, a total of 51 Sentinel-1A SAR images covering Beijing from January 2018 to April 2022 were selected to derive subsidence information by Time Series Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (TS-InSAR). The results of surface subsidence in Beijing demonstrate that Changping, Chaoyang, Tongzhou and Daxing Districts exhibited the most serious subsidence phenomenon before the COVID-19 outbreak. The four main subsidence areas form an anti-Beijing Bay that surrounds other important urban areas. The maximum subsidence rate reached -57.0 mm/year. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the main subsidence area was separated into three giant subsidence funnels and several small subsidence funnels. During this period, the maximum subsidence rate was reduced to -43.0 mm/year. Human activity decrease with the COVID-19 outbreak. This study effectively analysed the influence of natural factors on surface subsidence after excluding most of the human factors. The following conclusions are obtained from the analysis: (1) Groundwater level changes, Beijing's geological structure and infrastructure construction are the main reasons for surface subsidence in Beijing. (2) Seasonal changes in rainfall and temperature indirectly affect groundwater level changes, thereby affecting surface subsidence in the area. (3) The COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 reduced the payload of Beijing's transportation facilities. It also slowed down the progress of various infrastructure construction projects in Beijing. These scenarios affected the pressure on the soft land base in Beijing and reduced the surface subsidence trend to some extent.

TI  - A Quantitative Study of a Directional Heat Island in Hefei, China Based on Multi-Source Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) are essential for evaluating urban thermal environments. However, current quantitative studies of SUHIs ignore the thermal radiation directionality (TRD), which directly affects study precision; furthermore, they fail to assess the effects of TRD characteristics at different land-use intensities, on the quantitative studies of SUHIs. To bridge this research gap, this study eliminates the interference of atmospheric attenuation and daily temperature variation factors, in quantifying the TRD based on land surface temperature (LST), from MODIS data and station air temperature data for Hefei (China) from 2010-2020. The influence of TRD on SUHI intensity quantification was evaluated by comparing the TRD under different land-use intensities in Hefei. The results show that: (1) daytime and nighttime directionality can reach up to 4.7 K and 2.6 K, and occur in areas with the highest and medium urban land-use intensity, respectively. (2) There are two significant TRD hotspots for daytime urban surfaces, where the sensor zenith angle is approximately the same as the forenoon solar zenith angle, and where the sensor zenith angle is near its nadir in the afternoon. (3) The TRD can contribute up to 2.0 K to the results of assessing the SUHI intensity based on satellite data, which is approximately 31-44% of the total SUHI in Hefei.

TI  - An Analysis of the Dynamics of Areas Affected by Steppe Fires in Western Kazakhstan on the Basis of Earth Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regular landscape fires alter the species composition of the vegetation cover, activate erosion processes, destroy animals and their habitats, and act as a greenhouse gas emission source. Therefore, it is extremely important to get an understanding of fire regimes in various landscapes. Forest fires are examined in many studies; by contrast, grass fires in general and steppe fires in particular remain poorly studied. This paper examines the fire frequency dynamics in zonal natural landscapes in three regions of Western Kazakhstan over the 2001-2020 period on the basis of expert interpretation of Landsat satellite images; the verification was performed on the basis of MCD14ML active burning data and MCD64A1, FireCCI51, and GABAM burned area data. In total, 18 600 burned areas were identified, and their total size over the 2001-2020 period amounts to almost 60% of the study area. Most of the area affected by fires is represented by a relatively small number of very large-scale fires (over 25 000 ha each); while the largest burned areas exceed 500 000 ha. Two-thirds of all burned areas were affected by fires two or more times; 43% of them, three or more times. After 2010, the frequency of fire occurrence in the study area decreased significantly; primarily, due to the increase in livestock numbers and secondarily, due to the deterioration of hydrothermal conditions. In arid conditions, the weather affects the fire regime not as a factor contributing to the spread of fire, but as a factor affecting the accumulation of sufficient amounts of combustible materials. Therefore, a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperatures and pasture loads reduce the number of fires and burned areas since the plant mortmass reserves decline.

TI  - High-Resolution Semantic Segmentation of Woodland Fires Using Residual Attention UNet and Time Series of Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern Africa experiences a great number of wildfires, but the dependence on low-resolution products to detect and quantify fires means both that there is a time lag and that many small fire events are never identified. This is particularly relevant in miombo woodlands, where fires are frequent and predominantly small. We developed a cutting-edge deep-learning-based approach that uses freely available Sentinel-2 data for near-real-time, high-resolution fire detection in Mozambique. The importance of Sentinel-2 main bands and their derivatives was evaluated using TreeNet, and the top five variables were selected to create three training datasets. We designed a UNet architecture, including contraction and expansion paths and a bridge between them with several layers and functions. We then added attention gate units (AUNet) and residual blocks and attention gate units (RAUNet) to the UNet architecture. We trained the three models with the three datasets. The efficiency of all three models was high (intersection over union (IoU) > 0.85) and increased with more variables. This is the first time an RAUNet architecture has been used to detect fire events, and it performed better than the UNet and AUNet models-especially for detecting small fires. The RAUNet model with five variables had IoU = 0.9238 and overall accuracy = 0.985. We suggest that others test the RAUNet model with large datasets from different regions and other satellites so that it may be applied more broadly to improve the detection of wildfires.

TI  - Garlic Field Classification Using Machine Learning and Statistic Approaches
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The level of garlic consumption in Indonesia increases as the population grows. This is because most of the ingredients of Indonesian food recipes contain garlic. However, local garlic production is not sufficient to fulfil the demand. Therefore, the Indonesian government imported garlic from other countries to fulfil the demand. To reduce the import capacity of garlic, the government made a regulation to increase the potential area for garlic cultivation in several priority locations in Indonesia, one of which is Sembalun District, East Lombok. To support government regulation, this study presents an application of machine learning and a statistic approach for the garlic field mapping method in Sembalun, Indonesia. This study comprises several steps including the Sentinel-1A images data acquisition, image preprocessing, machine learning and statistic model training, and model evaluation. k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) methods are selected in this study. The performance of k-NN and MLC are compared to other garlic field classification results developed in previous studies using pixel-based and image-based classifications. The comparison results show that the k-NN classification is slightly better than the SVM classification and also that it outperformed the MLC method. In addition, MLC works faster than k-NN in learning the dataset and testing the models. The classification results can be used to estimate garlic production in the study area. The study concludes that the proposed methods are better than other classification models and the statistic approach. The future study will improve dataset quality to increase the model's accuracy.

TI  - Assessment of the Dynamics of Land Cover at the Local Level to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality (for Desertified Lands of the Dry-Steppe Zavolzh'e)
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The land structure in dry-steppe Zavolzh'e is complicated and includes irrigated and rain-fed croplands and pastures in natural steppe areas and on abandoned plow lands, which results in significantly incorrect assessment of the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) based on standard approaches elaborated to analyze the land status at the global and regional levels. The problem of interpreting the results of the assessment of the dynamics of land cover as one of the main global indicators of LDN proposed by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification is analyzed in this work. A method based on the analysis of seasonal series of Landsat satellite images, using Kohonen self-organizing neural networks implemented in the Scanex Image Processor software package was developed and applied for the study area. It is shown that this approach makes significantly greater the possibilities of assessing the LDN as a result of the detailed analysis and delineation of a larger number of cartographic areas and when using the transition assessment matrix based on the extended classification of the land cover. The application of the Change Detection module of the SAGA GIS software package enables us not only to identify the nature of restoration and degradation changes, but also to compare the trends for land categories. The combination of the proposed approaches in the form of a functional algorithm may be recommended for monitoring and evaluation of the achieving LDN at the local level.

TI  - Plant Phenology of High-Elevation Meadows: Assessing Spectral Responses of Grazed Meadows
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are biologically diverse and productive ecosystems but constitute a small fraction of total land area in semiarid regions. Efforts to link remotely sensed data from satellite-based platforms to measurements of vegetation structure and function at smaller spatial scales have increasingly received attention, due to the need to manage diverse landscapes at scales relevant to management. In the semiarid western United States, grazing is a dominant land use and meadows can receive a high degree of grazing pressure. In this study we examined satellite-based and near-surface imagery to determine if they were useful in assessing grazed systems with different grazing management. We compared meadows that were chronically grazed by feral horses in conjunction with periodic cattle grazing to a meadow managed and grazed by cattle only. We examined the agreement between near-surface digital cameras (PhenoCams) and satellite-based indices of greenness and production for meadows in the Central Great Basin, United States. We also verified them with field-collected data on percent foliar cover by dominant functional groups. There was strong agreement between the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index and PhenoCam Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) (Pearson's r >= 0.61). Gross primary production modeled using Landsat satellite imagery and integrated over the growing season had a strong linear relationship with GCC integrated over the growing season (R-2 = 0.89). Furthermore, despite differences in spatial and temporal resolution, integrated metrics from both platforms were able to discern differences in grazing pressure. Meadows with chronic feral horse grazing plus 3 mo of livestock grazing had reduced integrated gross primary production and GCC in comparison with a meadow that had short-term grazing (for 2 mo) by livestock only. The ability to detect differences in grazed systems from PhenoCams and satellite platforms provides important tools for quantifying the effects of grazing in groundwater-dependent ecosystems.

TI  - A Multi-Scale Pseudo-Siamese Network with an Attention Mechanism for Classification of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the remote sensing classification task, the ability of a single data source to identify the ground objects remains limited due to the lack of feature diversity. As the typical remote sensing data sources, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data can provide complementary spectral features and elevation information, respectively. To enhance classification ability, a multi-scale Pseudo-Siamese Network with attention mechanism (MA-PSNet) is proposed by fusing HSI and LiDAR data. In the network, two sub-branch networks are designed for extracting the features from HSI and LiDAR, respectively, and the connection is further established between these two branches. Specifically, a multi-scale feature learning module is incorporated, enabling the image features to be fully extracted at different scales. Similarly, a convolutional attention module is also embedded to highlight the saliency information of the objects, which makes the network training can be more targeted, thereby eventually improving the model performance for classification. The evaluation experiments of the proposed model are carried out on an urban dataset from Houston, USA, and a rural dataset from Trento, Italy. The overall accuracy (OA) of the model can reach 95.03% on the Houston data and 99.16% on the Trento data. The experimental results fully demonstrate that the proposed model has competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Integration of multi-sensor MTInSAR and ground-based geomatic data for the analysis of non-linear displacements affecting the urban area of Chieuti, Italy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow instability phenomena can turn into rapid events, showing sudden accelerations and potentially developing in a threat for structures and people. In such scenarios, an in-depth understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of the ground surface displacement field becomes essential for preventing potential catastrophes. In this work, Multi-Temporal Interferometry SAR (MTInSAR) technique based on COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions and ground measurements have been used to study an ongoing instability occurrence, affecting the urban area of Chieuti, a town located in the Southern Italy. Archives of C and X-band SAR data and geomatic monitoring observations spanning seven, five and one year, respectively, have been analyzed exploiting the complementary characteristics of these datasets. This enabled the accurate spatial-temporal characterization of the ground displacement field in the study area, the identification of sectors evidencing instability problems and a comprehensive reliability assessment of the detected displacements trends, characterized by strong nonlinearities. Moreover, the multi-geometry DInSAR analysis allowed to evaluate the horizontal and vertical components of the detected motion, confirming the nature of the instability process, related to a deep landslide mechanism affecting the western slope of the town.

TI  - Automatization and evaluation of a remote sensing-based indicator for wetland health assessment in East Africa on national and local scales
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To avoid wetland degradation and promote sustainable wetlands use, decision-makers and managing institutions need quantified and spatially explicit information on wetland ecosystem condition for policy development and wetland management. Remote sensing holds a significant potential for wetland mapping, inventorying, and monitoring. The Wetland Use Intensity (WUI) indicator, which is not specific to a particular crop and which requires little ancillary data, is based on the Mean Absolute Spectral Dynamics (MASD), which is a cumulative measure of reflectance change across a time series of optical satellite images. It is sensitive to the compound effects of land cover changes caused by different agricultural practices, flooding or burning. The more frequent and intrusive management practices are on the land cover, the stronger the WUI signal. WUI thus serves as a surrogate indicator to measure pressure on wetland ecosystems.We developed a new and automated approach for WUI calculation that is implemented in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing environment. Its automatic calculation, use of regular Sentinel-2 derived time series, and automatic cloud and cloud shadow masking renders WUI applicable for wetland management and produces high quality results with minimal user requirements, even under cloudy conditions. For the first time, we quantitatively tested the capacity of WUI to contribute to wetland health assessment in Rwanda on the national and local scale. On the national scale, we analyzed the discriminative power of WUI between different wetland management categories. On the local scale, we evaluated the possible contribution of WUI to a wetland ecosystem health scoring system. The results suggest that the adapted WUI indicator is informative, does not overlap with existing indicators, and is applicable for wetland management. The possibility to measure use intensity reliably and consistently over time with satellite data is useful to stakeholders in wetland management and wetland health monitoring, and can complement established field-based wetland health assessment frameworks.

TI  - Seasonality of phytoplankton biomass and composition on the Cape Canaveral shelf of Florida: Role of shifts in climate and coastal watershed influences
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass and composition in the inner continental shelf off Cape Canaveral on the east coast of Florida were examined for a 6-year period (2013-2019). In situ water samples were collected and analyzed for chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biomass and composition, along with water quality parameters. Regional satellite data on chlorophyll a, and temperature was also obtained from NASA. Average chlorophyll a values over the study period ranged from 0.63 +/- 0.03 mu g L-1 in the summer to 2.55 +/- 0.10 mu g L-1 in the fall. Phytoplankton community composition also showed seasonal differences, with persistent dominance by picoplanktonic cyanobacteria in the summer, but mixed dominance by picocyanobacteria and dinoflagellates in the fall. Seasonal differences were attributed to a shift in predominant seasonal wind directions, which drive water along the coast from the north in the fall and winter, but from the south in the spring and summer, including eddies and upwelling from the Gulf Stream. Water masses moving along the Florida coast from the north are influenced by nutrient and phytoplankton-enriched inputs from estuaries along the north coast of Florida, explaining the higher phytoplankton biomass levels on the Cape Canaveral shelf in the fall and winter. Seasonal patterns observed in this study demonstrate the importance of allochthonous influences on phytoplankton biomass and composition, and highlight the potential sensitivity of phytoplankton communities to continuing cultural eutrophication and future climate changes, including the frequency and intensity of tropical storms, and alterations in discharges from land.

TI  - Deep Learning Method Based on Spectral Characteristic Rein-Forcement for the Extraction of Winter Wheat Planting Area in Complex Agricultural Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world. Remote sensing technology can be used to obtain the spatial distribution and planting area of winter wheat in a timely and accurate manner, which is of great significance for agricultural management. Influenced by the growth conditions of winter wheat, the planting structures of the northern and southern regions differ significantly. Therefore, in this study, the spectral and phenological characteristics of winter wheat were analyzed in detail, and four red-edge vegetation indices (NDVI, NDRE, SRre, and CIred-edge) were included after band analysis to enhance the ability of the characteristics to extract winter wheat. These indices were combined with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to achieve intelligent extraction of the winter wheat planting area in a countable number of complex agricultural landscapes. Using this method, GF-6 WFV and Sentinel-2A remote sensing data were used to obtain full coverage of the region to evaluate the geographical environment differences. This spectral characteristic enhancement method combined with a CNN could extract the winter wheat data well for both data sources, with average overall accuracies of 94.01 and 93.03%, respectively. This study proposes a method for fast and accurate extraction of winter wheat in complex agricultural landscapes that can provide decision support for national and local intelligent agricultural construction. Thus, our study has important application value and practical significance.

TI  - Impact of SAR Azimuth Ambiguities on Doppler Velocity Estimation Performance: Modeling and Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Doppler Centroid Analysis (DCA) technique is one of the major techniques that do permit a direct retrieval of ocean surface velocity from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. However, azimuth ambiguities in the SAR images severely restrict the capability of DCA technique to obtain accurate ocean surface Doppler velocities. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how the azimuth ambiguities impact the Doppler velocity estimation performance and to evaluate how significant the impact is. In this paper, a model for ocean surface Doppler velocity estimation affected by azimuth ambiguities is developed resorting to jointly circular Gaussian processes, and its statistic is derived. The impact of azimuth ambiguities on Doppler velocity estimation performance in terms of Doppler centroid estimation bias and the standard deviation of Doppler centroid estimates is analyzed. The theoretical results are validated through simulation and Doppler velocities retrieved from Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR Doppler centroid estimates affected by azimuth ambiguities. This study will help researchers better understand the impact of azimuth ambiguities on Doppler velocity estimation, and will provide a theoretical reference for subsequent research on how to reduce the impact of azimuth ambiguities more effectively.

TI  - Up-Scaling Fuel Hazard Metrics Derived from Terrestrial Laser Scanning Using a Machine Learning Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterisation of fuel distribution across heterogeneous landscapes is important for wildfire mitigation, validating fuel models, and evaluating fuel treatment outcomes. However, efficient fuel mapping at a landscape scale is challenging. Fuel hazard metrics were obtained using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and the current operational approach (visual fuel assessment) for seven sites across south-eastern Australia. These point-based metrics were then up-scaled to a continuous fuel map, an area relevant to fire management using random forest modelling, with predictor variables derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), Sentinel 2A images, and climate and soil data. The model trained and validated with TLS observations (R-2 = 0.51 for near-surface fuel cover and 0.31 for elevated fuel cover) was found to have higher predictive power than the model trained with visual fuel assessments (R-2 = -0.1 for the cover of both fuel layers). Models for height derived from TLS observations exhibited low-to-moderate performance for the near-surface (R-2 = 0.23) and canopy layers (R-2 = 0.25). The results from this study provide practical guidance for the selection of training data sources and can be utilised by fire managers to accurately generate fuel maps across an area relevant to operational fire management decisions.

TI  - Investigation of land use changes using the landscape ecology approach in Maragheh City, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban development is an ongoing economic and social phenomenon that significantly impacts ecological systems. This study aims to investigate the land use changes and physical development patterns of Maragheh City and its effects on the urban landscape as a medium-sized city in the northwest of Iran. To reach this goal, land use maps for 1986, 1996, 2006, 2016, and 2020 were first processed from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images. ENVI 5.3 and ArcMap software were used to analyze land use alteration patterns, and FRAGSTATS software was used for land use metrics. The results indicate that constructed lands from 1986 to 2020 had the most changes and increased by 2157 ha, while green areas decreased by about 443 ha. This trend indicates the lack of land use integration and infill growth which created urban sprawl. Therefore, the growth pattern of Maragheh City in recent decades has followed scattered and unbalanced horizontal growth. There are significant ecological challenges in this area due to this trend, including the destruction of farms and fertile agricultural land and the replacement of it with scattered and incoherent urban and rural settlements.

M3  - Article
AB  - Learning Objectives:After reading this article and viewing the videos, the participant should be able to: 1. Discuss margins for in situ and invasive disease and describe reconstructive options for wide excision defects, including the keystone flap. 2. Describe a digit-sparing alternative for subungual melanoma. 3. Calculate personalized risk estimates for sentinel node biopsy using predictive nomograms. 4. Describe the indications for lymphadenectomy and describe a technique intended to reduce the risk of lymphedema following lymphadenectomy. 5. Offer options for in-transit melanoma management. Melanoma management continues to evolve, and plastic surgeons need to stay at the forefront of advances and controversies. Appropriate margins for in situ and invasive disease require consideration of the trials on which they are based. A workhorse reconstruction option for wide excision defects, particularly in extremities, is the keystone flap. There are alternative surgical approaches to subungual tumors besides amputation. It is now possible to personalize a risk estimate for sentinel node positivity beyond what is available for groups of patients with a given stage of disease. Sentinel node biopsy can be made more accurate and less morbid with novel adjuncts. Positive sentinel node biopsies are now rarely managed with completion lymphadenectomy. Should a patient require lymphadenectomy, immediate lymphatic reconstruction may mitigate the lymphedema risk. Finally, there are minimally invasive modalities for effective control of in-transit recurrences.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of a Deep Learning Based System to Predict District-Level Maize Yields in Tanzania
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction of crop yields is very helpful in ensuring food security, planning harvest management (storage, transport, and labor), and performing market planning. However, in Tanzania, where a majority of the population depends on crop farming as a primary economic activity, the digital tools for predicting crop yields are not yet available, especially at the grass-roots level. In this study, we developed and evaluated Maize Yield Prediction System (MYPS) that uses a short message service (SMS) and the Web to allow rural farmers (via SMS on mobile phones) and government officials (via Web browsers) to predict district-level end-of-season maize yields in Tanzania. The system uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning models to forecast district-level season-end maize yields from remote sensing data (NDVI on the Terra MODIS satellite) and climate data [maximum temperature, minimum temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation (rainfall)]. The key findings reveal that our unimodal and bimodal deep learning models are very effective in predicting crop yields, achieving mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) scores of 3.656% and 6.648%, respectively, on test (unseen) data. This system will help rural farmers and the government in Tanzania make critical decisions to prevent hunger and plan better harvesting and marketing of crops.

TI  - Spectral reflectance analysis of abandoned agricultural lands in the Central Russian forest-steppe using Sentinel-2 satellite data br
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the spectral response of post-agrogenic landscapes in the forest-steppe zone based on Sentinel-2 data. The study was carried out on the territory of the Central Chernozem region. The type of forest that forms on abandoned agricultural land has a statistically significant effect on the spectral response in most Sentinel-2 bands. The reflectance of abandoned lands with deciduous and coniferous species is statistically significantly different in most bands. The reflec-tance of abandoned lands with mixed forests does not differ statistically significantly from other types of post-agrogenic landscapes. The reflectance of abandoned lands is inversely related to their forest cover in most Sentinel-2 bands. The strongest correlation with forest cover is typical for red (Band 4) and SWIR (Band 11, 12) ranges for all post-agrogenic landscape types. In the same bands, there are statistically significant differences between most of forest cover gradations of post-agrogenic landscapes. The established patterns make it possible to use the reflectance in the red (Band 4) and SWIR MSI bands (11, 12) to assess the forest cover of post-agrogenic land-scapes.

TI  - Using Landsat Satellite Imagery for Assessment and Monitoring of Long-term Forest Cover Changes in Dak Nong Province, Vietnam
T2  - GEOGRAPHICA PANNONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are essential in regulating climate and protecting land resources from natural disasters. In Vi-etnam's Dak Nong province, forest cover has changed significantly between 1989 and 2021. This study applies remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) approaches to detect negative chang-es in forest cover as well as other land cover types. The maximum likelihood classification tool was used to classify Landsat images for the years 1989, 2001, 2011, and 2021, with post-classification ac-curacy evaluated through kappa coefficient statistics. The potential to based classification on Normal-ized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to detect changes in forest cover compared with supervised classification was also evaluated. The land use and land cov-er change detection results show that the forest area decreased from 77.54% of the study area in 1989 to 33.97% in 2021, with a total forest loss of 2,953.48 km2 and only 117.12 km2 of newly planted forest during this period. Broadly, forest cover in the area has been severely reduced, often due to indiscrimi-nate logging and expansion of agricultural land on the forest edge.

TI  - Integrating SAR Sentinel-1A and DSSAT CROPGRO Simulation Model for Peanut Yield Gap Analysis
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield data are critical for managing agricultural sustainability and assessing national food security. This study aims at increasing peanut productivity from its current levels by analyzing the yield gap (difference) of potential production between theoretical yield and actual farmers' yields. The spatial yield gap of peanut for the Tiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu is examined in this investigation by integrating the products of microwave remote sensing (SAR Sentinel-1A) with the DSSAT CROPGRO Peanut simulation model. The CROPGRO (crop growth) Peanut model was calibrated and validated by conducting a field experiment at Oilseeds Research Station, Tindivanam during Rabi (spring) 2019 for predominant cultivars, i.e., TMV 7, TMV 13, VRI 2 and G 7. Actual attainable yield was recorded by organizing crop cutting experiments (CCEs) with the help of the Department of Agriculture Economics and Statistics in the respective monitoring villages. The regression analysis between the maximum recorded DSSAT leaf area index (LAI) at the peak flowering stage of peanut and the yield recorded by CCEs for the spatial yield estimation of peanut in the Tiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu during Rabi 2021 was carried out using ArcGIS 10.6 software. The DSSAT CROPGRO simulated potential yield ranged from 3194 to 4843 kg/ha, whereas actual yield ranged from 1228 to 3106 kg/ha, with a considerable disparity between the actual and potential yield levels (from 1217 to 2346 kg/ha) of the monitored locations. The minimum, maximum and average yield gaps in peanut for Tiruvannamalai district were assessed as 1890, 2324 and 2134 kg/ha, respectively. In order to reduce the production difference of peanut cultivation, farmers should focus more on management issues such as time of sowing, irrigation or water management, quantity and sources of nutrients, cultivar selection and availability of quality seeds tailored to each region.

TI  - Statistical analysis of shoreline change reveals erosion and baseline are increasing off the northern Tamil Nadu Coasts of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many tourists have been recently attracted towards the coasts around the world, especially to the large urban centres and economically significant areas. In the last four decades, there is a significant increase in the key coastal developments and tourist's attractions like major ports, minor ports, fishing harbours, desalination plants, shore protection structures, and many more along the southeast coasts of India, in particular, northern Tami Nadu coastal stretches. The shoreline change study of these regions were carried out using the geospatial technologies (satellite remote sensing and geographical information system) to examine potential modifications occurred during the last 32 years between March 1990 and May 2022. This study used Landsat satellite images of spatial resolution 30 m to track the shoreline changes which was extracted using the Digital Image Processing software and techniques. In addition, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) developed Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) v5.2 software, an add-on tool to ArcGIS used for the statistical analysis to compute the shoreline rate of change. The linear regression rate (LRR) and end point rate (EPR) statistics were used to identify the eroding, accreting, and stable shoreline between Kattupalli coast and Kalpakkam coast of the northern Tamil Nadu coasts. This shoreline study of 106 km was carried out by dividing it into six zones (zone 1 to zone 6), and the DSAS analysis conveys that the shoreline of zone 1 (Kattupalli) and zone 2 (Ennore) shows erosion compared to other four zones. In locations where the coast is vulnerable, national mitigation measures must be implemented.

TI  - Early Disturbance of Lymphatic Transport as a Risk Factor for the Development of Breast-Cancer-Related Lymphedema
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Lymphedema is a chronic debilitating condition that requires continuous attention. ICG fluoroscopy shows a detailed superficial lymphatic architecture, can provide additional information regarding the functionality of lymphatic transport and can show early abnormalities of the lymphatic system. The aim of this study is to investigate whether his early disturbance of lymphatic transport visualized by lymphofluoroscopy is a risk factor for the development of breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). No such research has been conducted to date. All patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery with unilateral axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel node biopsy were considered. Patients were assessed at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months postoperatively. During each visit, a clinical assessment was performed to determine the presence of clinical lymphedema (>= 5% increase in relative arm volume difference compared to the baseline value). Variables related to (1) the disturbance of lymphatic transport, (2) the demographics and general health of the patient and (3) the breast cancer and treatment of the patient were also investigated. Early disturbance of lymphatic transport visualized by lymphofluoroscopy was identified as a risk factor for the development of clinical BCRL. Age and axillary lymph node dissection were withheld as independent risk factors. A surveillance program of these high-risk patients with lymphofluoroscopy can be useful to identify lymphedema in a subclinical stage and prevent development to more advanced stages. Introduction: Breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a frequently occurring and debilitating condition. When lymphedema is diagnosed late, treatment can be expected to be less effective. Lymphofluoroscopy can provide details about the superficial lymphatic architecture and can detect an early disturbance of lymphatic transport (i.e., dermal backflow) before the lymphedema is clinically visible. The main objective of this study is to investigate whether this early disturbance of lymphatic transport visualized by lymphofluoroscopy is a risk factor for the development of BCRL. Methodology: All patients scheduled for unilateral breast cancer surgery with axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel node biopsy were considered. Patients were assessed at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months postoperatively. During each visit, a clinical assessment was performed to determine the volume difference between both arms and hands (through circumference measurements and water displacement). Clinical BCRL was defined as a >= 5% increase in relative arm volume difference compared to the baseline value. Variables related to (1) the disturbance of lymphatic transport (through lymphofluoroscopy), (2) the demographics and general health of the patient and (3) the breast cancer and treatment of the patient were collected. Results: We included data of 118 patients in the present study. Thirty-eight patients (39.8%) developed BCRL. Early disturbance of lymphatic transport was identified as a risk factor for the development of clinical BCRL (HR 2.808). Breast-cancer- and treatment-related variables such as axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (HR 15.127), tumor stage (HR 1.745), mastectomy (HR 0.186), number of positive lymph nodes (HR 1.121), number of removed lymph nodes (HR 1.055), radiotherapy of the axilla (HR 2.715), adjuvant taxanes (HR 3.220) and postsurgical complications (HR 2.590) were identified as significant risk factors for the development of BCRL.In the multivariate analysis, age and ALND were withheld as independent risk factors for the development of BCRL. Conclusion: Lymphofluoroscopy can identify an early disturbance of lymphatic transport after breast cancer treatment. Patients with an early disturbance of lymphatic transport are considered to be a high-risk group for the development of BCRL. This study also confirms that age and ALND are predictors for the development of BCRL. Therefore, a surveillance program of these patients with lymphofluoroscopy could be useful to identify lymphedema in subclinical stages.

TI  - Two Air Quality Regimes in Total Column NO<sub>2</sub> Over the Gulf of Mexico in May 2019: Shipboard and Satellite Views
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Satellite Coastal and Oceanic Atmospheric Pollution Experiment (SCOAPE) cruise in the Gulf of Mexico was conducted in May 2019 by NASA and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to determine the feasibility of using satellite data to measure air quality in a region of concentrated oil and natural gas (ONG) operations. SCOAPE addressed both technological and scientific issues related to measuring NO2 columns over the outer continental shelf. Featured were nitrogen dioxide (NO2) instruments (Pandora, Teledyne API analyzer) at Cocodrie, LA (29.26 degrees, -90.66 degrees), and on the Research Vessel Point Sur operating off the Louisiana coast with measurements of ozone, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The findings: (a) all NO2 observations revealed two atmospheric regimes over the Gulf, the first influenced by tropical air in 10-14 May, the second influenced by flow from urban areas on 15-17 May; (b) comparisons of OMI v4 and TROPOMI v1.3 TC (total column) NO2 data with shipboard Pandora NO2 column observations averaged 13% agreement with the largest difference during 15-17 May (similar to 20%). At Cocodrie, the satellite-Pandora agreement was similar to 5%. (c) Three new-model Pandora instruments displayed a TC NO2 precision of 0.01 Dobson Units (similar to 5%); (d) regions of smaller, older natural gas operations showed high methane readings from leakage; elevated VOCs were also detected. Neither satellite nor spectrometer captured the magnitude of ambient NO2 variability near ONG platforms. Given an absence of regular air quality monitoring over the Gulf of Mexico, SCOAPE data constitute a baseline against which future observations can be compared.Plain Language Summary The Satellite Coastal and Oceanic Atmospheric Pollution Experiment (SCOAPE) cruise in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) conducted on the Research Vessel Point Sur in May 2019 investigated the feasibility of using satellite data to measure air quality in a region of concentrated oil and natural gas (ONG) operations. SCOAPE addressed both technological and scientific issues related to measuring NO2 columns in a prototypical coastal environment. The results are as follows. First, measurements from SCOAPE demonstrated that satellite NO2 data can be used to monitor ONG activity over the GOM. Second, during SCOAPE both OMI and TROPOMI TC (total column) NO2 amounts were higher over land and sometimes the near-shore ONG-rich Gulf, than over deepwater regions farther offshore. This was confirmed by Pandora spectrometer "ground truth" TC NO2 data measured throughout SCOAPE on shore and on ship. Third, SCOAPE established the reliability and precision of a new generation of Pandora spectrometers. Fourth, comparisons of satellite and Pandora TC NO2 data in SCOAPE confirm previous land-water interface studies that point to limitations in satellite NO2 in coastal regions. Finally, neither satellite nor spectrometer captures the magnitude of ambient ("nose-level") NO2 variability in a region dotted with hundreds of ONG platforms.

TI  - The Impact of Changes in Anthropogenic Activity Caused by COVID-19 Lockdown on Reducing Nitrogen Dioxide Levels in Thailand Using Nighttime Light Intensity
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China and has since become a pandemic. Thailand's first lockdown started in the middle of March 2020, restricting anthropogenic activities and inter-provincial traffic. There are few studies on the association between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels and human activity, primarily because of the difficulty in identifying the changes in anthropogenic activities at a high geographical resolution. Here, we have highlighted satellite-based nighttime light (NTL) as an indicator of anthropogenic activities and investigated the relationship between NTL and reductions in NO2 levels during Thailand's first lockdown in 2020. We applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) to analyze the regional relationship between NTL and changes in NO2 levels during the first lockdown. Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite observation indicated that the NO2 levels decreased by 10.36% compared with those of the same period in 2019. The level of NTL decreased in most urban and built-up (31.66%) categories. According to GWR results, NTL and NO2 levels represent a positive local correlation around the country's central, western, and northern parts and negative correlations in the peripheral regions. These findings imply that NTL observations can be used to monitor changes in NO2 levels caused by urban anthropogenic activities.

TI  - The Ground-Level Particulate Matter Concentration Estimation Based on the New Generation of FengYun Geostationary Meteorological Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The new-generation FengYun geostationary meteorological satellite has a high spatial and temporal resolution, which is advantageous in environmental assessments and air pollution monitoring. This study researched the ground-level particulate matter concentration estimation, based on satellite-observed radiations. The radiation of ground-level particulate matter is separate from the apparent radiation observed by satellites. The positive correlation between PM2.5 and PM10 is also considered to improve the accuracy of inversion results and the interpretability of the estimation model. Then, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were estimated synchronously every 5 min in mainland China based on FY-4A satellite directly observed radiations. The validation results showed that the improved model estimated results were close to the ground site measured results, with a high determination coefficient (R-2) (0.89 for PM2.5, and 0.90 for PM10), and a small Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (4.69 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5 concentrations, and 13.77 mu g/m(3) for PM10 concentrations). The estimation model presented a good performance in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations during typical haze and dust storm cases, indicating that it is applicable in different weather conditions and regions.

TI  - Assessment of development, parasitism, and predation of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in sassafras (Lauraceae) in southeastern US agroecosystems
T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is a polyphagous pest that disperses from non-crop host plants into crops in search of food. Sassafras trees (Sassafras albidum (Nutt.) Nees; Lauraceae) are found commonly in woodland habitats in the southeastern US and may therefore be a potential host. The main objective of this 2-yr study was to determine if sassafras serves as a host plant for this pest in woodland habitats adjacent to crops in Prattville, Alabama, and Byron, Georgia, USA. Each yr pheromone-baited traps were deployed in the canopy of sassafras trees to capture H. halys. We also evaluated parasitism and predation of H. halys sentinel egg masses by native parasitoids and predators in sassafras. Halyomorpha halys adult males and females as well as second through fifth instars were captured in traps and observed in sassafras trees over the season at both locations each yr of the study. Trissolcus euschistiAshmead (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) (67.7%) and Anastatus reduvii (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae) (18.3%) were the primary parasitoid species that emerged from H. halys sentinel egg masses. Stylet sucking (62.3%) and chewing (32.0%) were the primary types of predation on H. halys eggs. We conclude that sassafras is a reproductive host plant for H. halys, and native natural enemies prey on and parasitize H. halys egg masses in this host plant.

TI  - Predation and parasitism of naturally occurring and sentinel stink bug egg masses of Halyomorpha halys (Stal) and Nezara viridula (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in various southeastern habitats
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Stink bugs, including Halyomorpha halys (Stal) and Nezara viridula (L.), are agricultural pests that feed on fruit in a variety of crops. Monitoring predation and parasitism of stink bug egg masses furthers our understanding of potential biological control tactics. However, best practices for laboratory and field assessments of parasitism and predation of egg masses require further attention. We carried out a series of laboratory and field experiments to test whether parasitism and predation for three types of sentinel H. halys egg masses, fresh, frozen, and refrigerated, varied in agricultural commodities. In addition, we asked if predation and parasitism differed between sentinel and naturally occurring H. halys and N. viridula egg masses in soybean. In the laboratory, more H. halys eggs were parasitized by Trissolcus euschisti (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) if they were frozen or refrigerated compared to fresh eggs. Similarly, in the field, parasitism was higher for frozen egg masses than fresh. In 2018 and 2019, H. halys natural egg masses had higher parasitism and lower predation compared to sentinel egg masses in soybean. In a paired field test during 2020 and 2021, there was no difference in parasitism between H. halys natural and sentinel eggs, but much higher incidence of parasitism was detected in natural N. viridula egg masses than sentinel eggs. Collecting natural egg masses is the best methodology for field assessment of parasitism of stink bug egg masses; however, if natural egg masses are not easily available, deploying refrigerated sentinel egg masses is a good alternative.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Neo-Adjuvant Chemotherapy: Clinical Experience with Node-Negative and Node-Positive Disease Prior to Systemic Therapy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Axillary status is crucial for determining the correct local and systemic treatment. The possibility of de-escalating axillary surgery in patients with breast cancer undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial. This is especially true for clinically node-positive (cN+) patients, for whom axillary lymph node dissection still represents the gold standard, in contrast to clinically node-negative (cN0) patients, for whom sentinel lymph node biopsy has become more widely accepted. Several studies have recently shown that a minimally invasive surgical approach of the axilla is safe in cN+ patients who become cN0 after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, raising new questions about the potential benefit of this strategy. This retrospective study is aimed at assessing the reliability of this approach by comparing the characteristics and oncological outcomes (e.g., overall survival) of cN0 and cN+ patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and axillary surgery type. Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has emerged as the standard procedure to replace axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). SLNB is accepted in clinically node-negative (cN0) patients; however, its role in clinically node-positive (cN+) patients is debatable. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of BC patients undergoing NAC and SLNB. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical significance of SLNB in the setting of NAC. This was accomplished by comparing the characteristics and oncological outcomes between cN0 and cN+ patients prior to NAC and type of axillary surgery. Results: A total of 291 patients were included in the analysis: 131 were cN0 and 160 were cN+ who became ycN0 after NAC. At a median follow-up of 43 months, axillary recurrence occurred in three cN0 (2.3%) and two cN+ (1.3%) patients. However, there were no statistically significant differences in oncological outcomes (disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival, overall survival, and breast-cancer-specific survival) between cN0 and cN+ patients nor between patients treated with SLNB only or ALND. Conclusions: SLNB in the setting of NAC is an acceptable procedure with a general good prognosis and low axillary failure rates for both cN0 and cN+ patients.

TI  - Hazard Potential in Southern Pakistan: A Study on the Subsidence and Neotectonics of Karachi and Surrounding Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal communities in deltaic regions worldwide are subject to subsidence through a combination of natural and anthropogenic processes. The city of Karachi in southern Pakistan is situated along the diffuse western boundary of the tectonically active Indian Plate, making it more susceptible to natural subsidence processes from plate motion-related deformational events such as earthquakes and faulting. Karachi has a dense population of over 16 million people, and determining the rate of subsidence and extent of neotectonic activity is crucial for mitigating seismic hazards. Excessive abstraction of groundwater and extensive groundwater use in irrigation are some of the anthropogenic contributions to subsidence in the area. A combination of the lack of historical data and few previous studies of the area make it difficult to determine the rate and extent of deformation in this region. We present an analysis of subsidence and neotectonic activity in Karachi and its surrounding areas using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) timeseries techniques. The InSAR results for satellite LOS velocity change in both ascending and descending Sentinel-1 tracks indicate subsidence in key residential and industrial areas. Further decomposition into two dimensions (east-west and vertical) quantifies subsidence in these areas up to 1.7 cm per year. Furthermore, InSAR data suggest the presence of an active north-east dipping listric normal fault in North Karachi that is confirmed in the shallow subsurface by a 2D seismic line. Subsidence is known to cause the reactivation of faults, which increases the risk of damage to infrastructure.

TI  - Evaluation of the one-step nucleic acid amplification assay for detecting lymph node metastasis in patients with cervical and endometrial cancer: A multicenter prospective study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. This multicenter study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay in diagnosing lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with cervical and endometrial cancers. Methods. Surgically removed LNs from patients with cervical and endometrial cancer were sectioned at 2-mm intervals along the short axis direction and alternately examined using the OSNA assay and conventional histo-pathological examination. Ultrastaging (200-mu m LN sections) was performed for metastatic LNs using hematox-ylin and eosin staining and immunostaining with an anti-CK19 antibody in cases where the OSNA assay and histopathological examination (performed using 2-mm LN sections) results showed discordance. Results. A total of 437 LNs from 133 patients were included; 61 patients (14%) showed metastasis by histopa-thological examination, with a concordance rate of 0.979 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.961-0.991) with the OSNA assay. The sensitivity and specificity of the OSNA assay were 0.918 (95% CI: 0.819-0.973) and 0.989 (95% CI: 0.973-0.997), respectively. Discordance between the two methods was observed in nine LNs (2.1%), and allocation bias of metastatic foci was identified as the major cause of discordance. Conclusions. The OSNA assay showed equally accurate detection of LN metastasis as the histopathological ex-amination. We suggest that the OSNA assay may be a useful tool for the rapid intraoperative diagnosis of LN me-tastasis in patients with cervical and endometrial cancers. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Band Ratios Combination for Estimating Chlorophyll-a from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 in Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) is a crucial parameter for monitoring the water quality in coastal waters. The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of existing Chl-a band ratio inversion models for estimating Chl-a from Sentinel2-MSI and Sentinel3-OLCI observation. This was performed using an extensive in situ R-rs-Chl-a dataset covering contrasted coastal waters (N = 1244, Chl-a (0.03-555.99) mu g/L), which has been clustered into five optical water types (OWTs). Our results show that the blue/green inversion models are suitable to derive Chl-a over clear to medium turbid waters (OWTs 1, 2, and 3) while red/NIR models are adapted to retrieve Chl-a in turbid/high-Chl-a environments. As they exhibited the optimal performance considering these two groups of OWTs, MuBR (multiple band ratio) and NDCI (Normalized Difference Chlorophyll-a Index)-based models were merged using the probability values of the defined OWTs as the blending coefficients. Such a combination provides a reliable Chl-a prediction over the vast majority of the global coastal turbid waters (94%), as evidenced by a good performance on the validation dataset (e.g., MAPD = 21.64%). However, our study further illustrated that none of the evaluated algorithms yield satisfying Chl-a estimates in ultra-turbid waters, which are mainly associated with turbid river plumes (OWT 5). This finding highlights the limitation of multispectral ocean color observation in such optically extreme environments and also implies the interest to better explore hyperspectral Rrs information to predict Chl-a.

TI  - Huge CH<sub>4</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and CO Emissions from Coal Mines in the Kuznetsk Basin (Russia) Detected by Sentinel-5P
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coal industry is the largest global emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, recent data suggests that coal mine methane (CH4) emissions worldwide are higher than those of the oil and gas industry. Furthermore, the coal industry is less active in reducing methane emissions than the oil and gas sectors due to lower profitability. Although uncertainties remain in quantifying methane emissions from mines, the use of satellite observations is revolutionizing the process of monitoring and improving the accuracy of emission accounting. The methodology presented here allows us to determine background CH4 concentrations and improve our ability to detect emission events using Sentinel-5P data. Knowing the background concentrations for the area of interest provides us the opportunity to track seasonal and annual variations and trends, as well as quickly detect periodic or accidental emissions from unregulated sources, etc. The methodology and systematic research applied in this paper for the period of May 2018 to the end of 2022 enables us to detect hundreds of large-scale emissions of CH4, NO2, and CO from the coal mines in the Kuznetsk Basin (the Kemerovo region), the largest coal mining area in Russia. We estimated that the amount of these emissions is significantly higher than the emissions reported by various authors for other coal mining regions such as Poland and Australia. We found that in cases of high methane quantity there is a positive correlation between NO2 and CO emissions in time and location. The source of emissions in the study area is homogeneous, which allows it to be used as a benchmark for building models to estimate and track emissions in heterogeneous areas.

TI  - INVESTIGATION OF SOIL EROSION IN AGRO-TOURISM AREA: GUIDELINE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION PLANNING
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Most agro-tourism areas are located in the upstream area of the watershed, in the highlands, steep slopes, and the air temperature is peaceful and calm. One of them is in the tourism area in the Penet upstream watershed, Bali, Indonesia. Agro-tourism, in addition to providing economic benefits to agricultural products, also from tourist visits to the panorama and landscape of agricultural land. Land use that is not wise and not following conservation rules can cause erosion. This study aims to investigate soil erosion rate and plans for environmental-based conservation. The method used to quantify erosion uses Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) with a geographic information system (GIS) approach. This research integrates field surveys and soil analysis in the laboratory. The result showed that the erosion rate in agro-tourism areas ranges from 0.32 t ha-1 yr-1 (very light) to 1,535.34 t ha-1 yr-1 (very heavy). The agro-tourism areas affected by erosion with heavy to very heavy categories are the villages of Antapan, Bangli, Apuan, Angseri, and Candikuning. Conservation actions can be taken, including improving plant management factors with dense vegetation, increasing land management actions by constructing bench terraces, and planting parallel to contour lines. It is recommended for further researchers to model erosion by integrating remote sensing data and geographic information systems in order to complement data that cannot be obtained in the field or the laboratory.

TI  - CH<sub>4</sub> Fluxes Derived from Assimilation of TROPOMI XCH<sub>4</sub> in CarbonTracker Europe-CH<sub>4</sub>: Evaluation of Seasonality and Spatial Distribution in the Northern High Latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in satellite observations of methane provide increased opportunities for inverse modeling. However, challenges exist in the satellite observation optimization and retrievals for high latitudes. In this study, we examine possibilities and challenges in the use of the total column averaged dry-air mole fractions of methane (XCH4) data over land from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite in the estimation of CH4 fluxes using the CarbonTracker Europe-CH4 (CTE-CH4) atmospheric inverse model. We carry out simulations assimilating two retrieval products: Netherlands Institute for Space Research's (SRON) operational and University of Bremen's Weighting Function Modified Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (WFM-DOAS). For comparison, we also carry out a simulation assimilating the ground-based surface data. Our results show smaller regional emissions in the TROPOMI inversions compared to the prior and surface inversion, although they are roughly within the range of the previous studies. The wetland emissions in summer and anthropogenic emissions in spring are lesser. The inversion results based on the two satellite datasets show many similarities in terms of spatial distribution and time series but also clear differences, especially in Canada, where CH4 emission maximum is later, when the SRON's operational data are assimilated. The TROPOMI inversions show higher CH4 emissions from oil and gas production and coal mining from Russia and Kazakhstan. The location of hotspots in the TROPOMI inversions did not change compared to the prior, but all inversions indicated spatially more homogeneous high wetland emissions in northern Fennoscandia. In addition, we find that the regional monthly wetland emissions in the TROPOMI inversions do not correlate with the anthropogenic emissions as strongly as those in the surface inversion. The uncertainty estimates in the TROPOMI inversions are more homogeneous in space, and the regional uncertainties are comparable to the surface inversion. This indicates the potential of the TROPOMI data to better separately estimate wetland and anthropogenic emissions, as well as constrain spatial distributions. This study emphasizes the importance of quantifying and taking into account the model and retrieval uncertainties in regional levels in order to improve and derive more robust emission estimates.

TI  - Transformation of Agricultural Landscapes and Its Consequences for Natural Forests in Southern Myanmar within the Last 40 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Kyunsu township comprises coastal regions and a multitude of small islands covered by vast tropical evergreen and mangrove forests, and a large water body in the Adman Sea of Myanmar. Due to population growth, residents have increasingly expanded their agricultural land areas into natural tropical evergreen and mangrove forests, leading to deforestation. Understanding the processes and consequences of landscape transformation for surrounding ecosystems is crucial for local policy making and for fostering sustainable crop production in this area. Landsat datasets from 1978, 1989, 2000, 2011, and 2020 were used in a time-series post-classification approach to investigate land use land cover (LULC) changes in the Kyunsu township of Southern Myanmar across the last 40 years. Our study also attempted to assess the effects of the transformation of LULC on carbon stocks. Between 1978 and 2020, major LULC changes occurred with the expansion of Paddy Fields (+90%), Plantations (+11%), Open Forests (+81%), Settlement Areas (+115%), Aquaculture Areas (+1594%), and Others (+188%) while the area covered with Closed Forests shrunk by 44% and with Mangrove Forests by 9%. Water Bodies expanded by 0.13%. Our analyses show that between 1978 and 2020 2453 ha of Paddy Fields expanded into Plantations, 1857 ha to Open Forests, and 1146 ha to Mangrove Forests. Additionally, 12,135 ha of Open Forests, 8474 ha of Closed Forests, and 2317 ha of Mangrove Forests became Plantations. Across the 40 year study period, a total of 40,523 ha of Closed Forests were transformed to Open Forests. Our findings show that transformation of agricultural landscapes in the study area significantly affected deforestation and forest degradation of tropical evergreen rain forests and mangrove forests which are vital sources of ecosystem services. These transformations led to estimated losses of carbon stocks between 1978 and 2020 ranged from 89,260-5,106,820 Mg (average of 1,723,250 Mg) in our study area. Our findings call for sustainable resource intensification to increase production efficiency in existing cultivated areas rather than crop land expansion into natural forests. In addition, our data highlight the need for rigorous policies to conserve and protect tropical natural evergreen and mangrove forest, as key local resources providing multiple ecosystem services.

TI  - An Intercomparison of Sentinel-1 Based Change Detection Algorithms for Flood Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With its unrivaled and global land monitoring capability, the Sentinel-1 mission has been established as a prime provider in SAR-based flood mapping. Compared to suitable single-image flood algorithms, change-detection methods offer better robustness, retrieving flood extent from a classification of observed changes. This requires data-based parametrization. Moreover, in the scope of global and automatic flood services, the employed algorithms should not rely on locally optimized parameters, which cannot be automatically estimated and have spatially varying quality, impacting much on the mapping accuracy. Within the recently launched Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) service, we implemented a Bayes-Inference (BI)-based algorithm designed to meet these ends. However, whether other change detection algorithms perform similarly or better is unknown. This study examines four Sentinel-1 change detection models: The Normalized Difference Scattering Index (NDSI), Shannon's entropy of NDSI (SNDSI), Standardized Residuals (SR), and Bayes Inference over Luzon in the Philippines, which was flood-hit by a typhoon in November 2020. After parametrization assessment against an expert-created Sentinel-1 flood map, the four models are inter-compared against an independent Sentinel-2 classification. The obtained findings indicate that the Bayes change detection profits from its scalable classification rules and shows the least sensitivity to parametrization choices while also performing best in terms of mapping accuracy. For all change detection models, a backscatter seasonality model for the no-flood reference delivered best results.

TI  - <i>Hira Makes a Sound</i>: Nepali Diasporic Worldviewing through Asian American Studies Praxis during the COVID-19 Anti-Asian Hate Pandemics
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we offer a specific example from our programmatic research and teaching praxis during the COVID-19 anti-Asian hate pandemic period. We demonstrate how Asian American Studies community-centered knowledge coproduction and narrative generational wealth investment can address critical experiences of young learners from underrepresented, religiously-diverse populations through content that supports culturally sustaining child development and challenges disparately impactful realities of racism, misrepresentation, and systemic Western biases which undermine their health and wellbeing. Focusing on religious themes in relation to child development was not an explicit intention of our collaboratively developed storybook project titled, Hira Makes a Sound. Nevertheless, centering a women-led, intergenerational Nepali immigrant story in both our process and final product necessarily led to foregrounding religious, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of diasporic family and community life that are essential to coping and development for the fictional lead character, Hira, and her loved ones. Robust story data themes-paradoxically grounded in the ether of a shared Gurung worldview-provide generative lessons for researchers, educators, artists, and community advocates who work with or need to account for the lived experiences of young learners within religiously diverse, multi-generational immigrant family households and community ecologies.

TI  - Investigating Drought and Flood Evolution Based on Remote Sensing Data Products over the Punjab Region in Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last five decades, Pakistan experienced its worst drought from 1998 to 2002 and its worst flood in 2010. This study determined the record-breaking impacts of the droughts (1998-2002) and the flood (2010) and analyzed the given 12-year period, especially the follow-on period when the winter wheat crop was grown. We identified the drought, flood, and warm and cold edges over the plain of Punjab Pakistan based on a 12-year time series (2003-2014), using the vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) approach based on Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data products. During the year 2010, the Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS) model applied to the real-time Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall incorporated data products into the TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) for the flood detection/intensity, stream flow, and daily accumulative precipitation, and presented the plain provisions to wetlands. This study exhibits drought severity, warm and cold edges, and flood levels using the VTCI drought-monitoring approach, which utilizes a combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with land surface temperature (LST) data products. It was found that during the years 2003-2014, the VTCI had a positive correlation coefficient (r) with the cumulative precipitation (r = 0.60) on the day of the year (D-073) in the winter. In the year 2010, at D-201, there was no proportionality (nonlinear), and at D-217, a negative correlation was established. This revealed the time, duration, and intensity of the flood at D-201 and D-217, and described the heavy rainfall, stream flow, and flood events. At D-233 and D-281 during 2010, a significant positive correlation was noticed in normal conditions (r = 0.95 in D-233 and r= 0.97 in D-281 during the fall of 2010), which showed the flood events and normality. Notably, our results suggest that VTCI can be used for drought and wet conditions in both rain-fed and irrigated regions. The results are consistent with anomalies in the GFMS model using the spatial and temporal observations of the MODIS, TRMM, and TMPA satellites, which describe the dry and wet conditions, as well as flood runoff stream flow and flood detection/intensity, in the region of Punjab during 2010. It should be noted that the flood (2010) affected the area, and the production of the winter wheat crop has consistently declined from 19.041 to 17.7389 million tons.

TI  - Assessing Impacts of Flood and Drought over the Punjab Region of Pakistan Using Multi-Satellite Data Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Punjab region of Pakistan faced significant losses from flash flooding in 2010 and experienced a multiyear drought during 1998-2002. The current study illustrates the drought and flood conditions using the multi-satellite data products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) as well as the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) satellites with high-quality resolution in the region of Punjab during 2010-2014. To determine the drought and flood events, we used the Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) drought monitoring approach combined with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) to identify the warm and cold edges (WACE) in the provision of soil moisture as well as the VTCI imagery using the MODIS-Aqua data products. We assessed the 2010 flood effect on the four years (2011-2014) of drought conditions during winter wheat crop seasons. The obtained VTCI imagery and precipitation data were utilized to validate the drought and flood conditions in the year 2010 and the drought conditions in the years 2011-2014 during the winter-wheat-crop season. It is worth mentioning that over the four years (2011-2014) of the Julian day D-041 year, the VTCI shows a stronger link with the accumulative precipitation anomaly (r = 0.77). It was found that for D-201 during the 2010 flood was the relationship was nonlinear, and in D-217, there was a negative relationship which revealed the flood timing, duration, and intensity. For D-281, a correlation (r = 0.97) was noted during fall 2010, which showed the drought and flood extreme conditions for the winter-wheat-crop season in the year 2010-2014. In regard to 2010, the Global Flood Monitoring System (GFMS) model employs the TRMM and TMPA data products to display the study region during the 2010 flood events and validate the VTCI results. This study's spatial and temporal observations based on the observed results of the MODIS, TRMM, and TMPA satellites are in good agreement with dry and wet conditions as well as the flood runoff stream flow and flood intensity. It demonstrates the flood events with high intensity compared with the normality of flood with the complete establishment of flood events and weather extremes during the year of 2011-2014, thereby highlighting the natural hazards impacts. Our findings show that the winter wheat harvest was affected by the 2010 monsoon's summer high rain and floods in the plain of Punjab (Pakistan).

TI  - Updates in gynecologic care for individuals with lynch syndrome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome caused by germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6) or the EPCAM gene. It is estimated to affect 1 in 300 individuals and confers a lifetime risk of cancer of 10-90%, depending on the specific variant and type of cancer. Lynch syndrome is the most common cause of inherited colorectal cancer, but for women, endometrial cancer is more likely to be the sentinel cancer. There is also evidence that certain PVs causing Lynch syndrome confer an increased risk of ovarian cancer, while the risk of ovarian cancer in others is not well defined. Given this, it is essential for the practicing gynecologist and gynecologic oncologist to remain up to date on the latest techniques in identification and diagnosis of individuals with Lynch syndrome as well as evidence-based screening and risk reduction recommendations for those impacted. Furthermore, as the landscape of gynecologic cancer treatment shifts towards treatment based on molecular classification of tumors, knowledge of targeted therapies well-suited for mismatch repair deficient Lynch tumors will be crucial. The objective of this review is to highlight recent updates in the literature regarding identification and management of individuals with Lynch syndrome as it pertains to endometrial and ovarian cancers to allow gynecologic providers the opportunity to both prevent and identify Lynch-associated cancers earlier, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality of the syndrome.

TI  - Optimizing Wheat Yield Prediction Integrating Data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 with CatBoost Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating wheat yield is crucial for informed decision making in precision agriculture (PA) and improving crop management. In recent years, optical satellite-derived vegetation indices (Vis), such as Sentinel-2 (S2), have become widely used, but the availability of images depends on the weather conditions. For its part, Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter data are less used in agriculture due to its complicated interpretation and processing, but is not impacted by weather. This study investigates the potential benefits of combining S1 and S2 data and evaluates the performance of the categorical boosting (CatBoost) algorithm in crop yield estimation. The study was conducted utilizing dense yield data from a yield monitor, obtained from 39 wheat (Triticum spp. L.) fields. The study analyzed three S2 images corresponding to different crop growth stages (GS) GS30, GS39-49, and GS69-75, and 13 Vis commonly used for wheat yield estimation were calculated for each image. In addition, three S1 images that were temporally close to the S2 images were acquired, and the vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH) backscatter were calculated. The performance of the CatBoost algorithm was compared to that of multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) algorithms in crop yield estimation. The results showed that the combination of S1 and S2 data with the CatBoost algorithm produced a yield prediction with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.24 t ha(-1), a relative RMSE (rRMSE) 3.46% and an R-2 of 0.95. The result indicates a decrease of 30% in RMSE when compared to using S2 alone. However, when this algorithm was used to estimate the yield of a whole plot, leveraging information from the surrounding plots, the mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.31 t ha(-1) which means a mean error of 4.38%. Accurate wheat yield estimation with a spatial resolution of 10 m becomes feasible when utilizing satellite data combined with CatBoost.

TI  - Comparison of Deterministic and Probabilistic Variational Data Assimilation Methods Using Snow and Streamflow Data Coupled in HBV Model for Upper Euphrates Basin
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The operation of upstream reservoirs in mountainous regions fed by snowmelt is highly challenging. This is partly due to scarce information given harsh topographic conditions and a lack of monitoring stations. In this sense, snow observations from remote sensing provide additional and relevant information about the current conditions of the basin. This information can be used to improve the model states of a forecast using data assimilation techniques, therefore enhancing the operation of reservoirs. Typical data assimilation techniques can effectively reduce the uncertainty of forecast initialization by merging simulations and observations. However, they do not take into account model, structural, or parametric uncertainty. The uncertainty intrinsic to the model simulations introduces complexity to the forecast and restricts the daily work of operators. The novel Multi-Parametric Variational Data Assimilation (MP-VarDA) uses different parameter sets to create a pool of models that quantify the uncertainty arising from model parametrization. This study focuses on the sensitivity of the parametric reduction techniques of MP-VarDA coupled in the HBV hydrological model to create model pools and the impact of the number of parameter sets on the performance of streamflow and Snow Cover Area (SCA) forecasts. The model pool is created using Monte Carlo simulation, combined with an Aggregated Distance (AD) Method, to create different model pool instances. The tests are conducted in the Karasu Basin, located at the uppermost part of the Euphrates River in Turkiye, where snowmelt is a significant portion of the yearly runoff. The analyses were conducted for different thresholds based on the observation exceedance probabilities. According to the results in comparison with deterministic VarDA, probabilistic MP-VarDA improves the m-CRPS gains of the streamflow forecasts from 57% to 67% and BSS forecast skill gains from 52% to 68% when streamflow and SCA are assimilated. This improvement rapidly increases for the first additional model parameter sets but reaches a maximum benefit after 5 parameter sets in the model pool. The improvement is notable for both methods in SCA forecasts, but the best m-CRPS gain is obtained for VarDA (31%), while the best forecast skill is detected in MP-VarDA (12%).

TI  - Land cover dynamics in the Paraguayan Pantanal in the timeframe 1987-2020
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Paraguayan Pantanal is part of one of the largest freshwater wetlands in the world. It is also one of the richest ecosystems on the planet in terms of biodiversity. It is recognized as a RAMSAR site and on its way to being declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which faces various pressures mainly due to changes in land use. This study describes how these land use changes occurred over time in a place barely studied and thereby to lay the foundations for the decision-makers to undertake appropriate restoration and conservation measures. It aims to analyze the land cover dynamics in the Paraguayan Pantanal over 33 years, in the timeframe 1987-2020. A diachronic analysis of satellite images Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 was carried out. To process the different scenes into land cover maps, an unsupervised stacked classification process was conducted. In 33 years, 13,069.5 km(2) (43.1%) of forest were intended to other uses, including herbaceous vegetation, grazing lands, aquatic vegetation, and water bodies. Between the periods 1987-2004, 2004-2020, and 1987-2020, there were 3014.4 km(2) (9.9%), 5944.5 km(2) (19.6%), and 9118.9 km(2) (30.1%) of deforestation, considering the changes from forest to herbaceous vegetation and grazing lands. It is important to carry out a paradigm shift regarding the current mode of production, incorporating more sustainable livestock production techniques that allow the conservation of natural resources. Likewise, at the legislative level, land use regulations must be implemented and regulate the Forestry Law of Paraguay according to the current landscape situation.

TI  - Evaluation of the Potential of Sentinel-5P TROPOMI and AIS Marine Traffic Data for the Monitoring of Anthropogenic Activity and Maritime Transport NOx-Emissions in Canary Islands Waters
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work studies air quality by analysing NOx emissions in the inland waters of the Canary Islands, with particular emphasis on determining how maritime transport activity contributes to the emission of NO2 in the environment of the two main islands, Tenerife and Gran Canaria. We explored the capabilities of tropospheric NO2 density derived from the TROPOMI sensor onboard ESA's Sentinel 5P Satellite to be used as an air quality monitoring tool at the regional scale of the Canary Islands. The studied mesoscale emission scenarios allowed us to identify the main sources, associated with urban areas, heavy roads, power plants, ports, and to a lesser extent, shipping routes. Mean values for the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz de Tenerife were 1.38 x 10(15) molec cm(-2). Similarly, in port areas, mean values of 1.22 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) were found. These levels can confidently be associated with anthropogenic activities. These were clearly distinguishable from background (noise) values of 7.08 x 10(14) molec cm(-2) obtained in maritime areas away from the influence of the islands. To investigate the maritime contribution to the NO2 emissions, ship tracks were obtained from an Automated Identification System (AIS) receiving station that covered the channel between the Tenerife and Gran Canaria islands. Multitemporal, and hence accumulative, NO2 scenarios were compared with the ship traffic density within a given temporal window before satellite overpass. We found good spatial agreement between NO2 signal and frequent ship routes between the major islands at several time scales, particularly in weekly averaged scenarios. Enhancements up to 2.0 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) relative to surrounding waters were identified in the middle of the main shipping routes between the main islands. Thus, multitemporal NO2 scenarios derived from TROPOMI can lead to an estimate of the ship traffic contribution to NOx emissions in complex environments, such as this one, influenced by land emissions.

TI  - DELINEATION OF COAL FIRE RISK AREAS FROM LANDSAT-8 TIRS DATA: A CASE STUDY OF NA DUONG COALFIELD (NORTH-EAST OF VIETNAM)
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal fires are a persistent threat to major coal-producing countries in the world. Thus, it is very important to delineate the potential risks of coal fires. This study presents a method for the delineation of coal fire risk areas from Landsat-8 TIRS data. Land surface temperatures (LSTs) were first retrieved from the Landsat-8 TIRS images. The degree of spatial autocorrelation among these LSTs was then identified using local Moran's I statistic. Thermal-related anomalies for the delineation of coal fire risk areas were identified by setting the MEAN+2*SDEV (SDEV is the standard deviation), MEAN+3*SDEV, and MEAN+4*SDEV formulas as thresholds on the local Moran's I statistic. These coal fire risk areas were finally validated using known coal fire sites and cross-validated by comparing them with those obtained from hot spot analysis. A case study of the Na Duong coal field (northern Vietnam) has shown that coal fire risks at moderate and high levels were mainly detected in the center of the coal field. The higher values of local Moran's I statistic, the higher levels of coal fire risks. These coal fire risks were mainly concentrated around known coal fire sites. These results reveal that Landsat -8 TIRS data can effectively delineate coal fire risk areas.

TI  - Athabasca River Avulsion Underway in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Avulsions change river courses and transport water and sediment to new channels impacting infrastructure, floodplain evolution, and ecosystems. Abrupt avulsion events (occurring over days to weeks) are potentially catastrophic to society and thus receive more attention than slow avulsions, which develop over decades to centuries and can be challenging to identify. Here, we examine gradual channel changes of the Peace-Athabasca River Delta (PAD), Canada using in situ measurements and 37 years of Landsat satellite imagery. A developing avulsion of the Athabasca River is apparent along the Embarras River-Mamawi Creek (EM) distributary. Its opening and gradual enlargement since 1982 are evident from multiple lines of observation: Between 1984 and 2021 the discharge ratio between the EM and the Athabasca River more than doubled, increasing from 9% to 21%. The EM has widened by +53% since 1984, whereas the Athabasca River channel width has remained stable. The downstream Mamawi Creek delta is growing at a discharge-normalized rate roughly twice that of the Athabasca River delta in surface area. Longitudinal global navigation satellite systems field surveys of water surface elevation reveal the EM possesses a similar to 2X slope advantage (8 x 10(-5) vs. 4 x 10 (-5)) over the Athabasca River, and unit stream power and bed shear stress suggest enhanced sediment transport and erosional capacity through the evolving flow path. Our findings: (a) indicate that a slow avulsion of the Athabasca River is underway with potentially long-term implications for inundation patterns, ecosystems, and human use of the PAD; and (b) demonstrate an observational approach for identifying other slow avulsions at river bifurcations globally.

TI  - Association between Temperature and Influenza Activity across Different Regions of China during 2010-2017
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza causes a significant disease burden as an acute respiratory infection. Evidence suggests that meteorological factors can influence the spread of influenza; however, the association between these factors and influenza activity remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the impact of temperature on influenza across different regions of China based on the meteorological data and influenza data from 554 sentinel hospitals in 30 provinces and municipalities in China from 2010 to 2017. A distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was used to analyze the exposure lag response of daily mean temperatures to the risk of influenza-like illness (ILI), influenza A (Flu A), and influenza B (Flu B). We found that in northern China, low temperatures increased the risk of ILI, Flu A, and Flu B, while in central and southern China, both low and high temperatures increased the risk of ILI and Flu A, and only low temperatures increased the risk of Flu B. This study suggests that temperature is closely associated with the influenza activity in China. Temperature should be integrated into the current public health surveillance system for highly accurate influenza warnings and the timely implementation of disease prevention and control measures.

TI  - Going Back to Grassland? Assessing the Impact of Groundwater Decline on Irrigated Agriculture Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has increased agricultural drought risk in arid/semi-arid regions globally. One of the common adaptation strategies is shifting to more drought-tolerant crops or switching back to grassland permanently. In many drought-prone areas, groundwater dynamics play a critical role in agricultural production and drought management. This study aims to help understand how groundwater level decline affects the propensity of cropland switching back to grassland. Taking Union County of New Mexico (US) as a case study, field-scale groundwater level projections and high-resolution remote sensing data on crop choices are integrated to explore the impact of groundwater level decline in a regression analysis framework. The results show that cropland has been slowly but permanently switching back to grassland as the groundwater level in the Ogallala Aquifer continues to decline in the area. Specifically, for a one-standard-deviation decline in groundwater level (36.95 feet or 11.26 m), the average likelihood of switching back to grassland increases by 1.85% (the 95% confidence interval is [0.07%, 3.58%]). The findings account for the fact that farmers usually explore other options (such as more drought-tolerant crops, land idling, and rotation) before switching back to grassland permanently. The paper concludes by exploring relevant policy implications for land (soil) and water conservation in the long run.

TI  - Flood Monitoring in the Middle and Lower Basin of the Yangtze River Using Google Earth Engine and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of intensified human activities and global climate warming, the frequency and intensity of flood disasters have increased, causing many casualties and economic losses every year. Given the difficulty of mountain shadow removal from large-scale watershed flood monitoring based on Sentinel-1 SAR images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, this paper first adopted the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to extract the water body information during flooding. Then, a function model was proposed based on the mountain shadow samples to remove the mountain shadows from the flood maps. Finally, this paper analyzed the flood disasters in the middle and lower basin of the Yangtze River (MLB) in 2020. The main results showed that: (1) compared with the other two methods, the SVM model had the highest accuracy. The accuracy and kappa coefficients of the trained SVM model in the testing dataset were 97.77% and 0.9521, respectively. (2) The function model proposed based on the samples achieved the best effect compared with other shadow removal methods with a shadow recognition rate of 75.46%, and it alleviated the interference of mountain shadows for flood monitoring in a large basin. (3) The flood inundated area was 8526 km(2), among which, cropland was severely affected (6160 km(2)). This study could provide effective suggestions for relevant stakeholders in policy making.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of Forest Above-Ground Biomass Distribution Patterns Based on Landsat 8 OLI Images and a Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression Algorithm
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is an excellent indicator for the health status and carbon sink potential of forest ecosystems, as well as the effectiveness of sustainable forest management practices. However, due to the strong heterogeneity of forest structures, acquiring high-accuracy and high-resolution AGB distributions over wide regions is often prohibitively expensive. To fill the resulting gap, this paper uses part of Lishui city, Zhejiang province as the study area, based on 168 forest sample observations, and proposes a novel integrated framework that combines a multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) with the co-kriging algorithm to refine the spatial downscaling of AGB. Specifically, optimal predictor variable sets identified by random forest importance ranking, multiple stepwise regression, and Pearson VIF methods were first assessed based on their total explanatory power (R square), followed by reconfirmation of the optimal predictor variable set based on the non-stationarity impact of each variable's action scale (bandwidth) on the output pattern of AGB downscaling. The AGB downscaling statistical algorithms included MGWR, GWR, random forest (RF), and the ordinary least square (OLS), and their downscaling performances were quantitatively compared to determine the best downscaling method. Ultimately, the downscaled AGB pattern was produced using the best method, which was further refined by considering the spatial autocorrelation in AGB samples by implementing a co-kriging interpolation analysis of the predicted AGB downscaling residuals. The results indicated that the variable set selected by random forest importance ranking had the strongest explanatory power, with a validation R square of 0.58. This was further confirmed by the MGWR analysis which showed that the set of variables produced a more spatially smooth downscaled AGB pattern. Among the set of optimal variables, elevation and aspect affected AGB at local scales, representing a strong spatial heterogeneity. Some textural features and spectral features showed a smooth action scale relative to AGB, showing insignificant spatial scale processes. In the study area with complex terrain, using aspect as a covariant, the co-kriging (CK) model achieved a higher simulation accuracy for the MGWR-predicted AGB residuals than the ordinary kriging model. Overall, the proposed MGWR-CK model, with a final validation R square value of 0.62, effectively improved the spatial distribution characteristics and textural details of AGB mapping without the additional costs of procuring finer satellite images and GIS-based features. This will contribute to the accurate assessment of carbon sinks and carbon stock changes in subtropical forest ecosystems globally.

TI  - Snow Cover Phenology in Xinjiang Based on a Novel Method and MOD10A1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using Earth observation to accurately extract snow phenology changes is of great significance for deepening the understanding of the ecological environment and hydrological process, agricultural and animal husbandry production, and high-quality development of the social economy in Xinjiang. Considering snow cover phenology based on MODIS product MOD10A1 data, this paper constructed a method for automatically extracting key phenological parameters in Xinjiang and calculated three key phenological parameters in Xinjiang from 2001 to 2020, including SCD (snow cover duration), SOD (snow onset date), and SED (snow end date). The daily data of four field camera observation points during an overlapping period from 2017 to 2019 were used to evaluate the snow cover phenological parameters extracted by MOD10A1, and the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values were 0.65 and 1.07, respectively. The results showed the following: 1. The spatiotemporal variation in snow phenology was highly altitude dependent. The mean gradients of SCD in the Altai Mountains, Tienshan Mountains, and Kunlun Mountains is 2.6, 2.1, and 1.2 d/100 m, respectively. The variation trend of snow phenology with latitude and longitude was mainly related to the topography of Xinjiang. Snow phenological parameters of different land-use types were different. The SCD values in wasteland were the lowest and the SED was the earliest, while forest land was the first to enter SOD accumulation. According to the study, the mean annual values of SCD, SOD, and SED were 25, 342 (8 December), and 51 (8 February) as day of year (DOY), respectively. The snow cover area was mainly distributed in the Altai Mountains, Junggar Basin, Tianshan Mountains, and Kunlun Mountains. 2. The variation trend and significance of snow cover phenological parameters in different regions are different, and the variation trend of snow cover phenological parameters in most regions of Xinjiang is non-significant.

TI  - Methods for Estimating Surface Water Storage Changes and Their Evaluations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing effective methods for estimating regional-scale surface water storage change (ASW) has be-come increasingly important for water resources studies and environmental impact assessment. Three methods for estimat-ing monthly ASW are proposed in this study, of which one is based on land surface runoff and two that use water body water budgets. Water areas observed by Landsat satellites for Canada's entire landmass are used for evaluation of the re-sults. The surface runoff method achieved the least satisfactory results, with large errors in the cold season or dry regions. The two water-budget methods demonstrated significant improvements, particularly when water area dynamics is consid-ered in the estimation of the water body water budget. The three methods performed consistently across different climate regions in the country and showed better correlations with observations over wet climate regions than over dry regions with poorly connected hydrological system. The results also showed the impact of glacier and permanent snow melts over the Rocky Mountains on basin-scale surface water dynamics. The methods and outputs from this study can be used for cali-brating and validating hydrological and climate models, assessing climate change and human disturbance impacts on regional water resources, and filling the ASW data gaps in GRACE-based total water storage decompositions studies.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate methods for estimating re-gional-scale surface water storage change. This is important because information on surface water dynamics is limited for water resources studies and environmental impact assessment. Our study makes available two new methods which significantly improve on surface water storage estimation from the traditional runoff model. A guide on controls of sur-face water dynamics is provided for regions under various hydroclimate and physiographic-hydraulic conditions and reveals the influence of glacier melt on surface water variations.

TI  - Research Progress on Remote Sensing Monitoring of Lake Water Quality Parameters
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are an important component of the hydrosphere and are important freshwater resources. The water environment of lakes has become increasingly polluted, and monitoring the dynamic changes in lake water quality is of great significance for ecological environment protection. Remote sensing can provide technical support for lake water quality monitoring, overcoming the low-cost and poor timeliness characteristics of manual sampling; thus, it has been widely used in lake water quality monitoring. Remote sensing can be used to monitor many indicators, including suspended solids, chlorophyll a, soluble organic matter, dissolved oxygen, transparency, etc. Although remote sensing provides a new method for lake water quality monitoring, there are still some problems in practical application. 1 It is difficult to accurately retrieve the component changes in different substances in lake water from the signals received by remote sensing, resulting in the limitation of remote sensing accuracy. Atmospheric correction can eliminate the images reflected by factors such as atmosphere and light. In order to improve the accuracy of water quality monitoring, higher-accuracy atmospheric correction algorithms are needed. However, at present the atmospheric correction algorithm is not mature enough and lacks the portability between sensors. Therefore, atmospheric correction is still a difficult problem of remote sensing retrieval in lake water quality. 2 Due to seasonal and spatial constraints, there are differences in surface optical properties of different lakes and biological optical properties, resulting in changes in remote sensing reflectance. There is also a lack of portability of the model established by using limited measured data. 3 The interference of aquatic plants and external forces (wind, fish, etc.) causes the error between the measured data and the model estimation, and the synchronization of the data is difficult to guarantee, which will introduce large errors to the lake water quality model, resulting in a decrease in the reliability of the model. 4 The spatio-temporal scale of measured data and remote sensing data do not match, and it is difficult to capture dynamic and fine changes in water quality. More precise observation of water quality is needed that can capture rapid changes in lakes. However, it is still challenging to obtain real-time measured data that meet the requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to further understand the spectral characteristics of water quality parameters, combining multi-source data and other hydrological models. In the future, a retrieval algorithm with low dependence will be developed, and migrated models will be constructed to break the regional limitations of the model. Additionally, remote sensing promotes the operational development and early warning for the water quality of lakes.

TI  - Changes in Impervious Surfaces in Lhasa City, a Historical City on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface cover reflects the urban environment and urban expansion. Lhasa City is a historical city and one of the most populous on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and has been experiencing rapid urbanization in recent years. Analyzing the impervious surface distribution can reveal urban development characteristics and provide data for sustainable urban planning to protect the heritage. This study explored the spatial and temporal changes and expansion patterns of impervious surfaces in different zones of Lhasa City. Impervious surface maps (2014 and 2021) were extracted from Gaofen-1 images with a high spatial resolution (2 m) using an object-based image analysis method. Next, a gravity center, standard deviational ellipses and landscape indices were used to characterize impervious surface expansions in different zones. The result indicated that the impervious surface in Lhasa expanded from 51.149 km(2) in 2014 to 63.299 km(2) in 2021. The growth rates of impervious surfaces inside the Environmental Coordination zone were lower than in the zones outside. From 2014 to 2021, the impervious surface of Lhasa expanded in the southeast direction. Infilling and consolidation were the primary impervious surface development patterns. The expansion of the impervious surface was related to topography, population, and economic and policy factors.

TI  - Monitoring Ground Surface Deformation of Ice-Wedge Polygon Areas in Saskylakh, NW Yakutia, Using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Google Earth Engine (GEE)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the best indicators of the periglacial environment, ice-wedge polygons (IWPs) are important for arctic landscapes, hydrology, engineering, and ecosystems. Thus, a better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics and evolution of IWPs is key to evaluating the hydrothermal state and carbon budgets of the arctic permafrost environment. In this paper, the dynamics of ground surface deformation (GSD) in IWP zones (2018-2019) and their influencing factors over the last 20 years in Saskylakh, northwestern Yakutia, Russia were investigated using the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results show an annual ground surface deformation rate (AGSDR) in Saskylakh at -49.73 to 45.97 mm/a during the period from 1 June 2018 to 3 May 2019. All the selected GSD regions indicate that the relationship between GSD and land surface temperature (LST) is positive (upheaving) for regions with larger AGSDR, and negative (subsidence) for regions with lower AGSDR. The most drastic deformation was observed at the Aeroport regions with GSDs rates of -37.06 mm/a at tower and 35.45 mm/a at runway. The GSDs are negatively correlated with the LST of most low-centered polygons (LCPs) and high-centered polygons (HCPs). Specifically, the higher the vegetation cover, the higher the LST and the thicker the active layer. An evident permafrost degradation has been observed in Saskylakh as reflected in higher ground temperatures, lusher vegetation, greater active layer thickness, and fluctuant numbers and areal extents of thermokarst lakes and ponds.

TI  - Contribution of Land Cover Classification Results Based on Sentinel-1 and 2 to the Accreditation of Wetland Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland cities were proposed by the International Wetland Convention Organization for the protection of urban wetlands. Few studies have performed land cover classifications for internationally recognized wetland cities or explored what contribution the classification results can make to the establishment of additional wetland cities to date. Based on Sentinel-1 and 2 data, this study used a 10-fold random forest method to classify the land cover of the first six wetland cities recognized in China. A land cover dataset, which had a resolution of 10 m and included four wetland types, was obtained and the wetland area and protected wetland areas of the six cities were calculated. The results showed that (1) the classification accuracy of six cities was good, the overall accuracy was above 90%, and the Kappa coefficient was above 0.88. (2) Cropland or forested areas were the most common non-wetland land coverage type in wetland cities and accounted for more than 20% or 40% of the land coverages, while water was the most common wetland type and accounted for more than 2% of the land coverages. From 2015 to 2020, the built area in most cities increased, while cropland and forest decreased significantly. (3) The wetland rate was 6.68-37.56% and the wetland protection rate was 49.48-73.74% in the six wetland cities. From 2015 to 2020, the wetland rate of the six cities were relatively stable, and the wetland protection rate of inland cities (Yinchuan, Changde, Harbin and Changshu) increased significantly, while those of coastal cities (Haikou and Dongying) decreased, which might be related to the change in coastline. Therefore, we found that the wetlands in these cities were well protected. Land cover classification for wetland cities can provide a reference for using remote sensing techniques used to monitor internationally wetland cities while also supporting the creation of additional wetland cities.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Mangrove Species Classification Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data Using Extremely Randomized Trees in Fucheng Town, Leizhou City, Guangdong Province
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are an important source of blue carbon that grow in coastal areas. The study of mangrove species distribution is the basis of carbon storage research. In this study, we explored the potential of combining optical (Gaofen-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-9) and fully polarized synthetic aperture radar data from different periods (Gaofen-3) to distinguish mangrove species in the Fucheng town of Leizhou, Guangdong Province. The Gaofen-1 data were fused with Sentinel-2 and Landsat-9 satellite data, respectively. The new data after fusion had both high spatial and spectral resolution. The backscattering coefficient and polarization decomposition parameters of the fully polarized SAR data which could characterize the canopy structure of mangroves were extracted. Ten different feature combinations were designed by combining the two types of data. The extremely randomized trees algorithm (ERT) was used to classify the species, and the optimal feature subset was selected by the feature selection algorithm on the basis of the ERT, and the importance of the features was sorted. Studies show the following: (1) When controlling a single variable, the higher the spatial resolution of the multi-spectral data, the higher the interspecific classification accuracy. (2) The coupled Sentinel-2 and Landsat-9 data with a 2 m resolution will have higher classification accuracy than a single data source. (3) The selected feature subset contains all types of features in the optical data and the polarization decomposition features of the SAR data from different periods: multi-spectral band > texture feature > polarization decomposition parameter > vegetation index. Among the optimized feature combinations, the classification accuracy of mangrove species was the highest, the overall classification accuracy was 90.13%, and Kappa was 0.84, indicating that multi-source and SAR data from different periods coupling could improve the discrimination of mangrove species. (4) The ERT classification algorithm is suitable for the study of mangrove species classification, and the classification accuracy of extremely random trees in this paper is higher than that of random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Bayesian (Bayes). The results can provide technical guidance and data support for mangrove species monitoring based on multi-source satellite data.

TI  - Modeling Global Vegetation Gross Primary Productivity, Transpiration and Hyperspectral Canopy Radiative Transfer Simultaneously Using a Next Generation Land Surface Model-CliMA Land
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent progress in satellite observations has provided unprecedented opportunities to monitor vegetation activity at global scale. However, a major challenge in fully utilizing remotely sensed data to constrain land surface models (LSMs) lies in inconsistencies between simulated and observed quantities. For example, gross primary productivity (GPP) and transpiration (T) that traditional LSMs simulate are not directly measurable from space, although they can be inferred from spaceborne observations using assumptions that are inconsistent with those LSMs. In comparison, canopy reflectance and fluorescence spectra that satellites can detect are not modeled by traditional LSMs. To bridge these quantities, we presented an overview of the next generation land model developed within the Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMA), and simulated global GPP, T, and hyperspectral canopy radiative transfer (RT; 400-2,500 nm for reflectance, 640-850 nm for fluorescence) at hourly time step and 1 & DEG; spatial resolution using CliMA Land. CliMA Land predicts vegetation indices and outgoing radiances, including solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) for any given sun-sensor geometry. The spatial patterns of modeled GPP, T, SIF, NDVI, EVI, and NIRv correlate significantly with existing data-driven products (mean R-2 = 0.777 for 9 products). CliMA Land would be also useful in high temporal resolution simulations, for example, providing insights into when GPP, SIF, and NIRv diverge.

TI  - Identification and Analysis of Unstable Slope and Seasonal Frozen Soil Area along the Litang Section of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sichuan-Tibet Railway (STR) is currently under construction and serves as an important transportation route in western China. Identifying potential geohazards along the route is important for project construction. However, research on the frozen soil of the Western Sichuan Plateau, and on frozen soil identification using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is relatively negligible. As a low-cost, all-weather spatial geodesy tool, InSAR is frequently used for geohazard identification. We selected a study area located along the Litang section of the STR, starting from Litang County in the east and extending 60 km to the west. The geological conditions along the line are complex, with numerous fault zones and hidden danger points for landslide. To identify unstable slopes along the line, distribute scatterer InSAR (DS-InSAR) was used to obtain surface displacement information from 2018 to 2021. Based on the displacement information obtained from the ascending and descending orbit images from Sentinel-1, a spatial density clustering method identified 377 and 388 unstable slopes in the study area, respectively, of these, 132 were consistent. The identified unstable slopes were mostly located in areas with a relatively high altitude and moderate slope. The Luanshibao landslide, which is a typical landslide in the study area, had notable signs of displacement, where the displacement rate along the back edge of the landslide can reach 20 mm/a. An inversion method for the seasonal frozen soil area distribution was proposed based on the periodic subsidence and uplift model and time-series monitoring data; the calculated seasonal freeze-thaw amplitude exceeded 20 mm. Further analysis revealed a 2-month lag in the response of the freeze-thaw phenomenon to the air temperature. This study demonstrated that DS-InSAR offers optimal surface displacement data, which can provide an important basis to identify engineering geological hazards.

TI  - Characteristics of Glaciers Surging in the Western Pamirs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional surge patterns and control mechanisms for glaciers in the western Pamirs are unclear. Using remote sensing, more surge-type glaciers have been discovered in the western Pamirs. This provides an opportunity to obtain the integral characteristics of glacier surging. Using Sentinel-1A, TSX/TDX and Landsat remote sensing data, the changes in surface velocity, surface elevation and surface features of five glaciers that have recently surged in the western Pamirs are obtained. The results show that (1) all glacier surges initiate gradually for several years and most form a surge front in the upper region of the glacier. (2) For most glaciers, the active phase of the surge is more than 2 years, except for one that is within several months. (3) The peak velocity mostly occurs in summer and autumn, and the maximum velocity is less than 8 m d(-1). (4) There is sharp deceleration, such as the hydrologic controlled surge at the end of the surge. However, the surface flow of the transverse profiles shows no features of base sliding. Based on the comparison of surge patterns with other regions in High Mountain Asia, we conclude that the surging glaciers in the western Pamirs are triggered by thermal mechanisms under the control of sub-hydrological modulation.

TI  - Spatial Differentiation Characteristics of Rural Areas Based on Machine Learning and GIS Statistical Analysis-A Case Study of Yongtai County, Fuzhou City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of machine learning and GIS (geographic information systems) technology, it is possible to combine them to mine the knowledge rules behind massive spatial data. GIS, also known as geographic information systems, is a comprehensive discipline, which combines geography and cartography and has been widely used in different fields. It is a computer system for inputting, storing, querying, analyzing, and displaying geographic data. This paper mainly studies the spatial differentiation characteristics of rural areas based on machine learning (ML) and GIS statistical analysis. This paper studies 21 township units in Yongtai County. In this paper, ENVI remote sensing image processing software is used to carry out the geometric correction of Landsat-8 remote sensing data. ML is multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary, involving probability theory, statistics, approximation theory, convex analysis, algorithm complexity theory, and other disciplines. It is specialized in studying how computers simulate or realize human learning behavior to obtain new knowledge or skills, and reorganize existing knowledge structures to continuously improve its own performance. The purpose of using band fusion is to provide more data information for the study and improve the accuracy of land classification results. Through the extraction of evaluation elements, this paper preliminarily confirms the evaluation index object of a rural human settlement environment evaluation system from the perspective of spatial layout rationality. This paper uses a VMD-GWO-ELM-based three-stage evolutionary extreme learning machine evaluation method to simulate the model. In the same way, when the model is trained again, extra weight is given to extract the feature points to reduce the similarity. Experimental data show that GWO-SVM has good classification performance, with the cross-validation rate reaching 91.66% and the recognition rate of test samples reaching 82.41%. The results show that GIS statistics can provide a reference for environmental protection, which is conducive to land-use planning, implementation of environmental impact assessment of land-use planning, and ultimately achieving sustainable development.

TI  - Spatial Assessment of Soil Erosion Risk Using RUSLE Embedded in GIS Environment: A Case Study of Jhelum River Watershed
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The watershed area of the Mangla Reservoir spans across the Himalayan region of India and Pakistan, primarily consisting of the Jhelum River basin. The area is rugged with highly elevated, hilly terrain and relatively thin vegetation cover, which significantly increases the river's sediment output, especially during the monsoon season, leading to a decline in the reservoir's storage capacity. This work assesses the soil erosion risk in the Jhelum River watershed (Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&K), Pakistan) using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation of (RUSLE). The RUSLE components, including the conservation support or erosion control practice factor (P), soil erodibility factor (K), slope length and slope steepness factor (LS), rainfall erosivity factor (R), and crop cover factor (C), were integrated to compute soil erosion. Soil erosion risk and intensity maps were generated by computing the RUSLE parameters, which were then integrated with physical factors such as terrain units, elevation, slope, and land uses/cover to examine how these factors affect the spatial patterns of soil erosion loss. The 2021 rainfall data were utilized to compute the rainfall erosivity factor (R), and the soil erodibility (K) map was created using the world surface soil map prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The slope length and slope steepness factor (LS) were generated in the highly rough terrain using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM). The analysis revealed that the primary land use in the watershed was cultivated land, accounting for 27% of the area, and slopes of 30% or higher were present across two-thirds of the watershed. By multiplying the five variables, the study determined that the annual average soil loss was 23.47 t ha(-1) yr(-1). In areas with dense mixed forest cover, soil erosion rates ranged from 0.23 t ha(-1) yr(-1) to 25 t ha(-1) yr(-1). The findings indicated that 55.18% of the research area has a low erosion risk, 18.62% has a medium erosion risk, 13.66% has a high risk, and 11.6% has a very high erosion risk. The study's findings will provide guidelines to policy/decision makers for better management of the Mangla watershed.

AB  - Accurately clarifying the applicable spatial scale of 4-Scale model is conducive to improving the accuracy of its application in canopy reflectance simulation of different vegetation types, and to further improving the inversion accuracy of leaf area index, canopy density, and other parameters. Two forest plots (one for broad-leaved forest and one for mixed forest) with each area of 100 m*100 m in Maoershan Experimental Forest Farm, Shangzhi, Heilongjiang, were divided into the spatial scales of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 m, respectively. The 4-Scale model was used to simulate forest canopy reflectance. Local mean method, the nearest neighbor method, bilinear interpolation method, and cubic convolution method were used to convert Sentinel-2 images with spatial resolution of 10 m to other scales, with the results being evaluated. The simulated canopy reflectance and remote sensing pixel reflectance were compared and analyzed. The spatial scale of mixed forest and broad-leaved forest suitable for high-precision inversion parameters of 4-Scale model was determined. The results showed that the 4-Scale model underestimated the pixel forest canopy reflectance as a whole. The canopy reflectance of mixed forest and broad-leaved forest had the worst simulation effect at the 20 m scale. Both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error from (MAE) of red and near-infrared band were large. When the scale was >20 m, the simulation effect became better. The applicability of the model was the best when the mixed forest was 40 m and the broad-leaved forest was 30 m. The mean and standard deviation of the reflectance difference between the simulated value and the remote sensing pixel were the minimum in the red and near near-infrared bands, with the minimum RMSE and MAE. The simulation results of mixed forest and broad-leaved forest at 10 m scale were not stable, the rule of mean and standard deviation was inconsistent, and the difference between RMSE and MAE was large under the same band.

TI  - The Differences and Influence Factors in Extracting Urban Green Space from Various Resolutions of Data: The Perspective of Blocks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The appropriate resolution has been confirmed to be crucial to the extraction of urban green space and the related research on ecosystem services. However, the factors affecting the differences between various resolutions of data in certain application scenarios are lacking in attention. To fill the gap, this paper made an attempt to analyze the differences of various resolutions of data in green space extraction and to explore where the differences are reflected in the actual land unit, as well as the factors affecting the differences. Further, suggestions for reducing errors and application scenarios of different resolutions of data in related research are proposed. Taking a typical area of Nanjing as an example, data taken by DJI drone (0.1 m), GaoFen-1 (2 m) and Sentinel-2A (10 m) were selected for analysis. The results show that: (1) There were minimal differences in the green space ratio of the study area calculated by different resolutions of data on the whole, but when subdivided into each land use type and block, the differences were obvious; (2) The function, area and shape of the block, as well as the patch density and aggregation degree of the internal green space, had a certain impact on the differences. However, the specific impact varied when the block area was different; and (3) For the selection of the data source, the research purpose and application scenarios need to be comprehensively considered, including the function and attributes of the block, the distribution characteristics of green space, the allowable error limits and the budget. The present study highlighted the reasons of differences and hopefully it can provide a reference for the data selection of urban green space in the practical planning and design.

TI  - Automated Identification of Landfast Sea Ice in the Laptev Sea from the True-Color MODIS Images Using the Method of Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast sea ice (LFSI) refers to sea ice attached to the shoreline with little or no horizonal motion in contrast to drifting sea ice. The LFSI plays an important role in the Arctic marine environmental and biological systems. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately monitor the spatiotemporal changes in the LFSI distribution. Here we present an automatic LFSI retrieval method for the Laptev Sea, eastern Arctic Ocean, based on a conditional generative adversarial network Pix2Pix using the true-color images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The spatial resolution of the derived product is 1.25 km, with a temporal interval of 7 days. Compared to the manually identified data from the true-color images of MODIS, the average precision of the LFSI area derived from LFSI mapping model reaches 91.4%, with the recall reaching 98.7% and F1-score reaching 94.5%. The LFSI coverage is consistent with the traditional large-scale LFSI products, but provides more details. Intraseasonal and interannual variations in LFSI area of the Laptev Sea in spring (March-May) during the period of 2002-2021 are investigated using the new product. The spring LFSI area in this region decreases at a rate of 0.67 x 10(3) km(2) per year during this period (R-2 = 0.117, p < 0.01). According to the spatial and temporal changes, we conclude that the LFSI is becoming more stable while the area is shrinking. The method is fully-automatic and computationally efficient, which can be further applied to the entire Arctic Ocean for LFSI identification and monitoring.

TI  - Clear cell sarcoma: state-of-the art and perspectives
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - IntroductionClear cell sarcoma (CCS) is an ultrarare soft tissue sarcoma (STS) with a poor prognosis due to its propensity to metastasize and its low chemosensitivity. The standard treatment of localized CCS consists of wide surgical excision with or without additive radiotherapy. However, unresectable CCS is generally treated with conventional systemic therapies available for treatment of STS despite the weak scientific evidence to support its use.Areas coveredIn this review, we discuss the clinicopathologic characteristics of CSS, as well as the current treatment landscape and future therapeutic approaches.Expert opinionThe current treatment strategy of advanced CCSs, based on STSs regimens, shows a lack of effective options. Combination therapiesin particular, the association of immunotherapy and TKIs, represent a promising approach. Translational studies are needed in order to decipher the regulatory mechanisms involved in the oncogenesis of this ultrarare sarcoma and identify potential molecular targets.

TI  - Leaf temperatures and environmental conditions predict daily stem radial variations in a temperate coniferous forest
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hourly-resolved measurements of stem radial variations (SRVs) provide valuable insights into how climate-induced changes in hydrological regimes affect tree water status and tree stem radial growth. However, while SRVs are easily measured at the individual tree level, currently no methods are available to monitor this phenomenon across broad regions at intra-annual (daily to weekly) scales. Near-surface (in situ) thermal remote sensing-with its sensitivity to plant water status-may provide an approach for monitoring intra-annual SRVs, with the potential for scaling these approaches to the landscape level. Thus, we explored the suitability of in situ thermal remote sensing, in combination with other environmental data, to monitor SRVs in a coniferous forest of the North American Intermountain West. Specifically, we were interested in answering two main questions: Can we use in situ thermal remote sensing by itself and in combination with environmental variables (i.e., photoperiod, photosynthetically active radiation, and soil moisture) to predict (1) daily tree water status and (2) daily tree stem radial growth derived from SRVs? We used data collected by an environmental monitoring network in central Idaho over three growing seasons (2019-2021) to address these questions. Results showed that leaf temperature (T-L) in combination with environmental variables explained up to three-quarters of the SRV-based variability in daily tree water status (in the form of tree water deficit [TWD]) and approximately one-half of the variability in daily stem radial growth. The time of day when T-L was acquired also appeared to change the strength, shape, and predictive power of the models, with acquisition times in the morning and evening showing stronger relationships with daily SRVs than other times of the day. Overall, these results highlight the promise of utilizing thermal remote sensing data to derive tree hydrological and growth status, and reveal key considerations (e.g., the time of data acquisition) for future observational and modeling efforts. This study also provides a benchmark against which to compare future efforts to test these observed relationships at coarser spatial scales.

TI  - URBAN HEAT HAZARD MODEL BASED ON LOCAL CLIMATE ZONES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat hazard is the temperature in an urban area of more than 30oC and impacts humans. The local climate zone (LCZ) is based on the composition of developed and vegetated areas and represents air surface temperature (AST) and Land Surface Temperature (LST). The study aims to develop an urban heat hazard model based on LCZ. The study used high-resolution multi-spectral imagery. The spatial analysis uses the green open area, land cover change, LST, and AST ground through a survey. Those all used to develop LCZ. Based on the thermal band Landsat Imagery, the LCZ developed 1.000 x1.000 meters. The result found that the land cover change affected the temperature rise + 3oC. The second was found adequate in the previous study that vegetation-covered is the lowest temperature, both AST and LST, with temperatures>32oC. The third is due to Vegetation Cover from Land Cover, LST, and AST was generated model spatial of LCZ. The LCZ is divided into five classes based on the percentage of vegetation cover, with the majority of LCZ 4 as vegetation covering only 20%. Based on the Universal Thermal Climate Index and Effective Temperature Index to generate the Urban Heat Hazard (UHH) model spatial based on LCZ. The UHH value with high hazard regarding the temperature> 35oC. This study concluded that LCZ determines the UHH in the area regarding urban heat signature (AST and LST). The UHH affects the environment with AST >32oC and will impact a human with head headache, more sweat, and heatstroke.

TI  - Air Pollution Patterns Mapping of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO Derived from TROPOMI over Central-East Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of changes in the level of air pollution concentration allows for the control of air quality and its compliance with the normative requirements. Currently, every country in Europe implements air quality monitoring. However, during emergencies in areas that are often difficult to monitor, the only source of information is geospatial data obtained by means of Earth observation techniques. The aims of this study were to estimate the amounts of pollutant concentrations and develop a pattern of spatiotemporal changes in Central and Eastern Europe in Poland and Ukraine. Due to the ongoing military operations in Ukraine, it is an area that is difficult to access. Pollution from industrial facilities, fires, collapsed buildings, and the use of explosive weapons poses a threat to air quality. Additionally, the impact of war on air pollution concentration levels remains unclear. This work characterized the changes in the distribution of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide concentrations in 2018-2022 in local zones in both countries. Publicly available TROPOMI-S5 satellite data were used for this study, which were compared with measurements from ground stations in Poland. It has been estimated that the concentration of NO2 (+0.67 +/- 0.47 mu mol/m(2)) in Poland has increased and the level of SO2 and CO have decreased in both studied areas: in Poland (-161.67 +/- 5.48 mu mol/m(2), -470.85 +/- 82.81 mu mol/m(2)) and in Ukraine (-32.56 +/- 23.51 mu mol/m(2), -438.04 +/- 80.76 mu mol/m(2)). The concentration of NO2 in Ukraine has decreased by -0.28 +/- 0.21 mu mol/m(2).

TI  - Above- and Belowground Biomass Carbon Stock and Net Primary Productivity Maps for Tidal Herbaceous Marshes of the United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessments of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration in natural ecosystems are necessary to develop climate mitigation strategies. Regional and national-level assessments of carbon sequestration require high-resolution data to be available for large areas, increasing the need for remote sensing products that quantify carbon stocks and fluxes. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides guidelines on how to quantify carbon flux using land cover land change and biomass carbon stock information. Net primary productivity (NPP), carbon uptake, and storage in vegetation, can also be used to model net carbon sequestration and net carbon export from an ecosystem (net ecosystem carbon balance). While biomass and NPP map products for terrestrial ecosystems are available, there are currently no conterminous United States (CONUS) biomass carbon stock or NPP maps for tidal herbaceous marshes. In this study, we used peak soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) values, derived from Landsat 8 composites, and five other vegetation indices, plus a categorical variable for the CONUS region (Pacific Northwest, California, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic-Gulf, or Everglades), to model spatially explicit aboveground peak biomass stocks in tidal marshes (i.e., tidal palustrine and estuarine herbaceous marshes) for the first time. Tidal marsh carbon conversion factors, root-to-shoot ratios, and vegetation turnover rates, were compiled from the literature and used to convert peak aboveground biomass to peak total (above- and belowground) biomass and NPP. An extensive literature search for aboveground turnover rates produced sparse and variable values; therefore, we used an informed assumption of a turnover rate of one crop per year for all CONUS tidal marshes. Due to the lack of turnover rate data, the NPP map is identical to the peak biomass carbon stock map. In reality, it is probable that turnover rate varies by region, given seasonal length differences; however, the NPP map provides the best available information on spatially explicit CONUS tidal marsh NPP. This study identifies gaps in the scientific knowledge, to support future studies in addressing this lack of turnover data. Across CONUS, average total peak biomass carbon stock in tidal marshes was 848 g C m(-2) (871 g C m(-2) in palustrine and 838 g C m(-2) in estuarine marshes), and based on a median biomass turnover rate of 1, it is expected that the mean NPP annual flux for tidal marshes is similar (e.g., 848 g C m(-2) y(-1)). Peak biomass carbon stocks in tidal marshes were lowest in the Florida Everglades region and highest in the California regions. These are the first fine-scale national maps of biomass carbon and NPP for tidal wetlands, spanning all of CONUS. These estimates of CONUS total peak biomass carbon stocks and NPP rates for tidal marshes can support regional- and national-scale assessments of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as natural resource management of coastal wetlands, as part of nature-based climate solution efforts.

TI  - A Target-Based Non-Uniformity Self-Correction Method for Infrared Push-Broom Hyperspectral Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-uniformity in the response of spectral image elements is an inevitable phenomenon in hyperspectral imaging, which mainly manifests itself as the presence of band noise in the acquired hyperspectral data. This problem is prominent in the infrared band owing to the detector material, operating environment, and other factors. Non-uniformity is an important factor that can affect the quality of the hyperspectral data, which has a serious impact on both data analysis and applications and requires corrections via technical means wherever possible. This paper proposes a novel target-based non-uniformity self-correction method for infrared push-broom hyperspectral images. The Mars Mineralogical Spectrometer (MMS) onboard the Tianwen-1 orbiter was used as the research and application object. The model is constructed and applied to the target scene characteristics and detection patterns of Mars remote sensing exploration, which are combined with the causes of noise generation in the infrared spectral image bands. The design of the MMS dual-channel Visible-Near-Infrared (V-NIR) and Near-Mid-Infrared (N-MIR) co-field of view co-target detection and laboratory calibration data for the V-NIR spectral band can achieve non-uniformity corrections (NUCs). Therefore, for the MMS in-orbit Mars exploration mission, the method selected spectral data (920-1055 nm) characterized by a reduced atmospheric influence to iteratively obtain the homogeneous region, which was used to calculate the non-uniformity correction factor for the N-MIR spectral band. This method was compared, validated, and evaluated with other conventional methods using both laboratory and in-orbit hyperspectral data. The results showed that the experimental data corrections were comparable to laboratory calibrations, with a maximum relative deviation of <2.6%. These results prove that our method not only provides an excellent non-uniformity correction, but also ensures spectral fidelity. It can thus be used as a non-uniformity correction process for the MMS and similar hyperspectral imagers.

TI  - Urban Impervious Surface Extraction Based on Deep Convolutional Networks Using Intensity, Polarimetric Scattering and Interferometric Coherence Information from Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban impervious surface area is a key indicator for measuring the degree of urban development and the quality of an urban ecological environment. However, optical satellites struggle to effectively play a monitoring role in the tropical and subtropical regions, where there are many clouds and rain all year round. As an active microwave sensor, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has a long wavelength and can penetrate clouds and fog to varying degrees, making it very suitable for monitoring the impervious surface in such areas. With the development of SAR remote sensing technology, a more advanced and more complex SAR imaging model, namely, polarimetric SAR, has been developed, which can provide more scattering information of ground objects and is conducive to improving the extraction accuracy of impervious surface. However, the current research on impervious surface extraction using SAR data mainly focuses on the use of SAR image intensity or amplitude information, and rarely on the use of phase and polarization information. To bridge this gap, based on Sentinel-1 dual-polarized data, we selected UNet, HRNet, and Deeplabv3+ as impervious surface extraction models; and we input the intensity, coherence, and polarization features of SAR images into the respective impervious surface extraction models to discuss their specific performances in urban impervious surface extraction. The experimental results show that among the intensity, coherence, and polarization features, intensity is the most useful feature in the extraction of urban impervious surface based on SAR images. We also analyzed the limitations of extracting an urban impervious surface based on SAR images, and give a simple and effective solution. This study can provide an effective solution for the spatial-temporal seamless monitoring of an impervious surface in cloudy and rainy areas.

TI  - Multi-Remote Sensing Data Analysis for Identifying the Impact of Human Activities on Water-Related Ecosystem Services in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem service (ES) is the basis for human lives, and is also one of the criteria for evaluating environmental conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how human activities would affect the ESs under the rapid urbanization and social-economic development phenomena. This study selected four vital important water-related ESs, including the water yield, soil retention, water purification, and net primary productivity (NPP), to detect how the structure and function of ecosystems had changed in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) from 1999-2018, by applying multi-remote sensing methods. The results show that: though the YREB has experienced rapid urbanization during the study period, the integrated ecosystem services value (ESV) did not present a significant change trend, and the average integrated (ESV) is 5.06 x 10(12) yuan. The 20-year average water yield, soil retention, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and NPP of the YREB are 1.378 x 10(12) m(3); 6.35 x 10(10) t, 2.92 x 10(5) t, 6.89 x 10(4) t, 1.55 x 10(15) gC, respectively. Most provinces and cities present a weak negative correlation between human activities and the integrated ESV, while human activities show more than 50% attribution weights on ESV change, especially in three urban agglomeration areas. Moreover, the NPP has been found not to be mainly affected by human activities, which may stress the irreplaceable effects of climate change and other environmental protection actions. These findings emphasize that it is crucial to regulate human activities to guarantee ecosystem health and ESs in the future.

TI  - Effects of Wind Wave Spectra, Non-Gaussianity, and Swell on the Prediction of Ocean Microwave Backscatter with Facet Two-Scale Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The image intensity of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is closely related to the facet scattering distribution. In this paper, the effects of wind wave spectra, non-Gaussianity of the sea surface, and swell on the distribution of the facet normalized radar cross section (NRCS) simulated by the facet two-scale model (TSM) are analyzed by comparing the simulated results with the Sentinel-1 SAR data, the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data, and the geophysical model function (GMF) at the wind speed range of 3-16 m/s, the wind direction range of 0 degrees-360 degrees, and the incidence angle range of 30 degrees-50 degrees under VV and HH polarizations. The results show that the Apel spectrum achieves a more consistent mean NRCS and NRCS distribution with the reference data at low incidence angles, while the composite spectra perform better at high incidence angles under VV polarization. Under HH polarization, the Apel spectrum always has a better performance. The upwind-downwind asymmetry of backscattering can be predicted well by the modified TSM, which is constructed by incorporating bispectrum correction into the conventional TSM. The distribution of the scattering simulated by the modified TSM deviates from the Gaussian distribution significantly, which is in good agreement with the Sentinel-1 data. Additionally, the introduction of swell widens the spread of the NRCS distribution, and the fluctuation range of the NRCS profile considering swell is larger than that without swell. All these changes caused by the introduction of swell make the distribution of the facet scattering more consistent with the Sentinel-1 data. Moreover, the scattering image patterns and scattering image spectrum of the Sentinel-1 data can be successfully simulated at various sea states with the consideration of swell.

TI  - How to Systematically Evaluate the Greenspace Exposure of Residential Communities? A 3-D Novel Perspective Using UAV Photogrammetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantity and quality of green space (GS) exposure play an important role in urban residents' physical and psychological health. However, the current framework for assessing GS quality is primarily based on 2-D remote sensing data and 2.5-D street-view images. Few studies have comprehensively evaluated residential community GSs from an overall 3-D perspective. This study proposes a novel systematic framework for evaluating the quantity and quality of residential GSs based on the generation of a high-resolution 3-D point cloud using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP). Nine indices were proposed: green volume ratio, floor green volume index, green groups diversity index, vegetation diversity index, greenspace fragmentation, average vegetation colour distance, vegetation colour diversity, activity areas ratio, and green cohesion index of activity site. These metrics were calculated using the classified point clouds from four typical Chinese residential communities with different residential greenery types and population densities. The results showed that our method could quantitatively identify the differences in residential GS exposure within urban residential communities. For example, a residential community with a large plant distribution and rich greenery variations had higher greenspace volume ratio and vegetation diversity index values. Our findings suggest that this novel framework, employing cost-effective UAV-DAP, can clearly describe different GS attributes and characteristics, aiding decision-makers and urban planners in comprehensively implementing GS interventions to improve the residents' quality of life.

TI  - Performance of a Hybrid Gain Ensemble Data Assimilation Scheme in Tropical Cyclone Forecasting with the GRAPES Model
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hybrid data assimilation (DA) methods have received extensive attention in the field of numerical weather prediction. In this study, a hybrid gain data assimilation (HGDA) method that combined the gain matrices of ensemble and variational methods was first applied in the mesoscale version of the Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES_Meso). To evaluate the performance of the HGDA method in the GRAPES_Meso model, different DA schemes, including the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR), local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF), and HGDA schemes, were compared across eight tropical cyclone (TC) cases, and FY-4A atmospheric motion vectors were assimilated. The results indicated that the HYBRID scheme outperformed the 3DVAR and LETKF schemes in TC position forecasting, and with ensemble forecasting techniques, the HYBRID scheme promoted the accuracy of the prediction TC intensity. The threat score (TS) values for the light and medium precipitation forecasts obtained in the HYBRID experiment were higher than those for the forecasts obtained in the 3DVAR and LETKF experiments, which may be attributed to the forecasting accuracy for the TC position. Regarding heavy and extreme rainfall, the HYBRID scheme achieved a more stable effect than those of the 3DVAR and LETKF schemes. The results demonstrated the superiority of the HGDA scheme in TC prediction with the GRAPES_Meso model.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variations of forest and grassland phenology in the Yellow River Basin during 2000-2018.
T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The study of vegetation phenology is of great significance for understanding global climate change. The Yellow River basin has a wide spatial range and a complex ecological environment. The phenological characteristics of forest and grassland need further clarification. Based on the MODIS-EVI data from 2000 to 2018, we extracted the phenology of forest and grassland in the Yellow River basin using piecewise logistic and double logistic phenological models with the corresponding curvature change extremum method and derivative method, respectively. The temporal and spatial variations of phenological parameters were analyzed. The start of growing season (SOS) was at 90-165 day of year (DOY), and gradually delayed from southeast to northwest. The increase of 100 m elevation delayed SOS 0.94 d, and the SOS of forest was earlier than that of grassland. The end of growing season (EOS) was at 270-315 DOY, which delayed from west to southeast. For every 100 m increase in altitude, the EOS advanced 0.63 d, with EOS of forest being later than that of grassland. The length of growing season (LOS) was 110-230 d, which shortened gradually from southeast to northwest. The LOS of forest was larger than that of grassland. During the study, SOS showed an advance trend from 2000 to 2018 with a rate of 4.1 d·(10 a)-1, and the proportion of spatial advance area was 73.2%. There was an obvious advance in the central part of the basin. EOS generally showed a significant postponement trend with a rate of 2.3 d·(10 a)-1, and the proportion of spatially delayed area was 63.4%, the phenological advance and delay of forest was less stronger than that of grassland. LOS showed a significant prolongation trend with a rate of 6.4 d·(10 a)-1, and the proportion of spatial extension was 71.8%. The piecewise Logistic and double Logistic phenological models and the corresponding curvature extremum method and derivative method were suitable for the extraction of natural vegetation in the Yellow River Basin. The overall LOS of forest and grassland showed a prolonging trend, which was shortened with the increases of altitude. The LOS of forest was longer than that of grassland in the study area.
AB  - 植被物候研究对了解全球气候变化特征具有重要意义。黄河流域空间跨度大、生态环境复杂,林草植被的物候变化特征有待进一步明确。本研究基于20002018年MODIS-EVI数据,采用分段Logistic和双Logistic物候模型及分别对应的曲率变化极值法和导数法对黄河流域林、草植被物候进行反演,分析物候参数的时间变化和空间差异。结果表明: 研究区生长季开始期(SOS)在第90～165天,从东南到西北逐渐推迟,海拔每升高100 m,SOS推迟0.94 d,其中,森林SOS早于草地。生长季结束期(EOS)在第270～315天,从西向东南推迟,海拔每升高100 m,EOS提前0.63 d,其中,森林EOS晚于草地。生长季长度(LOS)为110～230 d,从东南向西北逐渐缩短,森林植被的LOS大于草地。研究期间,SOS呈提前趋势,幅度为4.1 d·(10 a)-1,空间上提前面积比例为73.2%,流域中部地区提前幅度较大;EOS整体呈显著推迟趋势,幅度为2.3 d·(10 a)-1,空间上推迟面积比例为63.4%,森林物候期提前和延迟都小于草地;LOS呈显著延长趋势,幅度为6.4 d·(10 a)-1,空间上延长比例为71.8%。分段Logistic和双Logistic物候模型以及相应的曲率极值法和导数法适用于提取黄河流域自然植被物候。研究区森林和草地LOS整体呈延长趋势,随海拔升高而缩短,且森林LOS长于草地。.

TI  - Slow Deformation Time-Series Monitoring for Urban Areas Based on the AWHPSPO Algorithm and TELM: A Case Study of Changsha, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Health monitoring is important for densely distributed urban infrastructures, particularly in cities undergoing rapid economic progress. Permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is an advanced remote sensing observation technique that is commonly used in urban infrastructure monitoring. However, the rapid construction of infrastructures may easily cause a loss of coherence for radar interferometry, inducing a low density of effective permanent scatterer (PS) points, which is the main limitation of PSI. In order to address these problems, a novel time-series synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) process based on the adaptive window homogeneous pixel selection and phase optimization (AWHPSPO) algorithm and thermal expansion linear model (TELM) is proposed. Firstly, for homogeneous point selection, information on both the time-series intensity and deformation phases is considered, which can compensate for the defects of insufficient homogeneous samples and low phase quality in traditional distributed scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DS-InSAR) processing. Secondly, the physical, thermal expansion component, which reflects the material properties of the infrastructures, is introduced into the traditional linear model, which can more rationally reflect the temporal evolution of deformation variation, and the thermal expansion coefficients can be estimated simultaneously with the deformation parameters. In order to verify our proposed algorithm, the Orange Island area in Changsha City, China, was selected as the study area in this experiment. Three years of its historical time-series deformation fields and thermal expansion coefficients were regenerated. With the use of high-resolution TerraSAR-X radar satellite images, a maximum accumulated settlement of 12.3 mm and a minor uplift of 8.2 mm were detected. Crossvalidation with small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) results using Sentinel 1A data proved the reliability of AWHPSPO. The proposed algorithm can provide a reference for the control of the health and safety of urban infrastructures.

TI  - SVM-Based Sea Ice Extent Retrieval Using Multisource Scatterometer Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to explore the joint usage of multisource scatterometer measurements in polar sea water and ice discrimination. All radar backscatter measurements from current operating satellite scatterometers are considered, including the C-band ASCAT scatterometer on board the MetOp series satellites, the Ku-band scatterometer on board the HY-2B satellite (HSCAT), and the Ku-band scatterometer on board the CFOSAT satellite (CSCAT). By performing seven experiments that use the same support vector machine (SVM) classifier method but with different input data, we find that the SVM model with all available HSCAT, CSCAT, and ASCAT scatterometer data as inputs gives the best performance. In addition to the SVM outputs, we employ the image erosion/dilation techniques and area growth method to reduce misclassifications of sea water and ice. The sea ice extent obtained in this study shows a good agreement with the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) sea ice concentration data from the years 2019 to 2021. More specifically, the sea ice areas are closer to the sea ice areas calculated using 15% as the threshold for NSIDC sea ice concentration data in both Arctic and Antarctic. The sea ice edges acquired by the multisource scatterometer show a close correlation with sea ice edges from the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. In addition, we found that the coverage of multisource scatterometer data in a half-day is usually above 97%, and more importantly, the sea ice areas obtained on the basis of half-day and daily multisource scatterometer data are very close to each other. The presented work can serve as guidance on the usage of all available scatterometer measurements in sea ice monitoring.

TI  - Downscaling and Merging of Daily Scale Satellite Precipitation Data in the Three River Headwaters Region Fused with Cloud Attributes and Rain Gauge Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex terrain, the sparse distribution of rain gauges, and the poor resolution and quality of satellite data in remote areas severely restrict the development of watershed hydrological modeling, meteorology, and ecological research. In this study, based on the relationship between cloud optical and physical properties and precipitation, a daily geographically weighted regression (GWR) precipitation downscaling model was constructed for the Three Rivers Source region, China, for the period from 2010 to 2014. The GWR precipitation downscaling model combined three different satellite precipitation datasets (CMORPH, IMERG, and ERA5) which were downscaled from a coarse resolution (0.25 degrees and 0.1 degrees) to a fine resolution (1 km). At the same time, the preliminary downscaling results were calibrated and verified by employing the geographic difference analysis (GDA) and geographic ratio analysis (GRA) methods combined with rainfall data. Finally, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the entropy weight method (EW) were adopted to fuse the three downscaled and calibrated satellite precipitation datasets into the merged satellite precipitation dataset (MSP), which provides a higher quality of data (CC = 0.790, RMSE = 2.189 mm/day, and BIAS = 0.142 mm). In summary, the downscaling calibration and precipitation fusion scheme proposed in this study is suitable for obtaining high-resolution daily precipitation data in the Three Rivers Source region with a complex climate and topography.

TI  - Evaluation and Comparison of Semantic Segmentation Networks for Rice Identification Based on Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and accurate rice identification based on high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing imagery is essential for achieving precision agriculture and ensuring food security. Semantic segmentation networks in deep learning are an effective solution for crop identification, and they are mainly based on two architectures: the commonly used convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and the novel Vision Transformer architecture. Research on crop identification from remote sensing imagery using Vision Transformer has only emerged in recent times, mostly in sub-meter resolution or even higher resolution imagery. Sub-meter resolution images are not suitable for large scale crop identification as they are difficult to obtain. Therefore, studying and analyzing the differences between Vision Transformer and CNN in crop identification in the meter resolution images can validate the generalizability of Vision Transformer and provide new ideas for model selection in crop identification research at large scale. This paper compares the performance of two representative CNN networks (U-Net and DeepLab v3) and a novel Vision Transformer network (Swin Transformer) on rice identification in Sentinel-2 of 10 m resolution. The results show that the three networks have different characteristics: (1) Swin Transformer has the highest rice identification accuracy and good farmland boundary segmentation ability. Although Swin Transformer has the largest number of model parameters, the training time is shorter than DeepLab v3, indicating that Swin Transformer has good computational efficiency. (2) DeepLab v3 also has good accuracy in rice identification. However, the boundaries of the rice fields identified by DeepLab v3 tend to shift towards the upper left corner. (3) U-Net takes the shortest time for both training and prediction and is able to segment the farmland boundaries accurately for correctly identified rice fields. However, U-Net's accuracy of rice identification is lowest, and rice is easily confused with soybean, corn, sweet potato and cotton in the prediction. The results reveal that the Vision Transformer network has great potential for identifying crops at the country or even global scale.

TI  - Object-Oriented Crop Classification Using Time Series Sentinel Images from Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The resulting maps of land use classification obtained by pixel-based methods often have salt-and-pepper noise, which usually shows a certain degree of cluttered distribution of classification image elements within the region. This paper carries out a study on crop classification and identification based on time series Sentinel images and object-oriented methods and takes the crop recognition and classification of the National Modern Agricultural Industrial Park in Jalaid Banner, Inner Mongolia, as the research object. It uses the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to extract time series Sentinel satellite radar and optical remote sensing images combined with simple noniterative clustering (SNIC) multiscale segmentation with random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms to classify and identify major regional crops based on radar and spectral features. Compared with the pixel-based method, the combination of SNIC multiscale segmentation and random forest classification based on time series radar and optical remote sensing images can effectively reduce the salt-and-pepper phenomenon in classification and improve crop classification accuracy with the highest accuracy of 98.66 and a kappa coefficient of 0.9823. This study provides a reference for large-scale crop identification and classification work.

TI  - Characteristics of NDVI Changes in the Altay Region from 1981 to 2018 and Their Relationship to Climatic Factors
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation growth and its response to climatic factors have become one of the most pressing issues in ecological research. However, no consensus has yet been reached on how to resolve this problem in arid areas with a high-elevation gradient and complex underlying surface. Here, NOAA CDR AVHRR NDVI V5 for 1981-2018 and China's regional surface meteorological faction-driven datasets were used. General linear regression, the Mann-Kendall test and sliding t-test, Pearson correlations, and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), on a grid-scale, were applied to analyze the annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and its relationship with temperature and precipitation in the Altay region. Results revealed that the temporal trend of NDVI for most grid cells was non-significant. However, mountains, coniferous forests, grasslands, and meadows in the high-elevation zone displayed a slow increasing trend in NDVI. Further, NDVI was positively correlated with the mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation, the latter playing a more significant role. Yet, for desert and shrub vegetation and coniferous forest, their NDVI had insignificant negative correlations with the mean annual temperature. Hence, both the trends and drivers of NDVI of high elevation are highly complex. This study's findings provide a reference for research on vegetation responses to climate change in arid areas having a high-elevation gradients and complex underlying surfaces.

TI  - Optimal Time Phase Identification for Apple Orchard Land Recognition and Spatial Analysis Using Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Images and Random Forest Classification
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The significance of identifying apple orchard land and monitoring its spatial distribution patterns is increasing for precise yield prediction and agricultural sustainable development. This study strived to identify the optimal time phase to efficiently extract apple orchard land and monitor its spatial characteristics based on the random forest (RF) classification method and multitemporal Sentinel-2 images. Firstly, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), and Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) between apple orchard land and other green vegetation (other orchards, forest and grassland) during the growing stage were calculated and compared to identify the optimal time phase for apple orchard land extraction; the RF classifier was then constructed using multifeature variables on Google Earth Engine to efficiently identify apple orchard land, and the support vector machine (SVM) classification results were used as a comparison; GIS spatial analysis, a slope calculation model, and Moran's I and Getis-Ord GI* analysis were employed to further analyze the spatial patterns of the apple orchard land. The results found the following: (1) April, May, and October were the optimal time phases for apple orchard identification. (2) The RF-based method combining coefficients of indexes, the grayscale co-occurrence matrix, and 70% of the ground reference data can precisely classify apple orchards with an overall accuracy of 90% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.88, increasing by 9.2% and 11.4% compared to those using the SVM. (3) The total area of apple orchard land in the study area was 485.8 km(2), which is 0.6% less than the government's statistical results. More than half (55.7%) of the apple orchard land was distributed on the gentle slope (Grade II, 6-15 degrees) and the flat slope (Grade I, 0-5 degrees); SiKou, Songshan, and Shewopo contained more than 50% of the total orchard land area. (4) The distribution of apple orchard land has a positive spatial autocorrelation (0.309, p = 0.000). High-High cluster types occurred mainly in Sikou (60%), High-Low clusters in Songshan (40%), Low-High clusters in Sikou (47.5%), and Low-Low clusters in Taocun and Tingkou (37.4%). The distribution patterns of cold and hot spots converged with those of the Local Moran Index computation results. The findings of this study can provide theoretical and methodological references for orchard land identification and spatial analysis.

TI  - VEDAM: Urban Vegetation Extraction Based on Deep Attention Model from High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of satellite and internet of things (IoT) technology, it becomes more and more convenient to acquire high-resolution satellite images from the ground. Extraction of urban vegetation from high-resolution satellite images can provide valuable suggestions for the decision-making of urban management. At present, deep-learning semantic segmentation has become an important method for vegetation extraction. However, due to the poor representation of context and spatial information, the effect of segmentation is not accurate. Thus, vegetation extraction based on Deep Attention Model (VEDAM) is proposed to enhance the context and spatial information representation ability in the scenario of vegetation extraction from satellite images. Specifically, continuous convolutions are used for feature extraction, and atrous convolutions are introduced to obtain more multi-scale context information. Then the extracted features are enhanced by the Spatial Attention Module (SAM) and the atrous spatial pyramid convolution functions. In addition, image-level feature obtained by image pooling encoding global context further improves the overall performance. Experiments are conducted on real datasets Gaofen Image Dataset (GID). From the comparative experimental results, it is concluded that VEDAM achieves the best mIoU (mIoU = 0.9136) of vegetation semantic segmentation.

TI  - Radiometric and Polarimetric Quality Validation of Gaofen-3 over a Five-Year Operation Period
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-3 was the first Chinese civilian C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, launched in August 2016. The need for monitoring the satellite's image quality has been boosted by its widespread applications in various fields. The efficient and scientific assessment of the system's radiometric and polarimetric performance has been essential in its more than five years of service. The authors collected 90 images of the Inner Mongolia calibration site, 888 images of the Amazon rainforest, and 39,929 images of the Chinese mainland from 2017 to 2021. This was achieved whilst covering the leading imaging modes, such as the spotlight mode, stripmap mode, ultra-fine mode, wave imaging mode, etc. In this study, we derive a framework that incorporates the man-made corner reflectors (CRs) in Mongolia, the traditional Amazon rainforest datasets, and even the long-strip data in the Chinese mainland (known as CRAS) for the purposes of GaoFen-3 radiometric quality analysis and polarimetric validation over its five years of operation. Polarimetric calibration without recourse to the CRs is utilized to measure the polarimetric distortions regardless of the region, and thus requires a higher calibration accuracy for the GaoFen-3 polarimetric monitoring task. Consequently, the modified Quegan method is developed by relaxing the target azimuth symmetry constraint with the Amazon forest datasets. The experiments based on the CRAS demonstrate that the main radiometric characteristics could reach the international level, with an estimated noise-equivalent sigma zero of approximately -30 dB, a radiometric resolution that is better than 2.9 dB, and a single-imagery relative radiation accuracy that is better than 0.51 dB. For polarimetric validation, the modified Quegan method was utilized to measure the crosstalk for quad-pol products to ensure that it was than -40 dB. Meanwhile, non-negligible channel imbalance errors were found in the QPSII and WAV modes, and they were effectively well-calibrated with strip estimators to satisfy the system design.

TI  - Fusion of Landsat 8 Operational LandImager and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager for hourly monitoring surface morphology of lake ice with high resolution in Chagan Lake of Northeast China
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface morphology of lake ice remarkably changes under the combined influence of thermal and me-chanical forces. However, research on the surface morphol-ogy of lake ice and its interaction with climate is scarce. A large-scale linear structure has repeatedly appeared on satel-lite images of Chagan Lake in recent years. The Geostation-ary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), with a 1 h revisit, and Land-sat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), with a spatial resolu-tion of 30 m, provide the possibility for the study of hourly changes in the large-scale linear structure. We merged the Landsat and GOCI images, using an Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), and extracted the lengths and angles of the linear structure. We monitored the hourly changes in the surface morphol-ogy during the cold season from 2018 to 2019. The average length of the linear structure in the completely frozen period was 21141.57 +/- 68.36 m. The average azimuth angle was 335.48 +/- 0.23?, nearly perpendicular to the domain wind in winter. Through two field investigations during the two re-cent cold seasons, we verified the linear structure as being ice fractures and ridges. The evolution of surface morphology is closely associated with air temperature, wind, and shoreline geometry.

TI  - A large forage gap in forage availability in traditional pastoral regions in China
T2  - FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forage supply has been stressed due to the rapid increase in China's livestock consumption. However, the long-term dynamics of the relationships between forage demand and multi-sourced supply are not understood. Here, we examine the annual forage demand, or practical carrying capacity (PCC), and supply, or theoretical carrying capacity (TCC) from 2000 to 2019 in China. We construct a forage supply-demand index (FSDI) to represent the forage supply pressure using MODIS-derived net primary productivity products and provincial statistical datasets, and we consider two scenarios. First, natural grasslands are the sole source of forage. Second, natural grassland forage supply is supplemented with straw crops. We find an increase in PCC in northwestern China's major pastoral and agropastoral provincial regions, including Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai, at rate of 0.24-3.59 million sheep units (SU) a year. As the primary source of forage, the theoretical carrying capacity of natural grasslands (TCCgrass) expanded at a rate of 3 million SU/yr nationally. Crop straws fed 126.58 million SU nationally in 2019, which accounted for 11.3% of the total practical carrying capacity and alleviated the forage supply pressure by reducing FSDI by 26.56%. During 2000-2019, the theoretical carrying capacity of straw crops (TCC crop) increased rapidly from 76.5 million SU to 126.6 million SU, which accounted for 10%-15% of the total forage supply at the national scale. We also discovered large carrying capacity gaps (TCCgap) in the northwestern pastoral provincial regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, and some agricultural provinces such as Shandong and Henan, when we considered forage supply from both natural grasslands and straw crops. Our findings showed a large forage gap in the traditional pastoral regions, and we also discussed green fodder as a potential solution for balancing the supply of and demand for forage, which may shed light on crop and forage planning.

TI  - Waveform retracking method of Sentinel-3 altimetry data in lake and reservoir areas Taking Dongping Lake and Xiashan Reservoir as examples
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry is an important tool for monitoring the changes of inland water level. However, there exists a certain gap between the water level extracted by this technology and that recorded by in-situ gauge stations. Waveform retracking is a key technology to improve the accuracy of satellite altimetry. Among the existing retracking methods, the Improved Threshold Retracker (ITR) has been widely used for its simple calculation and high accuracy. However, ITR also has some limitations because it needs external information as reference. To overcome this difficulty, this study optimizes ITR. With the fact that the water surface of lakes and reservoirs is approximately horizontal, the optimized ITR can automatically determine the correct water level from the water levels corresponding to multiple subwaveforms without relying on external information. For Dongping Lake and Xiashan Reservoir, we compare the accuracy of water level extraction by the optimized ITR, Multiple Waveform Persistent Peak retracker (MWaPP), and Offset Centre of Gravity retracker (OCOG) based on Sentinel-3A/B synthetic aperture radar altimeter observation data. The results show that the optimized ITR has the highest accuracy, with the average root mean squared errors of 6. 5 cm, increasing by 2. 7 cm and 24. 2 cm respectively compared with MWaPP and OCOG. Meanwhile, the optimized ITR, with higher success rate and stable performance, is affected least by the hooking effect and the results extracted contain hardly any outlier. It can accurately and reliably extract the lake and reservoir water level, which will contribute to the accurate monitoring of lakes and reservoirs.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use Change in the N'ZI Watershed of Cote d'Ivoire Using Landsat Satellite Images
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncontrolled population growth and strong industrialization are enormous pressures on natural resources. To monitor land use changes in the N'ZI watershed, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) were used from three satellite images: Landsat 4 and 5 (1986), Landsat 7 (2000), and Landsat 8 (2020). The method of supervised classification and calculation of spectral indices was used in this work. The results of the analysis identified six land use classes that changed over the 1986-2000, 2000-2020, and 1986-2020 periods. Water surfaces showed a decrease from -64.95% to -52.47% over the period (2000-2020 and 1986-2020). The forest class showed an average decrease of -86.93%. The savannah class had a reduction of -3.97% and the agricultural class of -9.30% between 1986 and 2020. All this desertification has been to the advantage of the great increase of dwellings-bare soil of 373.63% and of the weakly covered grounds of 10.60%. These results allowed the detection of different spatial and temporal changes in the N'ZI watershed, creating an awareness to control land occupancy.

TI  - HexTile: A Hexagonal DGGS-Based Map Tile Algorithm for Visualizing Big Remote Sensing Data in Spark
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of the era of big remote sensing data has transformed traditional data management and analysis models, among which visualization analysis has gradually become an effective method, and map tiles for remote sensing data have always played an important role. However, in high-latitude regions, especially in polar regions, the deformation caused by map projection still exists, which lowers the accuracy of global or large-scale visual analysis, as well as the execution efficiency of big data. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an algorithm called HexTile, which uses a hexagonal discrete global grid system (DGGS) model to effectively avoid problems caused by map projection and ensure global consistency. At the same time, the algorithm was implemented based on the Spark platform, which also has advantages in efficiency. Based on the DGGS model, hierarchical hexagon map tile construction and a visualization algorithm were designed, including hexagonal slicing, merging, and stitching. The above algorithms were parallelized in Spark to improve the big data execution efficiency. Experiments were carried out with Landsat-8, and the results show that the HexTile algorithm can not only guarantee the quality of global data, but also give full play to the advantages of the cluster in terms of efficiency. Additionally, the visualization was conducted with Cesium and OpenLayers to validate the integration and completeness of hexagon tiles. The scheme proposed in this paper could provide a reference for spatiotemporal big data visualization technology.

TI  - Distribution, Transport, and Impact on Air Quality of Two Typical Dust Events in China in 2021
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dust event from 12 January to 17 January 2021 ("1.12 event") is the first dust process in 2021 and the earliest dust event in the last two decades. The dust event from 14 to 18 March 2021 ("3.15 event") was the strongest dust storm in the past decade. Distribution, transport, and impact on urban air quality of these two typical dust events were studied using multi-source satellite data, a HYSPLIT trajectory model, and a 3D concentration-weighted trajectory model. Results show that both dust events affected a wide range of areas, covering Northwest, North, Northeast, East, and Central-South China. A strong dust belt spanning Northwest, North, and Northeast China was formed in northern China on 15 March 2021. The distribution heights of the 1.12 and 3.15 events were 0-5 km and 0-10 km, respectively. Dust from western Inner Mongolia and southern Mongolia dominated the 1.12 event, while dust from southern Mongolia dominated the 3.15 event. Both of these dust sources had eastward and southeastward transport paths. The majority of the dust was near-ground in downstream cities from an altitude of 0-3 km. Most cities were affected by the dust backflow. The 1.12 event generated more severe particulate pollution in southern China than the 3.15 event. During high-value dust days, ozone pollution levels decreased at the majority of stations. Dust weather with low dust rising heights and dust backflow phenomena should be taken seriously in urban dust pollution forecasting and warning work. International collaboration is needed to improve China's desertification control.

TI  - Medium-Energy Electron Detector Onboard the FY-3E Satellite
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Medium-Energy Electron Detector (MEED), a space weather monitoring instrument on the Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) satellite, is introduced in this paper. The MEED utilizes pin-hole imaging technology on low-orbit satellites for medium-energy electron detection. Two orthogonal sensor heads enable the MEED to measure electrons from 18 directions simultaneously in the energy range of 30-600 keV (divided into eight exponentially distributed energy channels). The instrument has a similar to 12 degrees angular resolution and covers two 180 degrees x 30 degrees fields of view. With the magnetometer onboard the same satellite, the pitch angle distribution of medium-energy electrons can be obtained with good angular resolution. This paper presents the design principle, ground calibration results, and preliminary on-orbit test results of the FY-3E MEED. The on-orbit test results show that the medium-energy electron fluxes, geographical distribution, energy spectrum, and pitch angle observed by the MEED are in agreement with the expected results. The MEED provides a new method to observe the low-orbit energetic electron radiation environment from the FY-3E satellite. Its successful in-orbit operation will enable the theoretical study of radiation belts and improve space weather research.

TI  - Rapid Mapping of Slow-Moving Landslides Using an Automated SAR Processing Platform (HyP3) and Stacking-InSAR Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing number of landslide hazards worldwide has placed greater demands on the production and updating of landslide inventory maps. As an important data source for landslide detection, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data processing is time-consuming and also requires specialized knowledge, which severely hinders its widespread application. At present, a new cloud-based online platform, i.e., Alaska Satellite Facility's Hybrid Pluggable Processing Pipeline (ASF HyP3) was developed for massive SAR data processing. In this study, combining the HyP3 online platform and Stacking-InSAR method, we constructed a new easy-to-use processing chain for rapidly identifying slow-moving landslides over large areas. With this processing chain, a total of 923 interferometric pairs covering an area of over 1800 km(2) were processed within a few hours (about 4 to 5 h). A total of 81 slow-moving landslides were immediately detected and mapped using Stacking-InSAR method, of which 65 landslides were confirmed by previous studies and 16 landslides were newly detected. Results show that the new processing chain can greatly improve the efficiency of wide-area landslide mapping and is expected to serve as an effective tool for rapid updating the existing landslide inventories and contribute to the prevention and management of geological hazards.

TI  - Landslide Detection Using Time-Series InSAR Method along the Kangding-Batang Section of Shanghai-Nyalam Road
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to various factors such as urban development, climate change, and tectonic movements, landslides are a common geological phenomenon in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region, especially on both sides of a road, where large landslide hazards often result in traffic disruptions and casualties. Identifying the spatial distribution of landslides and monitoring their stability are essential for predicting landslide occurrence and implementing prevention measures. In this study, taking the Kangding-Batang section of Shanghai-Nyalam Road as the study area, we adopted a semi-automated time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method to identify landslides and monitor their activity. A total of 446 Sentinel-1 ascending and descending SAR images from January 2018 to December 2021 were thus collected and processed by using open-source InSAR processing software. After a series of error corrections, we obtained surface deformation maps covering the study area, and a total of 236 potential landslides were subsequently identified and classified into three categories, namely slow-sliding rockslides, debris flows, and debris avalanches, by combining deformation maps, optical images, and a digital elevation model (DEM). For a typical landslide, we performed deformation decomposition and analyzed the relationship between its deformation and rainfall, revealing the contribution of rainfall to the landslide. In addition, we discussed the effect of SAR geometric distortion on landslide detection, highlighting the importance of joint ascending and descending observations in mountainous areas. We analyzed the controlling factors of landslide distribution and found that topographic conditions are still the dominant factor. Our results may be beneficial for road maintenance and disaster mitigation. Moreover, the entire processing is semi-automated based on open-source tools or software, which provides a paradigm for landslide-related studies in other mountainous regions of the world.

TI  - Research on Forest Fire Monitoring Based on Multi -Source Satellite Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, remote sensing forest fire monitoring mainly focuses on the accuracy of fire point detection by polarorbiting satellites. At the same time, there is less research on remote sensing monitoring and identification of fire points, smoke characteristics and other comprehensive fire information based on multi-source remote sensing images. The forest fire of May 9, 2020, in Anning City, Yunnan Province, was studied based on the Gaofen-6 wide-field (GF-6 WFV) data and the FY-3D polarorbiting meteorological satellite medium-resolution spectrometer (FY-3D MERSI) data for smoke, burned areas extraction and fire point identification. Firstly, Based on GF-6 WFV data, six spectral feature indices were selected to identify fire smoke and fire trails by maximum likelihood, support vector machine, and random forest classification methods, and evaluated for accuracy. Then, Based on the 1 km mid-infrared channel data of FY-3D MERSI, the potential fire point identification algorithm is improved, and the basic principles of FY-3C VIRR and MODIS fire point detection are combined with dynamic threshold and context detection method to identify fire points. Then the identification results are optimized by combining the far-infrared channel with 250 m resolution. Finally, the information on smoke, fire points and fire trails extracted from the two kinds of data were combined to explore and analyze the monitoring capability of GF-6 WFV and FY-3D MERSI for forest fires. The results show that the smoke and burned areas can be effectively identified by five feature indices and eight bands of GF-6 WVF data, and the random forest classification is the most effective among the three classification methods, with an overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 97. 20% and 0. 955. The improved fire point recognition algorithm for FY-3D MERSI data can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of fire points. Combining the mid-infrared -and far-infrared channels to detect fires can improve the fire detection accuracy from kilometer to 100 meter level. The combined GF-6 and FY-3D MERSI data can effectively extract smoke, burned areas and fire point information from the fire site, and the use of multi-source data can carry out forest fire monitoring and early warning in multiple directions, which is of great significance to improve the capacity of satellite remote sensing forest fire monitoring.

TI  - Forecasting land use and land cover dynamics using combined remote sensing, machine learning algorithm and local perception in the Ago`enyiv′e Plateau, Togo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics helps policymakers set sustainable land management plans. Population growth, migration, and rural exodus have led to spatial expansion in many cities worldwide, especially in coastal urban settings. This research aims at assessing and predicting LULC over the Agoe`nyive'plateau (AP) in Togo, using remote sensing and Markov Chain along with local perceptions on LULC change, thus considering four scenarios (i.e., Business-as Usual, afforestation, wetland policy, and building policy). LULC was classified based on the maximum likelihood algorithm using Landsat images. The future scenarios maps were produced using the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks-Markov chain modelling approach by considering five driver variables considered to affect future development. The historical change analysis was performed for the periods of 1986-2001, 2001-2011, and 2011-2020, while 1986-2020 was used for model validation and change prediction. Image accuracy assessment was performed using the error or confusion matrices, kappa coefficients (Kscores), Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC), and accuracy scores, with an overall accuracy (Kappa coefficient) of 87% (0.81), 88% (0.81), 90% (0.82), and 92% (0.84) for the years 1986, 2001, 2011, and 2020, respectively. The results showed an increase in built-up areas (38.71% land gain), while a decrease was observed in mixed vegetation/savannah (22.69% land loss), croplands/bare surfaces (22.89%), and wetlands (3.36% land loss) over the period of 1986-2020. An increase in built-up areas (7.79% and 19.79% land gain by 2030 and 2050, respectively) and a decrease in mixed vegetation (1.13% and 2.54% land loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), croplands and bare surfaces (6.58% and 16.98% loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), and wetlands (0.13% and 0.31% loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), are expected under the BAU scenario. Contrary to the wetland policy, which induces change only in the wetlands (0.02% and 0.047% land loss by 2030 and 2050, respectively), the afforestation scenario results in a gain in forest/savannah (0.11% and 0.73% land gain by 2030 and 2050 compared to the BAU scenario), but also a decrease in croplands/bare surfaces (0.64% by 2050 compared to the BAU scenario), whereas the building policy scenario results in a long-term increase in croplands/bare surfaces (2.88% by 2050, compared to the BAU), and wetlands (0.027 and 2.88% by 2050) in addition to the mixed vegetation/savannah. LULC dynamics (including future urbanization trends) for the AP under various scenarios is a step ahead of time, highlighting the importance of the implementation of existing laws and policies, but also providing information to deal with the observed inharmonious spatial development of urban centres, and serving as a dataset source for LULC change impact assessments on related resources.

TI  - Beyond river discharge gauging: hydrologic predictions using remote sensing alone
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study suggests a radical approach to hydrologic predictions in ungauged basins, addressing the long standing challenge of issuing predictions when in-situ river discharge does not exist. A simple but powerful rationale for measuring and modeling river discharge is proposed, using coupled advances in hydrologic modeling and satellite remote sensing. Our approach presents a Surrogate River discharge driven Model (SRM) that infers Surrogate River discharge (SR) from remotely sensed microwave signals with the ability to mimic river discharge in varying topographies and vegetation cover, which is then used to calibrate a hydrological model enabling physical realism in the resulting river discharge profile by adding an estimated mean of river discharge via the Budyko framework. The strength of SRM comes from the fact that it only uses remotely sensed data in prediction. The approach is demonstrated for 130 catchments in the Murray Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia, a region of high economic and environmental importance. The newly proposed SR (SRL, representing L-band microwave) boosts the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of modeled flow, showing a mean NSE of 0.54, with 70% of catchments exceeding NSE 0.4. We conclude that SRM effectively predicts high-flow and low-flow events related to flood and drought. Overall, this new approach will significantly improve catchment simulation capacity, enhancing water security and flood forecasting capability not only in the MDB but also worldwide.

TI  - VIIRS Edition 1 Cloud Properties for CERES, Part 2: Evaluation with CALIPSO
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The decades-long Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Project includes both cloud and radiation measurements from instruments on the Aqua, Terra, and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellites. To build a reliable long-term climate data record, it is important to determine the accuracies of the parameters retrieved from the sensors on each satellite. Cloud amount, phase, and top height derived from radiances taken by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the SNPP are evaluated relative to the same quantities determined from measurements by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on the Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) spacecraft. The accuracies of the VIIRS cloud fractions are found to be as good as or better than those for the CERES amounts determined from Aqua MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and for cloud fractions estimated by two other operational algorithms. Sensitivities of cloud fraction bias to CALIOP resolution, matching time window, and viewing zenith angle are examined. VIIRS cloud phase biases are slightly greater than their CERES MODIS counterparts. A majority of cloud phase errors are due to multilayer clouds during the daytime and supercooled liquid water clouds at night. CERES VIIRS cloud-top height biases are similar to those from CERES MODIS, except for ice clouds, which are smaller than those from CERES MODIS. CERES VIIRS cloud phase and top height uncertainties overall are very similar to or better than several operational algorithms, but fail to match the accuracies of experimental machine learning techniques. The greatest errors occur for multilayered clouds and clouds with phase misclassification. Cloud top heights can be improved by relaxing tropopause constraints, improving lapse-rate to model temperature profiles, and accounting for multilayer clouds. Other suggestions for improving the retrievals are also discussed.

TI  - Urban Remote Sensing with Spatial Big Data: A Review and Renewed Perspective of Urban Studies in Recent Decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - During the past decades, multiple remote sensing data sources, including nighttime light images, high spatial resolution multispectral satellite images, unmanned drone images, and hyperspectral images, among many others, have provided fresh opportunities to examine the dynamics of urban landscapes. In the meantime, the rapid development of telecommunications and mobile technology, alongside the emergence of online search engines and social media platforms with geotagging technology, has fundamentally changed how human activities and the urban landscape are recorded and depicted. The combination of these two types of data sources results in explosive and mind-blowing discoveries in contemporary urban studies, especially for the purposes of sustainable urban planning and development. Urban scholars are now equipped with abundant data to examine many theoretical arguments that often result from limited and indirect observations and less-than-ideal controlled experiments. For the first time, urban scholars can model, simulate, and predict changes in the urban landscape using real-time data to produce the most realistic results, providing invaluable information for urban planners and governments to aim for a sustainable and healthy urban future. This current study reviews the development, current status, and future trajectory of urban studies facilitated by the advancement of remote sensing and spatial big data analytical technologies. The review attempts to serve as a bridge between the growing "big data" and modern urban study communities.

TI  - Complex-Valued U-Net with Capsule Embedded for Semantic Segmentation of PolSAR Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, semantic segmentation with pixel-level classification has become one of the types of research focus in the field of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image interpretation. Fully convolutional network (FCN) can achieve end-to-end semantic segmentation, which provides a basic framework for subsequent improved networks. As a classic FCN-based network, U-Net has been applied to semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Although good segmentation results have been obtained, scalar neurons have made it difficult for the network to obtain multiple properties of entities in the image. The vector neurons used in the capsule network can effectively solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a complex-valued (CV) U-Net with a CV capsule network embedded for semantic segmentation of a PolSAR image. The structure of CV U-Net is lightweight to match the small PolSAR data, and the embedded CV capsule network is designed to extract more abundant features of the PolSAR image than the CV U-Net. Furthermore, CV dynamic routing is proposed to realize the connection between capsules in two adjacent layers. Experiments on two airborne datasets and one Gaofen-3 dataset show that the proposed network is capable of distinguishing different types of land covers with a similar scattering mechanism and extracting complex boundaries between two adjacent land covers. The network achieves better segmentation performance than other state-of-art networks, especially when the training set size is small.

TI  - Land Subsidence in Tianjin, China: Before and after the South-to-North Water Diversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) is a multi-decadal infrastructure project in China aimed at alleviating severe water shortages in north China. It has imposed broad social, economic, environmental, and ecological impacts since 2015, particularly in the Beijing-Tianjin metropolitan area. Sentinel-1A/B Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) (2014-2021), Global Positioning System (GPS) (2010-2021), and hydraulic-head data are used to assess the impacts on ongoing land subsidence in Tianjin in this study. Additionally, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to highlight primary factors controlling the recent land subsidence. Our results show that the reduced groundwater pumping has slowed down the overall subsidence since 2019 due to SNWD. As of 2021, the subsiding area (>5 mm/year) has reduced to about 5400 km(2), approximately 85% of the subsiding area before SNWD; the areas of rapid subsidence (>30 mm/year) and extremely rapid subsidence (>50 mm/year) have reduced to 1300 km(2) and 280 km(2), respectively, approximately 70% and 60% of the areas before SNWD. Recent subsidence (2016-2021) was primarily contributed by the inelastic compaction of clays in deep aquifers of Aquifers III and IV ranging from approximately 200 to 450 m below the land surface. The ongoing rapid subsidence (>30 mm/year) in Tianjin is limited to border areas adjacent to large industrial cities (e.g., Langfang, Tanshan, Cangzhou) in Hebei Province. Ongoing subsidence will cease when hydraulic heads in the deep Aquifers (IV and V) recover to the new pre-consolidation head, approximately 45 m below the land surface, and subsidence will not be reinitiated as long as the hydraulic heads remain above the new pre-consolidation head. This study reveals the importance of coordinating groundwater and surface water uses at local, regional, and national scales for land subsidence mitigation.

TI  - Cloud Base Height Retrieval Methods for FY-4A Based on Ensemble Learning
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Cloud base height (CBH) is a crucial cloud parameter affecting the water cycle and radiation budget of the earth-atmosphere system. Additionally, CBH has a great impact on aviation safety. Low CBH often leads to a decrease in visibility, which poses a great threat to flight safety. Therefore, it is meaningful to acquire accurate CBH for related scientific research and meteorological services. It is valuable but challenging to use satellite passive remote sensing data to retrieve CBH. Some cloud products such as cloud top height (CTH) and cloud optical thickness ( COT) are often used in previous research, related to CBH retrieval, from which two ideas to retrieve CBH can be summarized. The first idea employed independent methods to obtain CBH of different types of clouds respectively, and the second one directly retrieves CBH using cloud products of satellites without regarding cloud types. At present, there is no CBH products of FY-4A. Therefore, a CBH retrieval method for FY-4A is introduced in this paper. According to the two ideas mentioned above, two schemes of CBH retrieval are designed, which are compared to find more suitable ideas to retrieve CBH for FY-4A and to provide reference for subsequent development of FY- 4A CBH products.Methods A CBH retrieval method based on ensemble learning is proposed in this paper. CTH, COT, and cloud effective radius (CER) from FY-4A are used. Additionally, CBH and cloud types from CloudSat are employed for their widely recognized data quality. First, data of FY-4A and CloudSat are matched spatiotemporally and are divided into training data, validation data, and test data. Second, CBH retrieval models are built based on two ensemble learning algorithms, random forest (RF), and gradient boosting tree ( GBT). Two schemes of CBH retrieval are designed in this paper. In the first scheme, matched data are divided into eight types according to the eight cloud types of CloudSat. For each type of cloud, two retrieval models are built based on RF and GBT using training data and validation data through ten-fold cross validation. The optimal model is selected according to the models ' results on test data. In the second scheme, retrieval models are built without regarding cloud types. Training data of the eight cloud types are combined together. Validation data and test data are processed similarly. The three data sets are used to obtain the RF model and GBT model, and to select the optimal retrieval model. Finally, the optimal scheme and model of CBH retrieval for FY- 4A are selected according to the models ' performance.Results and Discussions Root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient ( R), and mean relative error (MRE) are used to evaluate models ' performance. In the first scheme, the GBT model is the optimal retrieval model for Cirrus (Ci), Altostratus (As), and Altostratus (Ac). RF model is the optimal retrieval model for Stratus/ Stratocumulus (St/ Sc), Cumulus (Cu), Nimbostratus (Ns), deep convective cloud (Dc), and multilayer cloud (Multi). In the second scheme, the GBT model is the optimal retrieval model. The models of the two schemes are compared on test data with 129515 samples. Overall, the retrieval model of the first scheme outperforms that of the second scheme. Specifically, RMSE of the model in the first scheme is 1304. 7 m. MAE is 898. 3 m, R is 0. 9214, and MRE is 63. 93%. For the eight types of clouds, RMSE, MAE, R, and MRE of the model in the first scheme are also superior to those of the model in the second scheme. Although the first scheme can obtain better results, the retrieval model of the first scheme still needs to be improved in the future. For example, the performance of the retrieval model for Dc is not a patch on that of other types of clouds. Additionally, the paper discusses how to apply the proposed method to practice. First, level 1 data (i. e. reflectance and brightness temperature) and level 2 data ( i. e. CTH, COT, and CER) of FY-4A can be used to acquire the eight cloud types according to a cloud type classification model proposed by Yu et al. Second, according to the cloud type classification results, the retrieval models of the first scheme can be adopted to retrieve CBH for the eight types of clouds respectively.Conclusions CBH is a critical cloud parameter, but there are no CBH products of geostationary meteorological satellites currently. Thus, a CBH retrieval method for FY- 4A based on ensemble learning is introduced in this paper. Two schemes of CBH retrieval are designed, and corresponding CBH retrieval models are built based on two ensemble learning algorithms, namely, RF and GBT. Data of CTH, COT, and CER from FY-4A are used in this paper. The first scheme employs eight independent models to retrieve CBH for eight types of clouds ( i. e. Ci, As, Ac, St/ Sc, Cu, Ns, Dc, and Multi) respectively. Specifically, for Ci, As, and Ac, the GBT model is used to retrieve CBH. For the other five types of cloud, the RF model is used to retrieve CBH. The second scheme uses a GBT model to retrieve CBH without regarding cloud types. CBH from CloudSat is used to evaluate the results of the two schemes, and the retrieval model of the first scheme outperforms that of the second scheme. For the eight types of clouds, the retrieval model of the first scheme also obtains better results.

TI  - Water Stream Extraction via Feature-Fused Encoder-Decoder Network Based on SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of water stream based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is of great significance in surface water monitoring, flood monitoring, and the management of water resources. However, in recent years, the research mainly uses the backscattering feature (BF) to extract water bodies. In this paper, a feature-fused encoder-decoder network was proposed for delineating the water stream more completely and precisely using both the BF and polarimetric feature (PF) from SAR images. Firstly, the standard BFs were extracted and PFs were obtained using model-based decomposition. Specifically, the newly model-based decomposition, more suitable for dual-pol SAR images, was selected to acquire three different PFs of surface water stream for the first time. Five groups of candidate feature combinations were formed with two BFs and three PFs. Then, a new feature-fused encoder-decoder network (FFEDN) was developed for mining and fusing both BFs and PFs. Finally, several typical areas were selected to evaluate the performance of different combinations for water stream extraction. To further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two machine learning methods and four state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms were utilized for comparison. The experimental results showed that the proposed method using the optimal feature combination achieved the highest accuracy, with a precision of 95.21%, recall of 91.79%, intersection over union (IoU) score of 87.73%, overall accuracy (OA) of 93.35%, and average accuracy (AA) of 93.41%. The results showed that the performance was higher when BF and PF were combined. In short, in this study, the effectiveness of PFs for water stream extraction was verified and the proposed FFEDN can further improve the accuracy of water stream extraction.

TI  - LONG-TERM CLIMATOGENIC DYNAMICS WATER SURFACE OF THE ULUG-KHEM KOTLOVINA LAKES (TYVA REPUBLIC)
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The annual water surface areas of five lakes (Kak-Khol, Dus-Khol, Khadyn, Bezymyannoe, Cheder) in the central part of the territory of the Tyva Republic for the period 1989-2020 were determined using Earth remote sensing data from the Landsat-5, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B. The areas of the lakes are calculated based on the modified normal-ized difference water index (MNDWI) obtained as a result of processing satellite images using the ArcGIS program. Characteris-tics of climatic conditions (surface air temperature, atmospheric precipitation) and calculations of the hydrothermal moisture coefficient G.T. Selyaninov and D.A. Peda were performed according to the Kyzyl weather station data for 1943-2020. Palmer Drought Severity Index values are taken for the coordinates of this weather station from public electronic archives.The investigated lakes, depending on the area of the water surface at the maximum filling, are categorized as very small, small and medium. During the period under consideration, none of the lakes dried up. The water surface area of the smallest of them during the study period varied from 0.09 (2015) to 0.14 (1993) km2, the largest - from 0.24 (2009) to 25.1 (1998) km2. The dynamics of the water areas for the period under consideration has multidirectional trends - for three lakes, the trends are negative (Lake Kak-Khol, Khadyn, Bezymyannoe), Cheder - positive, at the lake Dus-Khol with short-period fluctuations, the area for the analyzed period remains stable, however, a significant trend was revealed only for the lake Khadyn. Analysis of changes in the main climatic parameters over the past 78 years has shown that they are characterized by significant positive linear trends. So, for the average annual air temperature it was 0.61 C/10 years or 4.8 & DEG;C for the entire period, and for the annual amount of atmospheric precipita- tion - 4.82 mm/10 years or 37.6 mm for the entire period. In the mode of atmospheric precipitation, significant high-frequency cycles with a duration of 2-8 years were revealed. According to the Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficient, the conditions are de- fined as arid, according to the Pedya and Palmer indices, the climatic humidity of the territory is estimated mainly as optimal. Analysis of the relationship between the dynamics of the water areas of the studied lakes with changes in the main characteristics of the climate showed that the highest significant relationships were obtained with the air temperature (r = -0.63) and the Pedya index (r = -0.64) for the conditions of the current and previous year. The stability of the water surface area of the considered lakes to climatic fluctuations is influenced by the feeding characteristics of the lakes, for example, for the lake. Khadyn there is no significant correlation with climatic indicators, which is due to the predominance of river runoff in its water supply, which is formed in mountainous areas with climatic characteristics different from the steppe zone. According to the results of hydrochem- ical testing, the investigated lakes are saline with brine mineralization 15.1-159.8 g/dm3, the highest water mineralization in the lake. Dus-Khol. The non-susceptibility of the main lakes to drying out is a reliable basis for their therapeutic and recreational use.

T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a broad empirical base, the article highlights the stages in the formation of a pro-Russian public in the Northwestern Territory as a special intellectual and sociocultural phenomenon in the first half of the 19th century. An analysis of the socio-cultural and socio-political factors that contributed to the emergence and development of this ideological direction, which sought to establish cooperation between the imperial authoritiesand the educated society of the outlying region, was carried out.The formation of a pro-Russian public was a reaction to the dominance of the Polonized social elite in the northwestern provinces of the Russian Empire, which defended the Polish national project, which competed with the idea of imperial unification of the western outskirts. The history of the region, rich in events of foreign development, influenced the public consciousness of its inhabitants, contributing to the strengthening of both regional separatism and loyalism, the essence of which was the realization of the possibility of successful and conflict-free development of the region as part of Russia.It is concluded that in the specific historical and cultural conditions of the northwestern provinces by the beginning of the 1860sin the environment of the pro-Russian oriented public, two main ideological currents took shape, one of which was based on the estate principle and was represented by local gentry loyalists, and the other by a nationally oriented and conservative-patriotic group of local figures. At the same time, representatives of the pro-Russian oriented public were distinguished by a clear worldview that the full development of the "Western Russian people" and the preservation of the original ethnic, cultural and religious image of the North-Western Territory is possible only if the region has organic ties with Russia and upholds the sovereign idea of an imperial heterogeneous state with an East Slavic ethnic core

TI  - Regional Remote Sensing of Lake Water Transparency Based on Google Earth Engine: Performance of Empirical Algorithm and Machine Learning
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi depth (SD) is a valuable and feasible water quality indicator of lake eutrophication. The establishment of an automated system with efficient image processing and an algorithm suitable for the inversion of transparency in lake-rich regions could provide sufficient temporal and spatial information for lake management. These are especially critical for lake-rich regions where in situ monitoring data are scarce. This study demonstrated the implementation of an atmospheric correction algorithm (ACOLITE algorithm) in conjunction with the Google Earth Engine platform to generate remote-sensing reflectance products of specific points efficiently. The study also evaluated the performance of an algorithm for inverting lake SDs in Yunnan Plateau lakes, which is one of the five lake districts in China, since there is a lack of in situ data for most of the lakes in the region. The in situ data from four lakes with large SD ranges and imagery from Landsat Operational Land Imager were used to train and evaluate the performance of two algorithms: an empirical algorithm (stepwise regression) and machine learning (support vector machines and multi-layer perception). The results revealed that the retrieval accuracy of models with bands and band ratio combinations could be substantially improved compared with models with a single band or band combinations. A negative correlation was also observed between the temporal match between observations and the model accuracy. This study found that the MLP model with sufficient training data was more suitable for transparency estimation of lakes belonging to the dataset; the SVM model was more suitable for transparency prediction outside the training set, regardless of the adequacy of the training data. This study provides a reference for monitoring lakes within the Yunnan region using remote sensing.

AB  - This study generates intensity-duration-frequency curves for three important cities in Iraq using Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation near real-time (GSMaP NRT), and gauge corrected (GSMaP GC) satellite precipitation datasets. Many probability distribution functions were used to fit the maximum yearly rainfall data. The Sherman equation was used to create intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves for rainfall intensities with 2-, 5-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-year return periods, with the estimated coefficients of the best-fit distribution serving as the fitting parameters. The discrepancy between the IDF curves produced from the satellites and the observed data was used to bias correct the satellite IDF curves. The Generalized Extreme Value Distribution model best describes the hourly rainfall distribution of satellite data. GSMaP GC was the best option for creating IDF curves with higher correlations with observed data at Baghdad, Basra, and Mosul. The study indicates the necessity of gauge correction of satellite rainfall data to reduce under- and over-estimating observed rainfall. GSMaP GC can reasonably estimate rainfall in a predominantly arid climate region like Iraq. The generated IDF curves may be an important step toward achieving sustainable urban stormwater management in the country.

TI  - Assessment of Irrigation Efficiency by Coupling Remote Sensing and Ground-Based Data: Case Study of Sprinkler Irrigation of Alfalfa in the Saratovskoye Zavolgie Region of Russia
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, the leading role of data from sensors to monitor crop irrigation practices is indisputable. The combination of ground and space monitoring data and agrohydrological modeling made it possible to evaluate the effectiveness of crop irrigation. This paper presents some additions to recently published results of field study at the territory of the Privolzhskaya irrigation system located on the left bank of the Volga in the Russian Federation, during the growing season of 2012. Data were obtained for 19 crops of irrigated alfalfa during the second year of their growing period. Irrigation water applications to these crops was carried out by the center pivot sprinklers. The actual crop evapotranspiration and its components being derived with the SEBAL model from MODIS satellite images data. As a result, a time series of daily values of evapotranspiration and transpiration were obtained for the area occupied by each of these crops. To assess the effectiveness of irrigation of alfalfa crops, six indicators were used based on the use of data on yield, irrigation depth, actual evapotranspiration, transpiration and basal evaporation deficit. The series of indicators estimating irrigation effectiveness were analyzed and ranked. The obtained rank values were used to analyze the similarity and non-similarity of indicators of irrigation effectiveness of alfalfa crops. As a result of this analysis, the opportunity to assess irrigation effectiveness with the help of data from ground and space-based sensors was proved.

TI  - Classification of Arctic Sea Ice Type in CFOSAT Scatterometer Measurements Using a Random Forest Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ku-band scatterometer called CSCAT onboard the Chinese-French Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT) is the first spaceborne rotating fan-beam scatterometer (RFSCAT). A new algorithm for classification of Arctic sea ice types on CSCAT measurement data using a random forest classifier is presented. The random forest classifier is trained on the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) weekly sea ice age and sea ice concentration product. Five feature parameters, including the mean value of horizontal and vertical polarization backscatter coefficient, the standard deviation of horizontal and vertical polarization backscatter coefficient and the copol ratio, are innovatively extracted from orbital measurement for the first time to distinguish water, first-year ice (FYI) and multi-year ice (MYI). The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of sea ice type model are 93.35% and 88.53%, respectively, and the precisions of water, FYI, and MYI are 99.67%, 86.60%, and 79.74%, respectively. Multi-source datasets, including daily sea ice type from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF), NSIDC weekly sea ice age, multi-year ice concentration (MYIC) provided by the University of Bremen, and SAR-based sea ice type released by Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) have been used for comparison and validation. It is shown that the most obvious difference in the distribution of sea ice types between the CSCAT results and OSI SAF sea ice type are mainly concentrated in the marginal zones of FYI and MYI. Furthermore, compared with OSI SAF sea ice type, the area of MYI derived from CSCAT is more homogeneous with less noise, especially in the case of younger multiyear ice. In the East Greenland region, CSCAT identifies more pixels as MYI with lower MYIC values, showing better accuracy in the identification of areas with obvious mobility of MYI. In conclusion, this research verifies the capability of CSCAT in monitoring Arctic sea ice classification, especially in the spatial homogeneity and detectable duration of sea ice classification. Given the high accuracy and processing speed, the random forest-based algorithm can offer good guidance for sea ice classification with FY-3E/RFSCAT, i.e., a dual-frequency (Ku and C band) scatterometer called WindRAD.

TI  - Estimating the Forest Carbon Storage of Chongming Eco-Island, China, Using Multisource Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests are highly heterogeneous; information about the combined effect of forest classification scale and algorithm selection on the estimation accuracy for urban forests remains unclear. In this study, we chose Chongming eco-island in the mega-city of Shanghai, a national experimental carbon neutral construction plot in China, as the study object. Remote sensing estimation models (simple regression models vs. machine learning models) of forest carbon density were constructed across different classification scales (all forests, different forest types, and dominant tree species) based on high-resolution aerial photographs and Sentinel-2A remote sensing images, and a large number of field surveys and optimal models were screened by ten-fold cross-validation. The results showed that (1) in early 2020, the total forest area and carbon storage of Chongming eco-island were 307.8 km(2) and 573,123.6 t, respectively, among which the areal ratios and total carbon storage ratios of evergreen broad-leaved forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, and warm coniferous forest were 51.4% and 53.3%, 33.5% and 32.8%, and 15.1% and 13.9%, respectively. (2) The average forest carbon density of Chongming eco-island was 18.6 t/ha, among which no differences were detected among the three forest types (i.e., 17.2-19.2 t/ha), opposite to what was observed among the dominant tree species (i.e., 14.6-23.7 t/ha). (3) Compared to simple regression models, machine learning models showed an improvement in accuracy performance across all three classification scales, with average rRMSE and rBias values decreasing by 29.4% and 53.1%, respectively; compared to the all-forests classification scale, the average rRMSE and rBias across the algorithms decreased by 25.0% and 45.2% at the forest-type classification scale and by 28.6% and 44.3% at the tree species classification scale, respectively. We concluded that refining the forest classification, combined with advanced prediction procedures, could improve the accuracy of carbon storage estimates for urban forests.

TI  - An Advanced Spatiotemporal Fusion Model for Suspended Particulate Matter Monitoring in an Intermontane Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ebinur Lake is the largest brackish-water lake in Xinjiang, China. Strong winds constantly have an impact on this shallow water body, causing high variability in turbidity of water. Therefore, it is crucial to continuously monitor suspended particulate matter (SPM) for water quality management. This research aims to develop an advanced spatiotemporal fusion model based on the inversion technique that enables time-continuous and detailed monitoring of SPM over an intermontane lake. The findings shows that: (1) the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) fusion in blue, green, red, and near infrared (NIR) bands was better than the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) model in extracting SPM information; (2) the inversion model constructed by random forest (RF) outperformed the support vector machine (SVM) and partial least squares (PLS) algorithms; and (3) the SPM concentrations acquired from the fused images of Landsat 8 OLI and ESTARFM matched with the actual data of Ebinur Lake based on the visual perspective and accuracy assessment.

TI  - Design and Development of Medium Energy Proton Detector Onboard FY-3E Satellite
T2  - AEROSPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces the instrument design of the medium energy proton detector (energy range: 30 keV-5 MeV) mounted on the FY-3E satellite. Through the design and optimization of the sensor signal processing circuit, the anti-electromagnetic interference ability of the medium energy particle detector is greatly enhanced. The designed aluminum plating on sensors can effectively exclude the light pollution to the medium energy protons. The designed permanent annular magnet has a deflection efficiency of more than 95% for medium energy electrons below 1.0 MeV. Additionally, by designing the logical working mode of the sensor, the contamination by other high energy particles (high energy electrons > 1.5 MeV, high energy protons > 5 MeV, and heavy ions) is excluded. Combining the above methods, the detector achieves the detection lower limit of 30 keV for medium energy protons. Its energy resolution is better than 15%@100 keV and the mixing ratio of electrons is less than 2%.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation in and Responses of the NDVI to Climate in Western Ordos and Eastern Alxa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is an important component of the terrestrial ecosystem, and studying the rules of vegetation change and its driving factors is helpful to strengthen the ecological protection and sustainable development of regional vegetation. This study analyzes the changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its response to climate factors in the five regions of western Ordos and eastern Alxa in China between 2000 and 2020. The MODIS NDVI and meteorological data from 2000 to 2020 was used and the ordinary least squares, trend analysis, and correlation analysis methods were analyzed. The NDVI in this region shows spatial differentiation and is high in the east and low in the west. The overall NDVI has shown a significant increasing trend (p < 0.01), and the slope value of the rate of change also shows that the NDVI in 98.17% of the area is increasing. On a temporal scale, NDVI had a significant positive correlation with precipitation (p < 0.01), but no significant correlation with temperature changes. On a spatial scale, NDVI was positively correlated with precipitation, which accounted for 95.57% of spatial changes, of which a significant positive correlation accounted for 34.99% (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the temperature and NDVI were negatively correlated but not significantly. A positive correlation accounted for 45.95% of the change, but the insignificant negative correlation accounted for 54.05%. Therefore, comprehensive analysis showed that precipitation played a leading role in the NDVI in the study area. The results are helpful to study the driving mechanism of vegetation growth and provide reference for vegetation protection in regions of western Ordos and eastern Alxa of Inner Mongolia, China.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution and Driving Factors of Landscape Pattern in a Typical Hilly Area in Southern China: A Case Study of Yujiang District, Jiangxi Province
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the most intuitive manifestation of land use/land cover change, the spatio-temporal evolution of landscape patterns has significant implications for optimizing regional landscape pattern and land use management. Based on multi-period remote sensing data, we selected an optimal scale (570 m) and used the geographic detector model to analyze the spatio-temporal changes in the landscape pattern of a typical hilly area (Yujiang District, Yingtan City, Jiangxi Province) in southern China. The results showed that from 2009 to 2018, the area of urban land, other construction land, rural residential land, and cultivated land expanded by 33.27%, 21.23%, 19.42%, and 1.07%, respectively. In contrast, the area of grassland, forest land, and water area shrank by 18.18%, 5.41%, and 2.19%, respectively, over the past 10 years. At the landscape level, the patch shape became more complex over time, with increased landscape fragmentation and diversity. At the class level, cultivated land, forest land, and grassland tended to be fragmented, whereas rural residential land exhibited an aggregation tendency. Slope gradient, gross regional product, and distance from major highways had a strong ability to explain the spatial differences in landscape pattern change. The results of this study enable a dynamic understanding of landscape pattern evolution in typical hilly areas in southern China and provide a reference for landscape pattern optimization in similar geomorphic settings.

TI  - Coupling Coordination Degree between Ecological Environment Quality and Urban Development in Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle Based on the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization often exerts massive pressure on the resources relied upon by the ecological environment. It is necessary to quickly evaluate the interaction and mutual influence between regional urbanization and the ecological environment. This paper uses the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, integrates MODIS and night light remote sensing data sets, and computes the remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) and the coupling coordination degree (CCD) to measure the coupling coordination and analyze the spatiotemporal changes in the Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle (CCEC) for 2010, 2015, and 2020. Our results demonstrate four key findings. Firstly, the CCD varies spatially; it peaks at the Chengdu and the West Chongqing Plains, decreasing outwards along the mountains, with the lowest degree of coupling in the central, southern, and northern edge areas of the CCEC. Additionally, it has shown a trend of maintaining unchanged first and then increasing, mainly responding to policy decisions. Secondly, the changes between the different coupling levels were almost stable and mainly occurred between adjacent levels. Thirdly, the coupling level of towns spreads outwards from the centers at Chengdu and Chongqing and has an overall upward trend in time. Fourthly, in the most recent year, the coupling types present a distribution pattern of one developing axis connected with two peaks. Specifically, the environment system lagging type aggregates in Chengdu, Chongqing, and their surrounding areas, and the others mainly are economic system lagging type. The high internal coupling type also mainly occurs in the high and low coupling levels. Under this context, constructive suggestions for developmental optimization in the study area were proposed.

TI  - Extraction of Impermeable Surfaces Based on Multi-Source Nighttime Light Images of Different Geomorphological Partitions
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate extraction of impermeable surfaces is important for assessing land use change and improving the urban heat island effect. Nighttime light imagery has the advantage of being efficient and cost effective, providing a new perspective for monitoring and extracting impermeable surfaces and analyzing urban expansion processes. However, for the vast Karst terrain fragmentation area located in southwest China, the extraction of impermeable surface information faces many challenges due to surface landscape fragmentation and nighttime light image resolution. These challenges include light spillover, oversaturation and limited understanding of spatial links with surface types at fine scales. This study uses Luojia1-01, NPP-VIIRS, and Flint as remote sensing data sources to examine the applicability of nighttime light images in extracting impermeable surfaces from geomorphologically complex areas. The results show that Luojia1-01 data can provide finer spatial details and more accurate impermeable surface extraction results than NPP-VIIRS and Flint data. The relative error of extracted area in regions with large topographic relief is higher than that in regions with flat topographic cuttings. The extraction results of the three images are spatially similar; however, the overall accuracy is poor, and a single nighttime light image is not the best solution for obtaining impermeable surface information in large scale terrain fragmentation areas. However, the integrated application of multi-source light images is a trend for future regional research and development, and the best way to extract impermeable surfaces in complex terrain areas should be explored in conjunction with other remote sensing data sources in the future.

TI  - Combining Remotely Sensed Evapotranspiration and an Agroecosystem Model to Estimate Center-Pivot Irrigation Water Use at High Spatio-Temporal Resolution
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating irrigation water use accurately is critical for sustainable irrigation and studying terrestrial water cycle in irrigated croplands. However, irrigation is not monitored in most places, and current estimations of irrigation water use has coarse spatial and/or temporal resolutions. This study aims to estimate irrigation water use at the daily and field scale through the proposed model-data fusion framework, which is achieved by particle filtering with two configurations (concurrent, CON, and sequential, SEQ) by assimilating satellite-based evapotranspiration (ET) observations into an advanced agroecosystem model, ecosys. Two types of experiments using synthetic and real ET observations were conducted to study the efficacy of the proposed framework for estimating irrigation water use at the irrigated fields in eastern and western Nebraska, United States. The experiments using synthetic ET observations indicated that, for two major sources of uncertainties of ET difference between observations and model simulations, which are bias and noise, noise had larger impacts on degrading the estimation performance of irrigation water use than bias. For the experiments using real ET observations, monthly and annual estimations of irrigation water use matched well with farmer irrigation records, with Pearson correlation coefficient (r) around 0.80 and 0.50, respectively. Although detecting daily irrigation records was very challenging, our method still gave a good performance with RMSE, BIAS, and r around 2.90, 0.03, and 0.4 mm/d, respectively. Our proposed model-data fusion framework for estimating irrigation water use at high spatio-temporal resolution could contribute to regional water management, sustainable irrigation, and better tracking terrestrial water cycle.

TI  - Study on the Methods of Collecting Atmospheric Pollution Gases in Huaibei Region by Mobile Mini-DOAS
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban air pollutants in China mainly include nitrogen oxides, ozone, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. NO2 and SO2 are common trace gases in atmospheric pollutants, which directly or indirectly impact ground air radiation,global climate,air quality and human health. Huaibei region is the production base of basic energy and important raw material coal in China. Local atmospheric pollution has become more complex due to long-term coal production. It is one of the research hot pots to acquire atmospheric pollutant concentration quickly. Differential optical absorption spectrometer (DOAS) is an optical remote sensing spectral equipment, which has the advantages of stability, and high sensitivity and is not restricted by building platform. It can obtain the concentration information of a variety of polluting gases at the same time. Because of the complex environment pollution in Huaibei, this paper constructed a mobile mini differential optical absorption spectroscopy(DOAS) system based on the mobile platform, which includes a spectrum acquisition system, temperature control system and GPS positioning system. The GPS positioning system was used to record the longitude, latitude and speed during the movement. The spectrometer was placed in the constant temperature system to ensure the accuracy of the system measurement. During the experiment, the performance of the system is tested, and the navigation observation route is planned first. The mobile DOAS measurement results are compared with the MAX-DOAS to verify the accuracy of the system to realize the rapid, convenient and accurate monitoring of typical atmospheric pollutants in Huaibei. During the measurement period, QDOAS software was used for inversion processing of the originally measured spectra and the relatively clean is selected as the reference spectrum to obtain the spatial distribution of NO2 and SO2 column concentration in the Huaibei region. The range of NO2 concentration is 0. 509/10(16) similar to 15. 4 X 10(16) molecule center dot cm (2) and that of SO2 is 0. 353 X 10(16) similar to 9. 07 X 10(16) molecule center dot cm (2). The results of mobile Mini-DOAS measurements were compared with MAX-DOAS measurements and TROPOMI data, which showed good consistency (correlation coefficient R-2 > 0. 75). Field experiments show that the mobile Mini-DOAS system can accurately obtain the distribution of urban pollution gas column, providing an effective technical means for confirming the source area of urban atmospheric pollution and verifying satellite remote sensing data.

TI  - Identification of Soybean Planting Areas Combining Fused Gaofen-1 Image Data and U-Net Model
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to accurately identify soybean planting areas for ensuring agricultural and industrial production. High-resolution satellite remotely sensed imagery has greatly facilitated the effective extraction of soybean planting areas but novel methods are required to further improve the identification accuracy. Two typical planting areas of Linhu Town and Baili Town in Northern Anhui Province, China, were selected to explore the accurate extraction method. The 10 m multispectral and 2 m panchromatic Gaofen-1 (GF-1) image data were first fused to produce training, test, and validation data sets after the min-max standardization and data augmentation. The deep learning U-Net model was then adopted to perform the accurate extraction of soybean planting areas. Two vital influencing factors on the accuracies of the U-Net model, including cropping size and training epoch, were compared and discussed. Specifically, three cropping sizes of 128 x 128, 256 x 256, and 512 x 512 px, and 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 training epochs were compared to optimally determine the values of the two parameters. To verify the extraction effect of the U-Net model, comparison experiments were also conducted based on the SegNet and DeepLabv3+. The results show that U-Net achieves the highest Accuracy of 92.31% with a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 81.35%, which is higher than SegNet with an improvement of nearly 4% in Accuracy and 10% on mIoU. In addition, the mIoU has been also improved by 8.89% compared with DeepLabv3+. This study provides an effective and easily operated approach to accurately derive soybean planting areas from satellite images.

TI  - Evaluating the Sensitivity of Polarimetric Features Related to Rotation Domain and Mapping Chinese Fir AGB Using Quad-Polarimetric SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unaffected by cloud cover and solar illumination, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images coupled with quad-polarimetric techniques have significant potential for mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in the mountains of southern China. To improve the accuracy of mapping forest AGB, it is necessary to accurately interpret and evaluate the sensitivity of polarimetric features related to polarimetric response in complex forests. In this study, several rotated polarimetric features were extracted from L-band quad-polarimetric ALOS PALSAR-2 images based on uniform polarimetric matrix rotation theory. In addition, the sensitivity of rotated polarimetric features with forest parameters was evaluated by the Pearson correlation coefficient, sensitivity index (SI), and saturation levels. Ultimately, the forest AGB was mapped with various combinatorial feature sets by a proposed feature selection method based on the sensitivity index. The results illustrated that rotated polarimetric features extracted from the rotational domain have higher sensitivity with various forest parameters and higher saturation levels for mapping forests than other traditional features. After using the proposed feature selection method and combinatorial feature sets, the rRMSE of mapped forest AGB ranged from 22.5% to 33.9% for two acquired images, and the best result was obtained from the combination of three types of polarimetric features (BC + C4 + Ro). It is also confirmed that different types of features extracted from quad-polarimetric SAR images have better compensation effects and the accuracy of mapped forest AGB is significantly improved.

TI  - Simulation of Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Forest Carbon Stocks in Long Time Series-Based on Remote Sensing and Deep Learning
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complexity and difficulty of forest resource ground surveys, remote-sensing-based methods to assess forest resources and effectively plan management measures are particularly important, as they provide effective means to explore changes in forest resources over long time periods. The objective of this study was to monitor the spatiotemporal trends of the wood carbon stocks of the standing forests in the southeastern Xiaoxinganling Mountains by using Landsat remote sensing data collected between 1989 and 2021. Various remote sensing indicators for predicting carbon stocks were constructed based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We initially used a multiple linear regression model, a deep neural network model and a convolutional neural network model for exploring the spatiotemporal trends in carbon stocks. Finally, we chose the convolutional neural network model because it provided more robust predictions on the carbon stock on a pixel-by-pixel basis and hence mapping the spatial distribution of this variable. Savitzky-Golay filter smoothing was applied to the predicted annual average carbon stock to observe the overall trend, and a spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted. Sen's slope and the Mann-Kendall statistical test were used to monitor the spatial trends of the carbon stocks. It was found that 59.5% of the area showed an increasing trend, while 40.5% of the area showed a decreasing trend over the past 33 years, and the future trend of carbon stock development was plotted by combining the results with the Hurst exponent.

TI  - Flow regime changes in the Lancang River, revealed by integrated modelingwith multiple Earth observation datasets
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The flow regime change of rivers, especially transboundary rivers, affected by reservoir regulations is evident worldwide and has received much attention. Investigating dam-induced flow regime alterations is essential for understanding potential adverse downstream effects and facilitating dialogue around coordinated water use in transboundary basins, such as the Lancang River Basin (LRB). This study explored the value of combining several types of satellite Earth observation (EO) datasets that monitor different water balance components to constrain the parameter space of lumped conceptual hydrological models. Thus, we aimed to reconstruct the natural flow regimes upstream and downstream of the cascade reservoirs. Specifically, reservoir water storage changes were first estimated using satellite imagery and altimetry datasets. Then, storage changes were combined with hydrological model simulations of reservoir inflow to estimate the regulated flow regime downstream. Our results showed that integrated hydrological modeling combined with EO datasets exhibited better overall performance. Continuous warming and drying of the LRB resulted in a decrease in discharge of approximately 47 %. By comparing the simulated natural and regulated flow regimes, we revealed the pivotal role of the Xiaowan and Nuozhadu reservoirs in regulating natural flows. The wet season shortens (approximately 45 days), the flood peak flattens, and the low flow in the dry season has primarily increases. The two reservoirs attenuated 50 % of the flood peaks in the wet seasons and mitigated droughts by releasing up to 100 % of the natural flows in the dry seasons at the China-Laos border. Overall, these results enhance the understanding of upper reservoir operation, and the approaches can be applied to studies of dammed basins under climate change scenarios when knowledge of the upstream area is limited.

TI  - Mapping Fire Severity in Southwest China Using the Combination of Sentinel 2 and GF Series Satellite Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity mapping can capture heterogeneous fire severity patterns over large spatial extents. Although numerous remote sensing approaches have been established, regional-scale fire severity mapping at fine spatial scales (<5 m) from high-resolution satellite images is challenging. The fire severity of a vast forest fire that occurred in Southwest China was mapped at 2 m spatial resolution by random forest models using Sentinel 2 and GF series remote sensing images. This study demonstrated that using the combination of Sentinel 2 and GF series satellite images showed some improvement (from 85% to 91%) in global classification accuracy compared to using only Sentinel 2 images. The classification accuracy of unburnt, moderate, and high severity classes was significantly higher (>85%) than the accuracy of low severity classes in both cases. Adding high-resolution GF series images to the training dataset reduced the probability of low severity being under-predicted and improved the accuracy of the low severity class from 54.55% to 72.73%. RdNBR was the most important feature, and the red edge bands of Sentinel 2 images had relatively high importance. Additional studies are needed to explore the sensitivity of different spatial scales satellite images for mapping fire severity at fine spatial scales across various ecosystems.

TI  - Coseismic Deformation Field and Fault Slip Distribution Inversion of the 2020 Jiashi <i>Ms</i> 6.4 Earthquake: Considering the Atmospheric Effect with Sentinel-1 Data Interferometry
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to some limitations associated with the atmospheric residual phase in Sentinel-1 data interferometry during the Jiashi earthquake, the detailed spatial distribution of the line-of-sight (LOS) surface deformation field is still not fully understood. This study, therefore, proposes an inversion method of coseismic deformation field and fault slip distribution, taking atmospheric effect into account to address this issue. First, an improved inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation tropospheric decomposition model is utilised to accurately estimate the turbulence component in tropospheric delay. Using the joint constraints of the corrected deformation fields, the geometric parameters of the seismogenic fault and the distribution of coseismic slip are then inverted. The findings show that the coseismic deformation field (long axis strike was nearly east-west) was distributed along the Kalpingtag fault and the Ozgertaou fault, and the earthquake was found to occur in the low dip thrust nappe structural belt at the subduction interface of the block. Correspondingly, the slip model further revealed that the slips were concentrated at depths between 10 and 20 km, with a maximum slip of 0.34 m. Accordingly, the seismic magnitude of the earthquake was estimated to be Ms 6.06. Considering the geological structure in the earthquake region and the fault source parameters, we infer that the Kepingtag reverse fault is responsible for the earthquake, and the improved IDW interpolation tropospheric decomposition model can perform atmospheric correction more effectively, which is also beneficial for the source parameter inversion of the Jiashi earthquake.

TI  - Assessment of the Capability of Landsat and BiodivMapR to Track the Change of Alpha Diversity in Dryland Disturbed by Mining
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed spectral diversity is a promising method for investigating biodiversity. However, studies designed to assess the effectiveness of tracking changes in diversity using historical satellite imagery are lacking. This study employs open-access multispectral Landsat imagery and the BiodivMapR package to estimate the multi-temporal alpha diversity in drylands affected by mining. Multi-temporal parameters of alpha diversity were identified, such as vegetation indices, buffer zone size, and the number of clusters. Variations in alpha diversity were compared for various plant communities over time. The results showed that this method could effectively assess the alpha diversity of vegetation (R-2, 0.68). The optimal parameters used to maximize the accuracy of alpha diversity were NDVI threshold, 0.01; size of buffer zones, 120 m x 120 m; number of clusters, 100. The root mean square error of the alpha diversity of herbs was lowest (0.26), while those of shrub and tree communities were higher (0.34-0.41). During the period 1990-2020, the study area showed an overall trend of increasing diversity, with surface mining causing a significant decrease in diversity when compared with underground mining. This illustrates that the quick development of remote sensing and image processing techniques offers new opportunities for monitoring diversity in both single and multiple time phases. Researchers should consider the plant community types involved and select locally suitable parameters. In the future, the generation of long-time series and finer resolution maps of diversity should be studied further in the aspects of spatial, functional, taxonomic, and phylogenetic diversity.

TI  - Scattering-Point-Guided RPN for Oriented Ship Detection in SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has attracted widespread attention due to its significance and challenges. In recent years, numerous detectors based on deep learning have achieved good performance in the field of SAR ship detection. However, ship targets of the same type always have various representations in SAR images under different imaging conditions, while different types of ships may have a high degree of similarity, which considerably complicates SAR target recognition. Meanwhile, the ship target in the SAR image is also obscured by background and noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel oriented ship detection method in SAR images named SPG-OSD. First, we propose an oriented two-stage detection module based on the scattering characteristics. Second, to reduce false alarms and missing ships, we improve the performance of the network by incorporating SAR scattering characteristics in the first stage of the detector. A scattering-point-guided region proposal network (RPN) is designed to predict possible key scattering points and make the regression and classification stages of RPN increase attention to the vicinity of key scattering points and reduce attention to background and noise. Third, supervised contrastive learning is introduced to alleviate the problem of minute discrepancies among SAR object classes. Region-of-Interest (RoI) contrastive loss is proposed to enhance inter-class distinction and diminish intra-class variance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the SAR ship detection dataset from the Gaofen-3 satellite, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SPG-OSD and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - Hazard assessment model of ground subsidence coupling AHP, RS and GIS - A case study of Shanghai
T2  - GONDWANA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban ground subsidence (GS) causes ground elevation loss, threatens the safe operation of various facil-ities, and affects surface runoff and hydrological circulation. Therefore, it is vital to monitor the current status of GS to predict and evaluate potential risks to sustainable urban development. Sentinel SAR images from 2019 to 2020 combined with the data from the 2019-2020 Statistical Yearbook were used as data sources. Based on PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR, GIS was integrated with the AHP method. A ground subsidence risk evaluation index (REI) suitable for Shanghai was developed regarding three aspects of the amount of accumulated land subsidence (RS obtained): subsidence rate, and terrain elevation. The vul-nerability evaluation index (VEI) was established from five aspects: population density, GDP per unit area, the proportion of construction land, viaduct density, and metro density. We introduced the fuzzy AHP method to complete the risk assessment of ground subsidence in Shanghai and obtained the ground sub-sidence hazard index (GSHI). We used GIS superimposed remote sensing images to visualize the individ-ual evaluation indicators REI, VEI, and GSHI. Using GIS superimposed remote sensing images, various evaluation indicators and GSHI were visualized. Based on the evaluation results, targeted prevention and control recommendations are provided. The results of this research can provide a basis for scientific decision-making regarding Shanghai's territorial spatial planning and socio-economic development.(c) 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research.

TI  - Recognition of Abnormal Individuals Based on Lightweight Deep Learning Using Aerial Images in Complex Forest Landscapes: A Case Study of Pine Wood Nematode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Individuals with abnormalities are key drivers of subtle stress changes in forest ecosystems. Although remote sensing monitoring and deep learning have been developed for forest ecosystems, they are faced with the complexity of forest landscapes, multiple sources of remote sensing data, high monitoring costs, and complex terrain, which pose significant challenges to automatic identification. Therefore, taking pine nematode disease as an example, this paper proposes D-SCNet, an intelligent monitoring network for abnormal individuals applicable to UAV visible images. In this method, the convolutional block attention model and simplified dense block are introduced to enhance the semantic analysis ability of abnormal individual identification, use multi-level information of abnormal individuals well, enhance feature transfer as well as feature weights between network layers, and selectively focus on abnormal features of individuals while reducing feature redundancy and parameter and improving monitoring accuracy and efficiency. This method uses lightweight deep learning models through weak information sources to achieve rapid monitoring of a large range of abnormal individuals in complex environments. With the advantages of low cost, high efficiency, and simple data sources, it is expected to further enhance the practicality and universality of intelligent monitoring of anomalous individuals by UAV remote sensing.

TI  - Exploring Contrastive Representation for Weakly-Supervised Glacial Lake Extraction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the background of the ongoing atmospheric warming, the glacial lakes that are nourished and expanded in High Mountain Asia pose growing risks of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) hazards and increasing threats to the downstream areas. Effectively extracting the area and consistently monitoring the dynamics of these lakes are of great significance in predicting and preventing GLOF events. To automatically extract the lake areas, many deep learning (DL) methods capable of capturing the multi-level features of lakes have been proposed in segmentation and classification tasks. However, the portability of these supervised DL methods need to be improved in order to be directly applied to different data sources, as they require laborious effort to collect the labeled lake masks. In this work, we proposed a simple glacial lake extraction model (SimGL) via weakly-supervised contrastive learning to extend and improve the extraction performances in cases that lack the labeled lake masks. In SimGL, a Siamese network was employed to learn similar objects by maximizing the similarity between the input image and its augmentations. Then, a simple Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) map was provided as the location cue instead of the labeled lake masks to constrain the model to capture the representations related to the glacial lakes and the segmentations to coincide with the true lake areas. Finally, the experimental results of the glacial lake extraction on the 1540 Landsat-8 image patches showed that our approach, SimGL, offers a competitive effort with some supervised methods (such as Random Forest) and outperforms other unsupervised image segmentation methods in cases that lack true image labels.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Evolution and Prediction of Habitat Quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region Based on Land Use Change
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to solve the problem of habitat fragmentation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and realize the sustainable use of land, based on remote sensing data from 2010 to 2020, this paper uses GIS and the CA-Markov model to predict the land use structure in 2030, and uses the InVEST model to quantitatively analyze the changes in habitat quality in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2010 to 2030. The results indicate that (1) from 2010 to 2020, the area of construction land increased significantly, mainly from cultivated land, woodland and grassland; the proportion of cultivated land decreased by 7.2%. It was predicted that by 2030, the area of construction land will continue to expand, accounting for 19.6%. According to the results of land use dynamic degree, the conversion speed between land types in 2010-2015 was higher than that in 2015-2020. (2) The average habitat quality indexes of the study area in 2010, 2015, 2020 and 2030 were 0.57, 0.56, 0.55 and 0.52, respectively, and the habitat quality level was moderate and continued to decline. The habitat center of gravity moved in the north, from Fengning Manchu Autonomous County to the junction of Fengning Manchu Autonomous County and Longhua County, and then moved to the Mentougou District of Beijing. Therefore, in order to amendthe continuous decline in habitat quality, scientific measures should be taken according to local conditions to promote the improvement of habitat quality and the rational use of land.

TI  - Spatial Correlations of Land Use Carbon Emissions in Shandong Peninsula Urban Agglomeration: A Perspective from City Level Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal characteristics of land use carbon emissions are relevant to the sustainable use of land resources. Although spatial and temporal studies have been conducted on land use carbon emissions, the spatial correlation of land use carbon emissions at the city level still requires further research. Here, we estimated the distribution of carbon emissions at the city level in Shandong Peninsula urban agglomeration in spatial and temporal terms based on land use remote sensing data and fossil energy consumption data during 2000-2019. The results showed that the land use change in the 16 cities in the study area was the conversion of cropland to construction land. Carbon emissions from land use had an upward trend for all 16 cities overall during the period of 2000-2019, but the incremental carbon emissions trended downward after 2010. Among them, Jinan and Qingdao had higher carbon emissions than other cities. In addition, we also found that land use carbon emissions at the city level were characterized by stochasticity, while per capita carbon emissions displayed geospatial aggregation. Among them, Yantai displayed a spatial pattern of high-high clustering of carbon emissions, while Jining presented a spatial pattern of low-low clustering in terms of land-average carbon emissions and carbon emissions per capita during 2000-2019. The results of the study are important for guiding the achievement of urban carbon emission reduction and carbon neutrality targets at the city level.

TI  - A domain specific knowledge extraction transformer method for multisource satellite-borne SAR detection
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have different probability distributions. Traditional supervised learning, consequently, cannot achieve good test performance on one novel satellite -borne SAR dataset while training a good model on another existing satellite-borne SAR dataset. In this article, a domain adaptation (DA) Transformer object detection method is proposed to solve the unlabeled multisource satellite-borne SAR image object detection problem. Unlike existing DA methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN) that focus more on multi-level local feature extraction, we choose to use Vision Transformer (ViT) Faster region CNN (FRCNN) as the baseline network to cope with the extraction of global features of SAR images. Then, two classification tokens are used to learn the mapping of different domains and fully extract domain-specific knowledge, generating two different feature spaces that rely on the original label and pseudo-label to train the source and target domains feature spaces, respectively. Besides, the pseudo-label of target domain is also refined and reconstructed by feature clustering in order to improve the accuracy of target domain knowledge. Finally, the original detection head of FRCNN is employed to detect the target domain SAR image objects. Extensive experiments on image datasets from multisource satellite-borne SAR such as Gaofen-3, TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and RadarSAT-2 show that compared to the other state of the art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method can achieve the greatest object detection accuracy. Especially, taking the recently proposed Transformer-based method as an example, our method has more than 5% improvement in accuracy and more than 16% reduction in training time.

TI  - Canopy structure: An intermediate factor regulating grassland diversity-function relationships under human disturbances
T2  - FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are one of the largest coupled human-nature terrestrial ecosystems on Earth, and severe anthropogenic-induced grassland ecosystem function declines have been reported recently. Understanding factors influencing grassland ecosystem functions is critical for making sustainable management policies. Canopy structure is an important factor influencing plant growth through mediating within-canopy microclimate (e.g., light, water, and wind), and it is found coordinating tightly with plant species diversity to influence forest ecosystem functions. However, the role of canopy structure in regulating grassland ecosystem functions along with plant species diver-sity has been rarely investigated. Here, we investigated this problem by collecting field data from 170 field plots distributed along an over 2000 km transect across the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China. Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and resilience, two indicators of grassland ecosystem functions, were measured from field data and satellite remote sensing data. Terrestrial laser scanning data were collected to measure canopy structure (represented by mean height and canopy cover). Our results showed that plant species diversity was positively correlated to canopy structural traits, and negatively correlated to human activity intensity. Canopy structure was a significant indicator for ANPP and resilience, but their correlations were inconsistent under dif-ferent human activity intensity levels. Compared to plant species diversity, canopy structural traits were better indicators for grassland ecosystem functions, especially for ANPP. Through structure equation modeling analy-ses, we found that plant species diversity did not have a direct influence on ANPP under human disturbances. Instead, it had a strong indirect effect on ANPP by altering canopy structural traits. As to resilience, plant species diversity had both a direct positive contribution and an indirect contribution through mediating canopy cover. This study highlights that canopy structure is an important intermediate factor regulating grassland diversity -function relationships under human disturbances, which should be included in future grassland monitoring and management.

TI  - A Channel Imbalance Calibration Scheme with Distributed Targets for Circular Quad-Polarization SAR with Reciprocal Crosstalk
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As polarimetric antennas can be isolated through excellent electronic frameworks in circular quad-polarization (CQP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, cross-polarization (x-pol) and co-polarization (co-pol) channel imbalances are more challenging and essential to calibrate than crosstalk in polarimetric calibration (PolCAL). In uncalibrated CQP SAR images without corner reflectors (CRs), the reciprocity and reflection symmetry assumptions of the distributed targets are commonly used to estimate the x-pol and co-pol channel imbalances, respectively. To suppress the influence of additive noise on determining channel imbalances through distributed targets, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distributed targets should be obtained from the x-pol and co-pol channels of the CQP SAR images: namely, surface-dominated and volume-dominated targets. However, some reflection symmetry assumptions used in the existing calibration literature have poor applicability with volume-dominated targets, resulting in unsatisfactory estimation results for the co-pol channel imbalance phase. In this paper, we assess the priority of the reflection symmetry properties of volume-dominated targets used to calibrate the co-pol channel imbalance phase in CQP SAR data synthesized from linear quad-polarization data of ALOS, GF-3, and RADARSAT-2. In the theoretical part, high-priority reflection symmetry (termed semireflection symmetry) assumptions are confirmed as the most suitable for estimating the co-pol channel imbalance phase, and were selected to develop an algorithm for estimating the co-pol channel imbalance phase. Furthermore, based on the novel method for estimating the co-pol channel imbalance phase, a channel imbalance calibration scheme is proposed for CQP SAR systems with reciprocal crosstalk, including extracting surface-dominated and volume-dominated targets, and estimating and filtering channel imbalances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme with CRs in simulated CQP SAR images. The experimental results show that the calibration scheme is an effective workflow for estimating channel imbalances in CQP SAR systems with reciprocal crosstalk.

TI  - An Algorithm to Retrieve Precipitable Water Vapor from Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most important greenhouse gases, water vapor plays a vital role in various weather and climate processes. In recent years, a near-infrared ratio technique based on satellite images has become a research hotspot in the field of precipitable water vapor (PWV) monitoring. This study proposes a Level 2A PWV data retrieval method based on Sentinel-2 images (S2-L2A), which considers land-cover types and is more suitable for local areas. The radiative transfer model MODTRAN 5 is used to simulate the atmospheric radiative transfer process and obtain lookup tables (LUTs) for PWV retrieval. The spatial distribution of S2-L2A PWV is validated using Global Positioning System (GPS), Terra-MODIS PWV product (MOD05), and Level 2A product provided by ESA (ESA-L2A), while the time series results are evaluated using MOD05. Results show that the PWV retrieved by S2-L2A is both highly correlated and has low bias with the three PWV products, and is closer to the reference data than the MOD05 and ESA-L2A PWV. The relative PWV value in the morning is: bare soil > vegetation-covered area > construction land; as the elevation increases, the PWV value decreases. This study also analyzes the error distribution of the PWV data retrieved by S2-L2A, and finds that inversion error increases with AOT value, but decreases with elevation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Compared with the three water vapor products, the PWV data retrieved by the proposed method has high accuracy and can provide large-scale and high-spatial-resolution PWV data for many research fields, such as agriculture and meteorology.

TI  - Aerosol Physical-Optical Properties under Different Stages of Continuous Wet Weather over the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distributions and physical-optical properties of aerosols are of great scientific significance for the study of climate change and atmospheric environment. What are the characteristics of aerosols in constant high humidity? Continuous wet weather (CWW) is a special weather phenomenon that occurs frequently during the late winter and early spring in South China. In this study, the CALIPSO satellite data and the ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis data are used to analyze the aerosol optical properties of a total of 68 CWW processes from 2012 to 2021 in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA). We attempt to explore the variations in meteorological conditions and physical-optical properties of aerosols during the before-stage, wet-stage, and after-stage under different humidity levels. The results show that the prevailing wind direction is northeasterly and that the temperature and humidity are lower under the influence of cold high pressure in the before-stage. Moreover, the high aerosol optical depth (AOD) mainly results from regional transport. During the wet-stage, clean ocean airflow causes AOD to remain at a low level, whereas temperature and humidity increase significantly. The wet-stage ends with coldness when it is controlled by cold high pressure again. The atmospheric circulation in the after-stage is similar to that in the before-stage. However, a remarkable feature is that there is a temperature and humidity inversion layer, which results in a significant increase in AOD. This study reveals the physical-optical properties of aerosols during the three stages and the influence mechanism of meteorological factors on aerosols, which can provide a scientific basis for the study of CWW in the future.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of Gaofen-2 Panchromatic Satellite Images
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Due to the sub-meter higher spatial resolution of panchromatic satellite images, the imaging process is easily affected by atmospheric scattering and absorption and adjacency effect under low atmospheric visibility, resulting in blurred edges of image objects and reduced image quality, and seriously affects the accuracy of quantitative remote sensing application. Before the application of panchromatic satellite image, atmospheric correction should be carried out to improve image quality. At present, the conventional atmospheric correction software can not correct the panchromatic satellite image, so the digital image processing method is often used to improve the quality of panchromatic satellite image. However, the digital image processing method often brings the problems of noise and excessive enhancement while improving the image quality. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a set of atmospheric correction methods suitable for panchromatic satellite images, eliminate the influence of atmosphere and surrounding environment on the target pixel satellite entry pupil signal, recover the real surface information, and improve image quality in the panchromatic satellite image quantitative remote sensing application.Methods Taking the panchromatic satellite image of GF-2 as an example, this paper develops a set of atmospheric correction method for panchromatic satellite image by using the atmospheric radiative transfer model and the exponential decay point spread function. This method is simple to calculate, and fully considers the influence of atmospheric parameters (parameters of aerosol, water vapor, ozone, and other absorbing gases), spatial resolution, and adjacency effect between background pixels and target pixels on the entry pupil signal of target pixels, which further improves the image quality on the premise of ensuring the truth of panchromatic satellite image information. As an important evaluation index of an optical satellite imaging system, the modulation transfer function (MTF) can comprehensively and objectively characterize the sharpness of the image edge and the expression degree of spatial details, and its value can directly reflect the quality of imaging. Therefore, in order to comprehensively evaluate the quality of panchromatic satellite images after atmospheric correction, the traditional image quality evaluation indexes (clarity, contrast, edge energy, and detail energy) and MTF are simultaneously adopted in this paper to comprehensively and fully evaluate the atmospheric correction results.Results and Discussions The atmospheric correction method for panchromatic satellite images developed in this paper is used to correct the GF-2 panchromatic satellite images of Baotou calibration site under two atmosphere conditions: clean atmosphere and polluted atmosphere. The results show that whether the atmospheric conditions are polluted or clean, the visual effect of the corrected panchromatic satellite images has been improved, the contours of ground objects become clear, the texture information is more abundant, and the recognition of ground objects has also been significantly improved. For high resolution panchromatic satellite images, the atmospheric correction method ignoring the adjacency effect can only improve the image brightness, but does not improve image clarity much. Especially in the case of air pollution, the edge of ground objects in the corrected image is still relatively fuzzy, which is not conducive to the visual interpretation of the image and the extraction of ground objects contour. This further proves that adjacency effect correction is essential for high resolution panchromatic satellite images. By comparing the quality evaluation parameters of each image before and after correction, it can be seen intuitively that the clarity increases by at least 155%, the contrastincreases by at least 115%, the edge energy increases by at least 247%, the detail energy increases by at least 204%, and MTF increases by at least 169%.Conclusions Based on the 6SV radiative transfer model, the atmospheric correction method developed in this paper combines the atmospheric point spread function based on the exponential decay model, and fully considers the influence of atmospheric parameters (parameters of aerosol, water vapor, ozone and other absorbing gases), spatial resolution, and the spatial distance between background pixels and target pixels on the adjacency effect. It can effectively remove the influence of atmosphere and surrounding environment on the satellite load entry pupil signal in the process of panchromatic satellite image imaging, recover the surface truth information in the imaging area which is covered by atmospheric influence, and fully improve the quality of panchromatic satellite image under low atmospheric visibility. After the evaluation of the corrected panchromatic satellite image quality, it is found that compared with the traditional image quality evaluation index, MTF can better reflect the improvement and promotion of the sub-meter panchromatic satellite image quality by the proximity effect correction, which highlights the indispensability of the adjacency effect correction in the atmospheric correction of the panchromatic satellite image. At the same time, the trend of MTF curve and the level of the value can reflect the spatial acuity of the image and the advantages and advantages of the image quality more comprehensively and objectively. Therefore, MTF index is recommended to be included in the image quality evaluation system when sub-meter satellite images (such as panchromatic satellite images) are evaluated.

TI  - Night-Time Detection of Subpixel Emitters with VIIRS Mid-Wave Infrared Bands M12-M13
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a new approach to subpixel infrared (IR) emitter detection in VIIRS mid-wave (MWIR) infrared bands M12-M13 at night, based on the presence of a tightly clustered background diagonal present in full granule scattergrams of M12 versus M13 radiances. This diagonal is found universally in night-time VIIRS data collected worldwide. The diagonal feature is absent during the day due to solar reflectance. The existence of the diagonal is attributed to close spacing in the bandpass centers of the VIIRS' two MWIR bands. Apparently, the M12 and M13 emissivities are highly correlated to background objects, such clouds, ocean and land surfaces. The VIIRS Nightfire (VNF) algorithm detects pixels containing IR emitters based on their departure from the background diagonal. This paper outlines the method and compares VNF results with those from MODIS and VIIRS hotspot detection.

TI  - Evaluation and Analysis of Remotely Sensed Water Vapor from the NASA VIIRS/SNPP Product in Mainland China Using GPS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is a vitally important factor in atmospheric circulation. PWV is significant for forecasting extreme weather and understanding the dynamics of climate change. Comprehensively evaluating the performance of newly proposed remotely sensed water vapor products is crucial for guaranteeing their suitability for futural PWV applications. In this study, the accuracy of the recently established remotely sensed water vapor product from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) (VIIRS-PWV) platform within various regions of mainland China was evaluated via the PWV from Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. The GPS-derived PWV from 231 stations of the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) from 2012 to 2018 was obtained through precise point positioning (PPP) techniques. The results showed that the mean value of the correlation coefficient (CC), the mean bias (MB), and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the VIIRS-PWV and the GPS-PWV were 0.92, -1.6 mm, and 4.7 mm, respectively. These values were comparable with the results of the PWV data derived from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. This indicates that the VIIRS product could provide PWV data with satisfactory accuracy for large-area scientific applications. Moreover, the MB and RMSE of the differences between the GPS-PWV and VIIRS-PWV showed obvious seasonal variations. The VIIRS-PWV generally performed better in winter (with the MB and RMSE values of 0.1 mm and 2.3 mm) than in summer (with the MB and RMSE values of -4.4 and 7.0 mm). Analysis among different regions revealed that the Central South (CS) region of China attained the largest mean RMSE value of 6.3 mm, and the North West (NW) region attained the smallest mean RMSE value of 3.8 mm. In addition, the southern region of China obtained a mean RMSE value of 5.6 mm, while that for the northern region of China was 3.9 mm. This indicates that the VIIRS-PWV has better accuracy within the northern region of China than within the southern region.

TI  - Rice Yield Prediction in Hubei Province Based on Deep Learning and the Effect of Spatial Heterogeneity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate crop yield information can ensure regional food security. In the field of predicting crop yields, deep learning techniques such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are frequently employed. Many studies have shown that the predictions of models combining the two are better than those of single models. Crop growth can be reflected by the vegetation index calculated using data from remote sensing. However, the use of pure remote sensing data alone ignores the spatial heterogeneity of different regions. In this paper, we tested a total of three models, CNN-LSTM, CNN and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), for predicting the annual rice yield at the county level in Hubei Province, China. The model was trained by ERA5 temperature (AT) data, MODIS remote sensing data including the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Soil-Adapted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and a dummy variable representing spatial heterogeneity; rice yield data from 2000-2019 were employed as labels. Data download and processing were based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). The downloaded remote sensing images were processed into normalized histograms for the training and prediction of deep learning models. According to the experimental findings, the model that included a dummy variable to represent spatial heterogeneity had a stronger predictive ability than the model trained using just remote sensing data. The prediction performance of the CNN-LSTM model outperformed the CNN or ConvLSTM model.

TI  - A Method to Construct an Environmental Vulnerability Model Based on Multi-Source Data to Evaluate the Hazard of Short-Term Precipitation-Induced Flooding
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood hazards resulting from short-term severe precipitation have caused serious social and economic losses and have posed extraordinary threats to the safety of lives and property. Vulnerability, which reflects the degree of the adverse impact of flooding on a city, the sensitivity of the environment, and the extent to which rescues are possible during flooding, is one of the significant factors of the disaster risk assessment. Because of this, this paper proposes an Environmental Vulnerability Analysis Model (EVAM), based on comprehensively evaluating multi-source remote sensing data. The EVAM includes a two-stage, short-term flood vulnerability assessment. In the first stage, the flood's areal extension and land-use classification are extracted, based on the U-NET++ network, using multi-source satellite remote sensing images. The results from the first stage are used in the second stage of vulnerability assessment. In the second stage, combining multi-source data with associated feature extraction results establishes the Exposure-Sensitivity-Adaptive capacity framework. The short-term flood vulnerability index is leveraged through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the entropy method is calculated for an environmental vulnerability evaluation. This novel proposed framework for short-term flood vulnerability evaluation is demonstrated for the Henan Province. The experimental results show that the proportion of vulnerable cities in the Henan Province ranging from high to low is 22.22%, 22.22%, 38.89%, and 16.67%, respectively. The relevant conclusions can provide a scientific basis for regional flood control and risk management as well as corresponding data support for post-disaster reconstruction in disaster regions.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Algal Bloom Identification Method from Remote Sensing Images-Take China's Chaohu Lake as an Example
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate monitoring of algal blooms using remote sensing techniques is an effective means for the prevention and control of algal blooms. Traditional methods often have difficulty achieving the balance between interpretative accuracy and efficiency. The advantages of a deep learning method bring new possibilities to the rapid and precise identification of algal blooms using images. In this paper, taking Chaohu Lake as the study area, a dual U-Net model (including a U-Net network for spring and winter and a U-Net network for summer and autumn) is proposed for the identification of algal blooms using remote sensing images according to the different traits of the algae in different seasons. First, the spectral reflection characteristics of the algae in Chaohu Lake in different seasons are analyzed, and sufficient samples are selected for the training of the proposed model. Then, by adding an attention gate architecture to the classical U-Net framework, which can enhance the capability of the network on feature extraction, the dual U-Net model is constructed and trained for the identification of algal blooms in different seasons. Finally, the identification results are obtained by inputting remote sensing data into the model. The experimental results show that the interpretation accuracy of the proposed deep learning model is higher than 90% in most cases with the fastest processing time being less than 10 s, which achieves much better performance than the traditional supervised classification method and also outperforms the single U-Net model using data of whole year as the training samples. Furthermore, the profiles of algal blooms are well-captured.

TI  - Dynamic Response of Atmospheric and Ocean Parameters and Their Relation to Typhoon Haikui (2012) Using Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon Haikui (2012) occurred in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, and landfall on the east coast of China brought heavy rainfall with strong winds. Because of Typhoon Haikui, sea surface temperature (SST) cooling of 3 degrees C occurred on the right side of the track, mainly due to Ekman transport and upwelling. SST cooling on the left side was lower than on the right side, mainly due to the rainfall. Heavy precipitation occurred on both sides of the typhoon track; however, rainfall was higher on the left side of the typhoon track. This paper explains the dynamic process between atmospheric and oceanographic parameters and verifies the variations in chlorophyll and sea surface height data before, during, and after the typhoon. Typhoon Haikui demonstrates dynamic variations and intuitively illustrates the relationship between the ocean and atmospheric parameters.

TI  - DEM Generation from GF-7 Satellite Stereo Imagery Assisted by Space-Borne LiDAR and Its Application to Active Tectonics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China's first optical stereo mapping satellite with a sub-meter resolution, GaoFen-7 (GF-7), launched in November 2019, shows significant potential for providing high-resolution topographic and geomorphic data for quantitative research on active tectonics. However, no studies have evaluated the capability of the GF-7-generated digital elevation model (DEM) for quantitatively studying active tectonics. This study aimed to validate the accuracy of the DEMs extracted from GF-7 stereo imagery, with or without ground control points (GCPs), and evaluated the potential of applying GF-7 DEMs to active tectonics. First, GF-7 stereo images were processed to obtain DEMs with a spatial resolution of 2 m, utilizing three different methods, including block adjustment without GCPs, block adjustment with the aid of Google Earth images and SRTM DEM, and block adjustment with GCPs derived from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data. These three generated DEMs were called GF-7 DEMMethod1, GF-7 DEMMethod2, and GF-7 DEMMethod3, respectively, and were verified by the airborne LiDAR data in the Hasishan section of the Haiyuan fault. Second, the capability of the GF-7 DEMs for identifying active faults, fault scarps, and horizontal offsets was evaluated. Finally, 8 vertical and 13 horizontal offsets were measured based on three different GF-7 DEMs, and airborne LiDAR data were used to verify the measurements' accuracies. The results indicated that the accuracy of GF-7 DEMMethod1 was the worst and that of GF-7 DEMMethod3 was superior to that of GF-7 DEMMethod2. The GF-7 DEMs could effectively identify the apparent fault scarps and horizontal offsets. The RMSE values of the vertical offsets measured based on GF-7 DEMMethod1, GF-7 DEMMethod2, and GF-7 DEMMethod3 were 0.55 m, 0.55 m, and 0.41 m, respectively. The horizontal offsets yielded RMSE values of 3.98 m, 2.52 m, and 1.37 m, respectively. These findings demonstrated that vertical and horizontal offsets could be accurately measured using the DEMs generated from GF-7 stereo images. Meanwhile, our study indicated that the GCPs derived from ICESat-2 data could be utilized to improve the accuracies of the GF-7 DEM, and the measurements of vertical and horizontal offsets.

TI  - Interannual Variation of Landfast Ice Using Ascending and Descending Sentinel-1 Images from 2019 to 2021: A Case Study of Cambridge Bay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast ice has undergone a dramatic decline in recent decades, imposing potentialeffects on ice travel for coastal populations, habitats for marine biota, and ice use for industries.The mapping of landfast ice deformation and the investigation of corresponding causes of changesare urgent tasks that can provide substantial data to support the maintenance of the stability of theArctic ecosystem and the development of human activities on ice. This work aims to investigate thetime-series deformation characteristics of landfast ice at multi-year scales and the correspondinginfluence factors. For the landfast ice deformation monitoring technique, we first combined the smallbaseline subset approach with ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images to obtain the line-of-sightdeformations for two flight directions, and then we derived the 2D deformation fields comprising thevertical and horizontal directions for the corresponding periods by introducing a transform model.The vertical deformation results were mostly within the interval [-65, 23] cm, while the horizontaldisplacement was largely within the range of [-26, 78] cm. Moreover, the magnitude of deformationobserved in 2019 was evidently greater than those in 2020 and 2021. In accordance with the availabledata, we speculate that the westerly wind and eastward-flowing ocean currents are the dominantreasons for the variation in the horizontal direction in Cambridge Bay, while the factors causingspatial differences in the vertical direction are the sea-level tilt and ice growth. For the interannualvariation, the leading cause is the difference in sea-level tilt. These results can assist in predicting thefuture deformation of landfast ice and provide a reference for on-ice activities.

TI  - Characterization of Bias in Fengyun-4B/AGRI Infrared Observations Using RTTOV
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As China's first operational second-generation geostationary satellite, Fengyun-4B carries the newly developed Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI), which adds a low-level water vapor detection channel and an adjusted spectrum range of four channels to improve the quality of observation. To characterize biases of the infrared (IR) channels of Fengyun-4B/AGRI, RTTOV was applied to simulate the brightness temperature of the IR channels during the period of Fengyun-4B trial operation (from June to November 2022) under clear-sky conditions based on ERA5 reanalysis, which may provide beneficial information for the operational applications of Fengyun-4B/AGRI, such as data assimilation and severe weather monitoring. The results are as follows: (1) due to the sun's influence on the satellite instrument, the brightness temperature observations of the Fengyun-4B/AGRI 3.75 mu m channel were abnormally high around 1500 UTC in October, although the data producer made efforts to eliminate abnormal data; (2) the RTTOV simulations were in good agreement with the observations, and the absolute mean biases of the RTTOV simulations were less than 1.39 K over the ocean, and less than 1.77 K over land, for all IR channels under clear-sky conditions, respectively; (3) for the variation of spatial distribution bias over land, channels 12-15 were more obvious than channels 9-11, which indicates that the skin temperature of ERA-5 reanalysis and surface emissivity may have greater spatial uncertainty than the water vapor profile; (4) the biases and standard deviations of Fengyun-4B/AGRI channels 9-15 had negligible dependence on the satellite zenith angles over the ocean, while the standard deviation of channels 8 and 12 had a positive correlation with satellite zenith angles when the satellite zenith angles were larger than 30 degrees; and (5) the biases and standard deviations of Fengyun-4B/AGRI IR channels showed scene brightness temperature dependence over the ocean.

TI  - THE IMAGE OF PETER I IN THE RUSSIAN MIND
T2  - PSIKHOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article shows that the personality of Peter I occupies an important place in the structure of public thought, but often receives conflicting assessments. The task of the study was to study the image of the emperor in the minds of our contemporaries. The search was implemented by referring to the texts of messages about Peter I in social networks. In the course of the study, frequency, morphological and emotional analysis of texts was carried out. Along with the evaluation of the emotional, psychological and personal characteristics of the emperor, the authors carried out a meaningful analysis of the psychological characteristics of the attitude of users to the historical situation as a whole, which allows not only to describe the personal characteristics of the emperor, but also to demonstrate their place in the overall structure of assessments of his activities. The obtained results showed a respectful attitude of users to the achievements of the emperor with a pronounced emotional disagreement with the palette of some of his worldview beliefs. As private conclusions, it is shown that the interest of contemporaries (users of social networks) in the image of Peter I is more concentrated on progressive changes at the state level. The psychological image of Peter I is represented by detailed assessments. The main psychological features of the emperor are summarized in the minds of users into two enlarged subgroups - individual psychological and organizational and managerial. An analysis of the emotional background of the messages showed that when assessing the life of the emperor, a neutral background prevails, which may be due to the historical distance between eras. As prospects, the authors indicate methodological and applied areas of research that require additional research attention.

TI  - Radiative Energy Budget for East Asia Based on GK-2A/AMI Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The incident and emitted radiative energy data for the top of the atmosphere (TOA) are essential in climate research. Since East Asia (11-61 degrees N, 80-175 degrees E) is complexly composed of land and ocean, real-time satellite data are used importantly for analyzing the detailed energy budget or climate characteristics of this region. Therefore, in this study, the radiative energy budget for East Asia, during the year 2021, was analyzed using GEO-KOMPSAT-2A/Advanced Metrological Imager (GK-2A/AMI) and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts reanalysis (ERA5) data. The results showed that the net fluxes for the TOA and surface were -4.09 W center dot m(-2) and -8.24 W center dot m(-2), respectively. Thus, the net flux difference of 4.15 W center dot m(-2) between TOA and surface implied atmospheric warming. These results, produced by GK-2A/AMI, were well-matched with the ERA5 data. However, they varied with surface characteristics; the atmosphere over ocean areas warmed because of the large amounts of longwave radiation emitted from surfaces, while the atmosphere over the plain area was relatively balanced and the atmosphere over the mountain area was cooled because large amount of longwave radiation was emitted to space. Although the GK2A/AMI radiative products used for this study have not yet been sufficiently compared with surface observation data, and the period of data used was only one year, they were highly correlated with the CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System of USA), HIMAWARI/AHI (Geostationary Satellite of Japan), and ERA5 data. Therefore, if more GK-2A/AMI data are accumulated and analyzed, it could be used for the analysis of radiant energy budget and climate research for East Asia, and it will be an opportunity to greatly increase the utilization of total meteorological products of 52 types, including radiative products.

TI  - New Methodology for Shoreline Extraction Using Optical and Radar (SAR) Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal environments are dynamic ecosystems, constantly subject to erosion/accretion processes. Erosional trends have unfortunately been intensifying for decades due to anthropic factors and an accelerated sea level rise might exacerbate the problem. It is crucial to preserve these areas for safeguarding not only coastal ecosystems and cultural heritage, but also the population living there. In this context, monitoring coastal areas is essential and geomatics techniques, especially satellite remote sensing imagery, might prove very advantageous. In this paper, a semi-automatic methodology to extract shorelines from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) Sentinel-1 and optical Sentinel-2 satellite images was developed. An experimental algorithm, called J-Net Dynamic, was tested in two pilot sites. The semi-automatic methodology was validated with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) reference shorelines and demonstrated to be a powerful tool for a robust extraction of the shoreline both from optical and SAR images. The experimental algorithm was able to extract the shoreline closer to the reference with SAR images on the natural beach of Castelldefels and it was demonstrated to be less sensitive to speckle effects than the commonly used Canny Edge Detector. Using the SAR images of the urban beach of Somorrostro, the Canny detector was not able to extract the shoreline, while the new algorithm could do it but with low accuracy because of the noise induced by man-made structures. For further investigation, the Sentinel-2-extracted shorelines were also compared to the ones extracted by a state-of-the-art tool, CoastSat, in the two beaches using both automatic and manual thresholds. The mean errors obtained with J-Net Dynamic were generally higher than the ones from CoastSat using the manual threshold but lower if using the automatic one. The proposed methodology including the J-Net Dynamic algorithm proves to extract the shorelines closer to the reference in most of the cases and offers the great advantage of being able to work with both optical and SAR images. This feature could allow to reduce the time lag between satellite derived shorelines paving the way to an enhanced monitoring and management of coastal areas.

TI  - Potential of Satellite Spectral Resolution Vegetation Indices for Estimation of Canopy Chlorophyll Content of Field Crops: Mitigating Effects of Leaf Angle Distribution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) is critically important for agricultural production management. However, vegetation indices derived from canopy reflectance are influenced by canopy structure, which limits their application across species and seasonality. For horizontally homogenous canopies such as field crops, LAI and leaf inclination angle distribution or leaf mean tilt angle (MTA) are two biophysical characteristics determining canopy structure. Since CCC is relevant to LAI, MTA is the only structural parameter affecting the correlation between CCC and vegetation indices. To date, there are few vegetation indices designed to minimize MTA effects for CCC estimation. Herein, in this study, CCC-sensitive and MTA-insensitive satellite broadband vegetation indices are developed for crop canopy chlorophyll content estimation. The most efficient broadband vegetation indices for four satellite sensors (Sentinel-2, RapidEye, WorldView-2 and GaoFen-6) with red edge channels were identified (in the context of various vegetation index types) using simulated satellite broadband reflectance based on field measurements and validated with PROSAIL model simulations. The results indicate that developed vegetation indices present strong correlations with CCC and weak correlations with MTA, with overall R-2 of 0.76-0.80 and 0.84-0.95 for CCC and R-2 of 0.00 and 0.00-0.04 in the field measured data and model simulations, respectively. The best vegetation indices identified in this study are the soil-adjusted index type index SAI (B6, B7) for Sentinel-2, Verrelts's three-band spectral index type index BSI-V (NIR1, Red, Red Edge) for WorldView-2, Tian's three-band spectral index type index BSI-T (Red Edge, Green, NIR) for RapidEye and difference index type index DI (B6, B4) for GaoFen-6. The identified indices can potentially be used for crop CCC estimation across species and seasonality. However, real satellite datasets and more crop species need to be tested in further studies.

TI  - A comparative analysis of SLR, MLR, ANN, XGBoost and CNN for crop height estimation of sunflower using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable monitoring and determining the biophysical characteristics of crops is of global importance due to the increase in demand for food. In this context, remote sensing data provide valuable information on crops. This study investigates the relationship between the variables determined from both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images and crop height. For this purpose, backscatter (rVH, rVV, rVH / rVV) and coherence (YVH, YVV) of multi-temporal dual-polarized Sentinel-1 and vegetation indices of multi -temporal Sentinel-2 data are analyzed. Two indices, namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NDVI with the red-edge band (NDVIred), are interpreted to identify the contribution of the red-edge band over the near-infrared band. The Zile District of Tokat province in Turkey where dominantly sunflower cultivation is carried out, was selected as the study area. In the analysis of the data, Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), EXtreme Gradient Boost-ing (XGBoost), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were used. In the results of the study, ANN showed the lowest RMSE = 3. 083 cm (RMSE%= 11.284) in the stem elongation period. The CNN followed the lowest RMSE for the Inflorescence development and flowering stages 19.223 cm (RMSE%=15.458) and 8.731 cm (RMSE%=5.821), respectively. In the ripening period, XGBoost achieved the lowest RMSE = 8.731 cm (RMSE%=6.091). All the best models in four methods were created using common variables of rVH, rVV, YVH, YVV and NDVIred, except ANN which exclude coherence variables. The results concluded that NDVIred contributed more than NDVI which is widely interpreted in previous studies.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The state of the clinically evident cervical lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis is one of the most important factors impacting long-term survival. While squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the hard palate and maxillary alveolus are uncommon in comparison to other primary sites, there is a scarcity of published data on the effective management of the neck nodes for malignancies of these specific subsites. In such circumstances, an intraoperative frozen section or Sentinel node biopsy would aid in the optimal therapy of the neck.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mega wildfires are one of the environmental disasters worldwide. This study evaluates the pre-fire species diversity and the indirect effects, including habitat loss for one of the largest wildfires in Manavgat (Antalya-Turkey) in 2021, with a two-step methodology. Here, (1) burnt areas in the Manavgat district (2021) were detected with remote sensing data from Sentinel-2A by delta Normalized Burn Ratio calculation for a selected area in Google Earth Engine, and (2) mammals' habitat vector data of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List were integrated into Habitat and Biodiversity modelling of Terrset to analyze the alpha, beta, gamma diversity and Range Restriction Index for the wildfire region. In the total 4210 km2 study area, 696 km2 of the area was damaged by different fire severity; also, there were 56 mammal species' habitats here. These species include bats (i.e. Nyctalus leisleri), felids (i.e. Felis chaus), rodents (i.e. Rattus norvegicus) and large mammals (i.e. Ursus arctos). 88 % of these species are in IUCN's Least Concern category. The remaining classes are Near Threatened (3.7 %) and Vulnerable (7.4 %). This study also indicated that the burnt area's species rich-ness does not totally consist of endemic species. Therefore, pre-fire species richness analyses of this study can be a base for further studies about the species' post-fire activity and occupancy.Furthermore, the 2021 mega wildfires show us the necessity of wildfire monitoring and risk studies in the entire Mediterranean ecosys-tem to evaluate the risks to the Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, post-fire spatial data, fire migration monitorization, and recording of the species' activities should be performed temporally. In this way, the ability of wildlife's recovering, and the direct and indirect effects of the fire will be examined for ecosystems in the long term.(c) 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to estimate soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and investigate spatial distribution pattern of Yuksekova wetlands and surrounding lands in Hakkari province of Turkey using machine learning and remote sensing data. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from 10-cm depth in 50 locations differed with land use and land cover. Vegetation, soil, and moisture indices were calculated using Sentinel 2 Multispectral Sensor Instrument (MSI) data. Significant correlations (p <= 0.01) were obtained between the indices and SOCS; thus, the remote sensing indices (ARVI 0.43, BI -0.43, GSI -0.39, GNDI 0.44, NDVI 0.44, NDWI 0.38, and SRCI 0.51) were used as covariates in multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and gradient descent-boosted regression tree (GBDT) machine learning models. Mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error were 3.94 (Mg C ha (-1)), 6.64 (Mg C ha(-1)), and 9.97%, respectively. The simple ratio clay index (SRCI), which represents the soil texture, was the most important factor in the SOCS estimation variance. In addition, the relationship between SRCI and Topsoil Grain Size Index revealed that topsoil clay content is a highly important parameter in spatial variation of SOCS. The spatial SOCS values obtained using the GBDT model and the mean SOCS values of the CORINE land cover classes were significantly different. The land cover has a significant effect on SOC in Yuksekova plain. The mean SOCS for continuously ponded fields was 45.58 Mg C ha(-1), which was significantly different from the mean SOCS of arable lands. The mean SOCS in arable lands, with significant areas of natural vegetation, was 50.22 Mg C ha(-1) and this amount was significantly higher from the SOCS of other land covers (p<0.01). The wetlands had the highest SOCS (61.46 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by the lands principally occupied by natural vegetation and used as rangelands around the wetland (50.22 Mg C ha(-1)). Environmental conditions had significant effect on SOCS in the study area. The use of remote sensing indices instead of using single bands as estimators in the GBDT algorithm minimized radiometric errors, and reliable spatial SOCS information was obtained by using the estimators. Therefore, the spatial estimation of SOCS can be successfully determined with up-to-date machine learning algorithms only using remote sensing predictor variables. Reliable estimation of SOCS in wetlands and surrounding lands can help understand policy and decision makers the importance of wetlands in mitigating the negative impacts of global warming.

TI  - Infectious syphilis in women and heterosexual men in major Australian cities: sentinel surveillance data, 2011-2019
T2  - MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo examine changes in the positive infectious syphilis test rate among women and heterosexual men in major Australian cities, and rate differences by social, biomedical, and behavioural determinants of health. Design, settingAnalysis of data extracted from de-identified patient records from 34 sexual health clinics participating in the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance of Sexually Transmissible Infections and Blood Borne Viruses (ACCESS). ParticipantsFirst tests during calendar year for women and heterosexual men aged 15 years or more in major cities who attended ACCESS sexual health clinics during 2011-2019. Main outcome measuresPositive infectious syphilis test rate; change in annual positive test rate. Results180 of 52 221 tested women (0.34%) and 239 of 36 341 heterosexual men (0.66%) were diagnosed with infectious syphilis. The positive test rate for women was 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-3.2) per 1000 tests in 2011, 3.0 (95% CI, 2.0-4.2) per 1000 tests in 2019 (change per year: rate ratio [RR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.25); for heterosexual men it was 6.1 (95% CI, 3.8-9.2) per 1000 tests in 2011 and 7.6 (95% CI, 5.6-10) per 1000 tests in 2019 (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17). In multivariable analyses, the positive test rate was higher for women (adjusted RR [aRR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.34-2.55) and heterosexual men (aRR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.53-3.74) in areas of greatest socio-economic disadvantage than for those in areas of least socio-economic disadvantage. It was also higher for Indigenous women (aRR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.22-4.70) and for women who reported recent injection drug use (aRR, 4.87; 95% CI, 2.18-10.9) than for other women; it was lower for bisexual than heterosexual women (aRR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.29-0.81) and for women who reported recent sex work (aRR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.29-0.44). The positive test rate was higher for heterosexual men aged 40-49 years (aRR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.42-3.12) or more than 50 years (aRR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.53-3.65) than for those aged 15-29 years. ConclusionThe positive test rate among both urban women and heterosexual men tested was higher in 2019 than in 2011. People who attend reproductive health or alcohol and drug services should be routinely screened for syphilis.

TI  - Multi-seasonal evaluation of hybrid poplar (P.<i> Deltoides)</i> plantations using Worldview-3 imagery and State-Of-The-Art ensemble learning algorithms
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest resources are the primary components of the ecosystem environment. Poplars (Populus sp.), a member of the fast-growing trees, are one of the most productive forest tree species for industrial production thanks to their desirable traits comprising rapid growth, hybridization ability, and ease of propagation. Determining poplar cultivated areas and mapping their geographical distributions is critical for planners and decision-makers to increase the ecological and economic benefits of poplar trees. Due to the biodiversity of each geographical region and seasonal vegetation variations, classification based on remotely sensed imagery is essential for cropland monitoring. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of high-resolution multi-temporal (growing season and end of the growing season) Worldview-3 imagery in mapping poplar plantations in the Akyazi district of Sakarya, Turkey. For this purpose, pixel- and object-based image analysis with up-to-date ensemble learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), categorical boosting (CB), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGB), were employed for mapping poplar fields. Results indicated that the object-based classification approach provided statistically significant improvements in map-level (about 4%) and class-level accuracy (e.g., approximately 7% and %2 for poplar and young poplar classes, respectively) than pixel-based classification. While the CB performed superior classification performance for the object-based approach (92.56%), the highest classification performance was obtained with the XGB algorithm for the pixel-based approach (90.42%) for the end of the growing season data. McNemar's statistical test also confirmed that the performances of CB and XGB algorithms were statistically similar in pixel-based classification. Finally, analysis of multi-season images revealed that sensitivity of the vegetation phenology and seasonal effects considerably affect the separability of poplar tree species. (c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Glacial geomorphology of the northwest Laurentide Ice Sheet on the northern Interior Plains and western Canadian Shield, Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of the Northwest Territories of mainland Canada was covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum. The increasing coverage of high resolution remotely sensed data provides new opportunities to map the glacial geomorphology and study the glacial history of this remote location. Here we present a comprehensive map of glacial landforms within the northern Interior Plains and adjacent areas of the Canadian Shield, comprising around 6% of the Laurentide Ice Sheet bed. Twelve landform types were mapped from the high resolution ArcticDEM: ice flow parallel lineations, subglacial ribs, crevasse-squeeze ridges, major and minor moraine crests, hummocky terrain complexes and ridges, shear margin moraines, major, minor and lateral and submarginal meltwater channels, esker ridges and complexes, glaciofluvial complexes, perched deltas, raised shorelines and aeolian dunes. Together, these landforms provide a record of the highly dynamic behaviour of the northwest sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.

TI  - Embedding sustainability and SDGs in architectural and planning education: reflections from a KAP survey, Egypt
T2  - ARCHNET-IJAR INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeSustainable development requires a mental shift that induces behavioral modification. Education is central to sustainable development as it alters an individual's worldview. Egypt is a signatory to Agenda 2030 and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many Egyptian educational institutions have adopted the universal trend of incorporating sustainability and SDGs into their curricula. A recent UN assessment reports that Egypt faces challenges in meeting most SDGs. Therefore, this article investigates how students' knowledge, attitude and practices reflect their awareness regarding sustainability? Has their education induced any behavioral changes? What is the instructors' role in mainstreaming sustainability?Design/methodology/approachThe article investigates the progression of environmental consciousness among Egyptian architectural students and its relationship to sustainability. There are two sources of data: (1) documents, including study plans and course descriptions, and (2) a questionnaire developed and distributed electronically among students from public, private and international schools. The authors used a variety of data analysis methods. They used SPSS for statistical analysis to determine similarities among the students and correlations between variables. They then used Atlas.ti to analyze curricula, study plans and student replies to open-ended questions.FindingsThe interrogated curricula equate sustainability with the environment, as some consider energy conservation equivalent to environmental conservation and protection. Others emphasized environmental control issues as measures of green architecture. The results suggest that students' knowledge and awareness are not conducive to practices expected to yield sustainable designs. The impact of architectural and planning education on altering their attitudes is minimal. Public schools treat students as passive objects, whereas international and some private schools attempt to adhere to the globally accepted architectural pedagogy ideals, transforming the student's mindset.Research limitations/implicationsEducation in architecture is crucial to achieving sustainable development because it prepares future professionals who can contribute to sustainability through their practice. The findings show that architectural and planning education has a negligible effect on students' knowledge and attitudes, which influence their practices. Reforming architectural and planning education is a requirement to accomplish the SDGs. The reform requires instructors to introduce students to the theory of knowledge and critical thinking, thus enabling graduates to be competitive in global labor markets. Reforming education will direct the research agenda of staff members and graduate students toward contemporary research problems.Originality/valueThe research method that mixes qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiry is the first aspect of the originality of the research. Linking teaching methods in the studio with instructors' understanding of sustainability can explain why sustainable development is not clear in architectural and planning education in Egypt, which influences both professional practice and scientific research. Finally, the paper highlights the role of universities to be sustainable in embedding the concept and changing students' mindsets, thus improving Egypt's stand on the SDGs index.

TI  - Analysis of the spillover characteristics of cooling effect in an urban park: A case study in Zhengzhou city
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks include water bodies, non-hardened ground, and a variety of vegetation, whose shading and evaporation effects form a "park cold island. " A park effectively cools the surrounding environment through heat exchange. This phenomenon is called spillover of park cooling effect (PCS) and plays an important role in regulating the microclimate of cities. Although PCS was extensively documented in previous studies, the effects of park landscape features on PCS still need to be further explored, especially in China with rapid urban expansion. The severe scarcity of urban land resources heightens the necessity to clarify the relationship between park patch size and cooling efficiency. Therefore, in this study, we chose Zhengzhou city (the capital of Henan province, in the central region of China) as an example, which has experienced rapid urban land expansion and urban population and high spatiotemporal aggregation of heatwaves-drought-rainstorms. We used Landsat 8 imagery and high score data in the summer of 2019 to retrieve the characteristics of land surface temperature (LST), and then we extracted 36 city parks and identified the spillover distance of the park cooling effect (PCSD), spillover strength of the park cooling effect (PCSS), spillover rate of the park cooling effect (PCSR), and 11 park landscape indexes. We calculated the area threshold when a park achieves the highest cooling efficiency, and the PCS characteristics of each park also were quantified. The results showed that the average LST of urban parks was 2.3? lower than that of the entire study area; PCSS was 4.61? at a maximum; PCSD was between 31 and 370 m, and the average value was 179 m; the average PCSR was 0.957?/100 m. For the relationship of PCS with the 11 park landscape indexes, we found park area (AREA), park green space area (AREA(g)), and park perimeter (PERIM) contributed the most to PCS. Shape of impervious surface (LSIi) and percentage of water body (P-w) also significantly contributed to PCS. The ratio of perimeter to area (PARA), edge density (ED), edge density of the green space (EDg), and patch density (PD) were significantly and negatively correlated with PCS. For the relationship between park area and PCS, the result was that the park with an area of 6-8 ha and an internal green area of not less than 5-6 ha has the highest PCS effect. This study can expand our scientific understanding on the influences of park landscape characteristics on PCS and provide a scientific basis for formulating reasonable and effective urban parks and spatial layout planning to cope with the urban heat island effect.

TI  - Coherency and phase delay analyses between land cover and climate across Italy via the least-squares wavelet software
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and climate monitoring is a crucial task in agriculture, forestry, hazard management, and ecosystems assessment. In this paper, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and land cover products by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as precipitation were utilized to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation and climate along with their correlation and coherency across Italy during 2000-2021. The analyses were performed on both pixel and ecoregion levels via the least-squares wavelet software (LSWAVE). It was found that relatively more areas in all ecoregions had positive NDVI gradients than negative for each month since 2000. It was estimated that the average NDVI has increased by similar to 0.07 since 2000 for all ecoregions. Except the southern ecoregion which showed an insignificant daytime cooling, other ecoregions have been warming by less than 0.05 degrees C/year since 2000. Furthermore, precipitation had an insignificant decreasing trend for almost all ecoregions over the past two decades. The annual coherency between NDVI and LST was found much stronger than the annual coherency between NDVI and precipitation. The annual cycles of NDVI and LST were out-of-phase for the southern ecoregion while the annual cycle of precipitation led the one in NDVI by about one month for this ecoregion, the only ecoregion showing the highest Pearson correlation (53%) and annual coherency (39%) between NDVI and precipitation. For other ecoregions, the annual cycles of NDVI and LST were approximately in-phase, i.e., less than a month phase delay.

TI  - First assessment of Aeolus Standard Correct Algorithm particle backscatter coefficient retrievals in the eastern Mediterranean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2018, the Aeolus satellite of the European Space Agency (ESA) has acquired wind HLOS (horizontal line-of-sight) profiles throughout the troposphere and up to the lower stratosphere, filling a critical gap in the Global Observing System (GOS). Aeolus, carrying ALADIN (Atmospheric LAser Doppler INstrument), the first UV HSRL (High Spectral Resolution Lidar) Doppler lidar ever placed in space, provides also vertically resolved optical properties of particulates (aerosols and clouds). The present study focuses on the assessment of Aeolus L2A particulate backscatter coefficient (baseline 2A11), retrieved by the Standard Correct Algorithm (SCA), in the eastern Mediterranean, a region hosting a variety of aerosol species. Ground-based retrievals acquired by lidar instruments operating in Athens (central Greece), Thessaloniki (northern Greece) and Antikythera (southwestern Greece) serve as reference. All lidar stations provide routine measurements to the PANACEA (PANhellenic infrastructure for Atmospheric Composition and climatE chAnge) network. A set of ancillary data, including sun-photometric observations (AERONET), reanalysis products (CAMS and MERRA-2), satellite observations (MSG-SEVIRI and MODIS Aqua) and backward-trajectories modelling (FLEXPART), is utilized towards an optimum characterization of the probed atmospheric conditions under the absence of a classification scheme in Aeolus SCA profiles. First, emphasis is given on the assessment of Aeolus SCA backscatter coefficient under specific aerosol scenarios over Antikythera island. Due to the misdetection of the cross-polar component of the backscattered lidar signal, Aeolus underestimates the aerosol backscatter coefficient by up to 33 % when non-spherical mineral particles are recorded (10 July 2019). A good performance is revealed on 3 July 2019, when horizontally homogeneous loads of fine spherical particles are confined below 4 km. For other two cases (8 July 2020 and 5 August 2020), due to noise issues, the SCA performance degrades in terms of depicting the stratification of aerosol layers composed of particles of different origin. According to the statistical assessment analysis of 43 identified cases, a poor-to-moderate performance is revealed for the unfiltered (aerosols plus clouds) SCA profiles, which improves substantially when cloud-contaminated profiles are excluded from the collocated sample. This improvement is evident at both Aeolus vertical scales (regular scales have 24 bins and mid-bin scales have 23 bins), and it is justified by the drastic reduction in the bias (from 0.45 to 0.27 Mm(-1) sr(-1) for SCA and from 0.69 to 0.37 Mm(-1 )sr(-1) for SCA mid-bin) and root mean square error (from 2.00 to 1.65 Mm(-1 )sr(-1 )for SCA and from 1.88 to 1.00 Mm(-1) sr(-1 )for SCA mid-bin) scores. In the vertical, the SCA performance degrades at the lowermost bins due to either the contamination from surface signals or the increased noise levels for the aerosol retrievals. Among the three PANACEA stations, the best agreement is found at the remote site of Antikythera with respect to the urban sites of Athens and Thessaloniki. Finally, all key Cal/Val (calibration and validation) aspects necessary for future relevant studies, the recommendations for a possible Aeolus follow-on mission and an overview of the ongoing related activities are thoroughly discussed.

TI  - Mapping and quantifying pelagic <i>Sargassum</i> in the Atlantic Ocean using multi-band medium-resolution satellite data and deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pelagic Sargassum in the Atlantic Ocean is an important habitat for marine animals, yet frequent and massive beaching events around the Caribbean Sea have caused many problems. Currently, both retrospective assessment and near real-time monitoring over synoptic scales rely on medium-resolution multi-band satellite imagery and algorithms based on the alternative floating algae index (AFAI) or its alternatives. Despite the success in assessing long-term bloom patterns and providing synoptic information in near real-time, two weaknesses still exist: 1) due to spatial resolution limitations and optical complexity from the ocean, there are often false positive detection in nearshore waters (up to 30 km from shoreline). These waters are currently masked to avoid providing false information, thus leading to data gaps in nearshore waters; 2) due to perturbations by cloud-adjacent straylight and cloud shadows, both false positive and false negative detections are often encountered. The current solution is to dilate the cloudmask to make the adjacent pixels invalid, thus leading to data loss. In this work, a computer deep-learning model based on the Res-UNet architecture, namely U-net, was developed to overcome these difficulties. The model was trained and validated using a total of 8518 medium-resolution "ground truth" images carefully prepared from data collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. After accounting for subpixel Sargassum coverage, the over accuracy of the DL model, as measured by its F1 score, is similar to 92.5% (without masking nearshore waters or cloud-adjacent pixels), which is higher than that of the current AFAI model (86.2% after masking nearshore waters and cloud-adjacent pixels). Application of the DL model to the 2021 MODIS data (a major Sargassum year) showed substantially improved valid data coverage (monthly increases of 20-34%) in both nearshore waters and offshore waters, and increased Sargassum biomass during the summer months (by 10-20%) from the entire Sargassum belt extending from the west Africa to the Gulf of Mexico. In the minor Sargassum year of 2016, the DL model led to an average increase of about 7% in Sargassum biomass. The DL model also appears to be applicable to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite and the Ocean Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel 3A and 3B satellites. Merging multi-sensor observations (including MODIS) resulted in substantially improved valid data coverage in daily to weekly composites, thus improving near real-time monitoring.

TI  - The influence of dust aerosols on solar radiation and near-surface temperature during a severe duststorm transport episode
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the west of China, a rarely seen black storm, with a high intensity of dust aerosols and a large area of influence, occurred from April 26-29, 2015, for the first time, after more than 30 years. Based on the regional climate model (RegCM version 4.6), combined with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite retrieval, meteorological, and environmental data, this work presents the pollution situation, weather background, and backward trajectory during the black storm process. In addition, we analyzed the temporal-spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the impacts of dust aerosols on solar radiation and near-surface temperature under this extreme weather condition. We discovered that this black storm process was caused by the surface cold high pressure and frontal transit under the background of the upper-air circulation of "two troughs and two ridges. " The pollutants primarily from Xinjiang and the Central Asia region, along with the airflow, entered northern Xinjiang almost simultaneously with the southwest airflow, piled up along the Tianshan Mountains, and then crossed the mountains into southern Xinjiang. In addition, the areas with high AOD were mostly in the desert regions and basins, whereas the low-value areas were mountainous areas with relatively high altitudes due to the effect of geographical and climatic conditions. The AOD from RegCM 4.6 was generally lower, unlike the MODIS AOD. Moreover, the dust aerosols from this black storm caused a significant decline in net short-wave radiation (NSR) both at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and surface. The cooling effect was more significant in the region with high AOD. For the areas where the AOD was higher than 0.7, the net short-wave radiative forcing of dust aerosols (ADRF) at the surface was above -70 W center dot m(-2); on the other hand, the cooling effect at the TOA was not as significant as that at the surface, with the ADRF(TOA) being only about a quarter of the ADRF(SUR). The ADRF(SUR) could reduce the near-surface temperature, and the region with a large temperature drop corresponded to the high-value areas of ADRF(SUR)/AOD. During this black storm, the near-surface temperature response to dust aerosols reached 0.40?-2.9? with a significant temperature drop because of cold air.

TI  - A turbulence data reduction scheme for autonomous and expendable profiling floats
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Autonomous and expendable profiling-float arrays such as those deployed in the Argo Program require the transmission of reliable data from remote sites. However, existing satellite data transfer rates preclude complete transmission of rapidly sampled turbulence measurements. It is therefore necessary to reduce turbulence data on board. Here we propose a scheme for onboard data reduction and test it with existing turbulence data obtained with a modified SOLO-II profiling float. First, voltage spectra are derived from shear probe and fast-thermistor signals. Then, we focus on a fixed-frequency band that we know to be unaffected by vibrations and that approximately corresponds to a wavenumber band of 5-25 cpm. Over the fixed-frequency band, we make simple power law fits that - after calibration and correction in post-processing - yield values for the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate epsilon and thermal-variance dissipation rate chi. With roughly 1 m vertical segments, this scheme reduces the necessary data transfer volume 300-fold to approximately 2.5 kB for every 100 m of a profile (when profiling at 0.2 m s(-1)). As a test, we apply our scheme to a dataset comprising 650 profiles and compare its output to that from our standard turbulence-processing algorithm. For epsilon, values from the two approaches agree within a factor of 2 87 % of the time; for chi, they agree 78 % of the time. These levels of agreement are greater than or comparable to that between the epsilon and chi values derived from two shear probes and two fast thermistors, respectively, on the same profiler.

TI  - Faba bean above-ground biomass and bean yield estimation based on consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle RGB images and ensemble learning
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately and economically estimated crop above-ground biomass (AGB) and bean yield (BY) are critical for cultivation management in precision agriculture. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms have shown great potential in crop AGB and BY estimation due to their ability to rapidly acquire remote sensing data with high temporal-spatial resolution. In this study, a low-cost and consumer-grade camera mounted on a UAV was adopted to acquire red-green-blue (RGB) images, which were then combined with ensemble learning to estimate faba bean AGB and BY. The following results were obtained: (1) The faba bean plant height derived from UAV RGB images presented a strong correlation with the ground measurement (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 63.6 mm). (2) The accuracy of BY estimation (R-2 = 0.784, RMSE = 0.460 t ha(-1), NRMSE = 14.973%) based on RGB images was higher than the accuracy of AGB estimation (R-2 = 0.618, RMSE = 0.606 t ha(-1), NRMSE = 16.746%). (3) The combination of three variables (vegetation index, structural information, textural information) improved the AGB and BY estimation accuracy. (4) The AGB and BY estimation performance were best for the mid bean-filling stage. (5) The ensemble learning model provided higher AGB and BY estimation accuracy than the five base learners (k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, ridge regression, random forest and elastic net models). These results indicate that UAV RGB images combined with machine learning algorithms, particularly ensemble learning models, can provide relatively accurate faba bean AGB (R-2 = 0.683, RMSE = 0.568 t ha(-1), NRMSE = 15.684%) and BY (R-2 = 0.854, RMSE = 0.390 t ha(-1), NRMSE = 12.693%) estimation and considerably contribute to the high-throughput phenotyping study of food legumes.

TI  - A study of recurrence, complication and survival rates in patients with early stage vulval cancer undergoing sentinel lymph node sampling: a single-centre experience
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeGroin sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification and removal has become a standard of care for women with clinical early stage vulval cancer. There is evidence to support safe detection of the SLN with minimal morbidity. The purpose of this study is to report our experience of managing patients focusing on patient selection, adverse events, quality assurance of the procedure and any benefits and/or disadvantages to patients.MethodsThis was a retrospective study of patients with clinical early stage vulval cancer in a cancer centre over 5 years. Notes and hospital data were reviewed including admissions to emergency departments. Statistical software was used for the statistical analysis and the Kaplan Meier survival curve was generated to present survival rates.Results61 cases were analysed. A total of 156 nodes have been removed and positive nodes were identified in 14 cases. In total, 9 women (14.75%) had disease recurrence within 5 years from primary surgery. Overall, 4 patients (6.5%) developed groin recurrence. In 3 of these patients there was isolated groin recurrence (4.9%). The median length of admission was 3 days and 6 cases were managed as day cases.ConclusionsSince the closure of the GROINNS-2 trial we have continued the procedure of SLN identification for women with clinical early stage vulval cancer. We have shown high level of adherence to our protocol and survival and complication rates comparable to other studies on the same field. There were a few patients managed as day-case which was of benefit to the patients.

TI  - SAR and Passive Microwave Fusion Scheme: A Test Case on Sentinel-1/AMSR-2 for Sea Ice Classification
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The most common source of information about sea ice conditions is remote sensing data, especially images obtained from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and passive microwave radiometers (PMR). Here we introduce an adaptive fusion scheme based on Graph Laplacians that allows us to retrieve the most relevant information from satellite images. In a first test case, we explore the potential of sea ice classification employing SAR and PMR separately and simultaneously, in order to evaluate the complementarity of both sensors and to assess the result of a combined use. Our test case illustrates the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme and indicates an advantage of combining AMSR-2 89 GHz and Sentinel-1 data for sea ice mapping.

TI  - Deep learning-based framework for monitoring of debris-covered glacier from remotely sensed images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have proven their efficiency for various computer vision (CV) tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and object detection. However, training a DL model is expensive in terms of both complex-ities of the network structure and the amount of labeled data needed. In addition, the imbalance among available labeled data for dif-ferent classes of interest may also adversely affect the model accuracy. This paper addresses these issues using a new convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture. The proposed network incorporates both spatial and spectral information that combines two sub-networks: spatial-CNN and spectral-CNN. The spectral-CNN extracts spectral information, while spatial-CNN captures spatial infor-mation. Moreover, to make the features more robust, a multiscale spatial CNN architecture is introduced using different kernels. The final feature vector is formed by concatenating the outputs obtained from both spatial-CNN and spectral-CNN. To address the data imbalance problem, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was used to generate data for the underrepresented class. Finally, relatively a shallower network architecture was used to reduce the number of parameters in the network and improve the processing speed. The proposed model was trained and tested on Senitel-2 images for the classification of the debris-covered glacier. The results showed that the proposed method is well-suited for mapping and monitoring debris-covered glaciers at a large scale with high classification accuracy. In addition, we compared the proposed method with conventional machine learning approaches, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP).(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Detection of surface temperature anomaly of the Sea of Marmara
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring sea surface temperature (SST) over a long-term and detecting the anomalies highly contribute to understanding the pre-vailing water quality of the sea. Earth observation satellite images are the key data sources that offer the long-term SST detection in cost and time effective way. Since the Sea of Marmara in Tu center dot rkiye is surrounded by the highly populated provinces, the water quality of the sea has gained importance for scientific and public communities over the years. This article emphasizes on the significance of detect-ing SST trend and corresponding anomalies of the Sea of Marmara over the past 32 years. To address the SST variations of the Sea of Marmara in time, a comprehensive set of both field and satellite data regarding SSTs were obtained within the context of this study. The SST trend and its anomalies between the years 1990 and 2021 were detected by applying Seasonal-Trend decomposition procedure based on LOESS (STL) method to NOAA OISST V2 data. On the other hand, spatial SST distribution was detected with Landsat-8, Sentinel-3 and NOAA OISST V2 satellite data. SST results were verified with the in-situ data within the scope of accuracy assessment. The results showed that SST time-series data performed an increasing trend and had anomalies mostly during the spring months in the recent years. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Interconnected hydrologic extreme drivers and impacts depicted by remote sensing data assimilation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrologic extremes often involve a complex interplay of several processes. For example, flood events can have a cascade of impacts, such as saturated soils and suppressed vegetation growth. Accurate representation of such interconnected processes while accounting for associated triggering factors and subsequent impacts of flood events is difficult to achieve with conceptual hydrological models alone. In this study, we use the 2019 flood in the Northern Mississippi and Missouri Basins, which caused a series of hydrologic disturbances, as an example of such a flood event. This event began with above-average precipitation combined with anomalously high snowmelt in spring 2019. This series of anomalies resulted in above normal soil moisture that prevented crops from being planted over much of the corn belt region. In the present study, we demonstrate that incorporating remote sensing information within a hydrologic modeling system adds substantial value in representing the processes that lead to the 2019 flood event and the resulting agricultural disturbances. This remote sensing data infusion improves the accuracy of soil moisture and snowmelt estimates by up to 16% and 24%, respectively, and it also improves the representation of vegetation anomalies relative to the reference crop fraction anomalies.

TI  - Satellite Evidence for Glyoxal Depletion in Elevated Fire Plumes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-borne observations are used to characterize the fate of formaldehyde and glyoxal in wildfire plumes. Their distribution measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument reveals striking differences between the two compounds near intense fires. In typical situations, the glyoxal-to-formaldehyde ratio is highest near the fire (similar to 0.1) and decreases downwind of the source area due to the larger contribution of pyrogenic emissions to the glyoxal abundance and to the longer lifetime of formaldehyde. However, a pronounced glyoxal depletion is detected above high-level clouds, not seen for formaldehyde, likely due to processing in pyrocumulonimbus clouds generated by the fires. This depletion suggests glyoxal retention upon droplet freezing and/or its outgassing in hydrated form in the upper troposphere. The absence of a sizable loss of formaldehyde during convection indicates that its hydration in liquid droplets and subsequent outgassing as methanediol represent at most a minor sink of formaldehyde.

TI  - Anisakis infection in marine fishes and resident awareness of anisakiasis in Qingdao in 2021.
T2  - Chinese Journal of Parasitology and Parasitic Diseases
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To investigate the Anisakis infection in marine fishes in the Yellow Sea and local resident awareness of anisakiasis in Qingdao. Methods In October 2021, marine fishes were purchased from Fisherman's Wharf in Qingdao and Taixi Wharf in Langya. The viscera and muscle of the marine fishes were disected to search for Anisakis larvae. The Anisakis infection in different fish species, and different organs were examined to anlyze the correlation between the infection intensity and body length and weight of the marine fishes. Five villages were randomly selected in the West Coast New District to conduct a questionnaire survey on anisakiasis knowledge among residents who were willing to participate in the survey. The knowledge awareness rate and behavior habits of the residents on Anisakis were analyzed. Surveillance for anisakiasis was conducted in local sentinel hospital. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the infection rate and the responders proportion; Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed; Chi-square test was used for analyzing the knowledge awareness rate. Results A total of 196 fish from 22 species were collected, of which 70 were infected with Anisakis. The infection rate was 35.7% (70/196). Total 13 species of marine fishes were found infected with Anisakis, accounting for 59.1% (13/22), among which Muraenesox cinereus, Pleuronichthys cornutus, Gadous macrocephaius, Scomber japonicas (all 10/10) and Nibea albiflora (9/9) were all infected with Anisakis larvae. The infection rate of Anisakis was significantly different between different species ([chi]2 = 147.93, P < 0.01). The average infection intensity was 34.8 larvae/fish (2 439/70). The highest infection intensity was found in Gadous macrocephaius (189.3 larvae/fish), followed by Scomberomorus niphonius (25.7 larvae/fish). In Larimichthys polyactis and Pennahia argentata, Anisakis larvae were only found in mesentery and intestinal wall, accounting for 4/4 and 5/5, respectively. In Esox reicherti and Sebastiscus marmoratus, Anisakis larvae were only found in the body cavity, accounting for 13/13 and 2/2, respectively. Rank correlation analysis show that the infection intensities of Anisakis in L. polyactis and E. reicherti were posi. tively correlated with body length ( r = 0.71, 0.81, all P < 0.05) and body weight ( r = 0.64, 0.80, all P < 0.05), while the infection intensity of Anisakis in Lophiomus litulon was negatively correlated with body weight ( r = -0.98, P < 0.01). The infection intensity of other infected fishes was not correlated with body length and body weight. A total of 387 local residents were surveyed, 8.5% (33/387) of which had heard of anisakiasis, 4.9% (19/387) had knowledge on the harm of anisakiasis, and 7.0% (27/387) preferred to eat raw or semi. raw marine fishes, 17.8% (69/387) of residents processed raw and cooked food with shared cutting boards. The knowledge awareness rates of male and female were 11.2% (18/160) and 6.6% (15/227), respectively ([chi]2 = 7.69, P < 0.05). The knowledge aware. ness rate of residents in Zhuangjiatong Village (36.7% (26/71)) was higher than that of other villages ([chi]2 = 81.15, P < 0.01). The knowledge awareness rate in >= 60 years old residents was the highest, which was 11.8% (16/136), but there was no significant difference among age groups ([chi]2 = 10.89, P > 0.05). Sentinel hospitals monitor did not find any patient infected with Anisakis. Conclusion The infection rate of Anisakis in marine fishes in Qingdao is comparatively high. The knowledge awareness rate on preventrion and control of anisakiasis in resident is low. The locals comsume raw or semi.cooked marine fishes, and process raw and cooked food with shared cutting boards.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study provides the first evaluation of the potential of both the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor images and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data for automated lineament extraction in the south side of the Marrakech High Atlas (Telouet-Tighza area). After image corrections, enhancement methods such as principal component analysis, band composite (BC), and directional filtering were adopted to create new images that provided high visibility of linear structures. The new Landsat BC image used in this study was selected based on the calculation of the optimum index factor and correlation index. In addition to the Landsat image, the SRTM DEM was used to detect structural lineaments in the area by generating shaded relief images. Multisource data, such as band ratio image, geological maps, and fieldwork, were used to eliminate the nongeological lineaments extracted. The results indicate that an automated method was applied successfully for lineament mapping in this area, by detailing the main tectonic faults. Moreover, new lineaments are identified and are validated by fieldwork. Structural lineaments extracted show compatibility in their direction, length, distribution, and density with the tectonic evolution of the study area. A total of 2945 lineaments were extracted with major ENE-WSW and predominant E-W directions. The new structural map shows more structural information compared with the geological map of this area and exemplifies the performance of Landsat-8 OLI bands and SRTM data in this kind of study.

TI  - Evaluating the Retreat, Arrest, and Regrowth of Crane Glacier Against Marine Ice Cliff Process Models
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The fastest projected rates of sea level rise appear in models which include "the marine ice cliff instability (MICI)," a hypothesized but mostly unobserved process defined by rapid fracture and wastage of terminal ice cliffs that outpaces viscous relaxation and ice-shelf formation. Crane Glacier's response to the Larsen B Ice Shelf collapse has been invoked as evidence of MICI in the observational record. Using available remote sensing data, we analyze Crane's retreat, arrest, and regrowth over the last two decades. Much of Crane's terminus retreat occurred in floating, not grounded ice. Retreat accelerated by at least 54% during the 2 years following ice shelf collapse. This is inconsistent with contemporaneous regional forcing that promoted ice shelf growth during this period, but consistent with a geometrically controlled positive feedback. We infer a maximum possible cliff height of 111 m, which according to process models, could enable cliff calving assuming damaged ice.

TI  - On the quality checking of persistent scatterer interferometry data by spatial-temporal modelling
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, rapid growth in infrastructure development and urbanisation process increases the attention for accurate deformation monitoring on a relatively large-scale. Furthermore, such deformation monitoring is of great importance in the assessment and management of natural hazard processes like landslides, earthquakes, and floods. In this study, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique is applied using open-source Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the satellite Sentinel-1. It allows point-wise deformation monitoring based on time series analysis of specific points. It also enables performing spatio-temporal area-based deformation monitoring. Currently, these data do not have a sophisticated quality assurance process to judge the significance of deformations. To obtain different quality classes of the Persistent Scatterer (PS) data points, the first step is to classify them into buildings and ground types using LoD2 building models. Next, time series analysis of the PS points is performed to model systematic and random errors. It allows estimation of the offset and the deformation rate for each point. Finally, spatio-temporal modelling of neighbourhood relations of the PS points is carried out using local geometric patches which are approximated with a mathematical model, such as, e.g., multilevel B-Splines. Subsequently, the quality of SAR data from temporal and spatial neighbourhood relations is checked. Having an appropriate spatio-temporal quality model of the PS data, a deformation analysis is performed for areas of interest in the city of Hamburg. In the end, the results of the deformation analysis are compared with the BodenBewegungsdienst Deutschland (Ground Motion Service Germany) provided by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), Germany.

TI  - Chlorophyll dynamics from Sentinel-3 using an optimized algorithm for enhanced ecological monitoring in complex urban estuarine waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban estuaries are dynamic environments that hold high ecological and economic value. Yet, their optical complexity hinders accurate satellite retrievals of important biogeochemical variables, such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) biomass. Approaches based on a limited number of satellite spectral bands often fail to capture seasonal transitions and sharp spatial gradients in estuarine Chl-a concentrations, inhibiting integration of satellite data into water quality monitoring and conservation programs. We propose a novel approach that utilizes the wide range of spectral information captured by the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) to retrieve estuarine Chl-a. To validate our approach, we used measurements in Long Island Sound (LIS), a highly urbanized estuary increasingly susceptible to anthropogenic stressors and climate change. Hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and Chl-a data representing the spatiotemporal diversity of LIS were used to assess the ideal atmospheric correction approach for OLCI and develop a multi-spectral multiple linear regression (MS-MLR) Chl-a algorithm. POLYMER derived Rrs proved to be the preferred atmospheric correction approach. Evaluation of MS-MLR performance in retrieving Chl-a with in situ Rrs showed good agreement with field measurements. Application to OLCI-retrieved Rrs showed significant improvement (20%-30%) in common error metrics relative to other algorithms assessed. The MS-MLR approach successfully captured seasonal cycles and spatial gradients in Chl-a concentration. Application of this method to urban estuaries and coasts enables accurate, high resolution Chl-a observations at the ecosystem scale and across a range of conditions, as needed for conservation and ecosystem management efforts.

TI  - Influences of environmental factors on the dissipation of green tides in the Yellow Sea, China
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Green tides attack the Yellow Sea every year since 2007 and have caused substantial financial loss. Based on Haiyang-1C/Coastal zone imager (HY-1C/CZI) and Terra/MODIS satellite images, the temporal and spatial distribution of green tides floating in the Yellow Sea during 2019 was extracted. The relationships between the growth rate of the green tides and the environmental factors including sea surface temperature (SST), photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR), sea surface salinity (SSS), nitrate and phosphate during the green tides' dissipation phase has been detected. Based on the maximum likelihood estimation, a regression model that in-cludes SST, PAR and phosphate was recommended to predict the growth rate of the green tides in the dissipation phase (R2 = 0.63), and this model was also examined using Bayesian information criterion and Akaike infor-mation criterion. When the average SST in the study area was above 23.6 degrees C, the coverage of green tides began to decrease with the increase in temperature under the influence of PAR. The growth rate of the green tides was related to SST (R = - 0.38), PAR (R =-0.67) and phosphate (R = 0.40) in the dissipation phase. Compared with HY-1C/CZI, the green tide area extracted using Terra/MODIS tended to be underestimated when the green tide patches were smaller than 11.2 km2. Otherwise, the lower spatial resolution of MODIS resulted in larger mixed pixels of water and algae, which would overestimate the total area of the green tides.

TI  - Comparison of single-pore non-liposuction near-infrared laparoscopy with conventional open surgery for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early breast cancer: a single-center, small-sample retrospective study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to compare the effects of single-pore non-liposuction near-infrared (NIR) endoscopic surgery and traditional open surgery for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early breast cancer (EBC).Methods The clinical pathological data of 61 patients with EBC who underwent axillary SLNB using indocyanine green (ICG) combined with carbon nanoparticle suspension (CNS) were retrospectively collected. Thirty patients received SLNB through single-pore non-liposuction NIR endoscopic surgery (endoscopic group), and the remaining 31 received SLNB through open-incision surgery (open group). The success rate, operation time, volume of intraoperative bleeding, postoperative axillary drainage, axillary extubation time, and the occurrence of postoperative complications were compared between the groups along with the total number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), luminous SLNs, stained SLNs, and the pathological positivity rate of the SLNs.Results All patients underwent SLNB with a 100% success rate. SLNB operation times of the endoscopic group were longer than those of the open group (t = 3.963, P = 0.000), and the volume of axillary drainage was inferior (t = 3.035, P = 0.004). However, there were no differences in the intraoperative bleeding volumes, axillary extubation times, and postoperative complications (P > 0.05). In the Open group, the mean number of SLNs was 5.12 +/- 2.16, and the pathological positivity rate was 13.53%; in the Endoscopic group, these numbers were 4.89 +/- 1.73 and 12.39%. The mean number of SLNs detected (t = 0.458, P = 0.649) and the pathological positivity rates (chi 2 = 0.058, P = 0.810) did not differ between the two groups. All 61 patients were followed for a median of 14.6 months. There were no local recurrences or distant metastases.Conclusions Our single-center results reveal that single-hole non-liposuction NIR endoscopic axillary SLNB is not inferior to open SLNB and may be an appropriate option for patients with early breast cancer who desire breast preservation with fewer incisions.

TI  - Interrupted time series segmented regression analysis for detecting waterborne disease outbreaks by syndromic surveillance
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionPathogens can enter the drinking water supply and cause gastroenteritis outbreaks. Such events can affect many people in a short time, making them a high risk for public health. In Australia, the Victoria State Government Department of Health is deploying a syndromic surveillance system for drinking water contamination events. We assessed the utility of segmented regression models for detecting such events and determined the number of excess presentations needed for such methods to signal a detection. MethodsThe study involved an interrupted time series study of a past lapse in water treatment. The baseline period comprised the four weeks before the minimum incubation period of suspected pathogens, set at two days post-event. The surveillance period comprised the week after. We used segmented linear regression to compare the count of gastroenteritis presentations to public hospital emergency departments (EDs) between the surveillance and baseline periods. We then simulated events result-ing in varying excess presentations. These were superimposed onto the ED data over fifty different dates across 2020. Using the same regression, we calculated the detection probability at p < 0.05 for each outbreak size.ResultsIn the retrospective analysis, there was strong evidence for an increase in presentations shortly after the event. In the simulations, with no excess presentations (i.e., with the ED data as is) the models signalled 8% probability of detection. The models returned 50% probability of detection with 28 excess presentations and 100% probability of detection with 78 excess presentations.ConclusionsThe transient increase in presentations after the event may be attributed to microbiological hazards or increased health-seeking behaviour following the issuing of boil water advisories. The simulations demonstrated the ability for segmented regressions to signal a detection, even without a large excess in presentations. The approach also demonstrated high specificity and should be considered for informing Victoria's syndromic surveillance system.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic processes such as environmental, economic, and social factors influence land use and land cover (LULC) changes, with temporal and spatial variations. This study aims to identify changes in LULC and predict future trends in the Pakhal Lake area in Peninsular India. Satellite images for the years from 2016 to 2022 were used for LULC classification using deep learning with Sentinel - 2 imagery in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Dynamic World dataset is used to classify the LULC changes of the study area with a 10 m near-real-time dataset. Images were classified based on six different LULC classes, namely water, vegetation, flooded vegetation, agriculture, built-up area, and bare land. The Cellular Automata-Artificial Neural Network (CA - ANN) technique was used to predict LULC changes. QGIS plugin MOLUSCE with Multi-Layer Perception (MLP), was used to predict and determine potential LULC changes for 2025 and 2028. The overall Kappa coefficient value of 0.78, and an accuracy of 82% indicated good results for LULC changes and projected maps for 2025. Prediction of LULC changes using MLP - ANN for the years 2025 and 2028 showed increase in agriculture, built-up areas, and barren land. The results of the study will be useful to develop better management techniques of natural resources.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-1/2 and topographic attributes to predict the spatial distribution of soil texture fractions in some agricultural soils of western Iran
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was intended to examine the use of radar data obtained from Sentinel-1 imagery with different combinations of topographic attributes and multispectral data to predict soil texture fractions (STFs) in some agricultural soils located in the southern part of Kurdistan province, in western Iran. For this purpose, by applying the stratified random sampling technique, 216 soil samples were collected from the upper soil layer (0-30 cm) of the studied area. The particle size fractions were measured using the hydrometer method. Then, a comprehensive set of environmental variables including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and digital elevation model (DEM) were derived. These environmental variables were included in four datasets; these included: dataset A (Sentinel-2 and DEM), dataset B (Sentinel-1 and DEM), dataset C (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), and data set D (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and DEM). After selecting the parsimonious variables in each dataset based on Pearson correlation coefficients and variance inflation factor (VIF) analyses, three machine learning models including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), Cubist, and the ensemble of individual models were used to create the statistical link between environmental variables and STFs. The results showed that the ensemble modeling method with the dataset D had the highest accuracy in comparison to individual models in the prediction of clay (RMSE = 4.07%, MAE= 3.22%, ME=-0.08, CCC= 0.53), silt (RMSE = 5.96%, MAE=4.63%, ME=-0.52, CCC=0.49), and sand fraction (RMSE = 8.32%, MAE=6.46%, ME= 0.52, CCC=0.55). In addition, the results of variable importance revealed that all three types of environmental variables contributed to the prediction of the spatial distribution of STFs. These results also showed that elevation, Band 11 and VH_1 (which is the one provided by the radar data obtained from Sentinel-1), respectively, were the most important variables in the prediction of clay and sand fractions. In addition, Band 11, elevation, and multi-resolution valley bottom flatness index (MrVBF) were identified as the most important variables contributing to the prediction of the silt fraction. This study also demonstrated the effectiveness of backscatter coefficients obtained from Sentinel-1 in digital soil mapping (DSM) in the prediction of soil properties. Finally, the map of each fraction with its uncertainty and also, the soil texture map were generated from the ensemble model and dataset D. These maps could be used as the decision tools for agricultural management.

TI  - Plume dispersion from the Nelson and Hayes rivers into Hudson Bay using satellite remote sensing of CDOM and suspended sediment
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Change in the dispersion pattern of Arctic river plumes due to climate change and hydroelectric regulation is challenging to monitor, calling for synoptic and continuous observation using satellite remote sensing. Algorithms for colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and total suspended solids (TSS) were applied to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery to study Nelson and Hayes river plume dispersion into southwestern Hudson Bay, employing quantile regressions to capture dispersion variability along a freshwater-marine gradient. MODIS-derived CDOM and TSS quantile concentrations (Q0.05-Q0.95) decreased exponentially with distance from the Nelson River mouth. The Q0.95 asymptote marked the offshore extent of the river plume and was used to determine the marine and river water fractions of surface water in southwestern Hudson Bay. At about 125 km from the Nelson River mouth, CDOM was reduced by 75% of its river mouth values. Owing to the significant co-variability between CDOM dilution and river discharge, a 0.25 river water fraction was estimated at this distance, which varied by +/- 35 km during flood and ebb flows. Anti-cyclonic winds transported the river plume along the 54 degrees azimuth towards central Hudson Bay, while cyclonic winds propagated the plume eastward along the south shore. Particle settling in the coastal waters and resuspension events from mudflats and/or bank erosion caused non-significant relationships between TSS and river discharge. This non-conservative behavior renders TSS a less useful optical tracer of Nelson and Hayes river water in southwestern Hudson Bay. The novel quantile regression approach for defining boundaries of river water dilution in transitional waters may provide helpful information for coastal management on a spatial scale of tens to hundreds of kilometers, ranging from near real-time monitoring to seasonal and multi-year studies.

TI  - Improving the predictability of the Qendresa Medicane by the assimilation of conventional and atmospheric motion vector observations. Storm-scale analysis and short-range forecast
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal population in the western Mediterranean Basin is frequently affected by high-impact weather events that produce huge economic and human losses. Among the wide spectrum of maritime severe weather events, tropical-like Mediterranean cyclones (a.k.a. medicanes) draw particular attention, specially due to their poor predictability. The accurate prediction of this kind of event still remains a key challenge to the weather forecast community, mainly because of (i) errors in the initial conditions, (ii) lack of accuracy of modeling micro-scale physics processes and (iii) chaotic behavior inherent to numerical weather prediction models. The 7 November 2014 Qendresa Medicane, that took place over the Sicilian channel affecting the islands of Lampedusa, Pantelleria and Malta, was selected for this study because of its extremely low predictability behavior in terms of its track and intensity. To enhance the prediction of Qendresa, a high-resolution (4 km) ensemble-based data assimilation technique, known as ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), is used. In this study, both in situ conventional and satellite-derived observations are assimilated with the main objective of improving Qendresa's model initial conditions and thus its subsequent forecast. The performance of the EnKF system and its impact on the Qendresa forecast are quantitatively assessed using different deterministic and probabilistic verification methods. A discussion in terms of the relevant physical mechanisms adjusted by the EnKF is also provided. Results reveal that the assimilation of both conventional and satellite-derived observations improves the short-range forecasts of the trajectory and intensity of Qendresa. In this context, the relevance of assimilating satellite-derived observations to improve the pre-convective estimation of Qendresa's upper-level dynamics is shown, which is key to obtain a realistic track and intensity forecast of this event.

T2  - QUALITY TECHNOLOGY AND QUANTITATIVE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the stress-strength reliability literature, although identical components assumption may not be realistic due to the structure of a system, independent and identically distributed components have been commonly used. In this study, we aim to contribute to the literature by studying of non-identical distributed components in a consecutive $$k$$k-out of-$$n$$n system when both stress and strength components follow the proportional hazard rate models. Estimation methods for the stress-strength reliability of this system are investigated from frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. Maximum likelihood and uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimations are obtained in the frequentist approach. Based on the suitability of the structure, approximate Bayes estimates methods: Lindley's approximation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo through Metropolis-Hastings or Gibbs sampling algorithms and exact Bayes estimates are derived. Asymptotic confidence and highest posterior density credible intervals are also constructed for all cases. We provide comprehensive simulation experiments for investigating the performances of the considered estimates. Wind speed data from NASA's satellite data source project are used in the application of the considered model and methods. We present the comparison of wind energy potentials of two districts on the Aegean coast of Turkey using our model structure after determining their wind speed distributions.

TI  - Identification of factors controlling heavy metals/metalloid distribution in agricultural soils using multi-source data
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the factors that controlling the agricultural soil heavy metals/metalloids distribution is vital for cropland soil remediation and management. For this objective, 227 agricultural soils were sampled in the Guanzhong Plain, China, to measure the concentration of five heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn, and Cu) and one metalloid (As) by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, meanwhile, 24 possible influencing factors to agricultural soil heavy metals/metalloid distribution were collected and grouped into three categories. A sequential multivariate statistical analysis was carried out to provide insight into the controlling factors of soil heavy metals/metalloid distribution, then stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and partial least squares regression (PLS) were used to predict heavy metals/metalloid concentrations in agricultural soil based on the result of soil heavy metals/ metalloid controlling factors identification. The results demonstrated the types of soil and land use did not have a substantial effect on soil heavy metals/metalloid distribution, except Zn and Cu. The soil properties category played a major role in influencing the soil heavy metals/metalloid concentration. The concentrations of Mn and Fe, which are the main constitute elements of soil inorganic colloid, were the most significant factors, followed by the concentrations of P, K and Ca. Soil pH and soil organic matter (SOM) content, which are often considered as important factors for soil heavy metals/metalloid distribution, were not important in the present study. The SMLR was more effective than the PLS for predicting soil heavy metals/metalloid content. The results of this study enlighten that future soil heavy metals/metalloid contamination treatment in regions with high pH and low SOM content should concentrate on inorganic colloid particles, which have strong adsorption capacity for soil heavy metals/metalloid and are environmentally friendly. Moreover, the combination of successive multivariate statistical analysis and SMLR provide an effective tool to predict and monitor agricultural soil heavy metals/metalloid distribution, and facilitate the improvement of environmental and territorial management.

TI  - Lidar-Derived Road Profiles A Case Study Using Chaco Roads from the US Southwest
T2  - ADVANCES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite considerable developments in the archaeological application of lidar for detecting roads, less attention has been given to studying road morphology using lidar. As a result, archaeologists are well equipped to locate but not thoroughly study roads via lidar data. Here, a method that visualizes and statistically compares road profiles using elevation values extracted from lidar-derived digital elevation models is presented and illustrated through a case study on Chaco roads, located in the US Southwest. This method is used to establish the common form of ground-truthed Chaco roads and to measure how frequently this form is across non-ground-truthed roads. This method is an addition to the growing suite of tools for documenting and comparing roads using remotely sensed data, and it can be particularly useful in threatened landscapes where ground truthing is becoming less possible.

TI  - LAI estimation through remotely sensed NDVI following hail defoliation in maize (Zea mays L.) using Sentinel-2 and UAV imagery
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme events such as hailstorms are a cause for concern in agriculture, leading to both economic and food supply losses. Traditional damage estimation techniques have recently been called into question since damages have rarely been quantified at the large-field scale. Damage-estimation methods used by field inspectors are complex and sometimes subjective and hardly account for damage spatial variability. In this work, a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based parametric method was applied using both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and Sentinel-2 sensors to estimate the leaf area index (LAI) of maize (Zea mays L.) resulting from simulated hail damage. These methods were then compared to the LAI values generated from the Sentinel-2 Biophysical Processor. A two-year experiment (2020-2021) was conducted during the maize cropping season, with hail events simulated during a range of maize developmental stages (the 8th-leaf, flowering, milky and dough stages) using a 0-40% defoliation gradient of damage intensities performed with the aid of specifically designed prototype machines. The results showed that both sensors were able to accurately estimate LAI in a nonstandard damaged canopy while requiring only the calibration of the extinction coefficient k(theta) in the case of parametric estimations. In this case, the calibration was performed using 2020 data, providing k(theta) values of 0.59 for Sentinel-2 and 0.37 for the UAV sensor. The validation was performed on 2021 data, and showed that the UAV sensor had the best accuracy (R2 of 0.86, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.71). The k(theta) value proved to be sensor-specific, accounting for the NDVI retrieval differences likely caused by the different spatial operational scales of the two sensors. NDVI proved effective in parametrically estimating maize LAI under damaged canopy conditions at different defoliation degrees. The parametric method matched the Sentinel-2 biophysical process-generated LAI well, leading to less underestimations and more accurate LAI retrieval.

TI  - Modelling InSAR-derived hillslope velocities with multivariate statistics: A first attempt to generate interpretable predictions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal patterns of earth surface deformation are influenced by a combination of the geologic, topo-graphic, seismic, anthropogenic, meteorological and climatic conditions specific to any landscape of interest. These have been mostly modelled through machine learning tools. However, these influences are yet to be explored and exploited to train interpretable data-driven models and then make predictions on the deformation one may expect in space or time. This work explored this aspect by proposing the first multivariate model dedicated to InSAR-derived deformation data. The results we obtain are promising for we suitably retrieved the signal of environmental predictors, from which we then estimated the mean line of sight velocities for a number of hillslopes affected by seismic shaking. The importance of such models resides in its potential for opening an entirely new research line for slope instability modelling.

AB  - Assessment of the groundwater potential of the OAU Estate involving digital image pro-cessing of Landsat 8 imagery, and geophysical and hydrogeological investigations were car-ried out. Landsat 8 imagery was processed to produce hydrolineament map. Topographic parameters including drainage density and slope gradient were derived from SPOT DEM using ArcGIS 10.3 software, and used to generate drainage density and slope gradient maps. The lithology of the study area was extracted from existing geological map. One hundred and four Vertical Electrical Sounding data were analyzed quantitatively using par-tial curve matching technique and computer assisted 1-D forward modelling and the re-sults used to generate overburden thickness and coefficient of anisotropy maps. The hydro -lineament, drainage density, slope gradient, lithology, overburden thickness and coefficient of anisotropy maps were developed into thematic maps and used to generate the ground-water potential map. The groundwater potential of the study area was classified as low -(61%), moderate-(32%) and high-(7%) with corresponding yields of < 0.5 L/s, 0.5 L/s - 1.5 L/s and > 1.5 L/s, respectively.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Viscoplastic modelling of rainfall-driven slow-moving landslides: application to California Coast Ranges
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow-moving landslides are widely observed in mountainous areas worldwide. While most of these landslides move slowly downslope over long periods of time, some ultimately accelerate rapidly and fail catastrophically. Simulating the landslide creep movement triggered by environmental factors such as precipitation, is therefore necessary to anticipate potential damaging effects on proximal infrastructure, habitat, and life. Here, we present a physically-based model that links pore-water pressure changes in the landslide mass with a new viscoplastic constitutive law designed to capture different temporal trends in slow-moving landslides. The model accounts for landslide velocity changes caused by rainfall infiltration through the Terzaghi's effective stress principle, thus directly resolving the deformation of the active shear zone. Calibration and validation of the computations benefited from both ground-based and remote sensing data for three active landslides in the California Coast Ranges, USA. We find that our model can accurately describe both slow quasi-continuous and episodic movement commonly displayed by active landslides. Although inherent limitations of the viscoplasticity framework did not enable us to describe catastrophic landslide acceleration, our model provides versatile tools that can be used to analyze and describe distinct types of slow-moving landslide dynamics.

TI  - TREE SPECIES RECOGNITION AT STANDS SCALE: VALIDITY TEST OF MULTI-TEXTURE EXTRACTED FROM MULTI- SEASONAL UAV-BASED IMAGERY
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-type texture features of images of four seasons in pure stand tree species recognition, this research applied 5-band RedEdge-MX sensor to collect remote sensing data of four seasons and extracted eight texture features, including mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment and correlation, from 20 spectral bands. Maximum likelihood classification and random forest were adopted for the determination of the best window for texture extraction which resulted in the construction of optimal texture feature set in tree species recognition. Then, the performance of these texture feature sets along with their combinations in tree species recognition was analyzed. Experimental findings showed that the eight texture features of four seasonal data performed well in the recognition of pure stand tree species. Texture feature mean presented the highest performance (with overall accuracy of 88.8559%) and worst variance (84.8180%). The combination of eight texture features further improved the recognition accuracy of tree species (92.0599%) compared with single texture features. The recognition accuracy of tree species could be further improved by combining eight texture features with spectral band and digital surface model (92.7002%). Research showed that the application of multi-type texture features in typical seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter fully captured the differences of various tree species in different bands and seasons, which could be applied to the effectively identify pure stand tree species in regular plots.

TI  - MODIS-derived green <i>Noctiluca</i> blooms in the upper Gulf of Thailand: Algorithm development and seasonal variation mapping
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, red tides of non-toxic harmful algal blooms have frequently occurred in monsoon-influenced tropical areas, particularly the green form of Noctiluca scintillans (hereafter green Noctiluca). However, our understanding of the mechanism of red tide formation is hindered by spatial and temporal constraints of field data. In this study, we used moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) ocean color data along with a locally developed algal-bloom classification algorithm to investigate the seasonal variability of dominant red tides across the upper Gulf of Thailand (uGoT). During our July 2018 observation, a super green Noctiluca bloom with extraordinarily high chl-a (>1,469 mg m(-3)) displayed a distinct spectral reflectance characteristic among red tides in blue-to-green and red-to-near infrared wavelengths. According to the distinctive in situ hyperspectral characteristics of uGoT algal blooms, we developed a classification algorithm for MODIS normalized at 488, 531, and 667 nm, which successfully discriminated green Noctiluca in three levels of blooms, namely, super (100%), strong (>80%), and weak (>40%), from other algal blooms (i.e., dinoflagellates, diatoms, cyanobacteria, and mixed red tide species) as well as non-bloom oceanic and coastal waters using MODIS data, as confirmed by uGoT red tide reports. Monthly MODIS-based discrimination composites from 2003 to 2021 revealed seasonal variability in the surface distribution and bloom frequency of green Noctiluca and other red tides according to the Asian monsoon seasons: the southwest monsoon (May-September) and the northeast monsoon (October-January of the following year). Green Noctiluca blooms occurred farther from the shore and estuaries than other red tides (dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria), and were much more frequent than other red tides between the Tha Chin and Chao Phraya River mouths during the non-monsoon period (February to April). The frequency and distribution of green Noctiluca blooms, as well as other algal blooms, varied with the monsoon season. By comparing MODIS-derived algal blooms to monsoon-induced factors (i.e., sea surface winds, precipitation, and river discharge), we present an unprecedented overview of the spatial and temporal dynamics of red tides throughout the uGoT under Asian monsoon conditions. This research contributes to our understanding of the impact of climate change on phytoplankton dynamics.

TI  - Use of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide (SPIO) Versus Conventional Technique in Sentinel Lymph Node Detection for Breast Cancer: A Randomised Controlled Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundThe objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of the superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-guided and standard techniques for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in early breast cancer. Multiple inferiority trials have concluded the non-inferiority of SPIO to the conventional radioisotope technique, with or without blue dye, in detecting SLNs.Patients and MethodsFrom July 2018 to August 2022, patients clinically diagnosed with node-negative invasive breast cancer were randomised into the study group (SPIO) and control group (radioisotope and blue dye). Patient data and disease characteristics were prospectively collected. SLN detection rates were compared between the two groups.ResultsA total of 282 patients undergoing 288 sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedures were recruited, and 144 SLNB procedures were randomised into each group. The baseline patient and disease characteristics were comparable. SLN localisation failed in one patient in each group; the success rate of SLNB was 99.3%. The SPIO group demonstrated a higher mean number of SLNs harvested (3.3 versus 2.8, p = 0.039) and longer mean procedure duration (33.1 min versus 22.3 min, p = 0.01) than the control group did. In the study group, the concordance rates per patient and node were 99.3% and 94.6%, respectively. Sixty-seven positive SLNs were detected in 37 patients. The concordance rates per malignant SLNB procedure and positive SLN were 97.3% and 96.8%, respectively.ConclusionSingle-tracer SPIO-guided SLNB was non-inferior to the dual technique (radioisotope and blue dye) and could safely replace the gold standard for SLN mapping in early breast cancer.

TI  - Seasonal effects on aboveground biomass estimation in mountainous deciduous forests using ZY-3 stereoscopic imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Stereoscopic images are getting attentions in the forest remote sensing. It is essential to clarify environmental effects on detecting forest spatial structures using stereoscopic images in addition to data processing algorithms. The seasonal effects in mountainous deciduous forests is systematically explored in this study from mid-summer to late winter using 8 dates of ZY-3 stereoscopic images. This study reveals that the acquisition season is an important factor affecting the detection of forest spatial structures. In the leaf-on season, for closed forest stands, the forest canopy tops are easily to be detected; for open forest stands, the ground surface can be detected through between-canopy gaps in mid-summer, but be missed in late summer or early fall. In the leaf-off season, the stereoscopic imagery acquired in late winter or early spring was preferred for the detection of ground surfaces, while the mountain shadows limit those acquired in early and middle winter. The ratio of sunlit ground visible in stereoscopic images as the season change is the factor controlling these findings. The images with the smaller ratio are preferred for the detection of forest canopy tops, while the opposite is proper for the detection of ground surfaces. The combination of ZY-3 stereoscopic imagery acquired in mid-summer and late winter gave the best estimation accuracy of forest AGB among possible combinations.

TI  - Assessing Precipitation Over the Amazon Basin as Simulated by a Storm-Resolving Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate whether a better representation of precipitation in the Amazon basin arises through an explicit representation of convection and whether it is related to the representation of organized systems. In addition to satellite data, we use ensemble simulations of the ICON-NWP model at storm-resolving (2.5-5.0 km) scales with explicit convection (E-CON) and coarse resolutions, with parameterized convection (P-CON). The main improvements in the representation of Amazon precipitation by E-CON are in the distribution of precipitation intensity and the spatial distribution in the diurnal cycle. By isolating precipitation from organized convective systems (OCS), it is shown that many of the well simulated precipitation features in the Amazon arise from the distribution of these systems. The simulated and observed OCS are classified into 6 clusters which distinguish nocturnal and diurnal OCS. While the E-CON ensembles capture the OCS, especially their diurnal cycle, their frequency is reduced compared to observations. Diurnal clusters are influenced by surface processes such as cold pools, which aid to the propagation of OCS. Nocturnal clusters are rather associated with strong low-level easterlies, possibly related to the Amazonian low-level jet. Our results also show no systematic improvement with a twofold grid refinement and remaining biases related to stratiform features of OCS suggest that yet unresolved processes play an important role for correctly representing precipitating systems in the Amazon.

TI  - Omission of axillary lymph node dissection in patients with ypN plus breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: A retrospective multicenter study (KROG 21-06)
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We evaluated the impact of omitting axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on oncological outcomes in breast cancer patients with residual nodal disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: The medical records of patients who underwent NAC followed by surgical resection and had residual nodal disease were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 1273 patients from 12 institutions were included; all underwent postoperative radiotherapy. Axillary surgery consisted of ALND in 1103 patients (86.6%) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx) alone in 170 (13.4%). Univariate and multivariate an-alyses of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were performed before and after propensity score matching (PSM). Results: The median follow-up was 75.3 months (range, 2.5-182.7). Axillary recurrence rates were 4.8% in the ALND group (n = 53) and 4.7% in the SLNBx group (n = 8). Before PSM, univariate analysis indicated that the 5-year OS rate was inferior in the ALND group compared to the SLNBx group (86.6% vs. 93.3%, respectively; P = 0.002); multivariate analysis did not show a difference between groups (P = 0.325). After PSM, 258 and 136 patients were included in the ALND and SLNBx groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the ALND and SLNBx groups in DFS (5-year rate, 75.8% vs. 76.9%, respectively; P = 0.406) or OS (5-year rate, 88.7% vs. 93.1%, respectively; P = 0.083). Conclusions: SLNBx alone did not compromise oncological outcomes in patients with residual nodal disease after NAC. The omission of ALND might be a possible option for axillary management in patients treated with NAC and postoperative radiotherapy.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd, BASO -The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Effects of urbanisation on ecosystem service values: A case study of Nha Trang, Vietnam.
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have significantly reshaped the environmental landscape and altered land composition, thereby negatively affecting the structures and functions of ecosystem. Paradoxically, complex conditions and procedures of ecosystem operations generate a range of goods and services on which humans rely upon to thrive. This study examines the land-use transition and ecosystem service value changes in Nha Trang, Vietnam in order to understand and quantify the impacts of urbanisation patterns on ecosystems. Changes in the value of ecosystem services were acquired based on modified value coefficients from previous studies and land-use/land-cover information derived from Landsat satellite imagery in the years 1990, 2000, 2011, and 2020. The results show a significant decrease in ecosystem service value associated with the expansion and densification of urban areas over the past 30 years. Total annual value increased from 148.7 million USD in 1990-172.2 million USD in 2000 due to the success of forest rehabilitation efforts, followed by a decline to 149.3 million USD in 2020 because of the rapid development of urban agglomeration at the expense of cultivated land. Drawing from the outcomes, we suggest that the priority of regional land-use planning should be given to ecosystem-based ap-proaches rather than inadequate urban expansion. Hence, guidelines to incorporate the ecosystem service concept into urban planning are proposed to promote climate-resilient city management and sustainable development.

TI  - Examining the effects of green space accessibility on school performance for 3421 elementary schools
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - ABSTR A C T This study assesses green space accessibility and school performance at Ontario elementary schools (n = 3421), including green space on school property and in the school's 1.6 km and 5 km neighbourhood boundaries, to understand the potential effects of green space on student achievement. School addresses, enrollment numbers, socioeconomic factors, and standardized test scores were obtained from the Ontario Ministry of Education website. Each address was geocoded and manually validated using satellite imagery. Property boundary data was obtained from Ontario's comprehensive parcel boundary data, which required manual validation and digital editing in a GIS. Remote sensing was used to identify green space, calculated using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholds on Landsat 7 and 8 data. School performance data were based on province-wide standardized test scores at the third-and sixth-grade levels in reading, writing, and mathematics from the year 2018. Student performance was regressed against green space with beta regression models. Socioeconomic factors were included as confounding factors in the statistical analysis. Our findings suggest that a greater proportion of greenness at the 5 km neighbourhood level is negatively associated with higher school performance in Ontario elementary schools (p < 0.01 and 0.001); however, an association was not demonstrated at the school boundary and the 1.6 km neighbourhood boundary. The statistical association between green space and school performance in various boundaries within Ontario schools is essential for maintaining and improving green space and youth development.

TI  - Wellbeing Learnings from Pandemic Pedagogies in Aotearoa New Zealand
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses data from a survey of New Zealand teachers conducted in 2020 during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. It considers this data in the light of a series of contexts: Te Tiriti o Waitangi; social inequalities particularly in relation to the impacts of colonisation and neoliberal social and economic policies on Maori; the New Zealand government's commitment to wellbeing; Te Ara Waiora, a Maori model of wellbeing utilised by the New Zealand Treasury; and the status of the teaching profession in Aotearoa New Zealand. Using data from the teachers' responses to the survey, it outlines ways in which wellbeing was prioritised by teachers during these early months of the pandemic, when teachers were suddenly required to pivot to online teaching. It argues that the wellbeing values as espoused in te ao Maori, a Maori worldview, and those articulated by teachers provide inspiration for a pathway beyond the privations of the pandemic.

TI  - Modelling PM2.5 for Data-Scarce Zone of Northwestern India using Multi Linear Regression and Random Forest Approaches
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 (Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 m) concentrations above permissible limit causes air quality deterioration and hampers human health. Due to the lack of a good spatial network of ground-based PM monitoring sites and systematic checking, the availability of continuous data of PM2.5 concentrations at macro and meso scales is restricted. Present research estimated PM2.5 concentrations at high (1 km) resolution over Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Gautam Buddha Nagar, a data-scarce zone of the highly urbanized area of northwestern India for the year 2019 using Random Forest (RF), Multi-Linear Regression (MLR) models and Hybrid Model combining RF and MLR. It included Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), meteorological data and limited in-situ data of PM2.5. For validation, the correlation coefficient (R), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Relative Prediction Error (RPE) have been utilized. The hybrid model estimated PM2.5 with a greater correlation (R = 0.865) and smaller RPE (22.41%) compared to standalone MLR/RF models. Despite the inadequate in-situ data, Greater Noida has been found to have a high correlation (R = 0.933) and low RPE (32.13%) in the hybrid model. The most polluted seasons of the year are winter (137.28 mu gm(-3)) and post-monsoon (112.93 mu gm(-3)), whereas the wet monsoon (44.56 mu gm(-3)) season is the cleanest. The highest PM2.5 level was recorded in Noida followed by Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Faridabad. The findings of the present research will provide an input dataset for air pollution exposure risk research in parts of northwestern India with sparse monitoring data.

TI  - Sexual mixing patterns in men who have sex with men: network approaches for smart resource allocation
T2  - SEXUAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Age-based sexual mixing patterns in men who have sex with men (MSM) can greatly inform strategic allocation of intervention resources to subsets of the population for the purpose of preventing the greatest number of new HIV infections. Methods. Egocentric network data collected from MSM participating in annual HIV sentinel surveillance surveys were used to assess age-dependent mixing and to explore its epidemiological implications on the risk of HIV transmission risk (among those HIV-infected) and HIV acquisition risk (among those not infected). Results. Mixing in this sample of 1605 Chinese MSM is relatively age assortative (the average of values expressing the degree of preferential mixing were 2.01 in diagonal cells vs 0.87 in off-diagonal cells). Expected numbers of HIV acquisition were highest in the 20-24 years age group; those for HIV transmissions were highest among 25-29 year olds. The risk of both acquisition and transmission was highest in age groups that immediately follow the most commonly reported ages of sexual debut in this population (i.e. age 20). Conclusions. These findings suggest that combination prevention resources should be targeted at younger MSM who are at higher risk of both transmission and acquisition. Programs may also do well to target even younger age groups who have not yet debuted in order to establish prevention effects before risky sexual behaviours begin. More research on optimal strategies to access these harder-to-reach subsets of the MSM population is needed. Findings also support ongoing efforts for public health practitioners to collect network data in key populations to support more empirically driven strategies to target prevention resources.

TI  - Extensive protected area coverage and an updated global population estimate for the Endangered Madagascar Serpent-eagle <i>Eutriorchis astur</i>
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge gaps regarding distribution, habitat associations, and population size for rare and threatened range-restricted taxa lead to uncertainty in directing conservation action. Quantifying range metrics and species-habitat associations using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) with remote-sensing habitat data can overcome these setbacks by establishing baseline estimates for biological parameters critical for conservation assessments. Area of Habitat (AOH) is a new range metric recently developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. AOH seeks to quantify inferred habitat within a species' range to inform extinction risk assessments. Here, we used SDMs correlating occurrences with remote-sensing covariates to calculate a first estimate of AOH for the Endangered Madagascar Serpent-eagle Eutriorchis astur, and then updated additional IUCN range metrics and the current global population estimate. From these baselines we then conducted a gap analysis assessing protected area coverage. Our continuous SDM had robust predictive performance (Continuous Boyce Index = 0.835) and when reclassified to a binary model estimated an AOH = 30,121 km(2), 13% less than the current IUCN range map. We estimated a global population of 533 mature individuals derived from the Madagascar Serpent-eagle AOH metric, which was within current IUCN population estimates. The current protected area network covered 95% of AOH, with the binary model identifying three additional key habitat areas as new protected area designations to fully protect Madagascar Serpent-eagle habitat. Our results demonstrated that correlating presence-only occurrences with remote-sensing habitat covariates can fill knowledge gaps useful for informing conservation action. Applying this spatial information to conservation planning would ensure almost full protected area coverage for this endangered raptor. For tropical forest habitat specialists, we recommend that potential predictors derived from remote sensing, such as vegetation indices and biophysical measures, are considered as covariates, along with other variables including climate and topography.

TI  - Monitoring impacts of soil bund on spatial variation of teff and finger millet yield with Sentinel-2 and spectroradiometric data in Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from remote sensing devices are essential for monitoring environmental protection practices and estimating crop yields. However, yield estimates in Ethiopia are based on time-consuming surveys. We used Sentinel-2, spectroradiometeric, and ground-truthing data to estimate the grain yield (GY) of two major crops, teff, and finger millet, in Ethiopia's Aba Gerima catchment in 2020 and 2021. At the flowering stage, we performed supervised classification on October Sentinel-2 images and spectral reflectance measurement. We used regression models to identify and predict crop yields, as evaluated by the coefficient of determination (adjusted R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) provided the best fit to the data among the vegetation indices used to predict teff and finger millet GY. Soil bund construction increased the majority of vegetation indices and GY of both crops. We discovered a strong correlation between GY and the satellite EVI and NDVI. However, NDVI and EVI had the greatest influence on teff GY (adjusted R2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.14 ton/ha), while NDVI had the greatest influence on finger millet GY (adjusted R2 = 0.85; RMSE = 0.24 ton/ha). Teff GY ranged from 0.64 to 2.16 ton/ha for bunded plots and 0.60 to 1.85 ton/ha for non-bunded plots using Sentinel-2 data. Besides, finger millet GY ranged from 1.92 to 2.57 ton/ha for bunded plots and 1.81 to 2.38 ton/ha for non-bunded plots using spec-troradiometric data. Our findings show that Sentinel -2-and spectroradiometeric-based moni-toring can help farmers manage teff and finger millet to achieve higher yields, more sustainable food production, and better environmental quality in the area. The study's findings revealed a link between VIs and soil management practices in soil ecological systems. Model extrapolation to other areas will necessitate local validation.

TI  - Widespread seasonal speed-up of west Antarctic Peninsula glaciers from 2014 to 2021
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet is dominated by ice dynamics, where ocean-driven melt leads to un-buttressing and ice flow acceleration. Long-term ice speed change has been measured in Antarctica over the past four decades; however, there are limited observations of short-term seasonal speed variability on the grounded ice sheet. Here we assess seasonal variations in ice flow speed on 105 glaciers on the west Antarctic Peninsula using Sentinel-1 satellite observations spanning 2014 to 2021. We find an average summer speed-up of 12.4 +/- 4.2%, with maximum speed change of up to 22.3 +/- 3.2% on glaciers with the most pronounced seasonality. Our results show that over the six-year study period, glaciers on the west Antarctic Peninsula respond to seasonal forcing in the ice-ocean-atmosphere system, indicating sensitivity to changes in terminus position, surface melt plus rainwater flux, and ocean temperature. Seasonal speed variations must be accounted for when measuring the mass balance and sea level contribution of the Antarctic Peninsula, and studies must establish the future evolution of this previously undocumented signal under climate warming scenarios.Glaciers on the west Antarctic Peninsula flowed on average 12% faster during the summer compared with winter due to a mix of oceanic and atmospheric influences, according to an analysis of remote sensing data from 2014 to 2021.

TI  - "Beyond waking and walking. Intensive rehabilitation in patients requiring extended durations of advanced mechanical circulatory support: A case series"
T2  - PERFUSION-UK
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Physical therapy (PT) utilization in patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been reported; however, little is known about intensive rehabilitation and associated outcomes in patients requiring extended complex MCS and/or ECMO support. Purpose: Authors sought to explore safety, feasibility and outcomes associated with active rehabilitation in patients requiring prolonged advanced MCS/ECMO support. Research Design: Single-center retrospective series evaluated functional, clinical, and longitudinal outcomes of sample of eight critically ill, adult (>= 18 years of age) patients who underwent a intensive rehabilitation while receiving prolonged MCS/ECMO through advanced configurations including: venovenous (VV-ECMO), venoarterial (VA-ECMO), oxygenator with right ventricular assist device (Oxy-RVAD) and right ventricular assist device (RVAD). Data Analysis: 406 sessions were conducted; 246 during provision of advanced MCS/ECMO support. Results: Incidence of major adverse events-accidental decannulation, migration of cannulas, circuit failure, hemorrhage, major flow limitations, and major hemodynamic instability-was 1.2 events per 100 sessions. None of reported major adverse events impeded longitudinal ability to participate in PT. Increased time to PT initiation was associated with a statistically significant increase in intensive care unit (ICU) length-of-stay (beta 1 1.93, CI 0.55-3.30) and reduced ambulatory distance during last session on MCS/ECMO (beta 1 -47.64, CI - 93.93, -1.66). All patients survived to hospital discharge and 12 months from sentinel hospitalization. Amongst those patients discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation center (n = 4), all were discharged home within 3 months. Conclusion: Findings support the safety and feasibility of active rehabilitational PT in patients requiring extended durations of advanced MCS/ECMO support. Moreover, it highlights potentially associated benefits of this degree of intensive rehabilitation for these unique patients. Further investigation is needed to identify associations with longitudinal clinical outcomes, as well as predictors of success in this population.

TI  - The Ratio Distribution of Evapotranspiration to Precipitation well Related With Soil Thickness in Karst Watershed of Southwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is predominant variable for water management in various types of ecosystems, and it has been intensively studied through in situ measuring and modeling methods. However, it is challenging to measure actual ET and upscale it to regional level for karst landscapes, where aquifers typically show remarkable and rapid responses to precipitation events. There is an urgent need to quantify water fluxes to provide reliable evidence for the protection and sustainable management of karst water resources. Therefore, in this study, five plots were built to observe actual ET based on Thermal Dissipation Probes, redesigned ventilated chamber and in-site microlysimeters in a karst watershed in southwest China. Then, three models (Penman-Monteith-Leurning, PML; Remote Sensing-Priestley and Taylor; and Hargreaves) were constructed to upscale ET estimation to the regional level based on Landsat-8 images and MODIS data. The results showed that: (a) The PML model performed better than other models (p < 0.01) with higher R-2 values (0.72 for MODIS images and 0.87 for Landsat-8 images); (b) Daily ET exhibited significant seasonal variability and different spatial distribution, and yearly ET exhibited well related with soil thickness (R-2 = 0.58); (c) Daily ET had a slightly positive correlation with DEM, however, had a negative correlation with ground temperature. This study is helpful to improve accuracy of measured and estimated ET by combining remote sensing data, and it has important implications for upscaling it to regional level. It suggests that ET is strongly regulated by constant supply of water, vegetation coverage, and available energy in karst catchments.

TI  - Assessing impacts of land use/land cover changes on the hydrology of Upper Gilgel Abbay watershed using the SWAT model
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Population and economic growth, and the consequent increase in food demands have put great pressures on environmental resources and they are driving rapid LULC changes. This study is aimed to examine the impacts of land use/land cover LULC changes on the hydrology of the Upper Gilgel Abay watershed. Landsat images (Landsat 5 TM 1986, Landsat ETM+ 2003, and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS 2021) were categorized into LULC classes following the supervised image classification technique, and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to evaluate the hydrological impacts of LULC changes. The result of image analysis revealed an increase in cultivated land (11.7%) and a decrease in forest (39.6%), shrubland (17.5%), grassland (5.6%), and water bodies (25%) during 1986-2003 periods. On the other hand, between 2003 and 2021 periods, cultivated land, grassland and water bodies were decreased while woodland and shrubland were grew up. Consequent to the LULC changes taking place between 1986 and 2003 periods, surface runoff (6%) and water yield (1.8%) were increased, but groundwater flow (37.9), lateral flow (4.1), soil water (1.85), and evapotranspiration (2.2%) were decreased at a watershed-scale. In contrast, the average watershed surface runoff and water yield were decreased between 2003 and 2021 time scales, while lateral flow, groundwater flow, soil water, and evapotranspiration increased, owing to the growth of forest and shrubland and the decline of cultivated land. The study also indicated the hydrological impacts of the LULC changes at the sub-watershed scales. The impacts of LULC change on status of hydrological components during 1986-2003 and 2003-2021 periods were different compared with the findings at the watershed scale. The findings suggests improvements of vegetation covers to reduce surface runoff and increase groundwater flow and soil water content in the study area in particular and in the Ethiopian Highlands in general.

TI  - The impact of wildfires on air pollution and health across land use categories in Brazil over a 16-year period
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires cause many environmental impacts, including air pollution. Brazil is a very fire-prone region where few studies have investigated the impact of wildfires on air quality and health. We proposed to test two hy-potheses in this study: i) the wildfires in Brazil have increased the levels of air pollution and posed a health hazard in 2003-2018, and ii) the magnitude of this phenomenon depends on the type of land use and land cover (e.g., forest area, agricultural area, etc.). Satellite and ensemble models derived data were used as input in our analyses. Wildfire events were retrieved from Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), provided by NASA; air pollution data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS); meteoro-logical variables from the ERA-Interim model; and land use/cover data were derived from pixel-based classifi-cation of Landsat satellite images by MapBiomas. We used a framework that infers the "wildfire penalty" by accounting for differences in linear pollutant annual trends (beta) between two models to test these hypotheses. The first model was adjusted for Wildfire-related Land Use activities (WLU), considered as an adjusted model. In the second model, defined as an unadjusted model, we removed the wildfire variable (WLU). Both models were controlled by meteorological variables. We used a generalized additive approach to fit these two models. To estimate mortality associated with wildfire penalties, we applied health impact function. Our findings suggest that wildfire events between 2003 and 2018 have increased the levels of air pollution and posed a significant health hazard in Brazil, supporting our first hypothesis. For example, in the Pampa biome, we estimated an annual wildfire penalty of 0.005 mu g/m3 (95%CI: 0.001; 0.009) on PM2.5. Our results also confirm the second hypothesis. We observed that the greatest impact of wildfires on PM2.5 concentrations occurred in soybean areas in the Amazon biome. During the 16 years of the study period, wildfires originating from soybean areas in the Amazon biome were associated with a total penalty of 0.64 mu g/m3 (95%CI: 0.32; 0.96) on PM2.5, causing an estimated 3872 (95%CI: 2560; 5168) excess deaths. Sugarcane crops were also a driver of deforestation-related wildfires in Brazil, mainly in Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. Our findings suggest that between 2003 and 2018, fires originating from sugarcane crops were associated with a total penalty of 0.134 mu g/m3 (95%CI: 0.037; 0.232) on PM2.5 in Atlantic Forest biome, resulting in an estimated 7600 (95%CI: 4400; 10,800) excess deaths during the study period, and 0.096 mu g/m3 (95%CI: 0.048; 0.144) on PM2.5 in Cerrado biome, resulting in an estimated 1632 (95%CI: 1152; 2112) excess deaths during the study period. Considering that the wildfire penalties observed during our study period may continue to be a challenge in the future, this study should be of interest to policymakers to prepare future strategies related to forest protection, land use management, agri-cultural activities, environmental health, climate change, and sources of air pollution.

TI  - Recent morphological shifting of Padma River: geoenvironmental and socioeconomic implications
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the recent morphological changes of Padma River with consequent socioeconomic impacts on the downstream riverbank area. Morphological changes of the river reach were analyzed using remote sensing (RS) data (from 2010 to 2019) and GIS technique. Social survey was performed in Zajira and Naria upazilas of Shariatpur district among 150 respondents to determine the social and economic losses. The GIS analysis showed that the average rate of erosion of major channel was 42 m/yr and the average accretion rate was 38 m/yr at the secondary channel. The northeastern channel was abandoned and shifted toward south at the rate of 262 m/yr. Shariatpur site was affected by noticeable erosion at the rate of 52 m/yr. The changing pattern of chars showed that sedimentation rate was higher at the northern side comparing the south. Statistically significant differences were found from independent sample T test for the mean shifting in main channel (t (3) = - 3.87, p < .03), secondary channel (t (6) = 3.32, p < .02), and char area (t (8) = 4.32, p < .005) before and after 2014. Welch's ANOVA showed significant differences in the mean river width shifting among the reference lines for both main and secondary channels. The data from social survey showed that 95% people living along riverbank had lost most of their lands in between 2014 and 2019. Majority of the respondents (67%) noticed the anthropogenic influences around the bridge site to be one of the contributors to accelerate the recent erosion. In addition to settlement, structural, and economic loss, both physical and mental health of the riverbank people is affected due to frequent migration. Immediate necessary steps through effective river management policy guidelines and implementation to adopt a permanent solution are required.

T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater cetaceans play a significant role as sentinel animals, providing important data on animal species and aquatic ecosystem health. They also may serve as potential reservoirs of emerging pathogens and host virulence genes in their microbiota. In this study, we evaluated virulence factors produced by Gram-negative bacteria recovered from individuals belonging to two populations of free-ranging Amazon river dolphins (Inia geoffrensis). A total of 132 isolates recovered from the oral cavity, blowhole, genital opening and rectum of 21 river dolphins, 13 from Negro River and 8 from Tapajos River, Brazil, were evaluated for the production of virulence factors, such as biofilms and exoproducts (proteases, hemolysins and siderophores), in planktonic and biofilm forms. In planktonic form, 81.1% (107/132) of the tested bacteria of free-ranging Amazon river dolphins were able to produce virulence factors, with 44/132 (33.4%), 65/132 (49,2%) and 54/132 (40,9%) positive for protease, hemolysin and siderophore production, respectively. Overall, 57/132 (43.2%) of the isolates produced biofilms and, under this form of growth, 66/132 (50%), 88/132 (66.7%) and 80/132 (60.6%) of the isolates were positive for protease, hemolysin and siderophore production. In general, the isolates showed a higher release of exoproducts in biofilm than in planktonic form (P < 0.001). The present findings show that Amazon river dolphins harbor potentially pathogenic bacteria in their microbiota, highlighting the importance of monitoring the micro-organisms from wild animals, as they may emerge as pathogens for humans and other animals.

TI  - Evaluating TROPOMI and MODIS performance to capture the dynamic of air pollution in Sa tilde o Paulo state: A case study during the COVID-19 outbreak
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric pollutant data retrieved through satellite sensors are continually used to assess changes in air quality in the lower atmosphere. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies started to use satellite mea-surements to evaluate changes in air quality in many different regions worldwide. However, although satellite data is continuously validated, it is known that its accuracy may vary between monitored areas, requiring regionalized quality assessments. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate whether satellites could measure changes in the air quality of the state of Sa similar to o Paulo, Brazil, during the COVID-19 outbreak; and to verify the relationship between satellite-based data [Tropospheric NO2 column density and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)] and ground -based concentrations [NO2 and particulate material (PM; coarse: PM10 and fine: PM2.5)]. For this purpose, tropospheric NO2 obtained from the TROPOMI sensor and AOD retrieved from MODIS sensor data by using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm were compared with concentrations obtained from 50 automatic ground monitoring stations. The results showed low correlations between PM and AOD. For PM10, most stations showed correlations lower than 0.2, which were not significant. The results for PM2.5 were similar, but some stations showed good correlations for specific periods (before or during the COVID-19 outbreak). Satellite-based Tropospheric NO2 proved to be a good predictor for NO2 concentrations at ground level. Considering all stations with NO2 measurements, correlations >0.6 were observed, reaching 0.8 for specific stations and periods. In general, it was observed that regions with a more industrialized profile had the best correlations, in contrast with rural areas. In addition, it was observed about 57% reductions in tropospheric NO2 throughout the state of Sa similar to o Paulo during the COVID-19 outbreak. Variations in air pollutants were linked to the region economic vocation, since there were reductions in industrialized areas (at least 50% of the industrialized areas showed >20% decrease in NO2) and increases in areas with farming and livestock characteristics (about 70% of those areas showed increase in NO2). Our results demonstrate that Tropospheric NO2 column densities can serve as good predictors of NO2 concentrations at ground level. For MAIAC-AOD, a weak relationship was observed, requiring the evaluation of other possible predictors to describe the relationship with PM. Thus, it is concluded that regionalized assessment of satellite data accuracy is essential for assertive estimates on a regional/local level. Good quality information retrieved at specific polluted areas does not assure a worldwide use of remote sensor data.

TI  - Geometric positioning integrating optical satellite stereo imagery and a global database of ICESat-2 laser control points: A framework and key technologies
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Block Adjustment (BA) is one of the essential techniques for producing high-precision geospatial 3D data products with optical stereo satellite imagery. For block adjustment with few ground-control points or without ground control, the vertical error of the model is the decisive factor that constrains the accuracy of 3D data products. The elevation data obtained by spaceborne laser altimeter have the advantages of short update periods, high positioning precision, and low acquisition cost, providing sufficient data support for improving the elevation accuracy of stereo models through the combined BA. This paper proposes a geometric positioning model based on the integration of Optical Satellite Stereo Imagery (OSSI) and spaceborne laser altimeter data. Firstly, we elaborate the principle and necessity of this work through a literature review of existing methods. Then, the framework of our geo-positioning models. Secondly, four key technologies of the proposed model are expounded in order, including the acquisition and management of global Laser Control Points, the association of LCPs and OSSI, the block adjustment model combining LCPs with OSSI, and the accuracy estimation and quality control of the combined BA. Next, the combined BA experiment using Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) OSSI and ICESat-2 laser data was carried out at the testing site in Shandong Province, China. Experimental results prove that our method can automatically select LCPs with high accuracy. The elevation deviation of the combined BA eventually achieved the Mean Error (ME) of 0.06 m and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.18 m, much lower than the ME of 13.20 m and the RMSE of 3.88 m before the block adjustment. A further research direction will be how to perform more adequate accuracy analysis and quality control using massive laser points as checkpoints.

TI  - Bio-optical trends of waters around Vald?es Biosphere Reserve: An assessment of the temporal variability based on 20 years of ocean color satellite data
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Image Time Series are becoming increasingly available and will continue to do so in the coming years thanks to the launch of space missions which aim to provide a high spatial resolution coverage of the Earth every few days. Bio-optical characteristics and their variation over time have been poorly studied in the Patagonian shelf. In this paper, we present the trends of time series analysis from satellite images that allows us to interpret the variations of bio-optical properties throughout time and their implications for planktonic organisms. The annual and seasonal trends of six variables were analyzed for two different gulfs, Nuevo and San Jose ', in northern Patagonia from January 2003-December 2021. We present the dynamic temporal changes of chlorophyll a (Chla-sat), phytoplankton absorption (Ab_phy), detritus absorption as well as environmental features changes for the sea surface temperature (SST), depth of the euphotic zone (Z_eu) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). We found positive trends for SST, Ab_phy at 443 nm and PAR, but negative for Z_eu in Nuevo and San Jose ' gulfs. The positive trendlines for SST and negative for Z_eu suggest less availability of nutrients and light. These trends could change the bloom phenology and modify the phytoplankton community structure with implications for the entire food web and the ecosystem services in the VBR.

TI  - Multi-scenario simulation of land use and land cover based on shared socioeconomic pathways: The case of coastal special economic zones in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land-use change simulations without considering the sustainable planning policies, especially in special economic park highly concerned by planners, might lack the reliability and availability. Thus, this study proposes a novel planning support systems integrating the Cellular Automata Markov chain model and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (CA-Markov-SSPs) for predicting the changing of land use and land cover (LULC) at the local and system level by using a novel machine learning-driven, multi-source spatial data modelling framework. Using multi-source satellite data of coastal special economic zones from 2000 to 2020 as a sample, calibration validation based on the kappa indicates a highest average reliability above 0.96 from 2015 to 2020, and the cultivated land and built-up land classes of LULC is the most significant changes in 2030 by using the transition matrix of probabilities, the other classes except water bodies continue to increase. And the non-sustainable development scenario can be prevented by the multiple level collaboration of socio-economic factors. This research intended to help decision makers to confine irrational urban expansion and achieve the sustainable development.

TI  - Remote sensing approaches for crop nutrition diagnosis and recommendations for nitrogen fertilizers in rice at canopy level
T2  - ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilizer management plays a crucial role in high-yield rice production. To choose a well-performing rice N nutrient diagnosis indicator for developing rice production management strategies, this research conducted five field experiments under various N treatments. The results showed that machine learning and stepwise multiple linear regression suggested a strong relationship between vegetation indexes and agronomic indicators (0.70 > R-2 > 0.51). A strong correlation was obtained between red-edge based vegetation indexes and agronomic indicators (R-2 > 0.40). Additionally, the all-subset regression method results demonstrated that the red-edge basis vegetation indexes were generally applied during different vegetation index combinations. The red-edge basis vegetation indexes reached an approximately 40% contribution in nitrogen nutrient index prediction and an approximately 48% contribution in leaf area index monitoring. Furthermore, this study combined the normalized difference red-edge (NDRE) basis dynamic model to calculate the N dose, which ranged from 106 to 134 kg per hectare in large-scale N management according to the NDRE from Sentinel-2B images, a decrease of approximately 46 kg N ha(-1) fertilizer compared with farmers' practices. Nevertheless, more refinements are needed to ensure that this strategy can be applied to farmers' yield- and income-enhancing production.

TI  - Associations of residential greenness with unhealthy consumption behaviors: Evidence from high-density Hong Kong using street-view and conventional exposure metrics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Residential greenness was theoretically associated with health-related consumption behaviors concerning the socio-ecological model and restoration environment theory, but empirical studies were limited, especially in high-density cities. We examined the associations of residential greenness with unhealthy consumption behaviors (infrequent breakfast consumption, infrequent fruit consumption, infrequent vegetable consumption, alcohol drinking, binge drinking, cigarette smoking, moderate-to-heavy smoking, and heavy smoking) using street-view and conventional greenness metrics in high-density Hong Kong.Methods: This cross-sectional study employed survey data from 1,977 adults and residence-based objective environmental data in Hong Kong. Street-view greenness (SVG) was extracted from Google Street View images using an object-based image classification algorithm. Two conventional greenness metrics were used, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 remote-sensing images and park density derived from a geographic information system database. In the main analyses, logistic regression analyses together with interaction and stratified models were performed with environmental metrics measured within a 1000-m buffer of residence.Results: A standard deviation higher SVG and NDVI were significantly associated with fewer odds of infrequent breakfast consumption (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.71-0.94 for SVG; OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.95 for NDVI), infrequent fruit consumption (OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94 for SVG; OR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94 for NDVI), and infrequent vegetable consumption (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.66-0.92 for SVG; OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.94 for NDVI). The higher SVG was significantly associated with less binge drinking and the higher SVG at a 400-m buffer and a 600-m buffer were significantly associated with less heavy smoking. Park density was not signifi-cantly associated with any unhealthy consumption behaviors. Some of the above significant associations were moderated by moderate physical activity, mental and physical health, age, monthly income, and marital status.Conclusions: This study highlights the potential beneficial impact of residential greenness, especially in terms of street greenery, on healthier eating habits, less binge drinking, and less heavy smoking.

TI  - Detection of geothermal potential based on land surface temperature derived from remotely sensed and in-situ data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Geothermal energy is a renewable and environmentally sustainable resource of increasing importance. However, areas with geothermal potential are not easily detected by traditional field investigations, requiring the development of new, robust, and reliable models for detection. In this study, remote sensing data and ground-based variables were used to detect and analyze geothermal resource potential areas. General Land Surface Temperature (GLST) was integrated using 5 years of remote sensing data. Landsat 8 daytime GLST (Landsat-GLST), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime GLST (MODIS-DLST), and MODIS nighttime GLST (MODIS-NLST) data were integrated with Landsat Nighttime Land Surface Temperature (Night-LST), which not only filled the gap of Landsat Night-LST but also improved the spatial resolution of MODIS nighttime temperatures. Specifically, three independent variables (Night-LST, Distance From Known Geothermal Resource Points [DFGP], and Distance From Geological Faults [DFF]) were used to develop a weighted model to form a Geothermal Detection Index (GDI) based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Along with field verification, the GDI was successfully used to identify three geothermal activity areas in Tengchong City, Yunnan Province. Overall, this work provides a novel method for detecting geothermal potential to support the successful exploitation of geothermal resources.

TI  - Modeling and assessing the variation of land surface temperature as determinants to normalized difference vegetation index and land cover changes in Nigerian cities
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Increasing rates of urban population and infrastructural development have affected urban vegetation cover which increases the land surface temperature of the urban metropolitan cities. These anthropogenic activities reduce the functions of urban forest ecosystem services and thereby exposing the urban population to harsh environmental conditions. This study demonstrates 30 year influence of temporal variations of land surface temperature on vegetation cover and other land cover, using satellite data from two selected cities in Nigeria. The Landsat 4-5 (TM), Landsat 7 (ETM +) and Landsat 8 (OLI & TIRS) and the thermal band were used for calculating the (LST) and land cover of 1990, 2005 and 2020. The spatial distributions of changes detected in the period of the study were analyzed using ArcGIS 10.2.1. The near-infrared (NIR) and red band (bands 5 and 4, respectively) were used for estimating the vegetation cover changes. The vegetation cover decreased from 1990 to 2020 in Yenagoa, while it increased from 1990 to 2020 in Calabar. The results present the strongest correlation between LST and the land use/land cover changes in Calabar and Yenagoa. Data analysis shows that urbanization has brought about an increase in LST due to a decrease in the forest cover to impervious surfaces. The land use/land cover (LULC) analysis revealed the changes detected in the study period. Therefore, it was concluded that the availability and continuous usage of remote sensing data are essential for continuous monitoring of land surface temperature, land use/land cover changes and mapping of the vegetation cover.

TI  - Summertime Microscale Assessment and Prediction of Urban Thermal Comfort Zone Using Remote-Sensing Techniques for Kuwait
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization significantly accelerates the replacement of natural land-use and land-cover (LULC) classes, which can raise the temperature and diminish thermal comfort zone (TCZ), potentially negatively affecting the environment and human health. This study assesses and predicts the impacts of LULC change on directional shrinkage of the TCZ in Kuwait, using Landsat images and cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) algorithms from 1991 to 2031. The analysis revealed a rapid urban expansion (40%) in south-east (SE), north-east (NE), and north-west (NW) directions and shrinkage of TCZ (25% area with a very uncomfortable thermal condition) in N-NW and SW directions, from 1991 to 2021. The predicted scenario showed an increase in urban areas from 44% (2021) to 47% (2026) and 52% (2031). In contrast, very uncomfortable TCZ (35% in 2026 and 40% in 2031) was found concentrated around urban areas and bare land toward N-NE and N-NW directions. The study proposes effective and sustainable strategies to mitigate the shrinkage of TCZ, including zero-soil policies, planned landscape design, artificial water bodies, and rooftop gardens. This study will be an essential tool for promoting sustainable development in Kuwait by helping urban planners and policymakers realize the impacts of urbanization and land-use change on the TCZ.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change and driving factors of ecological status in Inner Mongolia based on the modified remote sensing ecological index
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensingmonitoring of regional ecological quality has advanced significantly with the rapid developments of remote sensing technology. At present, remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) has been widely used in ecological status monitoring. However, RSEI was proposed for urban environments, and the rationality and accuracy of its applicability to desert-dominated arid region ecosystems need to be demonstrated. Therefore, in this study, we incorporated desertification monitoring index (DMI) and salinity monitoring index (SMI) to RSEI and developed the modified remote sensing ecological index (MRSEI) for arid regions. Moreover, we analyzed the stability of MRSEI in ecological status monitoring for arid regions. The MRSEI was then used to evaluate the ecological quality of Inner Mongolia from 2000 to 2020 and exploring its causes. The results show that (1) Although the evaluation results of RSEI and MRSEI are more consistent in areas with high ecological status grades, the MRSEI results are more cautious and reliable in extreme conditions (e.g., desertification, salinization) than the RSEI. (2) Approximately 87.66% of ecological quality have improved or remain stable from 2000 to 2020, but the remaining areas (accounting for 12.34% of the whole area) are still under degraded conditions. This demonstrates that although local governments have made some progress in ecological conservation, the areas that are fluctuating or degraded still require protection or management. (3) In Inner Mongolia, the ecological quality which drove by precipitation (P) & temperature (T) accounting for 26.67% of the study area, population density (D) and GDP per capita (G) affected 13.23% of regional ecological quality. Overall, this research is crucial for evaluating spatial and temporal changes in arid region ecology and establishing conservation strategies.

TI  - Mapping of land degradation using spectral angle mapper approach (SAM): the case of Inaouene watershed (Northeast Morocco)
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the most critical hazards adversely affecting both environment and economy for all countries in the world. Several regions of Morocco suffer from the problem of soil erosion, notably the Rif and the Pre-Rif where the study area of this paper is located. The spectacular expansion of soil erosion processes in the Lahdar watershed is a worrying indicator of soil degradation. Geographic information systems and remote sensing are an excellent tool for analyzing and evaluating the risks of the expansion of soil degradation. The main objective of this paper is to assess spectral angle mapper (SAM) method and analyze their properties using geographic information system and image processing techniques in order to map the hazards of soil erosion. Land use and land cover dynamics demonstrate the relationship between human-induced development and the evolution of soil degradation and biodiversity conservation in a watershed. Therefore, an understanding of LULC factors is required for the implementation of environmental policies intended to foster a synergy between humans and the sustainability of their environment. The process of categorizing LULC was completed using the SAM technique, and the role of LULC in the dynamics of soil degradation was investigated using measurements of landscape fragmentation. For this purpose, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data (11 bands) with 30-m spatial resolution, 22 August -2017 were used, and classifiers for SAM were applied and evaluated. The findings of the study are seven main land cover categories: arboriculture (0.08%), cereal (35.05%), water (1.03%), forests (3.76%), residentials (4.61%), matorral-course (4.58%), and bare soils (50.89%). It should be noted that the bare soil class occupies half of the watershed area, making it vulnerable to the risks of soil degradation. Moreover, the results from this study will aid decision makers in better conservation planning of soil and water resources.

AB  - In intertidal areas, the zonation is determined by factors such as sea-level and topography. For this reason, a mixed methodology for the characterization (topography, extension, and zonation) of maximum intertidal areas is presented, based upon multispectral satellite imagery, hydrodynamic modeling, and in situ measurements. The methodology is applied and validated in the inner Cadiz Bay (SW Spain) as a case study. Satellite-derived waterlines were vertically referenced by tide-gauge measurements of sea-level; the resulting partial topography of intertidal areas was integrated into available hydrographic/topographic data to elaborate a high-resolution (10 m) model grid from which hydrody-namic simulations were conducted. Model results for lowest and highest tidal level situations were used to characterize the maximum intertidal areas within the inner Cadiz Bay, as well as the lowest astronomical tidal surface (LAT). The obtained LAT, referenced with respect the chosen geoid and/or ellipsoid, was identified with the vertical reference sur-face for Hydrography (VRSH) in this environment, complementing and improving the official VRSH presently being developed for Spanish waters. Obtained results show errors of the order of 1 cm for sea-level amplitudes and <1 min for the main tidal lags when comparing with tide-gauge data. Further applications of this exportable, relatively fast, low-cost, and accurate methodology are outlined.

TI  - Changes in the economic value of ecosystem services in rapidly growing urban areas: the case of Dhaka, Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the effects of land use patterns on ecosystem services can provide a conceptual foundation and point of reference for spatial planning strategies. The benefits ecosystems bring to individuals' lives and general well-being are referred to as ecosystem services. Land use/land cover (LULC) could influence various ecosystems and have implications for natural habitats and the quality of life. LULC has changed dramatically in Bangladesh during the past few decades, notably in the Dhaka Metropolitan Area. However, no attempt has been made to examine the co-evolution of LULC variations and values of ecosystem services (ESV) in the Dhaka Metropolitan Area. The study's objective is to evaluate the impact of LULC changes and different socio-demographic factors on ESV. LULC data sets were extracted from Landsat OLI and TIRS images using maximum likelihood classification. Analyses were conducted on both ESV estimations and driving forces, and the influence of LULC dynamics on the ESV was assessed. Data from 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2021 were used to estimate ESVs. LULC in the major metropolitan area of Dhaka has seen considerable changes between 1991 and 2021, with the most important change being the declination of water bodies, vegetation, and agricultural land. Vegetation and agricultural land proportions dropped from 22.50% and 19.29%, respectively, to 6.45% and 10.60%. Overall, there was a US$25.11M drop in ESV during 1991-2021. The study emphasizes the value of integrated land use planning for tightly regulating and controlling the growth of built-up regions. This will be essential for maintaining ecological sustainability and contributing to ecosystem resilience.

TI  - [Current status of lymph node dissection in pyloric-preserving gastrectomy for early gastric cancer].
T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - With the gradual increase in the diagnosis rate of early gastric cancer, clinicians must consider prevention of gastric anatomical structure and physiological function while ensuring the radical treatment of the tumor. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy is a function- preserving operation that preserves the pylorus, inferior pyloric vessel, and the vagus nerve in patients with early middle gastric cancer. One of the major controversies at present is the thoroughness of limited lymph node dissection for pyloric-preserving gastrectomy. Various studies have reported that the lymph node metastasis rate of early middle gastric cancer was low, especially in the suprapyloric region, inferior pylorus and the upper pancreatic region. Partial lymph node dissection is required for vascular and neurological protection, which is also safe and feasible in studies reported by major centers. Many clinical studies have been carried out in Japan and Korea, and postoperative follow-up has gradually increased evidence, providing the basis for the safety of lymph node dissection. In large case studies comparing pylorus- preserving gastrectomy with traditional distal gastrectomy, the incidence of postoperative morbidity, such as dumping syndrome, bile reflux esophagitis, weight loss, and malnutrition is low. Sentinel lymph node navigation technology is gradually applied to the diagnosis and treatment of early gastric cancer, and its clinical application value still needs further research.

TI  - Tracheoarterial fistula in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis successfully managed by overinflation of the tracheostomy tube cuff alone: a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTracheoarterial fistula is the most devastating complication after tracheostomy, and its mortality, without definitive treatment, approaches 100%. In general, the combination of bedside emergency management, that is, overinflation of the tracheostomy tube cuff, and definitive treatment such as surgical or endovascular intervention is necessary to prevent the poor outcome. Patients with neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are susceptible to tracheoarterial fistula because of long-term mechanical ventilation and muscle weakness.Case presentationWe describe a case of tracheoarterial fistula in a Japanese 39-year-old patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with long-term ventilator management. The patient was clinically diagnosed with a tracheoarterial fistula because of massive bleeding following sentinel hemorrhage. The massive hemorrhage was controlled by overinflation of the tracheostomy tube cuff alone, without definitive treatment.ConclusionsThis case suggests overinflation of the tracheostomy tube cuff alone plays an important role, semi-permanently, in the management of tracheoarterial fistula, especially in cases where surgical or endovascular intervention is not indicated. Clinicians taking care of patients with tracheostomy undergoing long-term mechanical ventilation should be aware that tracheoarterial fistula might occur following tracheostomy.

TI  - Local-scale monitoring of evapotranspiration based on downscaled GRACE observations and remotely sensed data: An application of terrestrial water balance approach
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET), as one of the most central parameters to the climate systems, plays a predominant role in the water, energy, carbon cycles, and energy-moisture exchanges between the earth and the atmosphere. Since the in-situ estimation of ET is challenging, the remote sensing-based techniques are deemed a reliable surrogate for the traditional ET estimation methods. The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission turned out to perform well in detecting the variations of ET over large basins. However, the subbasin-wise variations of ET based on the GRACE mission remain challenging due to its coarse resolution. In this study, the GRACE/GRACE-FO observations were downscaled based on Random Forest Machine Learning (RFML) algorithm and were integrated with fine-resolution precipitation and runoff data within the framework of the terrestrial water balance approach to derive small-scale variations of ET over Kizilirmak Basin (KB) in Turkiye. The results were compared to the fine-resolution ET products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite and Noah model and revealed acceptable precision of the methodology for the subbasin-wise application. The findings suggest that excluding the Lower Kizlirmak Basin (LKB), the water balance-based ET manifests a very high agreement with the MODIS- and Noah-derived ET over all the subbasins of the KB. The impacts of the main ET driving parameters such as temperature, water availability, solar radiation, surface albedo, and vegetation status were further investigated in terms of linear correlations. It is found that there is a high association between the monthly variations of ET and its conditioning factors over the KB, especially between the water availability and ET.

TI  - Cloud detection methods for remote sensing images:a survey
T2  - CHINESE SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud cover in the optical remote sensing images will obscure the ground information in different degrees,which causes the blurring and missing of the surface observation information and greatly affects the imaging quality of remote sensing images.Therefore,the detection and evaluation of cloud cover in remote sensing images are the basis and key to further analyze and utilize remote sensing image information.Through sufficient investigation and summary,the development trend and representative work of cloud detection methods based on remote sensing images at home and abroad since the 1990s were combed.Cloud detection methods based on remote sensing images were divided into three categories:methods based on band threshold,methods based on classical machine learning and methods based on deep learning.Besides,the public datasets at home and abroad used in the related research on cloud detection were summarized,and the accuracy of some representative cloud detection methods was compared.In addition to the vanilla cloud detection method,the cloud/fog(haze)detection,cloud/snow detection,cloud shadow detection and cloud removal methods related to cloud detection were also briefly combed.Based on the review and summary of cloud detection work above,the existing problems and future development trends of cloud detection were analyzed and prospected

TI  - Convolutional neural network for high-resolution wetland mapping with open data: Variable selection and the challenges of a generalizable model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape scale wetland conservation requires accurate, up-to-date wetland maps. The most useful approaches to cre-ating such maps are automated, spatially generalizable, temporally repeatable, and can be applied at large spatial scales. However, mapping wetlands with predictive models is challenging due to the highly variable characteristics of wetlands in both space and time. Currently, most approaches are limited by coarse resolution, commercial data, and geographic specificity. Here, we trained a deep learning model and evaluated its ability to automatically map wet-lands at landscape scale in a variety of geographies. We trained a U-Net architecture to map wetlands at 1-meter spatial resolution with the following remotely sensed covariates: multispectral data from the National Agriculture Imagery Program and the Sentinel-2 satellite system, and two LiDAR-derived datasets, intensity and geomorphons. The full model mapped wetlands accurately (94 % accuracy, 96.5 % precision, 95.2 % AUC) at 1-meter resolution. Post hoc model evaluation showed that the model correctly predicted wetlands even in areas that had incorrect label/train-ing data, which penalized the recall rate (90.2 %). Applying the model in a new geography resulted in poor perfor-mance (precision = similar to 80 %, recall = 48 %). However, limited retraining in this geography improved model performance substantially, demonstrating an effective means to create a spatially generalizable model. We demon-strate wetlands can be mapped at high-resolution (1 m) using free data and efficient deep-learning models that do not require manual feature engineering. Including LiDAR and geomorphons as input data improved model accuracy by 2 %, and where these data are unavailable a simpler model can efficiently map wetlands. Given the dynamic nature of wetlands and the important ecosystem services they provide, high-resolution mapping can be a game changer in terms of informing restoration and development decisions.

TI  - Marine heat waves: Characterizing a major climate impact in the Mediterranean
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine heat waves (MHW), considered as persistent and spatially extensive sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, have emerged as one of the global change-induced high impact events on the oceans. The study of MHWs received significant progress in recent years, although many unknowns remain. One of the most notable weaknesses is related to the absence of a universally established definition that would allow better intercomparison of results. It is our aim to contribute to this debate by considering the spatial extent to define a MHW. By applying this hypothesis to a relatively small, but complex, basin such as the Mediterranean, MHWs have been characterized and long-term trends assessed from SST satellite data analysis. Our results show that the inclusion of a minimum area threshold, 5 % of the area basin, greatly reduces the population of MHW events by not considering local SST anomalies that do not constitute a MHW event. A trend to more frequent, intense, and longer MHWs is found in the 1982-2021 period in the Mediterranean. In the spatial characterization and long-term trend analysis, regional differences were apparent. Results evidenced variations in MHWs characteristics and trends across the different sub-basins evidencing the fact that, even in a relatively small basin such as the Mediterranean, significant regional differences make it necessary to include a spatial perspective in the studies, beyond purely local analysis at each observation point in a large basin or even in the global ocean. Regarding the characterization of MHWs and trend analysis in the Mediterranean basin, a growing trend has been found in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity that accelerated since 2000 and especially in the last decade, pointing not just to a steady intensification and higher frequency of MHWs but to the emergence of a new set of more intense, long-lasting and spatially extensive MHWs in the recent years.

TI  - Factors associated with deforestation probability in Central Vietnam: a case study in Nam Dong and A Luoi districts
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Vietnam is undergoing a forest transition stage with an overall increase in forest cover since the 1990s; however, deforestation and forest degradation of natural forests still occur in several areas, especially in the Central region of the country. In order to better manage and protect natural forests, predicting deforestation probability and understanding its associated factors are necessary. In the present study, we focused on the two mountainous districts (Nam Dong and A Luoi) in Central Vietnam as a case study. We used Landsat satellite images for identifying changes of natural forests over the period of 1989-2020. The logistic regression model showed a good performance in prediction of deforestation (testing AUC = 0.874) in the study area. Our data showed that deforestation probability of natural forests in the study area in the period of 1989-2020 could be influenced by 11 socio-economic and topographical factors. In particular, forest areas with low elevation, gentle slopes, nearby rivers and residential areas have a high deforestation probability. Production forest, forest areas not included in payment for environmental service (PFES) schemes, forest with no ownership and forest areas managed by private owners may also have a high deforestation probability. The total area of very high level of deforestation probability in A Luoi (8,988 ha) and Nam Dong (5,304 ha) districts occupied about 11.4% of natural forests in the study area. Our study suggests that protection activities should be focused on high deforestation probability-prone forest areas.

TI  - Individual and combined impacts of urbanization and climate change on catchment runoff in Southeast Queensland, Australia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the impacts of climate change and land-use change is of critical importance, particularly for urbanized catch-ments. In this study, a novel framework was used to examine and quantify these impacts on the runoff in six catch-ments in Southeast Queensland, Australia. For each catchment, temporal variations in impervious areas were derived from six satellite images using a sub-pixel classification technique and incorporated into the SIMHYD hydro-logical model. This model was satisfactorily calibrated and validated with daily runoff observations (0.63 <= Nash- Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient <= 0.94, percent bias <= +/- 18 %) and was used to produce baseline runoff for 1986-2005 in these six catchments. The projected population increase was used to predict future imperviousness based on the linear relationship between the two. The projected rainfall and evapotranspiration were derived from the ensemble means of the eight general circulation models. Catchment runoff was projected under two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and 8.5), three urbanization scenarios (low, medium, and high), and six combined scenarios for two future periods (2026-2045 and 2046-2065). Comparing with the baseline, it was found that (1) climate change alone would lead to a -3.8 % to -17.6 % reduction in runoff among the six catchments, for all scenarios and both future periods; (2) a 11.8 % to 78 % increase in runoff was projected under the three urbanization scenarios, and (3) a de-crease in runoff due to climate change would moderate the increase in runoff caused by urbanization. For example, the combined effect would be a 54 % increase in runoff, with a -17.2 % decrease due to climate change and 78 % increase due to urbanization. Overall, runoff in the six catchments may be significantly affected by urban expansion. From this study, decision makers could gain a better understanding of the relative importance of the effects of climate and land-use change, which can be applied when developing future long-term water management plans at the catch-ment scale.

AB  - Background Although sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) status is a strong prognostic indicator for cutaneous melanoma, unnecessary SLNBs have substantial cost and morbidity burden. Objective This study was designed to develop, validate, and present a personalized, clinical, decision-making tool using nationally representative data with clinically actionable probability thresholds (Expected Lymphatic Metastasis Outcome [ELMO]). Methods Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry from 2000 to 2017 and the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004 to 2015 were used to develop and internally validate a logistic ridge regression predictive model for SLNB positivity. External validation was done with 1568 patients at a large tertiary referral center. Results The development cohort included 134,809 patients, and the internal validation cohort included 38,518 patients. ELMO (AUC 0.85) resulted in a 29.54% SLNB reduction rate and greater sensitivity in predicting SLNB status for T1b, T2a, and T2b tumors than previous models. In external validation, ELMO had an accuracy of 0.7586 and AUC of 0.7218. Limitations of this study are potential miscoding, unaccounted confounders, and effect modification. Conclusions ELMO () has been developed and validated (internally and externally) by using the largest publicly available dataset of melanoma patients and was found to have high accuracy compared with other published models and gene expression tests. Individualized risk estimates for SLNB positivity are critical in facilitating thorough decision-making for healthcare providers and patients with melanoma.

TI  - A high-precision aerosol retrieval algorithm for FY-3D MERSI-II images
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) onboard the recently launched Chinese Fengyun-3D (FY -3D) satellite has great capability in detecting global aerosols as it includes aerosol bands similar to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, to date, aerosol retrieval based on MERSI-II is still limited to dark target regions and there is no official aerosol products for the MERSI-II. This study focuses on developing a high-precision algorithm to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) suitable for entire land areas (except snow/ice and inland waters) based on MERSI-II measurements. Considering both the accuracy and retrieval efficiency, a new cost function is constructed based on (1) the fact that the AOD (550 nm) retrieved independently from different bands should be the same with the correct aerosol model, and (2) the assumption that the aerosol types are the same in the 5 x 5 km spatial range. The retrieval method based on the new cost function is nearly 50 times faster than most current methods using iterative calculations. To extend the appli-cation adaption of the FY-3D MERSI-II AOD retrieval and avoid the errors caused by the surface Lambertian hypothesis, a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) database is built using MODIS products. Eight candidate aerosol models in different natural zones of China are constructed based on AERONET aerosol products from 2010 -2021. The new method is applied to MERSI-II images over China and validated against ground-based measurements at 14 stations from 2020 to 2021. MODIS aerosol products from three operational algorithms are also used for comparison purposes. The results show that MERSI-II AOD retrievals agree well with the ground-based measurements with correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative mean bias (RMB) of 0.913, 0.123, and 0.955, respectively. In addition, 72.19 % of AOD matchups fall within the expected error (EE) envelopes. The MERSI-II retrievals show higher accuracy than that of MODIS dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) products and comparable accuracy of the MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of At-mospheric Correction (MAIAC) product. MERSI-II AOD also shows higher stability in terms of spatial and tem-poral and better performance under heavy aerosol loading conditions than MODIS products. A good AOD agreement with R from 0.777 to 0.863 between MERSI-II and MODIS products is found over the land of China. The new method showing high retrieval efficiency and accuracy has great potential to be operationally applied on AOD retrieval for MERSI-II.

AB  - Intense human activity and severe climate change in China have imposed significant burdens on ecoenvironmental quality (EEQ) and caused great challenge to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. However, the response mechanism of China's EEQ to natural factors and human activities in recent decades has remained unclear. Here, we combined multi-source remote sensing data, reanalysis data and model data, based on the Theil-Sen Median, TSS-RESTREND and Hurst index, to reveal the characteristics of past and future EEQ changes in China and to explore the driving factors of its changes from the perspective of natural factors and human activities. Over the last 18 years, the EEQ of more than 60% of the area has increased. Using TSSRESTREND analysis, we found that human activities and natural factors jointly dominanted about 58% of the EEQ in China. Natural factors simultaneously dominated the EEQ changes in more than 80% of the area, with climate water deficit being the most important. Three human activities of the population, gross domestic product, and electricity consumption have increased significantly in the past 18 years, simultaneously dominating the EEQ change in about 18% of the areas in China. Accordingly, in the context of global climate change, rational exploitation of human activities is essential to China's EEQ. Accordingly, a comparative analysis of the drivers of EEQ in China provides a scientific basis for understanding and optimising management policies.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of margin-controlled excision for eyelid melanoma
T2  - EYE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo provide evidence for long-term outcomes for margin-controlled excision of eyelid melanoma.MethodsRetrospective single-centre observational case series of patients treated for eyelid melanoma between 2007 and 2016, with a minimum of 5-year follow-up. Tumour excision involved rush-paraffin en face horizontal sections and delayed repair (Slow Mohs; SM).ResultsTwenty-two cases were seen with a survival of 91% (two deaths from nodular and lentigo maligna melanoma) and seven with melanoma in situ (MIS). Invasive melanoma includes eight lentigo maligna melanoma, four nodular, two amelanotic and one desmoplastic. Mean Breslow thickness was 6 mm for invasive (range 0.5-26). Mean excision margin for MIS was 3 mm (range 2-5 mm) and for invasive was 5 mm (range 2-10). Further excisions were performed in nine (41%); two went on to recur. Local recurrence was 36%; six invasive (27%) at a mean of 24 months (range 1.5-5 years) and two for MIS at a mean of 15 months (range 1-1.5 years). Imaging occurred for suspected advanced disease. Sentinel node biopsy was not performed. Advanced melanoma therapy was performed in two cases. No vitamin D testing occurred.ConclusionsSurvival rates are in line with 90% overall survival in the UK. Prescriptive excision margins are not applicable in the periocular region and margin-controlled excision with a delayed repair is recommended, but patients need to know further excision may be needed to obtain clearance. Evidence recommending vitamin D therapy needs to be put into clinical practice. In addition, upstaging of MIS occurred advocating excision rather than observation of MIS. More studies are needed to determine the best management of eyelid melanoma.

TI  - The ground deformation of the south-eastern flank of Mount Etna monitored by GNSS and SAR interferometry from 2016 to 2019
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The south-eastern sector of the Mount Etna, Italy, is characterized by numerous active faults, in particular the Belpasso-Ognina lineament, the Tremestieri-San Gregorio-Acitrezza fault, the Trecastagni fault and the Fiandaca-Nizzeti fault including the Timpe Fault System. Their activity is the result of both volcanism and tectonics. Here, we analyse the ground deformation occurred from 2016 to 2019 across those active faults by using the GNSS data acquired at 22 permanent stations and 35 campaign points observed by the Etna Observatory (INGV) and by the University of Catania. We also use the time-series of line of sight displacement of permanent scatterers SENTINEL-1 A-DInSAR obtained by using the P-SBAS tool of the ESA GEP-TEP (Geohazards Thematic Exploitation Platform) service. We discriminate the contributions of the regional tectonic strain, the inflations, the deflations of the volcano and the gravitational sliding in order to analyse the deformation along the faults of the south-eastern flank of Etna. The shallow and destructive M-w = 4.9 earthquake of 2018 December 26 occurred within the studied area two days after a dyke intrusion, that propagated beneath the centre of the volcano accompanied by a short eruption. Both GNSS and InSAR time-series document well those events and allow to investigate the post-seismic sliding across the faults of south-eastern flank. We analyse the slow slip events (SSE) that are observed in the GNSS and InSAR time-series in the vicinity of the Acitrezza fault. We quantify and discuss the tectonic origin of the Belpasso-Ognina lineament that we interpreted as a tear fault.

TI  - Monitoring soil-plant interactions and maize yield by satellite vegetation indexes, soil electrical conductivity and management zones
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In modern agriculture, understanding the spatio-temporal variability in crop fields and the implications of environmental factors in soil management are important for sustainable practices. In this case, the management zones (MZ) can aid agricultural practices by indicating locations in a crop field where the production might be restricted and requires a specific management. Currently, there are many datasets and methodological strategies for designing MZs, and the outcomes from these methods are quite different. Therefore, this research aims to compare the performance of different remote/proximal sensing inputs to retrieve data from soil and plants, define their relationship with corn yield, and the potential of these datasets to design MZs. The study was conducted at a corn field located in Paraguay. The datasets used in our methodology corresponded to (I) electrical conductivity, (II) soil data from conventional laboratory analysis and (III) spectral information (optical and thermal) derived from Landsat 8 images. MZs were generated from each one of the datasets and later they were compared to yield maps. In this case, zoning performances were evaluated by the similarity between MZs and yield maps. The best results were achieved with the spectral vegetation indices from Landsat 8. Correlations between vegetation indexes and yield reached a maximum value of 0.75 for NBR2 index, but EVI, SAVI and NDVI also presented good results (r > 0.7). Furthermore, vegetation indexes of corn at V8 phenological stage provided the best agreement between MZs and yield. Finally, the MZs derived from spectral data could define yield-limiting zones inside the crop field.

TI  - Weather model based atmospheric corrections of Sentinel-1 InSAR deformation data at Turkish volcanoes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main constraints on the use of satellite radar data for monitoring natural hazards is the existence of atmospheric signals. In particular, volcanic deformation can be difficult to identify because atmospheric phase delays can mask or even mimic ground deformation signals. Eliminating atmospheric signals is particularly crucial for high-relief volcanoes such as Agri, Tendurek, Acigol, Golludag and Hasandag in the Eastern and Central Anatolia. To overcome the atmospheric effects, we use high-resolution ECMWF weather models coupled with an empirical phase-elevation approach for correcting Sentinel-1 interferograms. We apply these methods to two areas of Turkey, the first of which covers three volcanoes in Central Anatolia (Acigol, Golludag, Hasandag) between January 2016 and December 2018 and the second covers two volcanoes in Eastern Anatolia (Agri, Tendurek) between September 2016 and December 2018. The reduction in standard deviation (quality factor) is calculated for both ascending and descending tracks and the atmospheric corrections are found to perform better on descending interferograms in both cases. Then, we use a least-squares approach to produce a time-series. For Central Anatolia, we used 416 ascending and 415 descending interferograms to create 144 and 145 cumulative displacement maps, respectively, and for Eastern Anatolia, we used 390 ascending and 380 descending interferograms to produce 137 and 130 cumulative displacement maps, respectively. We find that the temporal standard deviation before atmospheric corrections ranges between 0.9 and 3.7 cm for the five volcanoes in the region and is consistently higher on ascending track data, which is acquired at the end of the day when solar heating is greatest. Atmospheric correction reduces the standard deviation to 0.5-2.5 cm. Residual signals might be due to the ice-cap at Agri and agriculture near Acigol. We conclude that these volcanoes did not experience significant magmatic deformation during this time period, despite the apparent signals visible in individual uncorrected interferograms. We demonstrate that atmospheric corrections are vital when using InSAR for monitoring the deformation of high-relief volcanoes in arid continental climates such as Turkey.

TI  - Multispectral UAV data for detection of weeds in a citrus farm using machine learning and Google Earth Engine: Case study of Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely weed mapping between and within trees is considered one of the major chal-lenges in the site-specific weed management systems. This research presents the first cloud com-puting approach based on the incorporation of multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) im-agery in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) programming environment with the aim of improving the mapping of weed patches between and within trees in a citrus farm. For this purpose, the UAV multispectral bands (red, green, blue, near infrared, and red edge), as well as the estimated vege-tation height from the UAV Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were analysed in terms of tree and weed discrimination and used as input into Random Forest (RF) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithms. From the DEM, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was estimated us-ing the Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation (IDW) of the elevation values of dense points on the soil. The plant height was derived by subtracting the DTM from the DEM, resulting in the Canopy Height Model (CHM). The experimental results show that: (i) the combination of spectral bands and the CHM can classify both trees and weeds with an overall accuracy reached 96.87%; (ii) the RF classifier was more robust compared to KNN in the classification performance; (iii) when compared to the use of UAV spectral bands, the addition of the CHM can improve the accu-racy of crop classification by 13.36% (KNN) and 1.79% (RF). Furthermore, the integration of UAV imagery in the GEE was highly efficient in terms of automation of the UAV imagery process-ing.

TI  - Melanomas in children and adolescents: Clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Melanomas in the first 2 decades of life are uncommon and poorly understood.Objective: To assess clinicopathologic features and survival of children (#11 years) and adolescents (12-19 years) diagnosed with melanoma.Methods: A pooled cohort of 514 patients was analyzed (397 Dutch, 117 Australian; 62 children, 452 adolescents). Pathology reports were reevaluated to determine melanoma subtypes. Multivariable Cox models were generated for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).Results: Melanoma subtypes were conventional melanoma (superficial spreading, nodular, desmoplastic, and acral lentiginous), spitzoid melanoma, and melanoma associated with a congenital nevus in 428, 78, and 8 patients, respectively. Ten-year RFS was 91.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82.4%-100%) in children and 86.4% (95% CI, 82.7%-90.3%) in adolescents (P = .32). Ten-year OS was 100% in children and 92.7% (95% CI, 89.8%-95.8%) in adolescents (P = .09). On multivariable analysis possible only for the adolescent cohort due to the small number of children, ulceration status, and anatomic site were associated with RFS and OS, whereas age, sex, mitotic index, sentinel node status and melanoma subtype were not. Breslow thickness [4 mm was associated with worse RFS.Limitations: Retrospective study.

TI  - Women attending antenatal care as a sentinel surveillance population for malaria in Geita region, Tanzania: feasibility and acceptability to women and providers
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMeasurement of malaria prevalence is conventionally estimated through infrequent cross-sectional household surveys that do not provide continuous information regarding malaria parasitaemia. Recent studies have suggested that malaria parasitaemia prevalence among women attending antenatal care (ANC) correlates with prevalence among children under 5 years old and that pregnant women could be a sentinel population for tracking malaria prevalence. In mainland Tanzania, 97% of women are tested for malaria parasitaemia during first ANC visits. However, acceptability among pregnant women and healthcare providers of collecting malaria risk factor data during ANC visits is limited.MethodsA tablet-based questionnaire including 15 questions on insecticide-treated net ownership and use and care-seeking for febrile children was introduced at 40 healthcare facilities in Geita Region, Tanzania. Facilities were randomly selected from among those with 15-120 first ANC visits per month. To assess perspectives regarding introduction of the questionnaire, 21 semi-structured interviews were held with providers and facility in-charges at 12 facilities. Thirty pregnant and recently delivered women participated in focus group discussions at seven facilities to assess the acceptability of spending additional time answering questions about malaria risk.ResultsAll pregnant women reported that introduction of ANC surveillance and spending 10 more minutes with providers answering questions about their health would be neutral or beneficial. They perceived being asked about their health as standard of care. Providers and in-charges reported that introduction of ANC surveillance was within their scope of practice. Nine of 21 indicated it could potentially benefit women's health. Six providers expressed concern about staffing shortages and need for reimbursement for extra time and noted that data management occurs after hours.ConclusionsPregnant women and providers generally perceived ANC surveillance for malaria as acceptable and positive. Pregnant and recently delivered women saw this as a reasonable and even helpful intervention. To be seen as a part of standard practice, efforts are needed to ensure providers perceive a benefit for ANC clients and that staffing concerns are addressed. In addition, staff should receive feedback related to data submissions regarding malaria prevalence and risk factors among women at their facility, with actions to take.

TI  - From regional to parcel scale: A high-resolution map of cover crops across Europe combining satellite data with statistical surveys
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The reformed Common Agricultural Policy of 2023-2027 aims to promote a more sustainable and fair agricultural sys-tem in the European Union. Among the proposed measures, the incentivized adoption of cover crops to cover the soil during winter provides numerous benefits such as improved soil structure and reduced nutrient leaching and erosion. Despite this recognized importance, the availability of spatial data on cover crops is scarce. The increasing availability of field parcel declarations in the European Union has not yet filled this data gap due to its insufficient information content, limited public availability and a lack of standardization at continental scale. At present, the best information available is regionally aggregated survey data, which although indicative, hinders the development of spatially accu-rate studies. In this work, we propose a statistical model relating Sentinel-1 data to the existence of cover crops at the 100-m spatial resolution over the entirety of the European Union and United Kingdom and estimate its parameters using the spatially aggregated survey data. To validate the method in a spatially-explicit way, predictions were com-pared against farmers' registered declarations in France, where the adoption of cover crops is widespread. The results indicate a good agreement between predictions and parcel-level data. When interpreted as a binary classifier, the model yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.74 for the whole country. When the country was divided into five regions for the evaluation of regional biases, the AUC values were 0.77, 0.75, 0.74, 0.70, and 0.65 for the North, Center, West, East, and South regions respectively. Despite limitations such as the lack of data for validation outside France, and the non-standardized nomenclature for cover crops among Member States, this work constitutes the first effort to obtain a relevant cover crop map at a European scale for researchers and practitioners.

TI  - Estimating the Wind Dependency of Aerosol Optical Depth at Remote Oceanic Regions
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the applicability of India's indigenously developed scatterometer, Scatsat-1 for marine aerosol characterization and wind dependency of aerosol optical depth (AOD) was investigated using 3 years of satellite data. Wind data from Scatsat-1 and AOD with its size fraction from SNPP VIIRS from 2017 to 2019 were used for the investigation. A technique has been demonstrated for identifying remote oceanic regions with mostly marine aerosol using certain criteria like distance from land, higher fraction of coarse AOD, lower variation of AOD with wind direction, and so forth. Daily wind and AOD from 2017 to 2019 were used for studying the relationship between wind speed and AOD at remote oceanic locations away from terrestrial and anthropogenic influence. Five regions of interest (ROIs) of 5(?)degrees by 5(?)degrees were identified in different oceanic regions for carrying out the regression analysis. A linear increase of coarse mode AOD and total AOD with an increase in wind speed was observed for all five remote locations while fine mode AOD was unrelated. The slope of the linear relation agreed with Kiliyanpilakkil and Meskhidze (2011) for intermediate wind values. The remote regions also had a lower variation of AOD with change in wind direction implying less transport of aerosol from nearby landmasses.

TI  - Coastal landscape classification using convolutional neural network and remote sensing data in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The length of global coastline is about 356 thousand kilometers with various dynamic natural and anthropogenic. Although the number of studies on coastal landscape categorization has been increasing, it is still difficult to distinguish precisely them because the used methods commonly are traditional qualitative ones. With the leverage of remote sensing data and GIS tools, it helps categorize and identify a variety of features on land and water based on multi-source data. The aim of study is using different natural - social profile data obtained from ALOS, NOAA, and multi-temporal Landsat satellite images as input data of the convolutional-neural-network (CvNet) models for coastal landscape classification. Studies used 900 cut-line samples which represent coastal landscapes in Vietnam for training and optimizing CvNet models. As a result, nine coastal landscapes were identified including: deltas, alluvial, mature and young sand dunes, cliff, lagoon, tectonic, karst, and transitional landscapes. Three CvNet models using three different optimizer types classified the landscapes of other 1150 cutlines in Vietnam with the accuracies about 98% and low loss function value. Excepting dalmatian, karst and delta coastal landscapes, five others distribute heterogeneous along the coasts in Vietnam. Therefore, the evaluation of additional natural components is necessary and CvNet model have ability to update new landscape types in variety of tropical nation as a step toward coastal landscape classification at both national and global scales.

TI  - Engagement on risk assessment for gene drive mosquitoes by EFSA and Target Malaria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - As engineered gene drive technologies continue to advance, many actors are actively considering how envi-ronmental risk assessments (RAs) for gene drive organisms should be conducted, and how stakeholder engagement opportunities should be provided. There is, however, a lack of clarity concerning what constitutes engagement on gene drive RA and, furthermore, what forms of engagement already exist around gene drive RA. To address this gap, we reflect on the actions of a risk assessor (the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA) and a gene drive developer (Target Malaria) to understand: 1) the RA-related decisions that each are making con-cerning gene drive technology for mosquitoes and other harmful insects, 2) the existing role of engagement in those decisions, and 3) the implications for our understandings of engagement and RA. We found, first, that both EFSA and Target Malaria have already made many RA-related decisions, even though any preparation and evaluation of a formal RA for gene drive mosquitoes remains far off. This finding supports the idea that gene drive RA involves multiple processes and decisions in different forms across the entire technology and regulatory development process. Second, we found that both EFSA and Target Malaria have already integrated engagement into their respective RA-related decisions in different ways, reflecting their different roles. We conclude by considering how EFSA and Target Malaria could improve their existing RA-related engagement by explicitly considering disciplinary diversity and worldview diversity in their related decision making.

TI  - Estimation of soil salt content in the Bosten Lake watershed, Northwest China based on a support vector machine model and optimal spectral indices
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-cost and efficient dynamic monitoring of surface salinization information is critical in arid and semi-arid regions, we conducted a remote sensing inversion exercise for soil salinity in the Bosten Lake watershed in Xinjiang, Northwest China, with a total area of about 43,930 km(2), a typical watershed in an arid area. Sentinel MSI and Landsat OLI data were combined with measured soil salinity data in July 2020, and optimal combination bands were selected based on characteristic bands to create a grid search-support vector machine (GS-SVM) inversion model of soil salt content. The maximum value of soil salt content in the Bosten Lake watershed was 11.8 g/kg. The minimum value was 0.41 g/kg, and the average value was 4.77 g/kg, soil salinization is serious. The results of previous studies were applied to the estimation of salt content in Bosten Lake watershed and could not meet the monitoring requirements of the study area, R-2 < 0.3. The GS-SVM soil salinity monitoring model was established based on the optimal DI, RI, and NDI remote sensing indexes for the Bosten Lake watershed. After model verification, it was found that the optimal model of image data was the Landsat OLI first-derivative model with R-2 of 0.64, RMSE of 3.12, and RPD of 1.64, indicating that the prediction ability of the model was high. We used the first-order derivative model of Landsat OLI data to map the soil salt content in the Bosten Lake watershed in arid area, and found that soil salt content in most of the study area was between 10 and 20 g/kg, indicating severe salinization. This study not only reveals the distribution characteristics of salinization in Bosten Lake watershed, but also provides a scientific basis for soil salinization monitoring in Central Asia to lay a foundation for further soil salinization monitoring in arid areas.

TI  - Linking random forest and auxiliary factors for extracting the major economic forests in the mountainous areas of southwestern Yunnan Province, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are generally extracted from remotely sensed images based on the spectral features, ignoring other important auxiliary information, and the techniques of precise extraction need to be further improved. By using the Sentinel-2 image and auxiliary factors (AFs) including site conditions (SCs) and vegetation indices (VIs), the random forest model with AFs (RF-AFs) was adopted for the extraction of the economic forests in Lancang County, which is a mountainous area with rich biodiversity and is witnessing rapid development of economic forests in Yunnan province of China. The results obtained using the RF-AFs model were compared with those obtained using the random forest model without AFs (RF). The results were as follows: (1) The kappa coefficient for extracting the first-level land use obtained using the RF model was 0.9531. Lancang County is dominated by forests, accounting for 73.76% of the total area. (2) After parameter optimization, the RF-AFs model yielded the highest accuracy in the extraction of the second-level forests, with a kappa coefficient value of 0.9493, which was 14.69% higher than that of the RF model. Thus, the RF-AFs model is more suitable for the precise extraction of economic forests. (3) The evaluation results of the factors' importance of the RF-AFs model showed that the cumulative importance values of SCs such as temperature (TEM), elevation (EL), precipitation (PRE) and VIs such as plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), transformed soil-adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI) was 76.09%, indicating that they were the main factors for the extraction of economic forests. (4) Economic forests are dominated by Simao pines in Lancang County, which are mainly distributed in the central, southwestern and northern regions, accounting for 31.37% of forests area. The proportion of tea plantations, eucalyptus, and rubber trees is 9.05%, 6.71%, and 3.05% of forests area, respectively. The RF-AFs model is conducive for precisely extracting the economic forests and is thus of great significance in studying the ecological and environmental effects of economic forests, performing forestry management, and maintaining regional ecological security.

TI  - Combining UAV and Sentinel-2 satellite multi-spectral images to diagnose crop growth and N status in winter wheat at the county scale
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time and non-destructive nitrogen (N) status diagnosis is needed to support in-season N management decision-making for modern wheat production. For this purpose, satellite sensor imaging can act as an effective tool for collecting crop growth information across large areas, but they can be challenging to calibrate with ground reference data. This research aimed to calibrate satellite remote sensing-derived models for crop growth estimation and N status diagnosis based on fine-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, thus, map wheat growth and N status at the county scale. Seven wheat field experiments involving multi cultivars and different N applications were conducted at four farms of Xinghua county from 2017 to 2021. A fixed-wing UAV sensing system and the Sentinel 2 (S2) satellite were used to collect wheat canopy multispectral images; three growth variables (plant dry matter (PDM), plant N accumulation (PNA) and N nutrition index (NNI)) and weather data, synchronized with spectral imagery, were obtained at the jointing and booting stages. The farm -scale PDM (UAV-PDM) and PNA (UAV-PNA) maps can be derived from the UAV images at the four farms, which were further upscaled to grids to match the S2 image resolution using pixel aggregation method. Then, satellite -based prediction models were constructed by fitting four machine learning algorithms to the relationships be-tween satellite spectral indices, upscaled PDM (PNA) and weather data. Amongst the four methods tested, the random forest (RF) achieved the greatest prediction accuracy for PDM (R2 = 0.69-0.93) and PNA (R2 = 0.60-0.77). Meanwhile, an indirect diagnosis method was used to calculate the NNI. The results indicated that the model derived from the S2 imagery performed well for predicting NNI (R2 = 0.46-0.54) at the jointing and booting stages. Thereby, the NNI was used to map winter wheat N nutrition status at the county scale. In summary, this research demonstrated and evaluated an approach to combine UAV and satellite sensor images to diagnose wheat growth and N status across large areas.

TI  - A statistical approach to site-specific thresholding for burn severity maps using bi-temporal Landsat-8 images
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Burn severity mapping facilitates post-fire management and restoration and predicts surface erosion and landslide risk. Different severity levels are usually distinguished by fixed threshold values with remote sensing techniques. Since the climate, ecosystem, geology, and morphology control the destruction level of forest fires, site-specific class thresholds should be considered to discriminate severity classes precisely. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to produce an accurate burn severity map using spectral indices with site-specific thresholds for unburned, low, moderate and high severity classes. In this context, pre- and post-fire Landsat 8 images were used to produce bi-temporal burn severity indices such as normalized burn ratio (NBR), normalized burned index (NBI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and green optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (GOSAVI). An alternative classification method based on a statistical distribution-based clustering approach was employed on the differential indices to determine severity class thresholds. The proposed thresholds were validated by the composite burn severity index (CBI) ratings of the field sampling points. The overall classification accuracy was found to be between 50% and 92.5%. In addition, the results were compared with the thresholds published in the literature. Consequently, this methodology can be used as adaptive thresholding in similar ecological and morphological zone to determine the burn severity classes.

TI  - Breaking out from a restricted range: Alternative habitat models to assess population perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat conservation for restricted-range species should also consider adjacent areas, but the analytical approaches for such assessments (particularly for a future perspective) are constrained by currently observed habitat relationships. We used two conceptually different habitat modelling approaches for analysing habitat distribution for the isolated Estonian population of a species of European conservation concern, the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans (Linnaeus, 1758)). We expected that the correlative (statistical) approaches based on current location data will increasingly deviate along with the distance from the current range, compared with a mechanistic approach based on limiting factors for the species. For conservation planning, we also investigated how the current protected area network covers quality habitats around the current range. We constructed three alternative correlative models (MaxEnt; Random forest; Generalized Boosted Regression) utilizing remotesensing (Sentinel-2; LiDAR) and forest inventory data for 1299 occurrences in the currently occupied ca. 1400 km2 range. A mechanistic model was constructed as a decision tree that distinguished 11 quality classes of forest land based on the ecological prioritization of limiting factors: site type; forest cover; abundance of key tree species; stand age; patch size; and layer structure. Supporting our expectation, an overall good accordance of habitat predictions of all the correlative models and the mechanistic model (at 30 x 30 m pixel size) declined with the distance from the current range. The MaxEnt model most closely followed the full range of habitat quality classes of the mechanistic model, while the other correlative models emphasized the highest habitatquality class. Within the current range, both MaxEnt and the mechanistic model similarly revealed habitat quality differences between occupied and unoccupied species protection areas. Delineation of habitat aggregations all over the country based on the mechanistic model revealed habitat loss both within and adjacent to the current range, which sets limits to local population recovery. For analysing wider options, we recommend complementing statistical spatial modelling of current conditions with ecologically sound mechanistic approaches. Based on our specific case, we outline how such model predictions can be assessed for management planning beyond current range.

TI  - Ten-Year Oncologic Outcomes in T1-3N1 Breast Cancer After Targeted Axillary Sampling: A Retrospective Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundTargeted axillary sampling (TAS) is a new surgical concept for the assessment of axillary lymph node status in breast cancer that is hypothesized to be more effective at minimizing postoperative morbidities than axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), provided the metastatic axillary lymph node can be accurately detected without missing data; however, the oncologic outcomes over long-term follow-up have not been sufficiently investigated. This was a retrospective analysis to evaluate the 10-year oncologic outcomes in T1-3N1 breast cancer after TAS.MethodsBetween 2008 and 2013, 230 female patients with cT1-3N1 breast cancer underwent breast and axillary surgery (ALND, n = 171; TAS, n = 59) at our institute. After TAS was applied, additional axillary radiotherapy was performed. Various postoperative complications, including postoperative seroma, lymphedema, and 10-year oncological outcomes, were evaluated and compared between the ALND and TAS groups.ResultsAlthough overall survival during the 10-year follow-up period was better in the TAS group, there was no statistically significant difference in oncologic outcomes, including locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, and overall survival (p = 0.395, 0.818, and 0.555, respectively). Furthermore, the incidence of lymphedema on the ipsilateral arm was significantly higher in the ALND group (p < 0.001).ConclusionsThe 10-year oncological outcomes of TAS were not inferior to those of conventional ALND in T1-3N1 breast cancers; however, the incidence of lymphedema was significantly higher in the ALND group.

TI  - Long-term three-dimensional distribution and transport of Saharan dust: Observation from CALIPSO, MODIS, and reanalysis data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert dust and sand storms from the Sahara can sometimes be transported thousands of kilometers, causing social and economic damages throughout their path, deteriorating the air quality, and affecting human health. The seasonal climatology and transport pathways of dust aerosols are, therefore, essential to a deeper understanding of the impact of dust on the affected region. This study investigated the three-dimensional climatology of dust aerosol distribution and its transportation characteristics over the Sahara, Mediterranean, and Europe using multiple satellites and reanalysis data. The results showed a strong spatial variation of dust aerosols, with the highest loading over the Sahara Desert and a gradual latitudinal decrease toward the north with the lowest dust load over Europe. Temporally, higher dust activities were observed during summer and spring in terms of dust occurrence frequency and contribution to the total aerosol loading. Dust aerosols significantly increased over Central Sahara and decreased over Central Europe. Saharan dust was efficiently transported toward Europe during summer and spring, mainly at higher altitudes of 2-6 km. It could reach as north as the latitude of similar to 42 degrees N in the transect of 5 degrees - 15 degrees E in the layer 2-4 km during summer, while in winter, the occurrence of dust was at lower altitudes (< 2 km) in some areas in Europe, north of 45 degrees N. The dust transport pathway toward Europe showed a long-standing dust layer mainly appearing over the Mediterranean from the near-surface up to 3 to 4 km during summer and spring, contributing to the meridional transport of dust. The dust layer characteristics and the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height above Europe showed the likelihood of dust intrusion into Europe's PBL during summer. This work also highlighted the main elements affecting dust distribution and transport toward Europe: wind, topography, and the PBL height.

TI  - Mapping the Poetics of Memory: A Critical Reading of Manoranjan Byapari's <i>Interrogating My Chandal Life</i> as Cultural Archive
T2  - CONTEMPORARY VOICE OF DALIT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The article analyses the idea of a text as a cultural archive by mapping the question of personal and collective or social memory with particular reference to the acclaimed Bengali Dalit writer Manoranjan Byapari's Interrogating My Chandal Life: An Autobiography of a Dalit. The memoir is a chronicler of the collective history of the marginal Namashudra community/ties of Bengal, their saga of pain and excruciating experiences of peripherality of existence that is perceived through the lens of the author. Located in the historical centre of the Dalit worldview, the autobiography investigates how the trajectories of collective histories, memories and shared identity of the Dalit community result in the emergence of what Derrida calls an 'archive' or a 'palimpsest.' Drawing on theories with regard to the role of cultural memory in the formation of a cultural archive, this article addresses questions as to how a text becomes a cultural archive and testimonies to history through the excavation and circulation of knowledge of the collective historical past.

TI  - On the determination and interpretation of the lithospheric induced magnetisation
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new technique for reducing the uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of lithospheric magnetic field observations over the Earth. This technique, without involving iterations, provides an improved estimate of the depth-integrated magnetic susceptibility of the crust as compared to previous approaches. Departing from the normal practice of using observations at specific locations, we model directly Gauss coefficients of the lithospheric magnetic field and use an a-priori initial lithospheric thickness model to circumvent magnetic annihilators (i.e. magnetisation distributions that cannot be determined from magnetic data since they have no impact on the lithospheric magnetic field). Of the several initial magnetic layer models tested, we prefer the model where magnetic thickness is based on the Moho or the regional estimate of the Curie depth when it is shallower than the Moho because it is physically reasonable and produces the fewest artefacts. The method is applied to a recent high-degree lithospheric magnetic field model called LCS-1 derived from CHAMP and Swarm magnetic satellite data. The technique is appropriate for regions where induced magnetisation dominates over remanent magnetisation. We show that high degrees of the final depth-integrated magnetic susceptibility variation are dependent only on the corresponding high degrees of the LCS-1 magnetic field model. Thus, the depth-integrated magnetic susceptibility variation is an important quantity derived in the study which enables readily qualitative interpretation of regional geology.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Integrating 2D hydrodynamic, SWAT, GIS and satellite remote sensing models in open channel design to control flooding within road service areas in the Odaw river basin of Accra, Ghana
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Infrastructure network security and resiliency have become major problems in recent years as a result of an increasing number of catastrophic weather-related occurrences around the world. Major catastrophic events in Accra within the Odaw river basin began in 1959, with the flood claiming the lives of roughly 154 Ghanaians and causing varying levels of burns and injuries. The Odaw river basin has a total catchment area estimated to be about 275 km(2) which drains the major urbanised areas of Accra including Ga East, Ga west, Accra metropolitan assembly and Adenta Municipal Assembly further upstream. These areas mostly get affected by flash floods. This study used integrated 2D hydrodynamic, SWAT, Geographic information system (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) models to estimate flood depth and the extent to map out inundated areas for effective open channel design to control flooding within the Odaw river basin. Landsat images were classified using a Random Forest algorithm to produce a LULC map for the SWAT model. SWAT model was used to delineate the basin with its channels, sub-basins, outlet points, flow length, area and runoff depth of the Odaw river basin using GIS. A 2D hydrodynamic model was used to estimate the flood depth (0-0.3 m, 0.3-5.0 m and > 5.0 m) and extent within the Odaw river basin using HER-RAS 6.0 software. Flood depth greater than 0.3 m was identified to be dangerous because it causes vehicles to float and submerge. George Bush Motorway, Kwame Nkrumah Motorway, Tetteh Quarshie Interchange, Obetsebi Lamptey Circle, Graphic Road, Black Meteors Lane, Ring Road Central, Afram Road, Guggisberg Avenue and Hall Street were identified road networks within this flood depth (> 0.3 m). Achimota, Asofan, Ashouman, Akokome, Adenkrebi, Kweman, Kokomlemle, Alajo and Tesano were also road service areas identified within this flood depth greater than 0.3 m. A 50-year peak flow of 447.801 m(3)/s which occurred in 2016 within the basin was obtained from field measurement by Edward in The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. This peak flow was used to propose an open channel design to control flooding within the basin using Manning's equation. The results of the study show that the integrated 2D hydrodynamic, SWAT, GIS and RS models have better performance in open channel design.

TI  - A novel change detection and threshold-based ensemble of scenarios pyramid for flood extent mapping using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood disasters destroy infrastructure, disrupt ecosystem processes, adversely affect social and economic activities and cause human fatalities. As such, flood extent mapping (FEM) is critical to mitigate these impacts. Specifically, FEM is essential to mitigate adverse impacts through early warning, efficient response during evacuation, search, rescue and recovery. Furthermore, accurate FEM is crucial for policy formulation, planning and management, rehabilitation, and promoting community resilience for sustainable occupation and use of floodplains. Recently, remote sensing has become valuable in flood studies. However, whereas free passive remote sensing images have been common input into predictive models, damage assessment and FEM, their utility is constrained by clouds during flooding events. Conversely, microwave-based data is unconstrained by clouds, hence is important for FEM. Hence, to increase the reliability and accuracy of FEM using Sentinel-1 radar data, we propose a three-step process that builds an ensemble of scenarios pyramid (ESP) based on change detection and thresholding technique. We deployed the ESP technique and tested it on a use-case based on two, five and 10 images. The usecase calculated three co-polarized Vertical-Vertical (VV) and three cross-polarized Vertical-Horizontal (VH) normalized difference flood index scenarios to form six binary classified FEMs at the base. We ensembled the base scenarios to three dual-polarized centre FEMs, and likewise the centre scenarios to a final pinnacle flood extent map. The base, centre and pinnacle scenarios were validated using six binary classification performance metrics. The results show that the ESP increased the base-to-pinnacle minimum classification performance metrics with overall accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, intersect over union, recall, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation coefficient of 93.204%, 0.864, 0.865, 0.870, 0.927, and 0.871 respectively. The study also established that the VV channels were superior in FEM than VH at the ESP base. Overall, this study demonstrates the efficacy of the ESP for operational flood disaster management.

TI  - Facial soft tissue thickness measurement method and relationship with BMI, age and sex
T2  - JOURNAL OF STOMATOLOGY ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Facial aesthetics results from the harmony of various components of the craniofacial region, a structure whose physiognomy and topography are determined by a set of hard and soft tissues. Few works in the literature have investigated the relationship between the variables of sex, age, BMI and soft tissue thickness and have considered how these variables may influence operative outcomes. The purpose of this study is to increase the pre-operative knowledge of the thickness of the soft tissues of the face through an analysis of their measurement conducted on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and to investigate the impact that the variables of gender, age and BMI have on their determination.Materials and methods: For this study 82 patients were recruited between January 2020 and January 2021 in the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Naples "Federico II". A descriptive analysis of the sample was carried out on the selected sample, calculating averages and standard deviations for the individ-ual variables analyzed.Results: BMI has a predominant role on some craniometric points while age and sex have a more marginal role. Our analysis shows that some points are affected by only one variable, BMI (G' N' PR' ID' SM' GN' PG' MIO' ACP' GO' ZY' SC' IC' ECMS' and MMB'); some points are affected by both BMI and gender (MP' and MR'); while only two (RHI' and MSO') are influenced by all the three variables.Conclusion: A priori knowledge through CBCT of the thickness of the soft tissues of the face and a comparison with the data we propose could provide the surgeon with advance notice of the characteristics of the tissues which she/he will encounter.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Snow cover mapping accuracy using remote sensing data is then particularly important. This study analyses Landsat-8 NDSI snow cover datasets over time and space using different NDSI-based approach. The objectives are (i) to investigate the relation snow-NDSI with different environmental variables, (ii) to evaluate the accuracy of the common NDSI threshold of 0.4 against in-situ snow depth measurement and (iii) to develop a method that optimises snow cover mapping accuracy and minimises snow cover detection errors of omission and commission. Landsat-8 snow cover datasets were compared to ground snow depth measurements of climate stations over Switzerland for the period 2014-2020. It was found that there is a consistent relationship between NDSI values and land cover type, elevation, seasons, and snow depth mea-surements. The global NDSI threshold of 0.4 may not be always optimal for the Swiss territory and tends to underestimate the snow cover extent. Best NDSI thresholds vary spatially and are generally lower than 0.4 for the three snow depth threshold tested. We therefore propose a new spatiotemporal NDSI method to maximize snow cover mapping accuracy by using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). This model uses three environ-mental variables (i.e., elevation, land cover type and seasons) and raw NDSI values and improves snow cover mapping accuracy by 24% compared to the fixed threshold of 0.4. By using this method omissions errors decrease considerably while keeping a very low value of commission errors. This method will then be integrated in the Snow Observation from Space (SOfS) algorithm used for snow detection in Switzerland.

TI  - Maori experiences of social housing in Otautahi Christchurch
T2  - KOTUITUI-NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents selected findings of a twelve-month-long research project exploring the lived experiences of Maori social housing tenants residing in Otautahi Christchurch. Over the last five years, Aotearoa New Zealand has seen unprecedented social housing demand. There is currently an overrepresentation of Maori experiencing housing need and awaiting placement into social housing, yet studies on this topic are limited. This research narrates the lived experience of Maori social housing tenants. It recounts experiences of social housing placement and explores the interactions tenants have with each other and their surrounding environment to create and maintain a sense of community within their housing placements. This article presents a complex understanding of Maori tenant experience centred on people finding a place to belong. Through utilising a Kaupapa Maori research framework and using semi-structured interviews, this qualitative research describes the process of creating a home as moving beyond the individual house. It highlights how the experience of 'home' for Maori tenants is governed by where you live and with whom you live with. Ultimately, the results presented emphasise the relevance of incorporating a Maori worldview into social housing provision to create environments that support Maori wellbeing.

TI  - Identifying the spatio-temporal dynamics of regional ecological risk based on Google Earth Engine: A case study from Loess Plateau, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin, the Loess Plateau is one of the typical eco-fragile regions in China, which has complex and diverse ecological problems and is in urgent need of comprehensive ecological governance and restoration. Ecological risk assessment as a method to quantify complex ecological risks can provide decision-makers with quantification and visualization of risk scenarios, which can serve the ecological protection and restoration of the Loess Plateau. Pre-processed and acquired through GEE, the multi-source and long-term remote sensing data are introduced to facilitate the efficiency of risk monitoring. There are few studies about GEE-based spatio-temporal ecological risk monitoring in the Loess Plateau. Therefore, a regional ecological risk assessment system from the perspective of risk sources, risk receptors, and exposure responses has been established to visualize and quantify the spatial heterogeneity of regional multi-perspective ecological problems at a 1 km-grid scale from 2001 to 2020. Meanwhile, multi-aspects spatial statistics and trend analysis are taken to identify the spatial and temporal characteristics. The results demonstrated that the comprehensive ecological risk of the Loess Plateau presented a decreasing trend from 2001 to 2020, which is mainly due to the improvement of vegetation conditions. Spatially, the low-risk pixels are primarily in the east and west, while the high-risk pixels mainly locate in the north central and northwest. From 2001 to 2020, the high-risk pixels in the central region decrease, and the high-risk pixels are concentrated in the northwest. In general, the ecological risks is significantly spatially heterogeneous, varying according to latitude and longitude, land cover, topography. Identifying grid-based dominant risks and trends provides decision-makers with accurate risk control and helps propose appropriate countermeasures.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of land use/cover and land surface temperature in Prayagraj city, India
T2  - INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial monitoring of variation in land cover and its mapping support the local authorities and decision-makers in strengthening comprehensive and sustainable plans for future urbanization and sustainability of the city. This research work was carried out to evaluate the change in the land cover pattern and its impact on the land surface temperature of Prayagraj city from 2000 to 2020. This study also examined the correlation between land surface temperature (LST) and other improved urban biophysical indices, such as soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and enhanced built-up and bareness index (EBBI), to determine the significant factors affecting the LST of the urban area. The result indicates that the built-up area and cropland have been escalated by 10 and 6.5%, whereas tree cover, water bodies and fallow land were reduced by 12, 1.38 and 1.27%, respectively. LST was increased by 1.47 degrees C between 2000 and 2020 due to an increase in the built-up area. LST showed a positive correlation with EBBI but a negative one with vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index and SAVI) and water indices (MNDWI). The results indicate that the land use pattern governs LST and any change in land use will ultimately change the LST.

TI  - Cognitive behavioral stress management affects different dimensions of benefit finding in breast cancer survivors: a multilevel mediation model
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective. This study aimed to confirm the multidimensionality of benefit finding (BF), or silver linings within the cancer experience, assess the effects of Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) on those dimensions, and test the mediating role of perceived stress management skills targeted by CBSM.Methods. This secondary analysis used data from 240 women with stage 0-III breast cancer who completed measures of BF (Benefit Finding Scale) and perceived stress management skills (PSMS) at baseline, 6-months, and 12-months post-randomization into CBSM or a psycho-education condition. We tested a six-factor BF model using Confirmatory Factor Analysis and assessed CBSM-related changes in BF and PSMS using Hierarchical Linear Models. We included significantly affected BF dimensions in mediation models.Results. A six-factor model of BF had good fit [chi(2)(212) = 391.5, p < .001; CFI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.06; SRMR = 0.04]. CBSM positively affected changes in personal growth (beta = 0.06, p = .01), social relations (beta = 0.05, p = .05), and worldview (beta = 0.05, p = .02) BF. Perceived relaxation skill increases significantly mediated changes in personal growth (beta = 0.03, p = .04) and social relations (beta = 0.03, p = .04).Conclusion. Some aspects of perceived stress management skills appear to account for specific BF dimensions and should be considered in future efforts to develop interventions to modulate BF.

TI  - Thermal remote sensing for mapping the sub-Arctic permafrost and refining its southern limits
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost soils store more than one fourth of global soil organic carbon. This important carbon pool is threatened by carbon release from permafrost thawing. Especially in sub-Arctic transition zones, accurate mapping of permafrost is crucial for timely documentation of permafrost retreat and the consequent carbon uptake in its fragile ecosystems. Utilizing the 8-day Aqua/MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products in 2003-2020, this study extracts the southern limits of a sub-Arctic boreal mountain permafrost in the Amur River Basin bordering China, Russa, and Mongolia. A temporally dynamic MODIS Look-up-table is built to scale the MODIS LST to daily ground surface temperature. Using a thermal equilibrium model, the mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) on top of permafrost ground is estimated. The 18-year average MAGT = 0 degrees C defines the southern limits of the permafrost. Integrating the spatial distributions and temporal frequencies of annual MAGT < 0 <degrees>C, a probability index of permafrost continuity is extracted to classify permafrost types in a km-scale. The extracted permafrost map shows a similar pattern of permafrost distributions as the currently adopted global permafrost map from the International Permafrost Association (IPA). More importantly, it reveals an apparent northward shift of the southern limits. This study showcases the advantages of thermal remote sensing in exploring permafrost retreat, which provides the base information for modeling carbon release in the vulnerable transitional zone. The spatially and temporally continuous satellite observations could improve our carbon monitoring in cold lands under the pressure of global warming.

TI  - The spatio-temporal trends of urban green space and its interactions with urban growth: Evidence from the Yangtze River Delta region, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of urban green space (UGS) in urban sustainability is attracting increasing attention from researchers. How to achieve greener cities in urban development is an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, we investigate the spatio-temporal variation of UGS and its relationship with urban growth in different socioeconomic development phases based on an empirical analysis of cities in the Yangtze River Delta region in China during a period of rapid urban development (2001-2019). The remote sensing data reveal a changing UGS pattern that declined notably in the first decade and has increased slightly since 2012, with the green areas mainly clustered in urban centers. We use piecewise linear regression to investigate the impacts of urban growth on UGS from the perspective of growth in the economy, population, and land - in four socio-economic development phases. The results show that the growth of the economy and population reduced UGS in the initial stage of development. Recently, there is more awareness of the importance of environmental issues in socio-economic development. Further, the growth of the economy and population could promote UGS in recent years. Meanwhile, the expansion of urban land boundaries could provide more spaces for UGS. However, the growth of urban land is contrary to the sustainable and compact development of the city. Finally, we discuss the potential of urban growth to improve urban environment, and propose nature-based solutions to mitigate the conflicts between urban compactness and UGS layout. This study supplements the theory of urban growth and the environment with evidence from Chinese cities and offers insights into sustainable urban development in developing regions.

TI  - Cloud detection of high-resolution remote sensing image based on improved U-Net
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is an important part of remote sensing image processing. Excellent cloud detection methods can accurately extract clouds from remote sensing images, providing convenience for subsequent processing. Most of the traditional cloud detection methods have problems such as poor generalization ability and insufficient segmentation accuracy, and the detection results cannot well meet the requirements of follow-up work. In this paper, the cloud detection dataset is constructed by data enhancement method, and the cloud in remote sensing image is accurately detected by improving U-Net network model. Firstly, the sub-pixel image segmentation is achieved by using the superpixels segmentation method to further improve the accuracy of similar target aggregation and reduce cloud labeling errors. Then, the Gaussian blur method is improved to blur the remote sensing image around the cloud label adaptively, which weakens the influence of background on cloud detection and reduces the computing cost. Finally, VGG16 network is used to deepen the feature extraction part of U-Net network to extract multi-scale cloud feature information from remote sensing images and improve the cloud detection accuracy. A large number of experiments are carried out on GF-2 and MODIS remote sensing images and compared with other cloud detection methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately detect large area clouds and broken clouds in remote sensing images, with Dice value up to 94.6%, IoU value up to 89.8% and CPA value up to 94.2%.

TI  - Improving model parsimony and accuracy by modified greedy feature selection in digital soil mapping
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of increasing soil degradation worldwide, spatially explicit soil information is urgently needed to support decision-making for sustaining limited soil resources. Digital soil mapping (DSM) has been proven as an efficient way to deliver soil information from local to global scales. The number of environmental covariates used for DSM has rapidly increased due to the growing volume of remote sensing data, therefore variable selection is necessary to deal with multicollinearity and improve model parsimony. Compared with Boruta, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis, we proposed the use of modified greedy feature selection (MGFS), for DSM regression. For this purpose, using quantile regression forest, 402 soil samples and 392 environmental covariates were used to map the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon density (SOCD) in Northeast and North China. The result showed that MGFS selected the most parsimonious model with only 9 covariates (e.g., brightness index, mean annual temperature), much lower than RFE (22 covariates), VIF (30 covariates), and Boruta (76 covariates). The repeated validation (50 times) showed that the MGFS derived model performed better (R2 of 0.60, LCCC of 0.74, RMSE of 13.80 t ha -1) than these using full covariates, Boruta, RFE and VIF (R2 of 0.48-0.57, LCCC of 0.64-0.72, RMSE of 14.24-15.79 t ha -1). Despite the similar performance of the uncertainty estimate (PICP), the model using MGFS and RFE had the lowest global uncertainty (0.86) as indicated by the uncertainty index. In addition, MGFS had the best computation efficiency when considering the steps of variable selection and map prediction. Given these advantages over Boruta, RFE and VIF, MGFS has a high potential in fine-resolution soil mapping practices, especially for these studies at a broad scale involving heavy computation on millions or billions of pixels.

TI  - An integrated approach to reconstructing snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows on Sentinel-2 Time-Series images in a mountainous area
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is an important type of surface cover and an important freshwater resource in the arid regions of northwest China, and optical satellites are an important means for monitoring variation in snow cover. However, the ra-diation values measured by satellite sensors are affected by cloud cover and cloud shadows; thus, the recon-struction of snow cover under clouds and cloud shadows becomes a bottleneck problem especially in mountains areas. Based on the digital elevation model (DEM), in this paper, an integrated method of snow cover recon-struction on Sentinel-2 images is created by combining the improved SNOWL (snow line) algorithm considering unstable snow cover areas, Fmask cloud detection algorithms, and the Sen2Cor clear sky snow cover detection tool with a geospatial processing platform, GEE (Google Earth Engine). Considering the Babao River Basin as the study area, 474 Sentinel-2 scenes (10 m) were selected to obtain the snow cover spatiotemporal variations of 158 days from November 2016 to March 2021. Compared with the high-resolution GF-2 satellite images, the inte-grated method can extract snow under clouds and cloud shadows well, and the improved SNOWL algorithm improves the overall accuracy from 66.05 % to 84.26 %. The experimental results show that approximately half of the Babao River Basin is unstable snow cover, and areas above 3977 m are covered with snow for at least half a year.

TI  - Geodetic imaging of ground deformation and reservoir parameters at the Yangbajing Geothermal Field, Tibet, China
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and modeling ground surface deformation are crucial for the dynamic assessment of geothermal resources and sustainable exploitation in a geothermal field. In this study, we extract the deformation in the Yangbajing geothermal field by the small baseline-synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) method using 141 Sentinel-1A images collected between March 2017 and November 2021. The InSAR result indicates both uplift and subsidence in the geothermal field. Subsequently, we use a dual-source model combining a dipping ellipsoid and a rectangular surface to model the shallow reservoir that contracted to cause the complex subsidence field in the north of the geothermal field. The shallow reservoir that expanded to cause the uplift in the south is modeled by an ellipsoid source. The parameters inversion is processed by the nonlinear Bayesian inversion method which has been applied to search the optimal parameters setting in a priori space and evaluate the uncertainties by the confidence intervals. To validate our inversion results, we collect the data from 31 wells including extraction and injection wells, detailed tectonic survey data and geothermal isotherms of the Yangbajing geothermal field. The modeled shallow reservoir in the north is within a 140 degrees C ground isotherm and a 160 degrees C underground isotherm. The thickness and depth of the reservoir slightly exceed the data from producing wells, probably due to the structural subsidence of the reservoir. The geometric structure is consistent with the channel faults that control the formation and development of the shallow reservoirs. The modeled reservoir under the rebound area in the south is also validated by comparing the data. Furthermore, we estimate the volume loss and recovery of the contracting and expanding reservoirs. We analyse the deformation mechanisms by considering the tectonic formation, the reservoir structure, and the extraction and rechargeability of the reservoirs. This research suggests the deformation pattern of shallow porous reservoirs that have similar layer composition and tectonic structure elsewhere in the world. Moreover, it provides a theoretical model to explore the parameters and volume change of geothermal reservoirs in plateau-embedded basins around the world. Our work is significant for the conservation and development of geothermal energy in geothermal fields that experience deformation, both subsidence and uplift.

TI  - Comparison of Eulerian and Lagrangian transport models for harmful algal bloom forecasts in Lake Erie
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Erie has experienced a re-emergence of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) since the early 2000s, posing significant socioeconomic and ecological consequences that impact drinking water, human health, fish-eries, tourism, and water quality. As predicting CHAB intensity and spatial distribution is critical to Lake Erie ecosystem management, this study focuses on a comprehensive evaluation of Lagrangian and Eulerian transport models for Lake Erie CHAB forecasts, including 1) a Lagrangian particle model (LPM), 2) an Eulerian tracer model (ETM), and 3) a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) that utilizes the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. We evaluated the models' performance against the latest high-resolution satellite product from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor over 24-to 240-h hindcasts for each CHAB occurrence in three consecutive CHAB seasons (2017-2019). We examined the relative contributions of horizontal transport, vertical turbulent mixing, and algal buoyancy on the CHAB inter-and intra-day variability. In the short-term forecast, we emphasize the highly dynamic reaction of currents to weather-scale wind events that are crucial to CHAB transport. While statistical skill assessments show that these three transport models attain comparable levels of hindcast accuracy, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of each model in the context of general bio-physical modeling. In particular, the fact that the ETM and PCPM perform as well as or better than the LPM sets up a promising path to developing more biological realism in future operational forecast models using Eulerian or hybrid approaches.

TI  - Identification of stage I/II melanoma patients at high risk for recurrence using a model combining clinicopathologic factors with gene expression profiling (CP-GEP)
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Patients with cutaneous melanoma stage I/IIA disease are currently not eligible for adjuvant therapy, despite their risk for relapses and death. This study validates the ability of a model combining clinicopathologic factors with gene expression profiling (CP-GEP) to identify patients at high risk for disease recurrence in stage I/II and subgroup stage I/IIA.Patients and methods: 543 patients with stage I/II primary cutaneous melanoma from the Uni-versity of Tuebingen diagnosed between 2000 and 2017 were analysed. All patients received sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Analysis was conducted for a separate group of 80 pa-tients who did not undergo SLNB.Results: CP-GEP stratified 424 stage I/IIA patients (78% of the cohort) according to their risk for recurrence, with five-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates of 77.8% and 93% for CP-GEP high risk (195 patients) and low risk (229 patients), respectively, and hazard ratio of 3.53 (p- value <0.001). In patients who did not receive SLNB biopsy, CP-GEP captured 6 out of 7 re-lapses.Conclusion: CP-GEP can be used to identify primary cutaneous melanoma patients with a high risk for disease recurrence -especially for stage I/IIA, who are considered low risk by AJCC 8th. These patients may benefit from adjuvant therapy. Also, in the future, when SLNB may become irrelevant, CP-GEP may serve as a risk stratification tool. 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Preliminary study of shark microbiota at a unique mix-species shark aggregation site, in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sharks, as apex predators, play an essential ecological role in shaping the marine food web and maintaining healthy and balanced marine ecosystems. Sharks are sensitive to environmental changes and anthropogenic pressure and demonstrate a clear and rapid response. This designates them a "keystone" or "sentinel" group that may describe the structure and function of the ecosystem. As a meta-organism, sharks offer selective niches (organs) for microorganisms that can provide benefits for their hosts. However, changes in the microbiota (due to physiological or environmental changes) can turn the symbiosis into a dysbiosis and may affect the physiology, immunity and ecology of the host. Although the importance of sharks within the ecosystem is well known, relatively few studies have focused on the microbiome aspect, especially with long-term sampling. Our study was conducted at a site of coastal development in Israel where a mixed-species shark aggregation (November-May) is observed. The aggregation includes two shark species, the dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus) and sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) which segregate by sex (females and males, respectively). In order to characterize the bacterial profile and examine the physiological and ecological aspects, microbiome samples were collected from different organs (gills, skin, and cloaca) from both shark species over 3 years (sampling seasons: 2019, 2020, and 2021). The bacterial composition was significantly different between the shark individuals and the surrounding seawater and between the shark species. Additionally, differences were apparent between all the organs and the seawater, and between the skin and gills. The most dominant groups for both shark species were Flavobacteriaceae, Moraxellaceae, and Rhodobacteraceae. However, specific microbial biomarkers were also identified for each shark. An unexpected difference in the microbiome profile and diversity between the 2019-2020 and 2021 sampling seasons, revealed an increase in the potential pathogen Streptococcus. The fluctuations in the relative abundance of Streptococcus between the months of the third sampling season were also reflected in the seawater. Our study provides initial information on shark microbiome in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. In addition, we demonstrated that these methods were also able to describe environmental episodes and the microbiome is a robust measure for long-term ecological research.

TI  - Land use classification over smallholding areas in the European Common Agricultural Policy framework
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use (LU) monitoring and mapping from remote sensing (RS) data are relevant topics in Earth observation (EO). LU monitoring requires powerful/robust classification approaches able to provide reliable identifications in decision-making applications, even over challenging areas. The European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) promotes the use of remote sensing for LU monitoring in Europe useful in the compliance control of the subsidy payments. In this context, the present study proposes a novel classification chain to identify ten land uses, namely: forest (FOR), pasture with trees (TRE), pasture with shrubs (SHR), pastureland (PAS), vineyard (VIN), arable land (ARL), fruit trees (FRU), nut trees (NUT), citrus (CIT), and olive grove (OLI), over three areas in the Valencian Autonomous Region (Spain) where smallholding farming predominates. The approach exploits the multitemporal information provided by Sentinel-2 data using a novel spatial strategy specifically designed to deal with heterogeneous agricultural areas. More precisely, we implemented a deep learning algorithm based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks to account for complex temporal dynamics. The classification results over the three areas showed accuracies higher than 95.5% over validation sets composed of in-situ checks never used during the training process. The proposed methodology outperformed standard approaches that not consider the spatial variability of the training samples, and revealed very good agreement concerning the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) of Spain. In addition, the developed chain proposes the novelty of using the kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI) as a predictor in a LU classification processing chain. Including the kNDVI instead of the traditional NDVI outperformed the classification accuracy in all metrics and classes. Ultimately, the obtained classifications were used for assessing the 2020 farmers' declarations in the three study areas. The declarations showed a level of agreement concerning the proposed approach near 99%.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes in the boreal forest in Siberia over the period 1985-2015 against the background of climate change
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has been proven to be an indisputable fact and to be occurring at a faster rate (compared to the other regions at the same latitude of the world) in boreal forest areas. Climate change has been observed to have a strong influence on forests; however, until now, the amount of quantitative information on the climate drivers that are producing changes in boreal forest has been limited. The objectives of this work were to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of boreal forest and forest types and to find the significant climate drivers that are producing changes in boreal forest. The boreal forest in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Siberia, Russia, which lies within the latitude range 51-69 degrees N, was selected as the study area. The distribution of the boreal forest and forest types in the years 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015 were derived from a series of Landsat data. The spatiotemporal changes in the boreal forest and forest types that occurred over each 10-year period within each 2 degrees latitudinal zone between 51 and 69 degrees N from 1985 to 2015 were then comprehensively analyzed. The results show that the total area of forest increased over the study period and that the increase was fastest in the high-latitude zone between 63 and 69 degrees N. The increases in the areas of broad-leaved and coniferous forests were found to have different characteristics. In the medium-latitude zone between 57 and 63 degrees N in particular, the area of broad-leaved forest grew faster than that of coniferous forest. Finally, the influence of the climate factors of temperature and precipitation on changes in the forests was analyzed. The results indicate that temperature rather than precipitation is the main climate factor that is driving change.

TI  - Estimating the shrimp farm's production and their future growth prediction by remote sensing: Case study Gulf of California
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrimp farms are within the main aquaculture activities and In the last 30 years, shrimp farms have expanded along the Gulf of California. Because the shrimp farm's production is related to the pond area and the extended location of shrimp farms, we employed a multi-disciplinary approach to study the process of annual shrimp farm expansion, in addition to predicting shrimp production in the short term. Our study hypothesizes that semi-intensive shrimp farm production is dependent on the pond area which can be accurately quantified by using remote sensing image classification combined with the historical production data of shrimp aquaculture. We could calculate the long-term expansion of the total pond area and forecast the total annual shrimp production in the short-term. Our results highlight the development over the last 28 years. The total surface area of the shrimp ponds grew by more than 1100%. The linear regression model between the shrimp farms area, calculated using remote sensing, and statistical data on shrimp production, was strongly positive and significant (r2 = 0.874, p =2.209e-11). Likewise, the linear regression model for the total pond area as a function of time resulted strong positive and statistically significant (r2 = 0.936, p =2.917e-15). We demonstrated that the shrimp production could be assessed based on the total pond area by year, obtained by remote sensing. We estimated the past long-term shrimp farm expansion in the study zone using remote sensing data. This methodology is valuable for monitoring food security, aquaculture management decisions, and coastal ecology.
