TI  - CV-GMTINet: GMTI Using a Deep Complex-Valued Convolutional Neural Network for Multichannel SAR-GMTI System
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivated by recent advances in deep learning, a novel deep complex-valued convolutional neural network (CV-CNN)-based method is proposed for ground moving target indication (GMTI) in a multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system. The proposed method integrates the SAR-GMTI task into a blind inverse problem solved by a deep CV-CNN named CV-GMTINet. To take advantage of the amplitude and phase information of complex multichannel SAR images, both feature maps and network parameters are extended into the complex domain. The proposed CV-GMTINet is designed by adopting complex-valued residual dense blocks (CV-RDBs) to adaptively learn complex hierarchical features. The trained CV-GMTINet, as a GMTI processor, can be applied to complex multichannel SAR images to discriminate moving targets from stationary clutter and refocus the moving target images simultaneously. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art GMTI methods in both detection performance and refocusing accuracy, especially for the slow-moving target and the moving target with only along-track velocity.

AB  - This study developed a machine-learning-based model to extract the rainfall information from C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired in dual-polarization (VV/VH) over hurricane conditions. The model is based on a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) tuned by 1,1762 pairs of samples from collocations of Sentinel-1 data and Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) measurements. The model inputs include four SAR measured physical parameters and one morphological feature related to the hurricane. Several comparative tests show that the selection of different SAR inputs has a significant impact on the performance of the models for rainfall estimation. For example, compared to the SFMR measurements, the root mean square error and correlation coefficient of rain rate obtained by BPNN with all five inputs reach the best, which are 3.61 mm/hr and 0.87, respectively.

TI  - The Fusion of Physical, Textural, and Morphological Information in SAR Imagery for Hurricane Wind Speed Retrieval Based on Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed a deep-learning-based model to retrieve sea surface hurricane winds from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. We introduce the essential idea, residual learning, of the Residual Net into the artificial neural network and design a deep cross-layer concatenation network (DCCN). The model inputs include SAR measured physical parameters in backscattering energy, the texture feature represented by the gray level co- occurrence matrix (GLCM), and the morphological hurricane feature. We collected 45 satellite SAR images from Sentinel-1 (S1) over hurricane conditions. These images were divided into 39 and six for model development and independent testing. A total of 16 127 wind samples acquired from 39 SAR images and simultaneously measured by the stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) were collected as model tuning datasets, among which 80% and 20% were used for training and validation. Our validation results show that the deep-learning-based model achieved a correlation coefficient (CORR) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.98 and 1.72 m/s for wind speeds up to 75 m/s. We further applied the model to six independent SAR images. The model significantly outperformed two existing geophysical algorithms and one backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm with the RMSE is 2.61 m/s and a CORR of 0.95. Moreover, statistical analysis in different wind speed regimes indicates that our model shows a stable performance improvement than comparable algorithms. The RMSE decreases 10%-70%, especially the reduction of RMSE is more than 45% at high wind speed (>42 m/s). Furthermore, adding an independent rainfall estimate to the deep-learning model further enhanced the wind retrieval algorithm.

TI  - Building belonging in online WIL environments - lessons (re)learnt in the pandemic age: a collaborative enquiry
T2  - JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The theme of belonging in e-pedagogy gained currency in the 2000s when educational providers hastened to join the online teaching and learning boom and studies of building and maintaining a sense of community (SOC) proved central to this endeavour. Motivated by the pandemic-era necessity to convene teaching and learning online as part of a response to super-complexity as a defining feature of tertiary education in the 21st century, work-integrated learning (WIL) practitioners returned to this scholarship to consider, under pressure, modes of building SOC and belonging in online spaces. Underpinned by a broadly constructivist worldview and informed by the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, our COVID-age study considers what pedagogical strategies are viewed as affording learners this sense of belonging - or not. Using a collaborative enquiry to pool our perceptions and experiences from three WIL contexts, we ask how work-integrated learning (WIL) practitioners build belonging in online spaces and identify strategies learners perceive as valuable. Drawing on the authors' small-scale studies of educator and learner experiences of online WIL (eWIL), our collaborative enquiry uses qualitative descriptive analysis to identify key themes in the voices of students. Advancing the scholarship, our study identifies three threads to the fabric of belonging: humanising online WIL; the importance of mentor presence; and fostering professional belonging. The study suggests that strategies impacting these three areas are at the heart of building belonging in online spaces, broadly envisaged as imagined professional communities of practice. Techniques viewed as successful are advanced as possibilities for enhancing pedagogy in online WIL communities.

TI  - Senior triaging of ENT emergency clinic referrals alleviates pressures on the outpatient department.
T2  - Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The ear, nose and throat (ENT) emergency clinic is managed by foundation year (FY) doctors from taking referrals to discharging patients, under the supervision of a registrar. FYs learn essential skills and knowledge on how to manage common ENT problems. The clinic is often overloaded because of a high patient demand, and this limits the opportunities for teaching. We hypothesised that the clinic bookings would be better managed if referrals from general practitioners (GPs) were triaged by registrars.METHODS: Telephone referrals from GPs for the ENT emergency clinic were directed to the on-call ENT registrar, between 8am and 1pm from Monday to Friday, and to the FY outside of this period. Consecutive referrals to the emergency clinic were analysed in a baseline audit and a post-intervention cycle.RESULTS: A total of 646 and 611 patients were given clinic appointments in the first and second cycles, respectively. Clinic session overbookings decreased from 85% to 46.3%. Appointments for referrals that were deemed inappropriate had reduced from 22% to 12.1%.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Involvement of a registrar in taking referrals for the ENT emergency clinic was associated with a reduction in clinic overbookings. It is feasible and productive to involve a senior decision maker in the operational management of the emergency clinic, while preserving the delivery of this service by FYs for its training value.

TI  - A Quantifying Approach to Soil Salinity Based on a Radar Feature Space Model Using ALOS PALSAR-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid areas, timely and effective monitoring and mapping of salt-affected areas is essential to prevent land degradation and to achieve sustainable soil management. The main objective of this study is to make full use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarization technology to improve soil salinity mapping in the Keriya Oasis, Xinjiang, China. In this study, 25 polarization features are extracted from ALOS PALSAR-2 images, of which four features are selected. In addition, three soil salinity inversion models, named the RSDI1, RSDI2, and RSDI3, are proposed. The analysis and comparison results of inversion accuracy show that the overall correlation values of the RSDI1, RSDI2, and RSDI3 models are 0.63, 0.61, and 0.62, respectively. This result indicates that the radar feature space models have the potential to extract information on soil salinization in the Keriya Oasis.

TI  - The Asian tiger mosquito <i>Aedes albopictus</i> (Skuse) in Kosovo: First record
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive mosquito species that is considered a potential vector of about 22 arboviruses, among which dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Here we report the first record of Aedes albopictus in the territory of the Republic of Kosovo. The first finding, in July 2020, was driven by a photo of an adult mosquito published by a citizen in social media. The subsequent field investigation in July 2020 confirmed the presence of adult mosquitoes by human landing catch and collection of eggs in ovitraps at the village Zhur. Monitoring was performed for 7 weeks with ovitraps and BG-Sentinel adult traps at 36 sampling stations from 7 localities, in the Southern part of Kosovo, on the border with Albania. Fifty-two out of 81 ovitrap samples resulted positive for the presence of Ae. albopictus. A total of 2,711 eggs are collected in 22 out 36 stations and a total of 78 adults from 4 out 4 stations with BG Sentinel trap and 15 adults with handled electric aspirator. Our finding shows that the tiger mosquito is expanding its geographical range in the Balkans, southeastern Europe.

AB  - While extracting "built-up" pixels from satellite imagery, supervised classification algorithms often misclassify "river sand" pixels as "built-up" ones due to the similarity in their spectral profiles. With the help of the spectral reflectance information in BLUE & GREEN bands of Landsat satellite imagery, this study has introduced a new index BRSSI (Built-Up & River Sand Separation Index) that efficiently reduce the misclassification between these two classes. The results shows that average overall accuracy, F1 score and kappa (kappa) coefficient for the developed index corresponding to selected 3 study regions across India are 0.9763, 0.9767 & 0.9527 respectively.

AB  - Coal seam fire (CSF) affects various social, economical, and environmental aspects. Surface and sub-surface CSF are detected in the past by studying the anomalies of land surface temperature patterns. Most of them use manual observations and thresholds to separate CSF. Such techniques are also susceptible to other regions, which have high temperature and high mineral content. The proposed work presents a novel technique to detect surface and sub-surface CSF by treating them as outliers. It provides a multi-level anomaly detection technique using isolation forest, which is robust to the presence of other high temperature and high mineral content regions over the seasons.

AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is the principal component of photosynthetic pigment that truly reflects phytoplankton biomass which negatively impacts water quality. Landsat based spectral indices can be applied to estimate the amount of Chl-a in water. This study quantifies the uncertainties for the estimation of Chl-a using cross-validation of linear machine learning (ML) algorithms. The results for the comparison of Chl-a retrieved by four indices: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), maximum chlorophyll index (MCI), normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI), and multi-linear regression (MLR) showed that MLR, a multi-linear regression composite of the three (NDVI, MCI and NDCI) spectral indices explanatory variables evaluating the relative effect of these explanatory on the outcome of Chl-a, outperformed the other indices. As a result, the performances of the indices ranked in ascending order based on the coefficient of determination (R-2) are as follows: MLR>NDCI>MCI>NDVI. Additionally, for all the indices, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) displayed robust model performances with the lowest magnitude of bias and RMSE ranging from (0.014 <= Bias <= 2.998 mgL-1) and (0.18 <= RMSE <= 1.74 mgL-1) respectively. In contrast, a k-Fold crossvalidation configured at an optimum fold (k = 5) had fairly comparable performances to LOOCV with regard to R-2. This research developed a unique and easily applicable MLR composite index based on satellite remote sensing technique for water quality monitoring for a relatively small water reservoir in southern Taiwan. Overall, our research findings highlight the importance of readily accessible satellite data for near real time evaluation of water quality.

TI  - deSpeckNet: Generalizing Deep Learning-Based SAR Image Despeckling
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL) has proven to be a suitable approach for despeckling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. So far, most DL models are trained to reduce speckle that follows a particular distribution, either using simulated noise or a specific set of real SAR images, limiting the applicability of these methods for real SAR images with unknown noise statistics. In this article, we present a DL method, deSpeckNet, that estimates the speckle noise distribution and the despeckled image simultaneously. Since it does not depend on a specific noise model, deSpeckNet generalizes well across SAR acquisitions in a variety of landcover conditions. We evaluated the performance of deSpeckNet on single polarized Sentinel-1 images acquired in Indonesia, The Democratic Republic of Congo, and The Netherlands, a single polarized ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 image acquired in Japan and an Iceye X2 image acquired in Germany. In all cases, deSpeckNet was able to effectively reduce speckle and restore the images in high quality with respect to the state of the art.

TI  - Place-Based Analysis of Satellite Time Series Shows Opposing Land Change Patterns in the Copperbelt Region of Zambia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of land degradation needs to be understood at various spatial and temporal scales in order to protect ecosystem services and communities directly dependent on it. This is especially true for regions in sub-Saharan Africa, where socio economic and political factors exacerbate ecological degradation. This study identifies spatially explicit land change dynamics in the Copperbelt province of Zambia in a local context using satellite vegetation index time series derived from the MODIS sensor. Three sets of parameters, namely, monthly series, annual peaking magnitude, and annual mean growing season were developed for the period 2000 to 2019. Trend was estimated by applying harmonic regression on monthly series and linear least square regression on annually aggregated series. Estimated spatial trends were further used as a basis to map endemic land change processes. Our observations were as follows: (a) 15% of the study area dominant in the east showed positive trends, (b) 3% of the study area dominant in the west showed negative trends, (c) natural regeneration in mosaic landscapes (post shifting cultivation) and land management in forest reserves were chiefly responsible for positive trends, and (d) degradation over intact miombo woodland and cultivation areas contributed to negative trends. Additionally, lower productivity over areas with semi-permanent agriculture and shift of new encroachment into woodlands from east to west of Copperbelt was observed. Pivot agriculture was not a main driver in land change. Although overall greening trends prevailed across the study site, the risk of intact woodlands being exposed to various disturbances remains high. The outcome of this study can provide insights about natural and assisted landscape restoration specifically addressing the miombo ecoregion.

TI  - Revealing spatio-temporal dynamics with long-term trypanosomatid live-cell imaging
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, is highly motile and must be able to move in all three dimensions for reliable cell division. These characteristics make long-term microscopic imaging of live T. brucei cells challenging, which has limited our understanding of important cellular events. To address this issue, we devised an imaging approach that confines cells in small volumes within cast agarose microwells that can be imaged continuously for up to 24 h. Individual T. brucei cells were imaged through multiple rounds of cell division with high spatial and temporal resolution. We developed a strategy that employs in-well "sentinel" cells to monitor potential imaging toxicity during loss-of-function experiments such as small-molecule inhibition and RNAi. Using our approach, we show that the asymmetric daughter cells produced during T. brucei division subsequently divide at different rates, with the old-flagellum daughter cell dividing first. The flagellar detachment phenotype that appears during inhibition of the Polo-like kinase homolog TbPLK occurs in a stepwise fashion, with the new flagellum initially linked by its tip to the old, attached flagellum. We probe the feasibility of a previously proposed "back-up" cytokinetic mechanism and show that cells that initiate this process do not appear to complete cell division. This live-cell imaging method will provide a novel avenue for studying a wide variety of cellular events in trypanosomatids that have previously been inaccessible.Author summaryTrypanosoma brucei causes severe diseases that affect humans and livestock in Sub-Saharan Africa. Efficient strategies for manipulating the T. brucei genome have provided a wealth of information about protein localization and function in diverse cellular processes. However, employing live-cell imaging for phenotypic analysis in T. brucei remains a significant challenge because immobilization of this highly motile parasite rapidly leads to morphologic defects and cell death. While fixed-cell imaging can provide snapshots of cellular events, it cannot provide the direct causal link or precise timing of events that comes from watching a living cell change over time. Our strategy using agarose microwells now allows long-term live cell T. brucei imaging with a simple apparatus that can be adapted for a wide range of experimental conditions.

AB  - The study presented an analysis of the shoreline evolution in Callao Bay - Lima, Peru; which is one of the most important bays in Peru due to economics and touristic activities. Study areas include La Punta, Callao and Ventanilla districts with an approximate 32 km of length. The study area was divided into six sectors, and the analysis was focused mainly from the 2001 to 2020 period, identifying areas affected by coastal erosion or accretion throughout. Satellite data images were obtained from Landsat (5, 7 and 8) and Sentinel 2, they were processed to correctly identify the shoreline. Shoreline variations were analyzed using the DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) utility, applying a statistical method called "Linear Regression Ratio". Shoreline variations showed different rates of changes along different sectors of the study area. In general terms, the accretion or erosion trend in Callao Bay was a low accretion with average rates from 3.77 m / year to 4.20 m / year, except in the sector which is closed to the Rimac river with change rate of around 11.85 m/year.

AB  - Within the protected area of managed resources Peninsula de Guanahacabibes there is a wide diversity of plant communities of high ecological value that provide environmental services, they are grouped into various formations and forest categories. Due to the presence of an outdated cartography dating from 2009 and with Landsat 7 images, the objective was to make the thematic cartography and delimit the updated zoning of the different forest formations and categories of the study area, where the optical images were used of the Landsat 8 platform and the Russian SAS Planet software, treated and processed in the QGIS 3.23 software; From there, a supervised classification of coverage was carried out using the maximum likelihood algorithm. Obtaining as main results the updated zoning from the supervised classification of forest formations and categories with a higher level of detail. The results also show that the formation of semideciduous forest and mangrove are the most representative with 60 911.92 ha and 23 311.37 ha of surface and that within the categories of forests the one with the largest extension is the one destined to the protection and conservation of fauna with 519.3 km(2).

AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System - Reflectometry has shown promising results to retrieve land-related parameters, such as soil moisture. Polarimetric radar measurements offer additional information about the scattering scenario. SMAP-R is the first polarimetric GNSS-R dataset collected from the space thanks to the reception of the Horizontal and Vertical components of an incident circular polarized signal, allowing the retrieval of the full-Stokes parameter of the reflection. The reflectivity derived from the first Stokes bistatic radar cross section is compared to the SMAP brightness temperature, showing their dependence with vegetated areas by means of a linear equation. Finally, a polarimetry analysis is conducted proposing different polarimetric ratios derived from SMAP-R Stokes parameters, and the MODIS-derived vegetation water content.

TI  - LAND COVER CHANGES IN COFFEE CULTURAL LANDSCAPES OF PEREIRA (COLOMBIA) BETWEEN 1997 AND 2014
T2  - CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how and what land cover changes and transitions have occurred in a territory is crucial to planning and managing high-demand surfaces. At the landscape level, the challenge is determining the allocation and management of various land cover options. Therefore, for natural resources planning and management, a study characterizing and analysing the territory of interest should be included. This work aimed to analyse the changes and land cover patterns in the city of Pereira, Colombia, within the framework of the Colombian Coffee Cultural Landscape. The evaluated period was between 1997 and 2014, and a Geographic Information System, ENVI 4.8 programme and QGIS programme were used for multitemporal analysis. To describe the land cover transitions, two temporal moments were analysed with Landsat satellite images: one moment was for the year 1997, which was taken in August (Landsat 5), and the other moment was for the year 2014, which was taken in July (Landsat 8). At level 1 of CORINE (Coordination of information on the environment), the areas of land cover corresponding to agricultural areas, forests and semi-natural areas decreased most in the analysis period, while artificial surfaces increased. At level 3, the cover with the greatest decrease in territory was coffee crops, which showed a negative annual loss rate of -3.97%, followed by permanent crops (2.67%). The continuous and discontinuous urban fabric showed the greatest growth with a positive annual rate of 4.14%. In conclusion, the land cover that lost the most territory was coffee crop, mainly due to political-economic factors, such as the dissolution of the International Coffee Agreement and the National Federation of Coffee Growers that discouraged coffee cultivation and permanent crops. Likewise, sociocultural factors, such as smallholder farmers have guided the changes in land cover and have stimulated productive styles to adapt and remain, increasing heterogeneous agricultural areas.

AB  - Emissions from forest fires give out huge amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere degrading the surrounding air quality. Climate change results in prolonged summer days and less precipitation thus increasing fuel accumulation facilitating recurring forest fires in the Western Himalayan regions. Most of the forest fire cases are human ignited that damaging the forest irreparably. This study attempts to analyse the impact of the forest fire events on the tropospheric concentrations of five major gaseous pollutants aerosols, Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Formaldehyde (HCHO). A clear increase in daily average of the air pollutants considered in the study was observed as the number of forest fires were also increasing. The gases responded inversely with precipitation. Precipitation washed away majority of the air pollutants. The high-resolution air quality data were retrieved from the Google Earth Engine platform using Sentinel 5 Precursor datasets, daily active fire points from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument of Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) and daily precipitation data from CHIRPS Daily Version 2.0 Final. Four out of five gases i.e., CO, aerosols, NO2, HCHO pollutants gave moderate to high correlation values with the forest fire incidences. Air pollutants responded inversely with the precipitation pattern.

AB  - In the present study, crab species of the families Ocypodidae Rafinesque, 1815, Macrophthalmidae Dana, 1851, and Dotillidae Stimpson, 1858, are reported from the islands of Liki and Bepondi, in Papua, eastern Indonesia, on the basis of specimens collected during the Nusa Manggala Expedition in 2018. Ocypode ceratophthalmus (Pallas, 1772), O. cordimana Latreille, 1818, Gelasimus jocelynae (Shih, Naruse and Ng, 2010), and Paraleptuca crassipes (White, 1847), all of which belong to the Ocypodidae, are recorded. In addition, two new species from Liki Island, Macrophthalmus (Macrophthalmus) manggala (Macrophthalmidae) and Tmethypocoelis liki (Dotillidae), are described. Macrophthalmus (Macrophthalmus) manggala, new species, belongs to the Macrophthalmus (Macrophthalmus) convexus species-group and can be distinguished from the other members of the same group by a G1 that has a truncated apex with a short chitinous process being twisted and directed laterally, a vulva that is rounded and slightly protruded with a median transverse groove, and the gastric mill wherein the anterior margin of the propyloric ossicle of the median tooth plate is narrow and acute and the lateral tooth plate bears 15-16 teeth. Tmethypocoelis liki, new species, differs from the other four congeners in the male cheliped, which has a subdistal tooth on the upper margin of the dactylus, and the G1, which has a bilobed tip with five short and one long apical setae.

AB  - Evidence suggests that plant traits, plant functional diversity, and species diversity are linked to ecosystem functions to different extents. However, these relationships are sometimes inconsistent because of the presence of environmental gradients (e.g. climate, topography, land use) and scale mismatches between sampling units and landscape processes. Relationships between satellite data and vegetation parameters seem to be also case-specific, which hinders the creation of generalizable models. We have built predictive models of structural parameters and species composition across a broad range of climatic and topoedaphic conditions and management practices across grasslands and forests in Germany. For that, we use Sentinel multitemporal imagery and neural networks. Our models manage to explain 50% of the data variability for structural parameters, show high stability, and can generalize well across environmental gradients and sites. We also found that prediction models of biodiversity parameters show lower predictive capabilities. Spatially continuous models of grassland and forest attributes provide vital information on ecosystem functions at landscape scale. Thus, they can contribute to studying the feedback mechanisms between biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and land management at the scales to which ecological processes occur.

TI  - Comparison of the Novel Probabilistic Self-Optimizing Vectorized Earth Observation Retrieval Classifier with Common Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Vectorized Earth Observation Retrieval (VEOR) algorithm is a novel algorithm suited to the efficient supervised classification of large Earth Observation (EO) datasets. VEOR addresses shortcomings in well-established machine learning methods with an emphasis on numerical performance. Its characteristics include (1) derivation of classification probability; (2) objective selection of classification features that maximize Cohen's kappa coefficient (kappa) derived from iterative "leave-one-out " cross-validation; (3) reduced sensitivity of the classification results to imbalanced classes; (4) smoothing of the classification probability field to reduce noise/mislabeling; (5) numerically efficient retrieval based on a pre-computed look-up vector (LUV); and (6) separate parametrization of the algorithm for each discrete feature class (e.g., land cover). Within this study, the performance of the VEOR classifier was compared to other commonly used machine learning algorithms: K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, Gaussian process, decision trees, random forest, artificial neural networks, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. Firstly, the comparison was performed using synthetic 2D (two-dimensional) datasets featuring different sample sizes, levels of noise (i.e., mislabeling) and class imbalance. Secondly, the same experiments were repeated for 7D datasets consisting of informative, redundant and insignificant features. Ultimately, the benchmarking of the classifiers involved cloud discrimination using MODIS satellite spectral measurements and a reference cloud mask derived from combined CALIOP lidar and CPR radar data. The results revealed that the proposed VEOR algorithm accurately discriminated cloud cover using MODIS data and accurately classified large synthetic datasets with low or moderate levels of noise and class imbalance. On the contrary, VEOR did not feature good classification skills for significantly distorted or for small datasets. Nevertheless, the comparisons performed proved that VEOR was within the 3-4 most accurate classifiers and that it can be applied to large Earth Observation datasets.

AB  - Policymakers often make decisions based on GDP, unemployment rate, industrial output, etc. The primary methods to obtain or estimate such information are resource-intensive. In order to make timely and well-informed decisions, it is imperative to come up with proxies for these parameters, which can be sampled quickly and efficiently, especially during disruptive events like the COVID19 pandemic. We explore the use of remotely sensed data for this task. The data has become cheaper to collect than surveys and can be available in real-time. In this work, we present Regional GDP-NightLight (ReGNL), a neural network trained to predict GDP given the nightlights data and geographical coordinates. Taking the case of 50 US states, we find that ReGNL is disruption-agnostic and can predict the GDP for both normal years (2019) and years with a disruptive event (2020). ReGNL outperforms time-series ARIMA methods for prediction, even during the pandemic.

AB  - The connection of these maps to homoclinic loops acts like an amplifier of the map behavior, and makes it interesting also in the case where all map orbits approach zero (but in many possible ways). We introduce so-called ???flat??? intervals containing exactly one maximum or minimum, and so-called ???steep??? intervals containing exactly one zero point of fy,,, and no zero of f/y,,,. For specific parameters y and ,,, we construct an open set of points with orbits staying entirely in the ???flat??? intervals in section three. In section four, we describe orbits staying in the ???steep??? intervals (for open parameter sets), and in section five (for specific parameters) orbits regularly changing between ???steep??? and ???flat??? intervals. Both orbit types are described by symbol sequences, and it is shown that their Lebesgue measure is zero.

TI  - Characterizing posttraumatic stress disorder in primary care using electronic medical records: a retrospective cohort study.
T2  - Annals of family medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Context: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic mental health disorder associated with significant morbidity and economic cost. Primary care providers are frequently involved in the ongoing management of patients experiencing PTSD, as well as related comorbid conditions. Despite recognized need to enhance PTSD management in primary care settings, knowledge regarding its prevalence in these settings is limited.Objective: To apply a validated case definition of PTSD to electronic medical records (EMRs) of family physicians and nurse practitioners participating in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN).Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.Dataset: This study accessed de-identified EMR from 1,574 primary care providers participating in the CPCSSN.Population Studied: The study population included all patients with at least one visit to a primary care provider participating in the CPCSSN between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019 (N = 689,301).Outcome Measures: We identified patients with PTSD and described associations between PTSD and patient characteristics (including sex, age, geography, depression, anxiety, medical comorbidities, substance use and social and material deprivation) using multivariable logistic regression models.Results: Among the 689,301 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 8,213 (1.2%) had a diagnosis of PTSD. Patients with PTSD were significantly more likely to reside in an urban location (84.9% vs. 80.4%; p-value <.0001) and have one or more comorbid conditions (90.8% vs. 70.2%; p-value <.0001). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, patients with depression (OR 4.8; 95%CI 4.6-5.1) and anxiety (OR 2.2; 95%CI 2.1-2.3) had increased odds of having PTSD compared to patients without depression or anxiety. Patients with alcohol (OR 1.8; 95%CI 1.6-1.9) and drug (OR 3.1; 95%CI 2.9-3.3) use disorders had significantly higher odds of PTSD compared to patients without these disorders. Patients in the most deprived neighborhoods based on census data had 4.2 times higher odds of have PTSD (95%CI 3.2-5.43) compared to patients in the least deprived areas.Conclusions: This is the first study to describe PTSD prevalence in a large Canadian sample of primary care patients using an EMR-based case definition. Characterizing patients with PTSD in primary care may improve disease surveillance and inform the interdisciplinary care required to manage PTSD symptoms.

TI  - Findings of a community screening programme for human cystic echinococcosis in a non-endemic area.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonosis caused by infection with the larval stages of the taeniid cestodes of the species complex Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato. It is prevalent among transhumant communities in East Africa, including those residing in northern Kenya. The movement of livestock from these regions of high incidence to areas of low incidence creates an indirect risk of disease spill-over to humans. To assess possible establishment of the CE life cycle outside known endemic regions, we used a portable ultrasound scanner to screen for the presence of human CE in Bungoma County of western Kenya, an area which imports substantial numbers of cattle for slaughter from neighbouring pastoralist regions. Eight sentinel sites were purposively selected based on their proximity to slaughterhouses handling animals introduced from pastoralist regions, and necessary permissions to conduct the study were sought. Regression analyses were conducted to identify risk factors associated with the presence of abdominal and cystic lesions (CL). In total, 1002 participants were screened; of these, 654 (65.3%) were female and the median age was 43. Farming (n = 403; 43.4%) was the most frequent occupation, followed by professional (i.e. on regular salary) (n = 215; 23.1%), and business (n = 207; 22.3%) categories. Sixty-seven participants (6.7%) had abnormal ultrasound findings, of these, 7 (1.1%) had simple liver cysts/CL, as per WHO classification. As such, their outcome was inconclusive and they were not put on treatment but advised to attend follow-up investigations in a referral health facility. Other abnormal findings included splenomegaly (n = 14), ovarian cysts (n = 14), uterine fibroids (n = 10), polycystic kidneys (n = 6), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 6). Age was unconditionally associated with the presence of presumptive CL. These results contribute to CE baseline data while providing insights on the implementation of ultrasound diagnosis in the field, as recommended by the WHO for targeted control of echinococcosis by 2030.

TI  - Physical culture in the context of modern philosophical anthropology
T2  - PEDAGOGY OF PHYSICAL CULTURE AND SPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Study Aim Background and study aim. Prerequisites and purpose of the study. Today, philosophical Aim anthropology (in the context of physical culture) occupies an intermediate place between the biological sciences and existential philosophy, elements of which it uses to explain the problems of physical existence. In the deep spheres of the physical state of a man (in the continuum of his/her spiritual-moral, physical, subconscious-rational, irrational and anthrobiological subjectivity) one can find the true foundations of personal physical culture and give them an immanent-subjective expression of human strength (as a creator of culture globalized world). The purpose of the study is to characterize the physical culture of the individual in the context of philosophical anthropology.Material and Methods Material and methods. Sources of information were the authoritative database Web of Science Core Collection, Vernadskyi National Library of Ukraine. Extraction of data from documents was carried out by means of a search query. In total, data on 102 documents containing such keywords as philosophy, anthropology, physical culture, sport were removed from the Web of Science Core Collection. Accordingly, 18 documents were found in the catalogues of the Vernadskyi National Library of Ukraine. Further analysis was performed with these 120 documents. The results of the search query were recorded in the form of tables and a special text file, which was processed in VOSviewer. The requirements of dialectical logic, comparative method, method of phenomenological reduction, hermeneutic methods are chosen by research methods.Results Results. The most significant and popular thematic categories, journals, authors, articles, keywords are identified. The connection between the elements of bibliographic description of articles and individual groups of publications has been established. It is established that from the second quarter of the XX century among philosophers there is opposition to the understanding of human nature on the basis of the acceptance of some one of its essence (spiritual, physical, intellectual, emotional and volitional, etc.), which determines the existence of any person. This was a denial of the approach to a man, which was called essential (from the Latin essentia - essence). The result of this transformation was to establish an existential understanding of a man (from the Latin existentia - existence). However, a self-contained existential approach is capable of producing a worldview distortion of personal physical culture, especially in conditions of restriction of freedom (for example, during a pandemic, war). Therefore, in modern philosophical anthropology it is necessary to adhere to a balanced combination of essential and existential understanding of a man in general and his/her physical culture in particular. In this way, philosophical anthropology is able to actualize various structures of worldview, including the values of physical culture.Conclusions Conclusions. From the point of view of modern philosophical anthropology, athletes, in the broadest sense of the term (all those who purposefully engage in physical and sports exercises), are carriers of a set of socio-cultural values (moral and volitional qualities, morpho-functional properties, psychophysical abilities, etc.). These values, in the context of the globalization of civilizational development and the main axiological concepts (quality and standard of living, social order, well-being), should be considered as a means of activating planetary socio-cultural development.

AB  - In this research the potential of the PRISMA hyperspectral sensor in comparison with multispectral data (Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI) was assessed for predicting soil moisture. To this aim, PRISMA, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 spectra, resampled according to the spectral bands of each sensor, were simulated from a laboratory soil spectral library.The soil samples used to create the spectral library were collected from different agricultural areas in Central and Southern Italy. Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), the Normalized Soil Moisture Index (NSMI) and the Soil Moisture Gaussian Model (SMGM) were employed to calibrate soil moisture (SM) estimation models from the resampled spectra. The prediction accuracy of SM estimation was assessed from statistical metrics.The best accuracies in retrieving SM were obtained by PLSR using data resampled at PRISMA spectral resolution. A preliminary test of the application of the calibrated models was carried out using real PRISMA and Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Questions of Ivan Cankar's World View in the FirstAssessments of Slovenian Literary Historians
T2  - BOGOSLOVNI VESTNIK-THEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY-EPHEMERIDES THEOLOGICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the assessment of Ivan Cankar's views in the first evaluations of his work by the Slovenian literary historians Ivan Grafenauer (1880-1964), Ivan Prijatelj (1875-1937), Alojz Kraigher (1877-1959), Izidor Cankar (1886-1958) and France Koblar (1889-1975). The aim of this article is to determine the aspects from which the aforementioned critics judge Cankar's aesthetic, artistic, life and world views, his view of Slovenian literature and lan-guage, and his view of the Slovenian nation and its history. In assessing Cankar's worldview, they focus on his literature in the various genres of poetry, prose, and drama, as well as his thought prose in the form of political articles, essays, published speeches, critiques, and polemics that respond to the current issues of his time. In assessing Cankar's worldview, the article does not proceed from philosophical definitions of the term "worldview" and related concepts, but rather focuses on the use of terminology by selected evaluators of Cankar's works. The article examines how selected critics assess Cankar's relationship to Christianity between doctrinal on the one hand and general moral laws on the other, the writer's committed attitude toward Slovenes, and his relationship to justice that transcends ideological or worldview concepts. The aim of the study is to cover the various aspects of Cankar's worldview as comprehensively as possible and thus to contribute to overcoming the contradictions, inconsistencies and divisions in the perception and interpretation of the writer's central works that have determined the past 100 years of reception from the perspective of Cankar's worldview.

TI  - Prevention of Secondary Lymphedema after Complete Lymph Node Dissection in Melanoma Patients: The Role of Preventive Multiple Lymphatic-Venous Anastomosis in Observational Era
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Current guidelines have limited the performance of complete lymph node dissection (CLND) for patients with clinically detectable lymphatic metastases. Despite the limitations of this surgical procedure, secondary lymphedema (SL) is an unsolved problem that affects approximately 20% of patients undergoing CLND. Preventive lymphatic-venous micro-anastomoses (PMLVA) has already demonstrated its efficacy in the prevention of SL in melanoma patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), but the efficacy of this procedure is not demonstrated in patients with clinically detectable lymphatic metastases. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study, was performed in two observation periods. Until March 2018, CLND was proposed to all subjects with positive-SLNB andPMLVA was performed in a subgroup of patients with risk factors for SL (Group 1). From April 2018, according to the modification of melanoma guidelines, all patients with detectable metastatic lymph nodes underwent PMLVA during CLND (Group 2). The frequency of lymphedema in subjects undergoing PMLVA was compared with the control group. Results: Database evaluation revealed 172 patients with melanoma of the trunk with follow-up information for at least 6 mounts. Twenty-three patients underwent PMLVA during CLND until March 2018, 29 from April 2018, and 120 subjects underwent CLND without any preventive surgery (control Group). The frequency of SL was significantly lower in both Group 1 (4.3% vs. 24.2%, p = 0.03) and Group 2 (3.5%, p = 0.01). Patients undergoing PMLVA showed a similar recurrence-free periods and overall survival when compared to the control group. Conclusions: PMLVA significantly reduces the frequency of SL both in immediate and delayed CLND. This procedure is safe and does not lead to an increase in length of hospitalization.

TI  - Sentimag® Technique for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients: Evaluation of Effectiveness, Feasibility and Challenges
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The gold standard technique of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) is the dual technique of radioactive tracer with blue dye. The aim of this study was to assess the node identification rate and feasibility in terms of ease of use of this technique for SLNB in breast cancer patients.Methods: Retrospectively collected data of 143 breast cancer patients with clinically and radiologically negative axilla were analysed. SLNB procedures were performed using the superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. Sentinel lymph nodes were identified using the Sentimag (R) magnetometer and visual aid.Results A total of 146 SLNB procedures were undertaken on 143 patients. Lymph node identification rate (IR) was 97.9%. Thirty seven patients (25.3%) were detected with cancer in their lymph nodes, 19% had at least one macrometastasis, 6% at least one micrometastasis and 1% had ITCs. The mean average lymph node retrieval was 2.2 nodes per procedure. Mild brownish discolouration was noted around the injection site. No allergic reaction or side effect of Sienna+(R) tracer / Magtrace (R) was reported.Conclusion: The new magnetic detection method of sentinel lymph nodes (Sentimag (R)) is effective, feasible and comparable to the gold standard technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with breast cancer.

TI  - A Combined Nomogram Model to Preoperatively Predict Positive Sentinel Lymph Biopsy for Breast Cancer In Iranian Population
T2  - ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary dissection in breast cancer provides useful information on the degree of axillary nodule involvement, which serves as a reliable indicator for the prognosis and staging of breast cancer in patients. The aim of this study was to develop and validate the nomogram model by combining prognostic factors and clinical features to predict the node status of preoperative breast guard positive node cancer. Materials and Methods: Subjects consisted of patients referring to hospitals with the diagnosis of breast cancer. Patients were allowed to substitute molecular subtypes with data on breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis as well as sentinel node status. The bootstrap review was used for internal validation. The predicted performance was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. According to the logistic regression analysis, the nomograms reported material strength between predictors and final status reliability. Results: 1172 patients participated in the study, of whom only 539 patients had axillary lymph node involvement. The subtype, family history, calcification, and necrosis were not significantly related to axillary lymph node involvement. Tumor size, histological type, and lymphovascular invasion in multivariate logistic regression were significantly and directly correlated with axillary lymph node involvement. Conclusion: Nomograms, depending on the population, help make decisions to prevent axillary surgery. It seems that the prediction model presented in this study, based on the results of the neuromography, can help surgeons make a more informed decision on underarm surgery. Moreover, in some cases, their surgical program will be informed by accurate medical care and preclusion of major surgeries such as ALND.

TI  - A Theoretical Analysis of Granulometry-Based Roughness Measures on Cartosat DEMs
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of water bodies such as rivers is an important problem in the remote sensing community. A meaningful set of quantitative features reflecting the geophysical properties help us better understand the formation and evolution of rivers. Typically, river sub-basins are analyzed using Cartosat Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), obtained at regular time epochs. One of the useful geophysical features of a river sub-basin is that of a roughness measure on DEMs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not much literature available on theoretical analysis of roughness measures. In this article, we revisit the roughness measure on DEM data adapted from multiscale granulometries in mathematical morphology, namely multiscale directional granulometric index (MDGI). This measure was classically used to obtain shape-size analysis in grayscale images. In earlier works, MDGIs were introduced to capture the characteristic surficial roughness of a river sub-basin along specific directions. Also, MDGIs can be efficiently computed and are known to be useful features for classification of river sub-basins. In this article, we ask the question when does a MDGI fail to classify distinct DEMs? We provide a theoretical analysis of a MDGI to answer this question. In particular, we identify nonrivial sufficient conditions on the structure of DEMs under which MDGIs cannot distinguish between distinct DEMs. These properties are illustrated with some fictitious DEMs. We also provide connections to a discrete derivative of volume of a DEM. Based on these connections, we provide intuition as to why a MDGI is considered a roughness measure. We empirically verify that MGDIs capture the topographical characteristics using the Lower-Indus, Wardha, and Barmer river sub-basins. We show that a simple decision tree based on MDGI features alone can successfully distinguish between sub-basins with a high accuracy. We obtain upto 94% accuracy while the baseline of random classifier is around 33.34%.

TI  - The Private Impact of Public Data: Landsat Satellite Maps Increased Gold Discoveries and Encouraged Entry
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - How does public data shape the relative performance of incumbents and entrants in the private sector? Using a simple theoretical framework, I argue that public data reduces investment uncertainty, facilitates the discovery of new market opportunities, and increases the relative market share of new entrants relative to incumbents. I shed light on these predictions by estimating the impact of public data from Landsat, a U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite mapping program, on the discovery rates of new deposits by incumbents (seniors) and entrants (juniors) in the gold exploration industry. I exploit idiosyncratic timing variation and cloud cover in Landsat coverage across regions to identify the causal effect of public data on the patterns of gold discovery. I find that Landsat data nearly doubled the rate of significant gold discoveries after a region was mapped and increased the market share of new entrants from about 10% to 25%. Public data seem to play an important, yet relatively underexplored, role in driving performance differences across firms.

AB  - Comprehensive Ice velocity observations are essential for estimating ice sheet discharge and mass balance and are key input for modelling ice dynamic processes in response to climate warming. Based on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery we generate high-resolution ice velocity maps at 50 m posting over the ice sheets by combining SAR interferometry (InSAR) and offset-tracking (OT). The InSAR method provides improved accuracy particularly in the slow-moving interior of the ice sheets at higher resolution but requires crossing satellite acquisitions as well as image pairs with adequate coherence. On zones without crossing orbits our processing line uses the velocity vector derived from INSAR and flow direction from OT to optimally fill in gaps. Fast moving areas where coherence is not preserved are filled with OT velocity observations. The added value of the new ice velocity maps is assessed by intercomparison with operational ice velocity products and in-situ GPS data. Significant improvement compared to current products are achieved in interior parts of the ice sheets, for example helping to better constrain boundaries between ice drainage basins.

TI  - Generative Feature Extraction From Sentinel 1 and 2 Data for Prediction of Forest Aboveground Biomass in the Italian Alps
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important forest attribute directly linked to the forest carbon pool. The use of satellite remote sensing (RS) data has increased for AGB prediction due to their large footprint and low-cost availability. However, they have been limited due to saturation effect that leads to low prediction precision. In this article, we propose an innovative and dynamic architecture based on generative neural network that extracts target oriented generative features for predicting forest AGB using satellite RS data. These features are more resilient to mixed forest types and geographical conditions as compared to the traditional features and models. The effectiveness of the proposed features was assessed by experiments performed using multispectral, synthetic aperture radar, and combined dual-source datasets. The proposed model achieved best performance in terms of precision, model agreement, and overfitting as compared to the other conventional models for all analyzed datasets. The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding scatterplots of the generative features clearly show one dimension of the feature space associated with the target AGB. Feature importance analysis indicated that the produced generative features were more significant than the conventional analytical features. Also, the model provided a robust framework for homogeneous fusion of multisensor features from satellite RS data for predicting AGB.

TI  - Validation for Ice Flow Velocity Variations of Shirase Glacier Derived From PALSAR-2 Offset Tracking
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have shown that the flow velocity of Shirase Glacier can be estimated by applying the offset tracking method to the amplitude images derived from the phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar type-2 (PALSAR-2) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2. Although the offset tracking is widely used, the method is sometimes not applicable effectively and the reason is not always clear. Here, we consider a possibility of ionospheric contamination and show the validation results of the estimated flow velocity applied the offset tracking method to the PALSAR-2 data, based on in-situ measurement of the flow velocity from the GNSS receiver on the autonomous phase-sensitive radio echo sounder simultaneously with the PALSAR-2 observation. As a result, the ionospheric contamination can yield a spurious error of +/- 0.2 km a(-1). After statistically removing the erroneous pairs, the RMSE was 0.049 km a(-1) derived from the flow velocity error between the in-situ measurement results and estimated from satellite, and the estimated flow velocity obtained using PALSAR-2 data is proved to be in good agreement with the ground truth. Obtained spatial and temporal variations reveal signature of glacier dynamics, which prove the efficacy of the offset tracking method. The obtained ice-flow velocity increases rapidly from the upstream region to the coast, but its velocity is roughly constant over a region, 10-km long about the grounding line (GL), then gradually tends to increase again downstream from the GL. This trend has continued largely unchanged over24 years since 1996.

T2  - THE STUDY OF CALLIGRAPHY
T2  - 서예학연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - Park Jega was a scholar and thinker active in the late 18th century of the Joseon Dynasty. Although he never presented a precise painting theory, he said that he has been a painting enthusiast since childhood and continued to enjoy painting even after he grew up. Thus, in this paper, I analyzed his view of the painting by investigating his preface, postscript, and inscribed poem of painting.I briefly summarized Park Jega's view of painting to empty the mind and cultivate nature as follows. First, I analyzed the aspect that he emphasized the form of spirit as an image beyond the image from the stance of focusing on the rhythm of spirit. As a result, Park Jega actively affirmed the value of calligraphy and painting by applying the theory that the boundary of poetry is mutually compatible with that of painting to the creation of calligraphy and painting. He embodied the natural painting will that exudes the spiritual taste of literati painting. Also, he realized the world of describing the thinking while faithfully possessing the formative beauty of resembling the form. Thus, he was faithful to the rhythm of spirit that expresses the image beyond the image. Second, I examined the fact that he created the vitality of the natural taste of nature in terms of the natural spirit. As a result, the emptiness to empty the mind is a premise that can achieve aesthetic communion with external objects and was also related to Park Jega’s open thinking. Since people already have preconceived notions, they should empty their minds before painting. Park Jega called that prejudice Gakmak(角膜). He said people must first remove the Gakmak that blocks them from recognizing beauty as beauty. In short, Park Jega insisted on discarding stereotypes and closely observing objects because people can create a good painting only in an unintentional state to obtain the form of the spirit.We cannot fully comprehend Park Jega's view of painting through the above discussion. It is necessary to have a broad understanding of his worldview and an integrated discussion of his poetry, calligraphy, and painting to understand his view of painting more in-depth.

AB  - Leopoldo Maria Panero came to be known in 1970 for his inclusion in Jose Maria Castellet’s anthology Nueve novisimos poetas espanoles. In his first collection of poems, Asi se fundo Carnaby Street, Panero built a universe full of cultural references deriving from both pop culture and high culture. Additionally, in those poems, it is possible to find certain tender and naive sensibility typical of childhood which the author seems to long for. However, from his second collection of poems, Panero’s poetry comes to reveal a discouraging and bleak vision of the world. The world is portrayed as a deserted cruel ghostly place in which the poet feels like an abandoned child. His verses are filled with all sorts of actions which go against accepted morals and customs such as homosexuality, violence, incest, etc. On the other hand, his poems are sprinkled with words considered clearly inappropriate for lyrical poetry such as “pedo”, “mierda”, “excremento”, “culo”, “ano”, “falo”, “vagina”, “cagar”, “masturbarse”, “copula”, “necrofilia”, “semen”, etc. His father, Leopoldo Panero, who was defined by Damaso Alonso as a “poeta arraigado”, was the official poet laureate of the Francoism, as he came to support the National-Catholic ideology of the Francoist regime portraying it in his works as a guarantor of harmony and peace. Leopoldo Maria Panero’s poetry constitutes a sharp contrast with the utopic worldview of his father, as what we find there is a discouraging dystopia. Undoubtedly, this change was possible due to the sociopolitical shift which Spain went through in the latter half of the 20th century.

AB  - Geugyesuryeonguhoe performed <The Gaol Gate> in 1932, and <Tomag (ghetto)> in 1933 the following year. <The Gaol Gate> is an Irish play created by Mrs. Gregory (lsabella Augusta Gregory), and <Tomag(ghetto)> is a play by You Chijin, also the first original play performed at Geugyesuryeonguhoe. Research on <Tomag(ghetto)> was actively conducted, but there was no access to <The Gaol Gate> as a work that had an influence on <Tomag(ghetto)>. However, the two works were clearly defended and selected by Geugyesuryeonguhoe, and in the process they secured the same motif and theme. In particular, the sorrow of the family, who has to confirm the death of the head of the household and erase the sorrow, confirms the fact that the two works have the same creative intention. In the end, <The Gaol Gate> and <Tomag(ghetto)> are works that show the people degenerating into scapegoats, the power to oppress the people, the agents of that power, and the spiritual awakening to commit to the necessity and practice of reform. To this end, it should be said that the worldview that the two works are aiming for also has a wide shared area in that they theatrically express the darkness of the times and use the light that opposes the darkness in common. Based on these characteristics, this study intends to compare and examine the motifs and images, characters and materials, subject consciousness and creative intentions of the two plays.

AB  - When detecting targets of interest in satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, clustering is often required to construct the candidate pixels of an object. In this paper, we propose a new feature using principal component analysis to address the problem of dense targets that cause performance degradation when using the density-based spatial clustering of noise algorithm, which is suitable for the clustering process. Further, simulations are used to analyze the proposed features for different target and clutter clusters extracted from real TerraSAR-X (TSX) images, and the proposed dense target discrimination technique is applied to the TSX images. The simulation results reveal that the proposed feature is effective in distinguishing clusters composed of dense targets, and the target detection performance can be improved by re-separating dense target clusters from actual SAR images.

TI  - Graph-Based Classification and Urban Modeling of Laser Scanning and Imagery: Toward 3D Smart Web Services
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, remotely sensed data obtained via laser technology has gained great importance due to its wide use in several fields, especially in 3D urban modeling. In fact, 3D city models in urban environments are efficiently employed in many fields, such as military operations, emergency management, building and height mapping, cadastral data upgrading, monitoring of changes as well as virtual reality. These applications are essentially composed of models of structures, urban elements, ground surface and vegetation. This paper presents a workflow for modeling the structure of buildings by using laser-scanned data (LiDAR) and multi-spectral images in order to develop a 3D web service for a smart city concept. Optical vertical photography is generally utilized to extract building class, while LiDAR data is used as a source of information to create the structure of the 3D building. The building reconstruction process presented in this study can be divided into four main stages: building LiDAR points extraction, piecewise horizontal roof clustering, boundaries extraction and 3D geometric modeling. Finally, an architecture for a 3D smart service based on the CityGML interchange format is proposed.

TI  - Observational evidence on the coastal upwelling along the northwest coast of India during summer monsoon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The lesser known coastal upwelling in the North Eastern Arabian Sea (NEAS) during summer monsoon, its associated dynamics and forcing mechanisms is elucidated for the first time using basin scale monthly time-series in-situ and satellite data. The presence of cool upwelled waters along northwest coast of India from July to early October with an associated increase in productivity was evident in both data. The low level Findlater jet blows towards west coast of India with high wind magnitude (10-12 m/s) during summer monsoon generates strong Ekman transport (1416 kg/m/s) at offshore and Ekman pumping velocity (1.349 m/s) at coastal region initiates upwelling. It was identified that the currents and remote forcing also regulate upwelling along the region. Although upwelling seems to exist along the northwest coast, it was weaker (25.5 degrees C) compared to the southwest coast where the SST dropped to 24 degrees C. The upwelling was observed in the south during June as a surface process, while it was observed along the northwest coast of India by the end of August. Even though the onset of upwelling in the NEAS and South Eastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) had a lag of two months, the recession of upwelling happened during late and early September respectively. The cause for the lag in the onset and cessation of upwelling between SEAS and NEAS is attributed to the propagation of Kelvin waves and southwest monsoon winds. The study also reveals that temperature and chlorophyll profiles show bi-modal peaks of high and low associated with winter cooling (winter) and upwelling (summer).

TI  - Seasonal and Long-Term Clarity Trend Assessment of Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada.
T2  - U S Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report
M3  - Article
AB  - The clarity of Lake Tahoe, observed using a Secchi disk on a regular basis since the late 1960s, continues to be a sentinel metric of lake health. Water clarity is influenced by physical and biological processes and has declined in the five decades of monitoring, revealing differences between summer (June-September) and winter (December-March). This document summarizes key findings of a study of Lake Tahoe water clarity, including long-term variability and the relative importance of several influencing variables and processes. This study, prepared in cooperation with the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, focused on (1) an apparent divergence in clarity trends between summer and winter periods, (2) observed changes in in-lake physical and ecological variables that may influence or control seasonal and annual clarity trends, and (3) five research hypotheses regarding lake clarity that were developed by Lake Tahoe management agencies. Previously collected data were used to complete this study. Trend analysis confirmed that winter clarity stabilized (that is, there is no longer a statistically significant trend up or down) during the last 20 years. Evaluation of clarity for selected months in the 50-year Secchi disk clarity dataset showed that only two summer months, July and August, had statistically significant decreases in clarity from 2000-19. Different subsets of available data were analyzed to reveal the presence or absences of trends for each season, decade, and month. Five hypotheses related to lake clarity were part of the study described by this report. Hypothesis 1 stated that clarity is controlled predominantly by the distribution and volumetric density of fine particles in suspension. This hypothesis was studied using available data describing in-lake fine (0-20 micrometers) particles from 2008-19. Water clarity was negatively correlated with in-lake particle abundance, with particles in the 1.0-4.6 [mu]m range having the greatest effect, consistent with light-scattering theory. Estimated abundances of diatoms of the genus Cyclotella also were found to be negatively correlated with clarity. Data limitations precluded a complete investigation of hypothesis 2, which stated that the observed improvements in winter water clarity are a response to decreasing fine suspended-sediment concentrations in the lake resulting from load reductions from upland sources in and near urbanized areas. Data describing fine-sediment loading from urban areas to the lake were only available since 2014, and only once or twice per month. A slight, statistically significant, negative correlation was identified between urban fine-particle loading and monthly lake clarity with a 4-month lag. Particle abundance in monitored streams is highly correlated with simultaneous particle abundance in the lake. Hypothesis 3 stated that changing hydrodynamic conditions in the lake are increasing thermal stability and resistance to mixing. Trend analyses performed on stability index and buoyancy frequency time series computed from long-term observations of lake temperatures support the hypothesis that hydrodynamic conditions have evolved since 1969 to increase the lake's resistance to mixing. The date of maximum mixing in winter has become progressively earlier in the year. Lake density stratification, defined using the stability index, is commencing earlier in the year and extending a month longer than in the early years of the monitoring program. Hypothesis 4 stated that the trend of decreasing summer clarity is a result of earlier, prolonged, and more intense stratification. Statistically significant correlations were found between summer clarity and (1) date of onset of stratification, (2) duration of stratification, and (3) buoyancy frequency. Hypothesis 5 stated that ecological (food web) interactions are causing changes in the trends of seasonal or annual clarity; data supporting hypothesis 5 were limited to examples from other systems and to intermittent monitoring of Lake Tahoe and Emerald Bay. The resulting narrative assessment was motivated by a 6-year study of Mysis shrimp disappearance and return in Emerald Bay. The available data and a large body of published literature are consistent with the inference that Mysis shrimp-induced food web changes are causing changes in the trends of seasonal or annual clarity. This food-web study focused on the relations between introduced Mysis shrimp, the native cladocerans (Daphnia and Bosmina) that were largely eliminated following Mysis introduction, and the effect on fine particles within the lake. The records of Mysis and other zooplankton data for Lake Tahoe are episodic and have large gaps. Consequently, statistical analyses could not be conducted to compare zooplankton data with other variables. The long-term record, however, indicates that the key effect was a change to the phytoplankton assemblage, where larger diatoms disappeared, likely due to Mysis grazing, only to be replaced by Cyclotella that are an order-of-magnitude smaller and have increased the abundance and volumetric density of total fine particles in suspension (biotic and abiotic).

AB  - With advances in remote sensing sensors and methods, numerous studies have showcased the algorithmic approach to monitoring and maximizing the potential of farmland. Of specific interest are applications that are tuned for applications at smaller scale such as the field parcel. In Finland, farmers are typically faced with both problems of water stress - excess and deficiency - at different stages of the season. In absence of widespread adoption of irrigation systems, improving the understanding of a fields behaviour with regards to water is important. In this study we test a simple and functional work-flow to identify zones within a field that exhibit stable and volatile characteristics during a growing season with respect to the crop moisture index, with an emphasis on using open data.

AB  - Urban Heat Islands (UM) phenomenon is a pressing problem for highly industrialized areas with serious risks for public health. Weather stations guarantee long-term accurate observations of weather parameters, such Air Temperature (AT), but lack appropriate spatial coverage. Numerous studies have argued that satellite Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a relevant parameter for estimating AT maps, exploring both linear regression and Machine Learning algorithms. This study proposes a Neural Network (NN) regression model for estimating the maximum AT from Landsat-8 data. The approach has been tested in a variegated morphological region (Puglia, Italy) using a large stack of data acquired from 2018 to 2020. The algorithm uses the median values of LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computed using different buffer radius around the location of each reference weather station (250 m, 1000 m, and 2000 m) to train the NN model with a K-fold cross-validation strategy. The reference dataset was split into three sets using a stratified sampling approach considering the different station categories: rural, High- and Low-density Urban areas respectively. The algorithm was tested with different learning rates (LR) (0.001 and 0.005). The results show that our NN model accuracy improves with the increase of the buffer radius, minimizing the difference in terms of R boolean AND 2 between training and evaluation data, with an overall accuracy consistently higher than 0.84. Future research could investigate more input variables in the NN model such as morphology or climate variables and test the algorithm on larger areas.

AB  - In the planetary sciences, the amount of remote sensing data and derived research products has been continuously increasing over the last few decades. The amount and complexity of the data require growing sophistication in data analysis, data management and data provision targeted at a wider research community.Here we present a prototype for structured storage and visualization of planetary data based on technology originally developed for Earth-based applications. This includes a centralized system for storing scientific findings and data products in order to efficiently manage, cross-link and enhance visibility of data products, including interim findings and source code. The aim here is to facilitate transparent management and re-use of research data and scientific results for long-term access and sustainable research data management.

TI  - Mapping deep percolation using remote sensing over an irrigated area in the Haouz plain (Marrakech, Morocco)
T2  - IX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON IRRIGATION OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops
CL  - Univ Basilicata, Matera, ITALY
AB  - This study aims to estimate the spatial deep percolation (DP) by combining remote sensing data and SAMIR (SAtellite Monitoring of IRrigation) tool. In this study, DP was derived as the residual component of water balance in the root zone. The Indirect computation of water balance requires climate data (reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and rainfall), land cover, crop coefficient derived from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and hydrodynamic soil parameters like soil moisture at field capacity and the wilting point. The main water balance component is evapotranspiration. It is spatialized based on the FAO-56 approach and the relationship between crop coefficient and NDVI. This approach was tested over an irrigated area in the Haouz plain during the agricultural period (2011-2012). The results showed that DP followed water supply fluctuations (sum of rainfall and irrigation provided by the manager, ORMVAH). High DP values are observed during heavy rainfall in March (around 36, 27, and 20 mm) for sugar beet, wheat, and olive trees, respectively. However, from April to June, the vegetation cover was exposed to high water stress for the rest of the season mainly due to the mismatch of water supply.

AB  - The issue of mastery of the ingest system is important because ingest cards are a "key component" that is not traded except in one system package. Therefore, through mastery of this component, changes in data transmission rate will be followed continuously as long as the COTS component is available. Currently, a satellite data transmission system is in progress from band L to band X, which has an impact on increasing the data transmission rate from 1 to 6 Mbps to 15 to 80 Mbps. To overcome these problems, an intermediate technology was developed by designing an ingest system based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) supported by several modular boards and can be reconfigure to get higher capability/speed. The FPGA board functions to receive data and clock streams of the NOAA-19 satellite from the demodulator serially and forward it to the personal computer (PC) via a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) output unit. The output of this ingest system design is a RAW data file to be further processed into level-0 products by PC Ingest. Implementing the ingest system is expected to reduce the dependence on purchasing commercial ingest cards.

AB  - The salt content of an agricultural field depends on the soil salinity and measuring its value precisely becomes essential. The dynamic changes of the factors are monitored using satellite data. This paper aims at estimating the value of soil pH based on the satellite data and the laboratory test results of pH values. Soil pH and salinity indices estimated from the satellite data has high correlation. A regression analysis is performed to explore the relationship between the salinity indices and the soil pH values over a study area. Salinity indices better represents the salt composition in the soil which is produced by reaction between the acidity and alkalinity as a chemical process. Based on the regression model the current soil pH value can be estimated with reference to the satellite data.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study first time identified and analyzed winter season agricultural crop patterns (ACP) derived from Land use (LU) maps in between 2010 to 2019 of south-eastern regions of Chittagong, Bangladesh. ACP identification was a challenging task in the worldwide research relevant to crop-related studies. To overcome this, we have considered frequently used traditional unsupervised classifier, such as K-means clustering algorithm technique. This has been applied on 30m pixel Landsat satellite reflectance images to identify crop pattern of the study area using the ENVI 5.3 and ArcGIS 10.8 software's, respectively. Multiple crops with seven classes were identified with the validation of in-situ ground-truth data and Google Earth (GE) images. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values were found at 81.96% and 0.79, respectively. The results suggest a significant variation of crop patterns in the study area and in recent time, the area largely dependent on mixed irrigation approach. Moreover, the crop pattern change was observed in the studied period as mixed crop 19% (9282.17 ha), Lentils (Pelon) 24.80% (11594.38 ha), Melon (Bangi) 22.37% (10461.08 ha), Chilis 17.90% (8367.48 ha), Paddy rice, unused land, and other crops, respectively. Among them, Lentils (Pelon) and Melon (Bangi) are identified as two common crops followed by mixed crops category, cultivated in the winter season as it required less irrigation compared to paddy rice area.

TI  - Dynamic Relationship Study between the Observed Seismicity and Spatiotemporal Pattern of Lineament Changes in Palghar, North Maharashtra (India)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Palghar region (north Maharashtra, India), located in the northwestern part of the stable continental region of India, experienced a low magnitude earthquake swarm, which was initiated in September 2018 and is continuing to date (as of October 2021). From December 2018 to December 2020, ~5000 earthquakes with magnitudes from M1.2 to M3.8 occurred in a small region of 20 x 10 km(2). These earthquakes were probably triggered by fluid migration during seasonal rainfall. In this study, we have used multi-temporal Landsat satellite data of the year 2000, 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2020, extracted lineaments, and studied the changes in frequency and pattern of lineaments before and after the initiation of the swarm in the Palghar region. An increase in the lineament density and amount of rainfall are found to be associated with the increasing frequency of earthquakes.

T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ULTRASONICS SYMPOSIUM (IEEE IUS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)
CL  - Venice, ITALY
AB  - This paper describes a method of optimization of Laterally Excited Bulk Acoustic Resonators (so-called XBARs) for single-mode performance and suppression of spurious modes. The method is based on analysis of the bulk acoustic wave (BAW) slowness surface. Optimization of plate thickness results in the transformation of a plate mode into BAW, which is efficiently reflected between the top and bottom of a plate and does not couple with spurious modes. The method was verified by its application to a few orientations of LJNbO(3) close to ZY cut. The resonant frequencies of BAW modes extracted from admittance functions agree with the tangential velocities obtained from the analysis of the slowness surface The simulated admittances of XBARs with optimal plate thicknesses demonstrate low spurious modes achieved for each orientation and perfect wave structure at resonance and anti-resonance. Spurious modes grow with a deviation of plate thicknesses from the found optimal values.

The method is based on an analysis of the slowness surface of bulk acoustic waves propagating in the material of a thin plate. It was verified by application to XBARs based on different LT orientations close to the ZY cut. The simulated admittance functions confirmed low spurious modes in devices with optimized plate thickness and degradation of resonator performance with a deviation of a plate thickness from the optimal value. Analysis of the wave structure revealed its strong dependence on the plate thickness and the ratio between two components of mechanical displacement in a thin plate.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based approach, which exploits multispectral Sentinel-2 open-source data and a small-size inventory to map artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). The study area is in central northern Burkina Faso (Africa) and is characterized by a semi-desert environment that makes mapping challenging. In sub-Saharan Africa, ASM represents a source of subsistence for a significant number of individuals. However, because ASM are often illegal and uncontrolled, the materials employed in the excavation process are highly dangerous for the environment as well as for the lives of the people involved in the mining activities. One of the most important aspects regarding ASM is the record of their spatial location, which, at the moment, is missing in most of the African regions. The performance evaluation of two state-of-the-art DL architectures [U-Net and attention deep supervised multiscale U-Net (ADSMS U-Net)] is provided, along with an in-depth analysis of the predictions when dealing with both dry and rainy seasons. The ADSMS U-Net architecture yields generally more accurate predictions than the basic U-Net allowing us to better discriminate ASM in such an environment. The findings show that the proposed approach can detect ASM in semi-desertic areas starting with a few samples at a low cost in terms of both human and financial resources.

TI  - Improving Landslide Detection on SAR Data Through Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we use deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to compare the landslide mapping and classification performances of optical images (from Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images (from Sentinel-1). The training, validation, and test zones used to independently evaluate the performance of the CNN on different datasets are located in the eastern Iburi subprefecture in Hokkaido, where, at 03.08 local time (JST) on September 6, 2018, an Mw 6.6 earthquake triggered about 8000 coseismic landslides. We analyzed the conditions before and after the earthquake exploiting multipolarization SAR as well as optical data by means of a CNN implemented in TensorFlow that points out the locations where the landslide class is predicted as more likely. As expected, the CNN runs on optical images proved itself excellent for the landslide detection task, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.96%, while CNNs based on the combination of ground range detected (GRD) SAR data reached overall accuracies beyond 95%. Our findings show that the integrated use of SAR data may also allow for rapid detection even during storms and under dense cloud cover and provides comparable accuracy to classical optical change detection in landslide recognition and detection.

AB  - This work aims to carry out an analysis of the theme "Cai Cai Vilu" by Victor Jara, from both its poietic and cultural aspects. To achieve this, the concept of wild thought by Levi-Strauss and the application that Maria Ester Grebe made of it when analyzing dualism in Mapuche culture is established as a reference framework. An important goal will be to determine how, Jara uses and puts the musical and cultural materials at the time of creation of this piece into play, and what is its relationship with the social context of the time.

TI  - How accurate is the remote sensing based estimate of water physico-chemical parameters in the Danube Delta (Romania)?
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The current paper estimated the physico-chemical properties of water in the Danube Delta (Romania), based on Sentinel 2 remote sensing data. Eleven sites from the Danube Delta were sampled in spring and autumn for three years (2018-2020) and 21 water physico-chemical parameters were measured in laboratory. Several families of machine learning algorithms, translated into hundreds of models with different parameterizations for each machine learning algorithm, based on remote sensing data input from Sentinel 2 spectral bands, were employed to find the best models that predicted the values measured in laboratory. This was a novel approach, reflected in the types of selected models that minimised the values of performance metrics for the tested parameters. For alkalinity, calcium, chloride, carbon dioxide, hardness, potassium, sodium, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, sulphates, and suspended matter the results were promising, with an overall percentage bias of the estimates of +/- 10% from the observed values. For copper, magnesium, nitrites, nitrates, turbidity and zinc the estimates were fairly accurate, with percentage biases in the interval +/- 10% - 20%, whereas for detergents, led, and phosphates the percentage bias was higher than 20%. Overall, the results of the current study showed fairly good estimates between remote sensing based estimates and laboratory measured values for most water physico-chemical parameters.

TI  - PILOT MONITORING SERVICE FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE BASED ON SATELLITE DATA AND PRODUCTS
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES E-LAND RECLAMATION EARTH OBSERVATION & SURVEYING ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of Earth Observation (EO) data for cultural heritage documentation and systematic monitoring is currently widely recognized. Considering the large spectrum of threats and the high importance of safeguarding, cultural heritage requires sustained monitoring that can efficiently be done based on a combination of satellite images having adequate spatial, spectral and temporal resolution, in-situ data and a broad-spectrum of ancillary data such as historical maps, digital elevation models and local knowledge. The present study showcases the features of a pilot cultural heritage monitoring service that was developed for several Romanian representative sites such as the Castle of Hunedoara, the Palace of Magna Curia, the Medieval Ensemble of Deva Fortress, the Alba Carolina Citadel, the archaeological sites of Micia and Germisara, etc., but can be upscaled at national or regional level. The monitoring service is composed of a Results Platform (based on open-source GeoServer and OpenLayers) and a near-real time Monitoring Platform (cloud computing through Google Earth Engine). The products that are ingested in the first platform are obtained using an approach tailored for each property type. Examples include old cartographic maps, historical satellite images, remote sensing radiometric indices, Copernicus products, displacement maps and many others. The products that are continuously generated within the second platform enable the early identification and assessment of natural and anthropogenic risks, thus representing a key element for cultural heritage protection. The pilot monitoring service was developed considering the requirements of the cultural heritage authorities that are administrating the above-mentioned sites, representing a reliable source of unparalleled knowledge regarding the potential threats and degradation risks.

TI  - Estimating Bare Earth in Sparse Boreal Forests With WorldView Stereo Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Circumboreal forests are currently experiencing rapid climate warming which is altering their structure, productivity, and status as a carbon sink. Very high-resolution (VHR; < 2 m) stereo-derived digital surface models are available to monitor these forests, but a similar resolution digital terrain model (DTM) is required to extract information about tree height, which is often used to estimate carbon content. To the best of our knowledge, no openly available VHR DTM currently exists. To address this need, we developed approaches to extract DTMs by filtering VHR stereo point clouds (PCs) in sparse canopies of Alaska. Our evaluation consisted of two stereo processing methods with three PC search radii at six different tree canopy cover (TCC) intervals. We found that VHR DTMs were robust for estimating bare ground at TCC intervals less than 40% with vertical errors < 1.6 m using airborne small footprint light detection and ranging (LiDAR) as reference.

TI  - Axiological dominants of paremies as typological markers in Russian, Tuvan and French ethnic cultures
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Making use of paremiological units in Tuvan linguistic culture, the article aims to examine the general hierarchy of axiological dominants of an ethnic culture. The outcomes of this examination are then compared with those previously obtained by the author through the analysis of Russian and French paremies. For its source materials, the study relies on published collections of Tuvan proverbs and sayings, as well as on the most authoritative paremiological dictionaries of Russian and French languages.In the methodological sense, the study is based upon the idea that the names and contents of thematic classes that objects within paremiological sources fall into correctly reflects the major qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the conceptual sphere and the subsystem of moral values within the ethnonational world picture that it corresponds to.The article proves that for all of the three ethnic cultures, there are common axiological dominants of typological importance, such as family, 'work, 'friendship'or 'faith. Being universal in character, they, however, occupy different places in the hierarchy of moral values within each ethnic culture. 'Man' as an axiological domimant, for instance, is barely present in Tuvan culture, and only occasionally appears in Russian, while in French it has a dominant presence within thematic classes of paremies. This leads to a conclusion that ethnic cultures may have an individualist (e.g., French) or a collectivist (e.g., Tuvan or Russian) character. Another set feature of Tuvan ethnic culture is the dominant binomiality of 'people' and 'Motherland, thus revealing the highest importance these values occupy within the traditional worldview of Tuvans.

TI  - TV Series in China: The Origin and Development of the Genre (1950s-1990s)
T2  - NAUKA TELEVIDENIYA-THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TELEVISION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I analyze Chinese TV series as a phenomenon of mass culture; a market product created on the basis of a specific national cultural code under conditions of strict ideological control. The chronological framework of this study is the second half of the 20th century: from the late 1950s, when television appeared and the production of TV drama began in China, to the late 1990s, marked by the creation of a system of supervision and control of the television industry, the transformation of TV drama into a modern format television series, the formation of the major serial genres, and the growth of production and consumption of TV series. Since then, the trend that persists in the 2000s-watching a series as a widespread form of leisure-is becoming noticeable. I examine TV dramas as a product shaped by multidirectional influences. On the one hand, the television market demands that the product be spectacular and entertaining, while on the other hand, TV series are subject to close state control and regulation. The government issues licenses for TV series production, determines priority themes for new series annually, approves a brief synopsis prior to filming, censors the finished series; and establishes national television awards to stimulate the production of "correct content." The most popular genres in the last quarter of the twentieth century are historical, moral, family, and martial arts dramas. Considering that a series is a formulaic narrative (J. Cawelti), it is these genres that seem to have the maximum number of techniques and possibilities for combining an engaging plot and broadcasting the right message. For example, family, moral series demonstrate socially approved norms of behavior. The wuxia genre represents the uniqueness of Chinese culture and creates a sense of Chineseness. Given the general attitude to history in the Chinese tradition, it is not surprising that historical series occupy a special position, being one of the most important means for the state propagation of the "etatist and paternalistic worldview." The analyzed historical and cultural material leads me to the conclusion that whatever the viewer watches-a series about the portal travelers or a screen version of the Chinese classics-their attention is offered ideologically safe product, checked by various authorities and spreading meanings that are useful for society and the state.

AB  - The growing abundance of digitally available spatial, geological, and climatological data opens up new opportunities for agricultural data-based input-output modeling. In our study, we took a convolutional neural network model previously developed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) image data only and set out to see whether additional inputs from multiple sources would improve the performance of the model. Using the model developed in a preceding study, we fed field-specific data from the following sources: near-infrared data from UAV overflights, Sentinel-2 multispectral data, weather data from locally installed Vantage Pro weather stations, topographical maps from National Land Survey of Finland, soil samplings, and soil conductivity data gathered with a Veris MSP3 soil conductivity probe. Either directly added or encoded as additional layers to the input data, we concluded that additional data helps the spatial point-in-time model learn better features, producing better fit models in the task of yield prediction. With data of four fields, the most significant performance improvements came from using all input data sources. We point out, however, that combining data of various spatial or temporal resolution (i.e., weather data, soil data, and weekly acquired images, for example) might cause data leakage between the training and testing data sets when training the CNNs and, therefore, the improvement rate of adding additional data layers should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Transcending the colonial worldview to establish a research paradigm through an African lens: Analysis of research modules in archives
T2  - EDUCATION FOR INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the emergence of postcolonialism, there has been a call for epistemic decolonisation in the African scientific community. Paradigmatic backgrounds are key to defining belief systems that guide research investigations - not only in choice of approach, but also in the contextualisation and execution of research designs. Researchers' limited understanding of these philosophical backgrounds and the way in which they can transcend towards decolonised research, inhibits researchers' exploration of the deeper meaning of and commitment to research in the postcolonial context. This paper aims at contextualising the decolonisation of Eurocentric paradigms towards the transcendence of a new worldview that is relevant and unique to the African context. This is done through the analysis of two research methodology modules in Archival Science at an open distance e-learning institution. The genesis of postcolonial research, which lies in replacing dominant "truths" with marginalised "truths", aims at rearticulating power, change and knowledge through a multiplicity of epistemologies, ontologies, and axiologies. By applying a postcolonial research paradigm, research can be used as a way of expanding knowledge and creating new knowledge as a starting point of epistemic decolonisation. This article contributes to the dismantling of the old order of research paradigms by exploring the transcendence of existing research paradigms and suggesting a research paradigm that provides a lens through which the postcolonial African scholar can conduct the search for truth in the field of Archival Science. However, it should be noted that, even in critical emancipation, there will still be elitism.

TI  - HIV-1 integrase resistance associated mutations and the use of dolutegravir in Sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - As sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries are transitioning to dolutegravir (DTG)-based ART, baseline data are required for optimal monitoring of therapeutic response. In this frame, we sought to generate up-to-date evidence on the use of integrase-strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) and associated drug resistance mutations (DRMs) within SSA. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included randomized and non-randomized trials, cohort-studies, cross-sectional studies, and case-reports published on INSTI or integrase DRMs in SSA. We included studies of patients exposed to DTG, raltegravir (RAL) or elvitegravir (EVG). Primary outcomes were "the rate of virological control (VC:<50copies/ml)" and "the presence of DRMs" on INSTI-based regimens among patients in SSA. We synthesised extracted data using subgroup analysis, and random effect models were used where appropriate. Additional analyses were conducted to assess study heterogeneity. We identified 1,916 articles/citations through database searches, of which 26 were included in the analysis pertaining to 5,444 patients (mean age: 37±13 years), with 67.62% (3681/5444) female. Specifically, 46.15% (12/26) studies focused on DTG, 26.92% (7/26) on RAL, 23.08% (6/26) on both DTG and RAL, and 3.85% (1/26) on EVG. We found an increasing use of DTG overtime (0% before 2018 to 100% in 2021). Median treatment duration under INSTI-based regimens was 12 [9-36] months. Overall, the rate of VC was 88.51% [95%CI: 73.83-97.80] with DTG vs. 82.49% [95%CI: 55.76-99.45] and 96.55% [95%CI: 85.7-100.00] with RAL and EVG, respectively. In univariate analysis, VC with DTG-containing vs. other INSTI-regimens was significantly higher (OR = 1.44 [95%CI: 1.15-1.79], p = 0.0014). Among reported DRMs at failure, the only DTG resistance-mutations were G118R and R263K. In SSA, DTG presents a superiority effect in VC compared to other INSTIs. Nonetheless, the early detection of INSTI-DRMs calls for sentinel surveillance for a successful transition and a sustained efficacy of DTG in SSA. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42019122424.

AB  - Nowadays, thermal infrared satellite remote sensors enable to extract very interesting information at large scale, in particular Land Surface Temperature (LST). However such data are limited in spatial and/or temporal resolutions which prevents from an analysis at fine scales. For example, MODIS satellite provides daily acquisitions with 1Km spatial resolutions which is not sufficient to deal with highly heterogeneous landscapes. Therefore, image super-resolution is a crucial task to better exploit MODIS LSTs. This issue is tackled in this paper. We introduce a deep learning-based algorithm, named Multi-residual U-Net, for super-resolution of MODIS LST single-images. Our proposed network is a modified version of U-Net architecture, which aims at super-resolving the input LST image from 1Km to 250m per pixel. The results show that our Multi-residual U-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Deep SURE for Unsupervised Remote Sensing Image Fusion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion is utilized in remote sensing (RS) due to the limitation of the imaging sensor and the high cost of simultaneously acquiring high spatial and spectral resolution images. Optical RS imaging systems usually provide images of high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution and vice versa. Therefore, fusing those images to obtain a fused image having both high spectral and spatial resolution is desirable in many applications. This article proposes a fusion framework using an unsupervised convolutional neural network (CNN) and Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE). We derive a new loss function for a CNN that incorporates a backprojection mean square error (MSE) with SURE to estimate the projected mse between the fused image and the ground truth. The main motivation is that training a CNN with this SURE loss function is unsupervised and avoids overfitting.

TI  - A preliminary assessment of high-spatial-resolution satellite rainfall estimation from SAR Sentinel-1 over the central region of South Korea

M3  - research-article
AB  - Reliable terrestrial rainfall observations from satellites at finer spatial resolution are essential for urban hydrological and microscale agricultural demands. Although various traditional “top-down” approach-based satellite rainfall products were widely used, they are limited in spatial resolution. This study aims to assess the potential of a novel “bottom-up” approach for rainfall estimation, the parameterized SM2RAIN model, applied to the C-band SAR Sentinel-1 satellite data (SM2RAIN-S1), to generate high-spatial-resolution terrestrial rainfall estimates (0.01Â° grid/ 6-day) over Central South Korea. Its performance was evaluated for both spatial and temporal variability using the respective rainfall data from a conventional reanalysis product and rain gauge network for a 1-year period over two different sub-regions in Central South Korea-the mixed forest-dominated, middle sub-region and cropland-dominated, west coast sub-region. Evaluation results indicated that the SM2RAIN-S1 product can capture general rainfall patterns in Central South Korea, and hold potential for high-spatial-resolution rainfall measurement over the local scale with different land covers, while less biased rainfall estimates against rain gauge observations were provided. Moreover, the SM2RAIN-S1 rainfall product was better in mixed forests considering the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R = 0.69), implying the suitability of 6-day SM2RAIN-S1 data in capturing the temporal dynamics of soil moisture and rainfall in mixed forests. However, in terms of RMSE and Bias, better performance was obtained with the SM2RAIN-S1 rainfall product over croplands rather than mixed forests, indicating that larger errors induced by high evapotranspiration losses (especially in mixed forests) need to be included in further improvement of the SM2RAIN.

TI  - High-Resolution SAR Image Classification Using Subspace Wavelet Encoding Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The feature learning methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have produced tremendous achievements in high-resolution (HR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification. However, the inherent speckle noise could weaken the effectiveness of the convolutional feature statistics. To effectively characterize the features of SAR land-covers under speckle noise, we propose a subspace wavelet encoding network (SWENet) trainable end-to-end and based on an encoder-decoder architecture for modeling the robust feature statistics in individual feature subspaces. We introduce a subspace encoder block at the end of the encoder stage and divide the entire feature space into a set of subspaces; the second-order statistics of all subspaces are concatenated. Then, the wavelet pooling block, suppressing the noise and keeping the structures of learned features well, decomposes the features into low-frequency (storing the basic object structures) and high-frequency components by Haar wavelet layer (HWL), and this block reconstructs the processed components using inverse IHWL during the upsampling stage. Especially, the wavelet pooling block is defined in each subspace for powerful feature learning. Experimental results on a TerraSAR-X image classification dataset suggest that our proposed SWENet yields a performance boost over its competitors.

TI  - Effectiveness of Common Preprocessing Methods of Time Series for Monitoring Crop Distribution in Kenya
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop identification and spatial distribution mapping are important for crop production estimation and famine early warning, especially for food-deficit African agricultural countries. By evaluating existing preprocessing methods for classification using satellite image time series (SITS) in Kenya, this study aimed to provide a low-cost method for cultivated land monitoring in sub-Saharan Africa that lacks financial support. SITS were composed of a set of MODIS Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1) in 2018, and the classification method included the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifier. Eight datasets obtained at three levels of preprocessing from MOD13Q1 were used in the classification: (1) raw SITS of vegetation indices (R-NDVI, R-EVI, and R-NDVI + R-EVI); (2) smoothed SITS of vegetation indices (S-NDVI); and (3) vegetation phenological data (P-NDVI, P-EVI, R-NDVI + P-NDVI, and P-NDVI-1). Both SVM and RF classification results showed that the "R-NDVI + R-EVI" dataset achieved the highest performance, while the three pure phenological datasets produced the lowest accuracy. Correlation analysis between variable importance and rainfall time series demonstrated that the vegetation index SITS during rainfall periods showed higher importance in RF classifiers, thus revealing the potential of saving computational costs. Considering the preprocessing cost of SITS and its negative impact on the classification accuracy, we recommend overlaying the original NDVI with the original EVI time series to map the crop distribution in Kenya.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation From Spaceborne Microwave Scatterometry and Parametric Wind Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne microwave sensors, measuring co-/cross-polarization (VV/VH) normalized radar cross section signals, have been widely used for tropical cyclone (TC) monitoring. However, considerable gaps remain to obtain TC intensity since these satellite data either blur inner-core structures (e.g., scatterometer data) or have limited spatial-temporal coverage (e.g., synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data). This study aims to get more accurate TC intensity estimates from scatterometers, which have good global coverage but relatively low spatial resolution. To overcome the blurring effect in scatterometers, we propose a new technique for guidance on TC intensities, with maximum 1-min sustained winds calculated as a function of decay parameters provided by the parametric Rankine-type model. The technique is employed on advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) data acquired between 2016 and 2017, validated with simultaneous SAR VH geophysical model function measurements and best-track (BT) estimates. When validated with BT estimates, the method enhances the blurred maximum winds, where the standard deviation of difference decreased from 6.3 to 3.49 m/s and the coefficient of determination increased from 0.7 to 0.89. Besides, it is noteworthy that the proposed technique performs slightly better than the Mayers-Ruf method. The promising results indicate that the technique can provide more representative TC maximum 1-min sustained wind estimates from ASCAT data, thus contributing to the further exploitation of scatterometer data for TC warnings.

TI  - Construction Land Information Extraction and Expansion Analysis of Xiaogan City Using One-Class Support Vector Machine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion is generally accompanied by a series of ecological problems; therefore, it is of great significance to strengthen the research on urban expansion to effectively guide and control urban expansion. In this study, we used a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) based on Landsat image data to extract the construction land area in Xiaogan City of Hubei Province (China) in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. We analyzed the characteristics of construction land expansion and explore the driving mechanisms of construction land expansion in Xiaogan City. The results show that 1) the accuracy of the construction land information extracted by OCSVM was 91.46%, 90.02%, 89.31%, 92.23%, and 89.67%, respectively, which met the expected results and could be used for the study of extension and driving mechanism, proving that OCSVM is suitable for the study of remote sensing image classification when only one class of features is extracted; 2) Xiaogan City's overall expansion is of high-speed type in 20 years, which is restricted by the terrain, medium-speed expansion between 2000 and 2005, and high-speed expansion between 2005 and 2020, and the expansion intensity of Xiaogan City in all four time periods from 2000 to 2020 is of slow expansion type; and 3) among the main factors influencing urban expansion in Xiaogan, the increase in population, economic development, development of high-tech zones, and construction of transportation lines increase the demand for construction land; government planning decisions provide the direction and scope for the expansion of construction land, which is the most leading factor among the drivers of construction land expansion.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study utilizes the airborne gamma-ray spectrometric data of Ga-bal El-Hassnawia and its vicinity in an attempt to refine the surface geological mapping and recognize the radioelements occurrences. The statistically analysed surface linea-ments derived from the Landsat image proved that they are oriented to the NW, NNW, N-S, and ENE trends. Qualitatively, the highest radiometric levels are related to the younger granites, the intermediate levels are observed over the Hammamat sediments and the acidic metavolcanics while the low levels are coinciding with the metasediments, ultramafites and basic to intermediate metavolcanics. The composite images show a good close correlation with the geologically mapped rock units. The factor analysis proved that the radiometric variables uranium (eU), potassium (K) and thorium (eTh) as well as total count (TC) are highly correlated positively with each other. Three principal factors F1, F2 and F3 are extracted from the data and their scores were used in differentiat-ing the rock types according to their radiometric levels; consequently, nine interpreted litho-radiometric units were identified. Three types of younger granites and two types of Hammamat sediments could be distinguished among the nine units. These units are subjected to statistical treatment with the goal of identifying the uranium occurrences that exceeds X + 2S and X + 3S as targets of exploration. Accordingly, it is found that the uranium province zones are related to the three types of granite (G1, G2 and G3), the second type of Hammamat sediment (H2) and more or less the acidic metavolcanics. The uranium migration indicated that the second type of Hammamat sediment (H-2) is the only unit that the uranium is migrated in whereas; the uranium is migrated out in all other units.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to implement a forward model for Sentinel-1 co-pol and cross-pol backscatter and coherence using crop bio-geophysical parameters namely leaf area index, biomass, canopy height, soil moisture and root zone moisture as inputs for the maize. These required input parameters are generated using Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), one of the state-of-the-art crop growth models. The predicted SAR signal is generated using Support Vector Regression (SVR) over all the maize fields in an agricultural region, Flevoland, Netherlands. The correlation between simulated signal and observed signal is evaluated.

AB  - Climate change constitutes a serious global challenge with consequences that are directly affecting infrastructure. Thus, there is a great need to develop reliable cost-effective systems, which integrate remote sensing data, in situ measurements and advanced methods for infrastructure monitoring. In this framework, the European Union and the Hellenic government are financially supporting a R&D project, named "PROION". The purpose of the project is the development of a platform for the continuous monitoring of high-priority infrastructures (public infrastructure, dams, bridges, etc.) which are located in a particularly active area in terms of tectonics and seismicity. Monitoring is based on the combination of instrumental and remote sensing measurements along with fuzzy logic networks methods and machine learning algorithms in order to generate an innovative decision-making and decision-support tool. Specifically, measurements derived from three-axis accelerometers, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry are imported into the platform. The measurements will be validated using high-accuracy reference representations arising from data acquired by Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) surveys and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) campaigns and subsequently, deformation maps will be generated. Intelligent data analysis methods will contribute to making decisions on the current as well as the future state of the infrastructure. At this initial stage of the project, the proposed monitoring system is described in detail.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide new means for analysis and assessment of current geo processes in the active landslide located in "Fish-Fish" residential area, northern Black Sea coast of Bulgaria in order to mitigate the risks of natural and anthropogenic origin. In recent decades, starting in 2002, the study region has been subject of several calamity events such as landslides, earth masses collapse, etc. To this end, it is essential to prepare risk management plans using information of high quality and regularly monitor the most vulnerable areas in this zone in advance. In this paper presented is the developed local geodatabase for the investigated site consisting of several layers all of them related to the modelling of the processes such as erosion, sea abrasion, etc.. This modelling is based on large variety of sources - terrain investigations, remotely sensed data from satellites and unmanned aerial systems (UAS).

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The provision of safe operation is of prime importance for every industrial plant. This consideration to an even greater extent concerns the nuclear power plants. One of the major threats during their normal operation for this infrastructural objects are the ground motions that could occur, because of several reasons such as seismic activities, geological instabilities to name a few. In this paper proposed is the surface deformations in the area of the nuclear power plant (NPP) Kozloduy to be analyzed using a time series of remotely sensed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 mission of ESA. It should be noted that this is the only way to obtain reliable information about the motions at regular intervals since the zone has restricted access. The justification for carrying out this study is twofold - first the mentioned radar instrument was purposely built for study those phenomena at large scales (regional or country level) and second the provision of the data and the software for their processing are obtained free of charge from the ESA repositories. It also should be underlined that the improved spatial resolution of the sensor compared with similar ones (e.g. ERS-1/2, Envisat) and the short revisiting time (6/12 days) allow production of information with better quality compared to the results obtained up to this moment using remotely sensed data only. In this research the short baseline subsets (SBAS) approach was adopted using the DInSAR technique as main processing method. As final result produced were interferometric maps that reveal the overall ground stability of the studied region and especially for the area surrounding the researched object. Those maps can serve the needs of the competent local authorities as well as to the plant operator in order to increase the safety of the population living in the area. The results obtained from this research were compared with the newly provided data from European Ground Motion Service and other sources such as continuous operating GNSS reference stations located closely to the studied zone.

AB  - Keeping crowdsourced maps up-to-date is important for a wide range of location-based applications (route planning, urban planning, navigation, tourism, etc.). We propose a novel map updating mechanism that combines the latest freely available remote sensing data with the current state of online vector map data to train a Deep Learning (DL) neural network. It uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to perform image-to-image translation, followed by segmentation and raster-vector comparison processes to identify changes to map features (e.g. buildings, roads, etc.) when compared to existing map data. This paper evaluates various GAN models trained with sixteen different datasets designed for use by our change detection/map updating procedure. Each GAN model is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively to select the most accurate DL model for use in future spatial change detection applications.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Regression-based models are widely used for retrieving water quality parameters from optical imagery. However, developing robust and accurate models in inland and nearshore coastal waters remains challenging, particularly when transferring the models in space or time. This study builds upon a machine learning regression model called extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to retrieve total suspended matter (TSM) concentration in optically-complex waters. XGBoost is an ensemble of decision tree models that benefits from a boosting mechanism to compensate for the prediction errors by adding more trees. We employ the trending XGBoost method for the first time for TSM retrieval. The dark spectrum fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction method is first performed on multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery of our study area in San Francisco Bay. Then, the XGBoost-based model is trained considering samples distributed in space and time. For training, the atmospherically-corrected spectral bands of Sentinel-2 at the visible and near-infrared portion of the spectrum are used, along with the collocated in-situ measurements of TSM. We examine the temporal transferability of the proposed model by retrieving TSM for images acquired after the training period. The results are assessed based on independent in-situ matchups (70 samples). Moreover, we compare the TSM estimates with a standard optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) model. The in-situ matchup analysis indicates a high potential of XGBoost in providing temporally robust retrievals of TSM (R-2 approximate to 0.77; RMSE approximate to 6 g/m(3) for estimates up to 70 g/m(3)). On the contrary, OBRA provides poor results when transferring the model in time. Moreover, the XGBoost demonstrated to be robust to sun-glint effects.

AB  - The empirical (regression-based) models have long been used for retrieving water quality parameters from optical imagery by training a model between image spectra and collocated in-situ data. However, a need clearly exists to examine and enhance the temporal transferability of models. The performance of a model trained in a specific period can deteriorate when applied at another time due to variations in the composition of constituents, atmospheric conditions, and sun glint. In this study, we propose a machine learning approach that trains a neural network using samples distributed in space and time, enabling the temporal robustness of the model. We explore the temporal transferability of the proposed neural network and standard band ratio models in retrieving total suspended matter (TSM) from Sentinel-2 imagery in San Francisco Bay. Multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery and in-situ data are used to train the models. The transferability of models is then examined by estimating the TSM for imagery acquired after the training period. In addition, we assess the robustness of the models concerning the sun glint correction. The results imply that the neural network-based model is temporally transferable (R-2 approximate to 0.75; RMSE approximate to 7 g/m(3) for retrievals up to 70 g/m(3)) and is minimally impacted by the sun glint correction. Conversely, the ratio model showed relatively poor temporal robustness with high sensitivity to the glint correction.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of the ZY1-02D Hyperspectral Imager Using the GF-5 AHSI Imager
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ZY1-02D satellite, which was launched in 2019, is China's first civil hyperspectral satellite. However, the laboratory calibration and vicarious calibration methods could not provide accurate radiometric calibration coefficients after the satellite had been launched. In this article, we describe how a cross-calibration method was utilized to calibrate the ZY1-02D hyperspectral imager using the well-calibrated Gaofen-5 Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (GF-5 AHSI). The 6S radiative transfer model was selected to simulate the apparent reflectance of the two hyperspectral sensors under corresponding imaging conditions, and the calibration coefficients were calculated by spectral channel matching. The reflectance-based vicarious calibration was carried out for comparison. Through the validation experiments, it is shown that the reflectance data obtained by cross-calibration and vicarious calibration are basically consistent, showing a stable radiation performance. At the Dunhuang calibration site, the ratio of measured surface reflectance to the cross-calibrated image reflectance is between 0.9 and 1.1, the R-2 values are more than 0.96, and the spectral angles are less than 3 degrees. The validation results for different ground features also show the applicability of the corrected coefficients. When compared with different sensors, the maximum difference between the ZY1-02D reflectance results after cross-calibration and Landsat-8/Sentinel-2 is less than 0.04 and the mean difference is less than 0.02, which further proves that the ZY1-02D hyperspectral imager has a high radiation accuracy after cross-calibration. The proposed cross-calibration method could be used as an effective supplement to the on-orbit calibration method and could also be extended to other satellite hyperspectral imagers.

TI  - Improving Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Imagery via Graph Reasoning and Disentangled Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation in aerial imagery is still an important, yet challenging task due to the complex characteristics of remote-sensing data. The critical issues consist of: 1) extreme foreground-background imbalance; 2) large intra-class variance; and 3) arbitrary-oriented, dense, and small objects. The above challenges make it unlikely to model the effective global interdependencies of semantic heterogeneous regions. Besides, general semantic segmentation methods suffer from feature ambiguity due to the joint feature learning paradigm, leading to inferior detail information. In this article, we propose an improved semantic segmentation framework to tackle these problems via graph reasoning (GR) and disentangled learning. On the one hand, a simple, yet effective GR unit is introduced to implement coordinate-interaction space mapping and perform relation reasoning over the graph. It can be deployed on the feature pyramid network (FPN) to exploit cross-stage multi-scale information. On the other hand, we propose a so- called disentangled learning paradigm to explicitly model the foreground and boundary objects, instantiated as foreground prior estimation (FPE) and boundary alignment (BA). The indication of the intermediate feature can be effectively emphasized to enhance the discriminative abilities of the network. Extensive experiments over iSAID, ISPRS Vaihingen, and the general Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework over other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.

TI  - Hybrid Multiple Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation in very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images is one of the most challenging tasks in remote sensing image understanding. Most of the current approaches are based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). However, standard convolution with local receptive fields fails in modeling global dependencies. Prior research works have indicated that attention-based methods can capture long-range dependencies and further reconstruct the feature maps for better representation. Nevertheless, limited by the mere perspective of spatial and channel attention and huge computation complexity of self-attention (SA) mechanism, it is unlikely to model the effective semantic interdependencies between each pixel pair of remote sensing data with complex spectra. In this work, we propose a novel attention-based framework named hybrid multiple attention network (HMANet) to adaptively capture global correlations from the perspective of space, channel, and category in a more effective and efficient manner. Concretely, a class augmented attention (CAA) module embedded with a class channel attention (CCA) module can be used to compute category-based correlation and recalibrate the class-level information. In addition, we introduce a simple yet effective region shuffle attention (RSA) module to reduce feature redundant and improve the efficiency of SA mechanism via regionwise representations. Extensive experimental results on the ISPRS Vaihingen, Potsdam benchmark, and iSAID data set demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our HMANet over other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - FCAU-Net for the Semantic Segmentation of Fine-Resolution Remotely Sensed Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remotely sensed images is an urgent issue in satellite image processing. Solving this problem can help overcome various obstacles in urban planning, land cover classification, and environmental protection, paving the way for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. Encoder-decoder structures based on attention mechanisms have been frequently used for fine-resolution image segmentation. In this paper, we incorporate a coordinate attention (CA) mechanism, adopt an asymmetric convolution block (ACB), and design a refinement fusion block (RFB), forming a network named the fusion coordinate and asymmetry-based U-Net (FCAU-Net). Furthermore, we propose novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to fully capture long-term dependencies and fine-grained details in fine-resolution remotely sensed imagery. This approach has the following advantages: (1) the CA mechanism embeds position information into a channel attention mechanism to enhance the feature representations produced by the network while effectively capturing position information and channel relationships; (2) the ACB enhances the feature representation ability of the standard convolution layer and captures and refines the feature information in each layer of the encoder; and (3) the RFB effectively integrates low-level spatial information and high-level abstract features to eliminate background noise when extracting feature information, reduces the fitting residuals of the fused features, and improves the ability of the network to capture information flows. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets (ZY-3 and DeepGlobe) demonstrate the effectiveness of the FCAU-Net. The proposed FCAU-Net transcends U-Net, Attention U-Net, the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet), DeepLab v3+, the multistage attention residual U-Net (MAResU-Net), MACU-Net, and the Transformer U-Net (TransUNet). Specifically, the FCAU-Net achieves a 97.97% (95.05%) pixel accuracy (PA), a 98.53% (91.27%) mean PA (mPA), a 95.17% (85.54%) mean intersection over union (mIoU), and a 96.07% (90.74%) frequency-weighted IoU (FWIoU) on the ZY-3 (DeepGlobe) dataset.

TI  - Nationwide CoViD-19 lockdown impact on air quality in India
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the comparative results of surface and satellite measurements made during the Phase 1 (25 March to 14 April), Phase 2 (15 April to 3 May) and Phase 3 (3 May to 17 May) of Covid-19 imposed lockdown periods of 2020 and those of the same locations and periods during 2019 over India. These comparative analyses are performed for Indian states and Tier 1 megacities where economic activities have been severely affected with the nationwide lockdown. The focus is on changes in the surface concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), PM2.5 and PM10, Ozone (O-3), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and retrieved columnar NO2 from TROPOMI and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from MODIS satellite. Surface concentrations of PM2.5 were reduced by 30.59%, 31.64% and 37.06%, PM10 by 40.64%, 44.95% and 46.58%, SO2 by 16.73%, 12.13% and 6.71%, columnar NO2 by 46.34%, 45.82% and 39.58% and CO by 45.08%, 41.51% and 60.45% during lockdown periods of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 respectively as compared to those of 2019 periods over India. During 1st phase of lockdown, model simulated PM2.5 shows overestimations to those of observed PM2.5 mass concentrations. The model underestimates the PM2.5 to those of without reduction before lockdown and 1st phase of lockdown periods. The reduction in emissions of PM2.5, PM10, CO and columnar NO2 are discussed with the surface transportation mobility maps during the study periods. Reduction in the emissions based on the observed reduction in the surface mobility data, the model showed excellent skills in capturing the observed PM2.5 concentrations. Nevertheless, during the 1st & 3rd phases of lockdown periods AOD reduced by 5 to 40%. Surface O-3 was increased by 1.52% and 5.91% during 1st and 3rd Phases of lockdown periods respectively, while decreased by-8.29% during 2nd Phase of lockdown period.

TI  - African Elephant (Loxodonta africana) Impact on Selected Tree Species and Assessment of Piosphere Gradients in Venetia-limpopo Nature Reserve.
T2  - Ecology Environment and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees utilised by elephants often undergo a significant amount of damage compared to trees utilised by other browsers. Woody plants play a crucial role in plant community dynamics, species composition, and the savannah system's functioning. As drivers of ecosystems, elephants are capable of transforming habitats in terms of structure and species composition. In this paper, the damage caused by elephants on different selected tree species in Venetia-Limpopo Nature Reserve was studied following a field-based approach. Field data collected for trees included the species name, GPS location, tree height class, extent, and type of damage resulting from elephant foraging. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to evaluate vegetation's vigour using Landsat-5 imagery. A Multiple Ring Buffer Tool was used to extract mean NDVI values of buffer rings spread around waterholes at 400-metre intervals. The impact on woody vegetation along the vegetation gradient, 'Piosphere', was evaluated. NDVI values extracted for the different years indicate that the impact on woody vegetation degradation along the Piosphere gradient is negligible. There was no statistically significant relationship (Pearson correlation r3= -0.500, P = 0.391), trend or pattern between the number of damaged trees and the type of damage. Different trees at different height classes were utilised inconsistently by elephants. The dominant (45%) type of damage was for Broken Main Stem (BMS), with the lowest (1%) damage being for Bark Stripping (BS). Overall, there was a statistically significant difference (Pearson correlation r3= 0.973, P = 0.146) between the number of trees selected by elephants in the various height classes. Trees between 3 m and 4 m were the most selected and the impact seemed to be stabilising at these tree heights. Additional studies need to be focused on the recruitment rates of elephant foraged trees in the reserve to prevent local extirpation of these species in the future.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The exponential rise of the threats to peace and unity in Nigeria has opened up an urgent discourse to salvage the situation, thus it becomes very necessary to ask questions like: is there a way to restore peace and unity in Nigeria, and if so, what could it be? What exactly the main constituents of the deplorable state of Nigeria are in terms of inter human relationships? Is Ubuntu the right step to take in solving the problem, and if so, how can it help? Will Nigerians accept this worldview if it is implemented? What would the effects and consequences of Ubuntu if it is implemented in Nigeria? These questions are the problems to be tackled in this paper.In an attempt to answer these questions, therefore, the researcher analyses the Ubuntu philosophy in a Nigerian perspective. The primary purpose is most importantly to demonstrate its relevance to the Nigerian society and, hence, providing a new outlook on nation building, through mutual respect, transparency and all that the Ubuntu philosophy provides. The researcher primarily presents the idea of the study in an expository methodological approach, using critical and analytical formula.

AB  - During the last quarter of 2019, the beaches, mangroves, and estuaries of Northeast Brazil received an unprecedented volume of crude oil from the sea, which became the worst environmental disaster ever to reach the Brazilian coast The oil, having reached the shores completely unnoticed, left both society and government agents completely clueless on (i) where the oil was coming from; (ii) how much oil was still in the ocean to reach the shorelines; and (iii) which beaches were going to be affected next! By exploring remote sensing data and ocean numerical modeling, along with oil dispersion chemistry on sea water, this study investigates the possible origin and path of the spill and whether it could have been detected from space. The oil dispersion modeling simulations performed for this investigation revealed a possible region and timing of the oil spill, also indicating the likelihood of it being advected toward the shoreline under the ocean surface.

AB  - O Estado da Bahia possui mais de 80% da sua area inserida na regiao semiarida, caraterizada pelas altas temperaturas, e longos periodos de baixos indices pluviometricos, como reflexo dessas condicoes climaticas, essa regiao e propicia a eventos de seca. Tendo em vista essa questao, o sensoriamento remoto torna-se um instrumento fundamental na obtencao e analise de dados aplicados a grandes areas, permitindo o acompanhamento das tendencias desse fenomeno. A partir dessa problematica, esse trabalho teve por objetivo mapear a dinamica espaco-temporal da Temperatura de Superficie (LST) para as mesorregioes do Estado da Bahia, durante os ultimos vinte anos, e correlaciona-la com os dados de precipitacao do Centro de Previsao de Tempo e Estudos Climaticos do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (CPTEC/INPE). Para isso, foram obtidas as imagens do LST Day do produto MOD11A2 do MODIS/TERRA, utilizadas rotinas computacionais na linguagem R e software de Sistemas de Informacoes Geograficas (SIG), o QGIS, para processamento das imagens e producao dos mapas. Os resultados mostraram que a Temperatura de Superficie Terrestre foram mais acentuadas nas mesorregioes do Vale do Sao Francisco e Extremo Oeste Baiano. Ja o Sul Baiano foi uma das mesorregioes que apresentou menores temperaturas de superficie para a serie historica, podendo ser resultado da conservacao da vegetacao tipica do bioma Mata Atlantica na regiao e das altas precipitacoes pluviometricas. Com a producao cartografica e analises geoestatisticas dessa variavel foi possivel avaliar a distribuicao espaco-temporal no periodo estudado.

M3  - Article
AB  - The scarcity of water for agricultural use is a serious problem that has increased due to intense droughts, poor management, and deficiencies in the distribution and application of the resource. The monitoring of crops through satellite image processing and the application of machine learning algorithms are technological strategies with which developed countries tend to implement better public policies regarding the efficient use of water. The purpose of this research was to determine the main indicators and characteristics that allow us to discriminate the phenological stages of maize crops (Zea mays L.) in Sentinel 2 satellite images through supervised classification models. The training data were obtained by monitoring cultivated plots during an agricultural cycle. Indicators and characteristics were extracted from 41 Sentinel 2 images acquired during the monitoring dates. With these images, indicators of texture, vegetation, and colour were calculated to train three supervised classifiers: linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbours (kNN) models. It was found that 45 of the 86 characteristics extracted contributed to maximizing the accuracy by stage of development and the overall accuracy of the trained classification models. The characteristics of the Moran's I local indicator of spatial association (LISA) improved the accuracy of the classifiers when applied to the L*a*b* colour model and to the near-infrared (NIR) band. The local binary pattern (LBP) increased the accuracy of the classification when applied to the red, green, blue (RGB) and NIR bands. The colour ratios, leaf area index (LAI), RGB colour model, L*a*b* colour space, LISA, and LBP extracted the most important intrinsic characteristics of maize crops with regard to classifying the phenological stages of the maize cultivation. The quadratic SVM model was the best classifier of maize crop phenology, with an overall accuracy of 82.3%.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Koryak Highland is one of the areas of the present-day mountain glaciation in the north-east of the Asian part of Russia. Its remoteness and inaccessibility are serious obstacles to the ground-based (field) researches, so our knowledge of the regime of glaciers in this area is still incomplete. Objective of this study was to obtain data on changes in the state of glaciers for about a half-century period. For this purpose, the following information was used: results of ground-based phototheodolite surveys of two glaciers on the Ledyanaya Mountain massif (2,453 m) in the central part of the highland, carried out in August 1961 by the expedition of the Institute of Geography of the USSR Academy of Sciences, data from recent space surveys SPOT 6, and a digital relief model ArcticDEM v3.0 2016. The glaciers under investigation are Nezhdanny and Sosedniy. Using these data, the mass balance of glaciers was estimated by the geodetic method. It was found that for 55 years, the area of glaciers decreased by 0.75 km(2) (15.2%), the volume - by 71.74 +/- 16.51 million m(3), and the average lowering in height of the surface - 16.7 m. For the period 1961-2016 the average annual specific mass balance of glaciers was equal to -0.362 +/- 0.065 m w.e. yr(-1). In this region the main factors exerting influence upon changes in the size of glaciers are the following: first, the summer air temperature rise of about 2 degrees C since the end of the twentieth century, and the second, a decrease in the amount of solid precipitation by 0.15 m w.e. per year. Degradation of glaciers is caused by changes in conditions of glacial alimentation, increased ablation, and the active cryogenic factors. At the same time, a new rock glacier is being formed in the alimentation area. It is possible that in the future the new one will replace the degrading glacier.

AB  - In this work, we tested two algorithms for the retrieval of snow surface albedo and grain size by exploiting Sentinel-3 OLCI data. The first algorithm is semi-empirical based on spectral indices and radiative transfer theory adapted from Painter et al. (2009, 2012) and the second is based on an approximation of the radiative transfer theory proposed by Kokhanovsky et al. (2019). Being interested mainly in mountain areas, we introduced adaptations to account for topography and heterogeneity of the area of interest. The algorithms were tested and intercompared in the European Alps for the period 2018-2021. The results indicate that for albedo both algorithms can follow the snow dynamics from winter to springtime. Both algorithms agree well with ground measurements showing a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between 0.05 and 0.15 and a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.71 to 0.81. As for grain size, a general underestimation is found for both methods, even though the semiempirical method follows better the typical grain size metamorphosis from winter to spring.

AB  - Current cybersecurity research is constrained by the general scarcity of large, realistic, labeled network traffic datasets. To address said scarcity, this paper introduces Sentinel: a multi-enterprise scientific instrument developed to support data-driven cybersecurity research.Sentinel provides researchers access to virtual computing infrastructure and petabytes of data collected over several years from network sensors at two large, disjoint educational institutions - the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech. The network dataset is supplemented by multi-modal malware activity logs generated by attack recreation exercises which realistically integrate ground truth into collected edge sensor data. To mitigate risks associated with providing access to enterprise network sensor logs, Sentinel uses a combination of a code-to-data policy, data usage agreements, and pattern-preserving anonymization.Sentinel has been used as part of a government-funded effort to investigate new machine learning algorithms, cybersecurity forensics, and data retention techniques.

M3  - Article
AB  - In oncological surgery the importance of the sentinel node concept is increasing, as we are capable of reducing the surgical burden of patients and its associated morbidity and preserving adequate oncological safety at the same time. Recently, there has been development of lymph node mapping techniques, where the most promising method appears to be the immunofluorescent one using indocyanine green dye. This technique provides high sensitivity in sentinel node detection in comparison with other existing methods using a dye in combination with a radionuclide. The indocyanine green technique has several advantages, and at the same time, we can use this method in non-oncological indications in gynecological surgery.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to understand the long-term influence of biostimulator NeOsol in combination with different manure types on soil's physical properties and crop status. NeOsol is a soil biostimulator that should stimulate the biological reactions of the soil profile and improve the soil's physical and chemical properties. A six-year experiment was conducted with eight treatments: NPK, cattle manure, pig manure, poultry manure, and the same four treatments with the NeOsol added on top. The in situ sampling of soil properties provided data on unit draft (UD), bulk density (BD), and saturated hydraulic conductivity (SHC). Furthermore, remotely sensed data were analyzed to describe crop status via three selected vegetation indices (VI), and crop yields were assessed last. The variants treated with NeOsol demonstrated decreases in UD over time; BD, SHC, and VI did not significantly change. The impact on yield was significant and increased over time. When comparing the variants with manure application to those without one, the cattle manure led to significantly higher SHC; the pig manure led to significantly lower UD and BD but significantly higher SHC and yield; and the poultry manure led to significantly lower UD and BD but higher yield.

AB  - Spain is included in the top five European countries with the highest number of wildfires. The occurrence and magnitude of forest fires involves aspects of a very diverse nature, from those of a socio-economic, climatic, or physiographic nature, to those concerning fuel or the availability and quantity of resources and means of extinction. The distribution of wildfires in Galicia is not random and that fire occurrence may depend on ownership conflicts also a spatial dependence between productive or non-productive area exists. Satellite data play a major role in providing knowledge about fires by delivering rapid information to map fire-damaged areas precisely and promptly. In addition, the availability of large-scale data and the high temporal resolution offered by the Sentinel-2 satellite enables to classify and determine the land cover changes with high accuracy. This study describes a methodology to detect burned areas and analyse the Land Cover and Land Use (LCLU) classes present in these areas during the period of 5 years (2016-2021) by Sentinel-2 images. The training areas were obtained by photointerpretation and the image classification was performed using the Random Forest algorithm which shows an overall accuracy range between 80-85%. The methodology concluded that Lobios and Muinos were the most affected municipalities by wildfires. Additionally, the spatial analysis determined that the Deciduous Forest mainly composed by Quercus sp. were the most affected in 2017 followed by Coniferous Forest mainly composed by Pinus sp. in 2016. Although, Scrub and Rock are the classes more affected for wildfire during 2016-2020 period.

TI  - Kereke Ya Sephiri: A Study of a Secret Society in Botswana and South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - The difference between esotericism and exoterism is unlike the difference between circles and rectangles. It is also not the difference between the size and relevance of a specific body of knowledge in circulation. It is rather the extent of the circulation, acceptance, understanding, and meaning of a particular body of knowledge, philosophy, or worldview, over the spiritual and socio-political life of diverse categories of people in society.The infancy of the academic study of esotericism, as well as its interdisciplinary nature, militate against the crystallization of a universally accepted definition of the term 'esotericism'. The various definitions of the term by researchers consistently relate to their research interests. In line with Faivre's concern with the forms of thought of esoteric movements (Faivre 1996), as well as the preoccupation that Versluis has with gnosis generation in esoteric movements (Versluis n.d), our study of Kereke ya Sephiri in Botswana and South Africa examines a) the cultural and religious contexts in which Frederick Modise, a gnostic in his own right, generated the underlying gnosis of his secret society, and b) the import of the content of this visionary mystical revelation in the spiritual and social lives of members of this secret society(1).The study of the Setswana term, Kereke ya Sephiri (church of a secret, referring to a Christian-based secret society), is a study of African esotericism in South Africa and Botswana. The principal academic interest in the study of esotericism lies in our quest to identify the fundamental tenets of the worldviews of the specific esoteric society, the eclectic nature of its philosophy, and how this philosophy relates to the orthodoxy of the day ( Christianity in this instance). We do so by concentrating on the form of thinking, engendered by esoteric practices. Esoteric groups do not appear or exist within cultural voids. For this reason, by identifying the eclectic or syncretic nature of the fundamental philosophy ( gnosis) of these groups, we trace the cultural influences involved in the emergence and consolidation of these worldviews and philosophies. This study shows that African esotericism is not always antithetic or subversive of dominant or institutionalized Christianity.

AB  - This research studies the possibility of applying data mining methods to determine homogeneous management zones in fields sown with cereals. For the study, satellite images of two fields in the East Kazakhstan region were used, obtained by the Sentinel-2 satellite in different periods of time (images of the first field were obtained from May to September 2020, images of the second field - from May to August 2021). Based on these images, a dataset of seasonal NDVI values was formed for each field. Four different clustering algorithms were applied to each of the datasets, the clustering results were visualized and rasterized as color maps, which were then offered for comparison and verification by an expert agronomist. Based on the expert review, recommendations were formulated for determining zones of homogeneous management.

M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal variation in the coastline of San Lucas Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico and its beach environments was determined. The analysis had a temporality of twenty years (at intervals of ten years: 2000, 2010 and 2020), three high-resolution LANDSAT 4-5 and 8 satellite images were used and the MNDWI was applied. The extraction of the coastline was carried out by vectoring directly on the pixels that are between the wet and dry limits of the beach and for the statistical analyzes the method proposed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was used. Of the 61 orthogonal transects, 55 resulted in an erosive state (90.16%) and 6 in accretion (9.84%). The final point rate (EPR) showed a mean shoreline retreat of (-) 1.2 m/yr and the net shoreline movement (NSM) revealed the largest negative distance to be (-) 122.94 m. reflecting marked erosion at the southwestern tip of the bay while accretion was 24.61 m. A relative decline was also seen in 6 of the 7 beach areas. The erosive trend of the San Lucas Bay coastline represents a loss of the beach coastal resource. These indicators serve as a reference for monitoring, planning and management in coastal management policies.

The project aims at estimating sea surface wind field from L-, C- and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. In particular, the key element is the adaptation/improvement of geophysical model functions to transform the microwave reflectivity map into an added-value product, i.e., a wind map characterized by a spatial resolution much finer than the one obtainable from scatterometer measurements. First experimental results related to C-band Sentinel-1 SAR imagery are presented.

AB  - In this study, wind speed is estimated from COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery using two approaches, which both exploit the X-band Geophysical Model Function (GMF) XMOD2 developed for the German TerraSAR-X SAR mission. The first approach uses external wind direction information provided by collocated ASCAT scatterometer measurements; the second one incorporates wind direction derived from the SAR scene using the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Experimental results, obtained using a relatively small collocated CSK data set, show the robustness of the wind estimation from the CSK imagery that result in accurate enough estimates under a range of incidence angles that span between 30 degrees and 50 degrees. The CWT approach allows reliable wind estimates on a 1km spatial grid.

M3  - research-article
AB  - An area under construction for a living facility collapsed around 12:48 KST on 13 January 2021 in Sa-dong, Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do. There were no casualties due to the rapid evacuation measure, but part of the temporary retaining facility collapsed, and several cracks occurred in the adjacent road on the south side. This study used the potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite for surface property changes that lies in backscattering characteristic to map the collapsed structure. The interferometric SAR technique can make a direct measurement of the decorrelation among different acquisition dates by integrating both amplitude and phase information. The damage proxy map (DPM) technique has been employed using four high-resolution Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) data spanning from 2020 to 2021 during ascending observation to analyze the collapse of the construction. DPM relies on the difference of pre- and co-event interferometric coherences to depict anomalous changes that indicate collapsed structure in the study area.The DPMs were displayed in a color scale that indicates an increasingly more significant ground surface change in the area covered by the pixels, depicting the collapsed structure. Therefore, the DPM technique with SAR data can be used for damage assessment with accurate and comprehensive detection after an event. In addition, we classify the amplitude information using support vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood classification algorithms. An investigation committee was formed to determine the cause of the collapse of the retaining wall and to suggest technical and institutional measures and alternatives to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring. The report from the committee revealed that the incident was caused by a combination of factors that were not carried out properly.

TI  - Kazakh Traditional Riddles as a Specific Form of Translation of Cultural-Historical Experience
T2  - KULTURNO-ISTORICHESKAYA PSIKHOLOGIYA-CULTURAL-HISTORICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article develops the ideas of M.M. Mukanov about the importance of a psychological approach to the product of oral creativity in ethnico-historical terms. Ethnic mentality corresponds to social and historical realities of the life of the ethnos creating a unique culture. An important part of the manifestation of ethnic mentality belongs to the works of oral creativity - the product of the mental activity of many generations. John M. Dienhart (Dienhart) argued that riddles "can serve as a useful identifier of cultural norms and worldview" [34]. Thus, the article discusses riddles as a specific element of Kazakh culture, as a special cultural tradition; the role of riddles in the translation of cultural and historical experience; how exactly the peculiarities of mentality manifest themselves in riddles; what the specificity of the guessing process is. In conclusion, we discuss what the common and the different in guessing riddles compared to solving educational and creative tasks. It is shown that the difficulties of guessing are associated with the disguise of the sought under the shell of the ethnic context and a special way of "stamping" the riddle. In a creative task, the most important moment is a reflexive effort aimed at awaring and changing the way of action. And the Kazakh riddle combines the correlation of two contents according to gestalt, thinking by analogy, transduction and ethno-cultural context. In this sense, guessing the Kazakh riddle is "three in one": mastering cultural and historical experience (the enclosed content), mastering the method of metaphorical thinking (thinking in modeling representations), mastering the ethno-cultural context. Thus, it corresponds to Archer Taylor's thesisthat the riddle is a universal art [38].

TI  - Bio-Physical Changes in the Gulf of Mexico During the 2018 Hurricane Michael
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the impacts of one of the strongest recorded hurricanes to have hit the Florida Panhandle, Hurricane Michael (2018), on the upper ocean using a suite of satellite data, in situ profiles, and outputs from the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Strong, low-level cyclonic winds associated with the hurricane generated strong Ekman suction that propagated ahead of the hurricane and caused changes in the surface and subsurface ocean. Following the passage of Hurricane Michael, a 3 degrees C drop in sea surface temperature (SST) was accompanied with a 4-5 mg m(-3) increase in chlorophyll-a concentration. In the subsurface, a similar to 15 m mixed layer deepening preceded upward displacements of the isotherms and cooling of the mixed layer. The impact of hurricane conditions on sea surface salinity (SSS) was localized and influenced by competing processes, with upwelling of salty subsurface water increasing SSS and enhanced precipitation decreasing SSS. During the peak of the hurricane, the impact of upwelling was greater than that of enhanced precipitation and, thus, SSS increased. Further away from the upwelling centers, hurricane-influenced precipitation, and river runoff freshened SSS.

TI  - Abai and Russian Philosophy: Man and His Values
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article attempts a comparative analysis of the concepts of two national philosophies - Kazakh and Russian. The authors turn to the problem of man, trying to understand how Kazakh and Russian thinkers conceive human nature, what concepts, in their opinion, are defining for a human being, what place in the characterization of human nature is occupied by universal, values: life and death, good and evil, love and hatred, mercy and compassion, God and man. In this regard, the authors analyze the legacy of the outstanding Kazakh poet, thinker, public educator and public figure Abai Kunanbaev, his philosophical concept of a universal, integral person ("tolyk adam"). The article reveals the worldview of Abai, whose roots go back to the Muslim humanistic tradition, the motive of his search for moral self-determination of a person. Comparing Abai's worldview with the views of representatives of Russian religious philosophy (Vladimir Solovyov, Ivan Ilyin, Pavel Florensky), the authors come to the conclusion that with all the differences between these two philosophies, primarily national ones, human nature is treated in a similar way in them. This primarily concerns the understanding of religious faith as a unifying, forming principle for the inner world of a person, the unifying principle around which such universal human values as mercy, compassion, honor, conscience, national dignity, mutual understanding, peace and harmony are gathered. The authors emphasize that these values, like never before, are in demand by the modern world, torn by conflicts, contradictions, local wars, a world that has forgotten what love is and what is the genuine truth of life.

AB  - The subject of the article "Wine, Opium, Hashish in Georgian and European Symbolism" is the identification of the cultural links between Georgian and European (primarily French and, German) symbolism. Our goal is to determine the role and place of Georgian symbolism in the world literature context and study the cultural-aesthetic ties that have influenced the art of the Georgian symbolist group, the process of forming their aesthetic taste and worldview. In this article, we focus on the genesis of the symbolist theory of the myth, its specific nature and the motivation for the creation of a new mythology. In addition, we consider the theme of wine, opium and hashish in Georgian and European cultural areas, and analyse the conceptual sense and function of this new mythology.

TI  - Remote Sensing for Biocultural Heritage Preservation in an African Semi-Arid Region: A Case Study of Indigenous Wells in Northern Kenya and Southern Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The region of Southern Ethiopia (Borana) and Northern Kenya (Marsabit) is characterised by erratic rainfall, limited surface water, aridity, and frequent droughts. An important adaptive response to these conditions, of uncertain antiquity, has been the hand-excavation of a sequence of deep wells at key locations often along seasonal riverbeds and valley bottoms where subterranean aquifers can be tapped. Sophisticated indigenous water management systems have developed to ensure equitable access to these critical water resources, and these are part of well-defined customary institutional leadership structures that govern the community giving rise to a distinctive form of biocultural heritage. These systems, and the wells themselves, are increasingly under threat, however, from climate change, demographic growth, and socio-economic development. To contribute to an assessment of the scale, distribution and intensity of these threats, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use land-cover (LULC) and precipitation changes in this semi-arid to arid landscape and their association with, and impact on, the preservation of traditional wells. Multitemporal Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite imagery covering the period 1990 to 2020, analysed at a temporal resolution of 10 years, was classified using supervised classification via the Random Forest machine learning method to extract the following classes: bare land, grassland, shrub land, open forest, closed forest, croplands, settlement and waterbodies. Change detection was then applied to identify and quantify changes through time and landscape degradation indices were generated using the Shannon Diversity Index fragmentation index within a 15 km buffer of each well cluster. The results indicated that land cover change was mostly driven by increasing anthropogenic changes with resultant reduction in natural land cover classes. Furthermore, increased fragmentation has occurred within most of the selected buffer distances of the well clusters. The main drivers of change that have directly or indirectly impacted land degradation and the preservation of indigenous water management systems were identified through an analysis of land cover changes in the last 30 years, supporting insights from previous focused group discussions with communities in Kenya and Ethiopia. Our approach showed that remote sensing methods can be used for the spatially explicit mapping of landscape structure around the wells, and ultimately towards assessment of the preservation status of the indigenous wells.

TI  - Intracellular TLRs of Mast Cells in Innate and Acquired Immunity.
T2  - Handbook of experimental pharmacology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mast cells (MCs) distribute to interface tissues with environment, such as skin, airway, and gut mucosa, thereby functioning as the sentinel against invading allergens and pathogens. To respond to and exclude these external substances promptly, MCs possess granules containing inflammatory mediators, including heparin, proteases, tumor necrosis factor, and histamine, and produce these mediators as a consequence of degranulation within minutes of activation. As a delayed response to external substances, MCs de novo synthesize inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, by sensing pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns through their pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs). A substantial number of studies have reported immune responses by MCs through surface TLR signaling, particularly TLR2 and TLR4. However, less attention has been paid to immune responses through nucleic acid-recognizing intracellular TLRs. Among intracellular TLRs, human and rodent MCs express TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9, but not TLR8. Some virus infections modulate intracellular TLR expression in MCs. MC-derived mediators, such as histamine, cysteinyl leukotrienes, LL-37, and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, have also been reported to modulate intracellular TLR expression in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion. Synthetic ligands for intracellular TLRs and some viruses are sensed by intracellular TLRs of MCs, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including type I interferons. These MC responses initiate and facilitate innate responses and the subsequent recruitment of additional innate effector cells. MCs also associate with the regulation of adaptive immunity. In this overview, the expression of intracellular TLRs in MCs and the recognition of pathogens, including viruses, by intracellular TLRs in MCs were critically evaluated.

AB  - In recent years, remote sensing images have been used for many different applications that require visual analysis and interpretation. In this paper, reducing/removing noise is the basic approach, as it causes loss of information and therefore affects the accuracy of the analyses. Within the scope of the study, two different test areas of land cover/use were applied to examine the effects of noise on optical satellite images. In this context, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellites were used to study the effects of denoising methods on different spatial resolutions. Due to the lack of raw images of the selected satellites, two different types of noise (i.e. Gaussian and Stripe) were added to the images. In this context, four different denoising methods were compared by using conventional filter techniques commonly used in the spatial domain, while also different methods that used different threshold values in the frequency domain. The first approach is Median, Block Matching and 3D Filtering methods in the spatial domain, applications that depend mainly on the neighborhood relationship of pixels in the image. The second approach is wavelet-based Contourlet and Curvelet methods in the frequency domain. The quality analysis of denoised images were evaluated as qualitative (statistical methods Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Mean Square Error, standard deviation, min/max value), and quantitative. Finally, Curvelet hard thresholding transform was the selected method as the best algorithm after quality analysis additionally, the method also effectively preserves edges in homogeneous test area and other fine details in the heterogeneous test area.

TI  - Automated RPCs Bias Compensation for KOMPSAT Imagery Using Orthoimage GCP Chips in Korea
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite images, including KOMPSAT, WorldView-3, and Pleiades, are widely used for mapping and environmental monitoring. In particular, satellite images with high spatial resolution have accurate location information and provide essential spatial information. Most high-resolution satellite image files are provided with rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) that can be used for sensor modeling. However, the RPCs have an initial bias. Therefore, most satellite image platforms and researchers match satellite images to ground control point (GCP) information and perform RPCs bias compensation of images using the matching information. In Korea, an image-based GCP chip database built using orthographic images has been provided for the georegistration of various satellite images. In this manuscript, RPCs bias compensation of KOMPSAT-3A satellite images was performed using the GCP chips, and then, the possibility of automation of RPCs bias compensation through GCP chips was analyzed. Image matching, such as area-based and edge-based techniques, was used, and the results of RPCs bias compensation using the GCP chips were analyzed through experiments for various regions. The automated compensation in both area-based or edge-based matching performed well, achieving accuracy within 1.5 pixels for test areas with various topographic features. However, the forest area posed a challenge, requiring new GCP chips with rich feature information. In addition, edge-based matching showed potentials to overcome large seasonal differences, including snow cover.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to understand the characteristics of Aristotle's view of nature that is, the static view of the universe, and find implications for education. Plato sought to interpret the natural world using a rational approach rather than an incomplete observation, in terms of from the perspective of geometry and mathematical regularity, as the best way to understand the world. On the other hand, Aristotle believed that we could understand the world by observing what we see. This world is a static worldview full of the purpose of the individual with a sense of purposive legitimacy. In addition, the natural motion of earthly objects and celestial bodies, which are natural movements towards the world of order, are the original actions. Aristotle thought that, given the opportunity, all natural things would carry out some movement, that is, their natural movement. Above all, the world that Plato and Aristotle built is a static universe. It is possible to fully grasp the world by approaching the objective nature that exists independently of human being with human reason and observation. After all, for Aristotle, like Plato, their belief that the natural world was subject to regular and orderly laws of nature, despite the complexity of what seemed to be an embarrassingly continual change, became the basis of Western thought. Since the universe, the metaphysical perspective of ancient Greece and modern philosophy, relies on the development of a dichotomy of understanding (cutting branches) into what has already been completed or planned, ideal and inevitable, so it is the basis of traditional teaching-learning that does not value learner’s opinions.

AB  - This study conducted simultaneous experiments using a flood experiment field that can reproduce the conditions of flooded buildings, along with satellite monitoring using the L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) aboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2). Through the experiments, we investigated the relationship between the multi-look number of interferometric processing, flooded building detection using interferometric coherence, and floodwater depth. For a better interpretation of the experiment results, we also performed a theoretical coherence simulation. Our results revealed that 1) coherence statistically depends on the multi-look number, 2) coherence-based change detection method can classify a flooded building with 6 cm or less water depth, and 3) there is no clear correlation between coherence degradation and floodwater depth. These findings will be useful for robust flood-area estimation of actual urban flooding events.

AB  - Increasing human and economic losses from urban disasters demand synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which has all-weather, day-and-night observation capability. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been operating the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2), carrying PALSAR-2, an L-band SAR, for monitoring disasters and environmental changes. We developed the first fully automated algorithms for detecting flood extents and earthquake-induced building damage from ALOS-2 data. The algorithms rapidly process ALOS-2 and ancillary data (flood simulation, hazard map, and other geographical information) and provide damage information less than an hour after the input data are entered. The validation results showed that the accuracy of the estimated flood extent was 60 to 94%, depending on the observation conditions, especially the incidence angle of ALOS-2 observation. The accuracy of the damaged building detection was 72% for buildings with a footprint larger than 200 m(2) in the area. We implemented these algorithms in an operational disaster response system. We launched a one-stop operation that automatically processes ALOS-2 data after emergency observation and provides the damage maps rapidly via email for disaster response workers.

AB  - Changes in the vegetation of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions have been used as indicators of the impact and seriousness of climate change. In this study, 342 MODIS NDVI images were used to monitor and assess the variability and long-term changes in the vegetation in Iceland in the period 2001-2018. An insignificant trend in the changes of the vegetation coverage (R= 0.16, p-value= 0.05) was obtained, however, it also resulted that the area with the low values of the NDVI (< 0.6) is decreasing, whereas the area with higher values of the NDVI (> 0.6, mostly forests) is increasing. The NDVI index during the study period rose for the area of about 3260 km2, while it declined for 1635 km(2). The results of this study can be used for organizing the strategies preventing climate change and global warming.

AB  - Clouds limit the potential use of optical images. Proper clouds and cloud shadows detection are necessary steps for optical image applications. Few algorithms are flexible in detecting clouds in images with a limited number of bands, such as the Wide-Field Imager (WFI) sensor on board the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4), which has four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near-infrared). Therefore, this work aims to assess the accuracy of two cloud detection algorithms: CMASK and ATSA, and evaluate the influence of the ATSA configuration parameters. We selected four regions in Brazil for our analysis. In all cases, ATSA presented overall accuracy (OA) superior to CMASK. While the ATSA obtained OA greater than 0.91 for all analyzes, the OA from CMASK did not exceed 0.84. CMASK presented commission errors for the No Clear class (combination of Cloud and Cloud shadow) and inclusion errors for the Clear class close to zero. However, many errors of omission of clouds misclassified as the Clear class was observed. The ATSA algorithm presented a better balance between inclusion errors and omission errors. Our results can be used as guidance for choosing a cloud mask algorithm for the CBERS-4 WFI images and for analysis considering the images from WFI on board CBERS-4A and Amazonia-1, as they have similar characteristics.

TI  - Ephemeral Surface Chlorophyll Enhancement at the New England Shelf Break Driven by Ekman Restratification
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) hosts a large and productive marine ecosystem supported by high phytoplankton concentrations. Enhanced surface chlorophyll concentrations at the MAB shelf-break front have been detected in synoptic measurements, yet this feature is not present in seasonal means. To understand why, we assess the conditions associated with enhanced surface chlorophyll at the shelf break. We employ in-situ and remote sensing data, and a 2-dimensional model to show that Ekman restratification driven by upfront winds drives ephemerally enhanced chlorophyll concentrations at the shelf-break front in spring. Using 8-day composite satellite-measured surface chlorophyll concentration data from 2003-2020, we constructed a daily running mean (DRM) climatology of the cross-shelf chlorophyll distribution for the northern MAB region. While the frontal enhancement of chlorophyll is apparent in the DRM climatology, it is not captured in the seasonal climatology due to its short duration of less than a week. In-situ measurements of the frontal chlorophyll enhancement reveal that chlorophyll is highest in spring when the shelf-break front slumps offshore from its steep wintertime position causing restratification in the upper part of the water column. Several restratification mechanisms are possible, but the first day of enhanced chlorophyll at the shelf break corresponds to increasing upfront winds, suggesting that the frontal restratification is driven by offshore Ekman transport of the shelf water over the denser slope water. The 2-dimensional model shows that upfront winds can indeed drive Ekman restratification and alleviate light limitation of phytoplankton growth at the shelf-break front.Plain Language Summary The ocean south of New England contains high concentrations of phytoplankton that form the base of the marine food web and provide critical support to the region's fisheries. The offshore edge of the relatively shallow continental shelf, the shelf break, is the boundary between the cooler and fresher water on the continental shelf (shelf water) and the warmer and saltier water offshore (slope water). This water boundary at the shelf break is thought to support high chlorophyll concentrations. Enhanced shelf-break chlorophyll concentrations are not always present, however. We use data from satellites, ships, gliders, and moorings to determine what drives the episodically enhanced surface shelf-break chlorophyll concentrations. We find that the shelf-break surface enhancements of chlorophyll concentrations are short-lived events, and are associated with periods when the shelf-slope water interface slumps, as a surface layer of the lighter shelf water moves over the denser slope water. This process creates a shallow surface layer that has ample light to support photosynthesis. Both data and a computational model show that eastward winds are the primary driver of the episodic frontal slumping and localized enhanced surface chlorophyll.

TI  - Remote sensing of invasive alien woody species in Uruguayan native forests
T2  - AGROCIENCIA URUGUAY
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasion of ecosystems by exotic species has been identified as the second cause of biodiversity loss worldwide, and is one of the most difficult threats to reverse. In Uruguay, the introduction and spread of invasive alien species (IAS) has been identified as a serious environmental problem, becoming perhaps the greatest danger that native forests currently face. IAS often represents optical differences in the forest canopy and can therefore be detected remotely. The two most widespread and aggressive woody IAS in the country's forests are Ligustrum lucidum and Gleditsia triacanthos. The objective of this study was to spatially identify IAS within the native forest of Uruguay, mainly these two species, using remote sensing techniques. This work is based on multispectral data from medium-resolution satellite images (Landsat) and uses the normalized difference fraction index (NDFI) for classification. The NDFI is sensitive to canopy coverage and is calculated through a sub-pixel spectral mixture analysis (SMA), decomposing the reflectance information for each pixel into fractions. The results showed an area of 22,009 ha of native forest invaded by these IAS, with an overall accuracy of 87.6%, representing 2.63% of the total native forest area in the country. The results presented in this work will help to geographically analyze the invasion by IAS in the forest, linking it to possible drivers. Furthermore, this map can now be used as relevant information when designing IAS prevention, mitigation, restoration, and eventual eradication strategies in the country.

TI  - Optical Detection of Marine Debris Using Deep Knockoff
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates the use of deep knockoff, a modern statistical variable selection methodology, to uncover the spectral signatures of marine debris (MD). This method uses a generative model by leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn the high-dimensional distribution of reflectance in visible to near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. To that end, a public dataset obtained from ground-based labeling of the observations by the multispectral instrument (MSI) on-board Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite is used. Through controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), consistent with the known physical causalities, the results indicate that the NIR (band 8, 833 nm) and red (band 4, 665 nm) are the most important bands, respectively, for discrimination of marine (plastic) debris from the background water. In the presence of dense Sargassum macroalgae, the deep knockoff isolates the green (band 3, 560 nm) and the narrow NIR (band 8a, 864.7 nm) as another important band.

TI  - Application of Magnetic Nanoparticles for Rapid Detection and In Situ Diagnosis in Clinical Oncology
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Screening, monitoring, and diagnostic methods in oncology are a critical part of treatment. The currently used clinical methods have limitations, most notably the time, cost, and special facilities required for radioisotope-based techniques. The use of magnetic nanoparticles is an alternative approach that offers faster analyses with safer materials over a wide range of oncological applications, such as the detection of cancer biomarkers and immunostaining. Furthermore, magnetic nanoparticles, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, can detect sentinel lymph nodes for breast cancer in a clinical setting, as well as those for gallbladder cancer in animal models within a timeframe that would enable them to be used during surgery with a magnetic probe. Screening, monitoring, and diagnosis are critical in oncology treatment. However, there are limitations with the current clinical methods, notably the time, cost, and special facilities required for radioisotope-based methods. An alternative approach, which uses magnetic beads, offers faster analyses with safer materials over a wide range of oncological applications. Magnetic beads have been used to detect extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the serum of pancreatic cancer patients with statistically different EV levels in preoperative, postoperative, and negative control samples. By incorporating fluorescence, magnetic beads have been used to quantitatively measure prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a prostate cancer biomarker, which is sensitive enough even at levels found in healthy patients. Immunostaining has also been incorporated with magnetic beads and compared with conventional immunohistochemical methods to detect lesions; the results suggest that immunostained magnetic beads could be used for pathological diagnosis during surgery. Furthermore, magnetic nanoparticles, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), can detect sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer in a clinical setting, as well as those in gallbladder cancer in animal models, in a surgery-applicable timeframe. Ultimately, recent research into the applications of magnetic beads in oncology suggests that the screening, monitoring, and diagnosis of cancers could be improved and made more accessible through the adoption of this technology.

TI  - UNDERSTANDING SPATIAL DRIVERS OF DEFORESTATION IN THE LUKI BIOSPHERE RESERVE, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding factors that are driving land use/land cover change is one of the major steps that should be rationally addressed for the purpose of sustainable management of natural resources. The present study examines four spatial drivers affecting deforestation in the Luki Biosphere Reserve over the last three decades (1987-2020), where forest resources are prone to multiple human pressures compromising their sustainability. These are: distance from the nearest road; population density; elevation; and slope. Change detection analysis was performed on classified Landsat images to generate the Boolean map with two categories including forest change and no change. GIS and topographic data were used to compute spatial drivers of deforestation. Additionally, the logistic regression model was used to assess the effect of the spatial drivers on forest conversion, and determine the drivers that significantly influence forest conversion. The study results revealed a major change in the landscape that led to the loss of forest land, and gain in other land use classes. However, the regression model was statistically significant (p < 0.01), suggesting that all the spatial drivers (independent variables) were significantly related to forest conversion. Distance to roads and population density have been identified as the most significant spatial drivers of deforestation over the last three decades. However, although slope and elevation also significantly affected forest conversion, but when compared to two other variables, their effects were moderate. It has been noted that the impact of these spatial drivers was spatially related to socioeconomic and demographic aspects. This study provides valuable information that could benefit the managers, policy-makers, and local authorities in their decision-making processes, especially for the purpose of environmental monitoring.

TI  - MAPPING OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICE ON PERMANENT GRASSLAND USING SENTINEL-2: A CASE STUDY OF NORTHERN SLOVAKIA
T2  - GEOGRAFICKY CASOPIS-GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a framework for identifying management practices on permanent grasslands based on a time series of remote sensing imagery. We assume that by using such an approach it is possible to check compliance with the legal conditions for granting CAP support for agricultural practices. We evaluated grassland management in the Medzilaborce region with Sentinel-2 optical satellite images. We proposed a set of indicators of mowing and grazing based on a rule-based assessment developed over a visual inspection of true color imagery as well as a phenological time series. We further used a land block database and evaluated the management using a specific traffic light system. We found that the grasslands in the studied area are managed extensively, not within time limits for granting CAP subsidies. Results suggest that this framework underestimates the proportion of the managed area of studied land blocks.

TI  - Mapping Glacial Lakes Using Historically Guided Segmentation Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we compare several approaches to segmenting glacial lakes in the Hindu Kush Himalayas in order to support glacial lake area mapping. More automatic mapping could support risk assessments of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods, a type of natural hazard that poses a risk to communities and infrastructure in valleys below glacial lakes. We propose and evaluate several approaches that incorporate labels from a 2015 survey using Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off imagery to guide segmentation on newer higher resolution satellite images such as Sentinel 2 and Bing Maps imagery, comparing them also to approaches that do not use this form of weak prior. We find that a guided version of U-Net and a properly initialized form of morphological snakes are most effective for these two datasets, respectively, each providing between an 8-10% intersection-over-union improvement over existing U-Net segmentation approaches. An error analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of each method. We design visualizations to support the discovery of lakes of potential concern, including an interactive exploratory interface. All the codes supporting our study are released in public repositories.

CL  - New York, NY
AB  - The demand for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) spaceborne data is on a rise. Cloud cover and sunshine duration are major factors that limit the usability of optical sensors e.g. an annual sunshine in Tokyo, Japan amounts to just 1881 hours, which is approximately 21% of the year. This prohibits reliable satellite monitoring. Our mission is to provide dependable Earth data regardless of weather and time of the day by the construction of the SAR satellite constellation. These small-size satellites are designed to achieve sub-daily revist, while keeping the overall mission cost low. We expect that the insights provided by frequent Earth monitoring will improve private-, business-, and government decision making resulting in more resilient economies and supporting sustainable development. We have launched our first demonstration satellite - StriX-alpha- in December 2020 and are preparing to launch a second satellite - StriX-beta- in early 2022. Our ultimate goal is to build a constellation - StriX consisting of 30 satellites. The name StriX was inspired by the genus of owls, which are known for their ability to see in the dark. In this paper, we will discuss a demonstration satellite's specifications and follow with the on-orbit calibration based on Amazon rainforest observations. Finally, example observations of oil spills off the coast of Syria will be presented.

TI  - Personal identity in the space of virtual culture: on the example of geek and glam subcultures
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The article presents exploring the cultural and anthropological traits of consumers and producers of cultural services and products in the digital epoch. There have been singled out two types of cultural subjectivity according to the aim of a person's activity in the virtual net: either production of things, services, and technologies or the consumption and creative use of all mentioned innovations. So these sociocultural formations are called "geek" and "chic" subcultures. Theoretical basis. The historical genealogy of the definitions was analyzed, so as the changes in social esteem of the contribution of geeky persons to modern art and design practices. Social and cultural identities of those who belong to the modern youth-subcultural communities have been formed according to the topology and temporality of digital trends. To explain the worldview characteristics of the members of those subcultures the concept of "the New Middle Ages" was used to discover the values and pursuits of those who represent geek and chic subcultures. The study is based on the theoretical works of such classical authors as A. Toffler, and Z. Bauman, as well as current investigators of youth cultures. They are Calum Finister, Thomas V. Pollet, Nick Neave, Jessica McCain, Billy Wong. The chic subculture is oriented toward the imitation of visual images, consumer habits, and the way of life of successful (or seemed to be such) people. Glamorous followers need to receive approvals and likes from like-minded people. The geek subculture is more inner-sense-oriented. It unites intellectuals and activists who have common creative intentions. Originality. There have been analyzed the main attributes and features of such modern subcultures were conditionally named chic and geek. They were analyzed in the context of the concept of the New Middle Ages. Conclusions. The virtual user's life world seems to be diverse only quantitatively, but qualitatively it is as narrow, mythopoetic, and esoterically uncritical as the world of the Medieval person, who used to live the whole life in the same place, mai in one's village. But thanks to the merger of the IT industry with effective social management, the geek culture becomes a powerful super-subculture that defends values of social good, industrial productivity, and cultural creativity. Chic subculture creates new trends in fashion and art discourse. It develops modern lifestyles, its visual images with which our era will be associated in the future.

TI  - Detection of lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer using the new system of one-step nucleic acid amplification assay
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer greatly depends on the presence of lymph node metastasis, which limits the need for surgery and adjuvant therapy for advanced cancer. One-step nucleic acid amplification of cytokeratin19 (CK19) mRNA was used to detect lymph node metastasis. Automated Gene Amplification Detector RD-200 and the LYNOAMP CK19 gene amplification reagent as components of the new one-step nucleic acid amplification system, which has increased gene amplification efficiency by improving the reagent composition, have shorter preprocessing and measurement times than conventional systems. We aimed to compare the clinical performance of the new system with that of histopathology and the conventional system. Materials and methods199 lymph nodes from 58 non-small cell lung cancer patients who underwent lymph node dissection were examined intraoperatively using the new system, conventional system, and histopathology. ResultsLymph node metastasis was diagnosed in 32, 42, and 44 patients using histopathological analysis, the new system, and the conventional system, respectively. Compared with histopathological analysis, the concordance rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the new system were 92.0%, 90.6%, 92.2%, 69.0%, and 98.1%, respectively, and compared with the conventional system, the values were 95.0%, 86.4%, 97.4%, 90.5%, and 96.2%, respectively. ConclusionThe clinical performance of the new one-step nucleic acid amplification system in detecting lymph node metastasis of lung cancer is comparable to that of histopathology and the conventional system; its performance was sufficient for determining the appropriate clinical treatment. The new rapid system can be effectively utilized during lung cancer treatment intraoperatively and postoperatively.

AB  - This paper combines fisheries dependent data and environmental data to be used in a machine learning pipeline to predict the spatiotemporal abundance of two species (plaice and sole) commonly caught by the Belgian fishery in the North Sea. By combining fisheries related features with environmental data, sea bottom temperature derived from remote sensing, a higher accuracy can be achieved. In a forecast setting, the predictive accuracy is further improved by predicting, using a recurrent deep neural network, the sea bottom temperature up to four days in advance instead of relying on the last previous temperature measurement.

TI  - Has the growth of cities in Ghana anything to do with reduction in farm size and food production in peri-urban areas? A study of Bolgatanga Municipality
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Growth and expansion of urban areas often result in dramatic transformation of land use in cities in Ghana with implications for farming and food production, which is a major livelihood activity for some of the inhabitants. This study assessed the implications of urban growth on farming and food crop production in Bolgatanga Municipality using a mixed method research design. Household interview schedule and key informant interviews were employed in the collection of primary data. In addition, multi-temporal satellite data was used to analyze land use and land cover change in the Municipality. The findings revealed that urban growth, resulting from increase in population, residential and commercial developments, seem to engulf agricultural activities. There has been a dramatic expansion of built-up areas in the Municipality with adverse implications for farming and food production in the future. The study concludes that continuous unguided conversion of farmlands, woodland and shrubs into built-up areas in the Municipality is detrimental to farming and food production. The formulation and implementation of an urban planning policy, by the Municipal Assembly in conjunction with the Land Use and Spatial Planning Department and the Municipal Department of Agriculture, that incorporates zoning of fertile lands for farming purposes and encourages best farming practices is recommended.

AB  - Using on-demand processing pipelines to generate virtual geospatial products is beneficial to optimizing resource management and decreasing processing requirements and data storage space. Additionally, pre-processed products improve data quality for data-driven analytical algorithms, such as machine learning or deep learning models. This paper proposes a method to integrate virtual products based on integrating open-source processing pipelines. In order to validate and evaluate the functioning of this approach, we have integrated it into a geo-imagery management framework based on Open Data Cube (ODC). To validate the methodology, we have performed three experiments developing on-demand processing pipelines using multi-sensor remote sensing data, for instance, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. These pipelines are integrated using open-source processing frameworks.

TI  - The Rebirth of My Beliefs
T2  - NEIZVESTNYI DOSTOEVSKII-THE UNKNOWN DOSTOEVSKY
M3  - Book Review
AB  - The article examines the scientific publication "F. M. Dostoevsky. "The Rebirth of My Beliefs,"" prepared for the 200th anniversary of the great writer by the Tyumen Regional Public Charitable Foundation "Rebirth of Tobolsk" in cooperation with scientists from Petrozavodsk State University and the Department of Manuscripts of the Russian State Library. It is an edition that contains commentated letters by F. M. Dostoevsky from Siberia to his brother M. M. Dostoevsky, dated January 30 - February 22, 1854, N. D. Fonvizina (a letter written in the second decade of February 1854) and A. N. Maykov, dated January 18, 1856 in pre-revolutionary and modern orthography; their facsimile is attached to the publication of letters. This example of Dostoevsky epistolary work is of interest as the most important evidence of the profound shifts in the writer's worldview during the years of Omsk penal servitude: the transition from the fascination with French theoretical socialism of the 1830s and 1840s to the soil-based Orthodoxy. The painstaking work of textual specialists contributed to the clarification of many incorrect readings of the published letters. For the first time, several fragments of the Siberian epistolary deleted by Dostoevsky have been correctly restored in the publication. The merits of the anniversary edition should include its experimental, highly artistic design (designed by graphic artist V. E. Valerius).

TI  - Mapping Aquaculture Ponds for the Coastal Zone of Asia with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Asia dominates the world's aquaculture sector, generating almost 90 percent of its total annual global production. Fish, shrimp, and mollusks are mainly farmed in land-based pond aquaculture systems and serve as a primary protein source for millions of people. The total production and area occupied for pond aquaculture has expanded rapidly in coastal regions in Asia since the early 1990s. The growth of aquaculture was mainly boosted by an increasing demand for fish and seafood from a growing world population. The aquaculture sector generates income and employment, contributes to food security, and has become a billion-dollar industry with high socio-economic value, but has also led to severe environmental degradation. In this regard, geospatial information on aquaculture can support the management of this growing food sector for the sustainable development of coastal ecosystems, resources, and human health. With free and open access to the rapidly growing volume of data from the Copernicus Sentinel missions as well as machine learning algorithms and cloud computing services, we extracted coastal aquaculture at a continental scale. We present a multi-sensor approach that utilizes Earth observation time series data for the mapping of pond aquaculture within the entire Asian coastal zone, defined as the onshore area up to 200 km from the coastline. In this research, we developed an object-based framework to detect and extract aquaculture at a single-pond level based on temporal features derived from high-spatial-resolution SAR and optical satellite data acquired from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. In a second step, we performed spatial and statistical data analyses of the Earth-observation-derived aquaculture dataset to investigate spatial distribution and identify production hotspots at various administrative units at regional, national, and sub-national scale.

AB  - Deep learning-based methods have shown great progress in remote sensing applications. The performance of such methods can significantly outperform traditional remote sensing methods under the condition of the availability of large datasets for training. Unfortunately, some remote sensing tasks, such as the change detection task, lack large established datasets. This issue is due to the limited access to some remote sensing data and the absence of a sufficient labeled dataset. Data augmentation techniques are generally used to tackle this issue by increasing the number of samples and enhancing the quality of the training data. These techniques have shown performance improvement for general data and have recently been applied to remote sensing data. The present survey synthesizes the recent data augmentation works contributed to the remote sensing field. It briefly describes data-level issues, existing data augmentation techniques used to address these issues, and challenges facing these techniques. This review provides the reader with an idea about the influence of data augmentation techniques on the performances of deep learning models, especially while using a small amount of data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Religious coping can be seen as a method which applies religious resources, including prayer, and trust and appeals to God, in order to deal with stressful situations.AIM: To gain insight into the associations between religious coping styles and mental health and to investigate whether the use of the coping styles differs between mental health care clients and non-mental health care clients with a Christian background.METHOD: The sample consisted of 655 Dutch participants with a Christian worldview, aged 18 to 79 years (M = 42.6, SD = 14.2). 60.9% were female and 49.5% higher educated. Intra- and extramural clients in mental health care were involved. A cross-sectional, online survey was used, combined with an available client database.RESULTS: More use of the collaborative coping style was associated with less psychological complaints. More use of the (passive-)deferring and selfdirecting coping styles was associated with more psychological complaints. Christian mental health care clients used the collaborative and the deferring coping styles less often compared to Christian non-clients.CONCLUSION: The collaborative religious coping style is positively associated with mental health. Mental health care clients amongst them use this style less often compared to non-clients. Awareness of religious coping styles and appropriate support are indicated.

AB  - Reducing methane emissions is essential to tackle climate change. Here, we address the problem of detecting automatically large methane leaks using hyperspectral data from the Level 1B product of the Sentinel-5P satellite. To do this, two features of TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), the Sentinel-5P satellite sensor, are exploited. The first one is the fine spectral sampling of the data which allows to isolate features of the methane absorption spectrum in the shortwave infrared wavelength range (SWIR). The second one is the daily coverage of the whole Earth which allows to perform time series analysis. Our method involves three main steps: i) a pixel reconstruction, ii) an angle correction and iii) a plume detection with a time series. In the first step, a simplified absorption model is inverted to recover, for each pixel, a coefficient representative of the presence of methane which we call the methane coefficient. In the second step, a correction is made to the methane coefficient to take into account the viewing angle of the satellite. In the third step, the obtained coefficient is normalized spatially and then the detection is carried out pixel by pixel, by looking for anomalies in a time series. We validate our method by comparing the detected plumes against a recently published dataset of plumes manually detected in the Sentinel-5P L2 methane product. We then show how our method can complement the Sentinel-5P L2 methane product for the detection of methane plumes.

AB  - This study compares four machine-learning algorithms comprising of Classification And Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification of urban land-use and land-cover (LULC) features. Using multitemporal and multisensor Landsat data from 1984-2020 at 5-year intervals for the Greater Gaborone Planning Area (GGPA) in Botswana, the aim of the study is to determine the performance of the classifiers in the extraction of different urban LULC features as built-up, bare-soil, water, grass, shrubs and forest. The results show that for mapping built-up areas, RF and SVM presented the best results with overall accuracy of 85%. Bare soil is best mapped using RF and CART with accuracy of up to 98%, while SVM and GTB were most suitable for mapping water bodies. The suitable classifiers for mapping the vegetation classes were RF for grass (94.5%), SVM for shrubland (81.5%) and GTB for forest (84.3%). In terms of class specific accuracy, RF achieved the highest performance with average overall accuracy (OA) of 95.9%, SVM (95.8%), GTB (95.6%) and CART (95.1%). The same performance pattern was observed from the F1-score, True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR) and Area under ROC curve (AUC) metrices for the class classification accuracies. The overall accuracy for the eight-epoch years were RF (87.8%), SVM (87.5%), GTB (86.4%) and CART (85.3%). To improve on the urban LULC mapping, the study proposes the post-classification feature fusion of the best classifier results.

TI  - Soil Erosion Susceptibility Prediction in Railway Corridors Using RUSLE, Soil Degradation Index and the New Normalized Difference Railway Erosivity Index (NDReLI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a remote sensing-based index for the prediction of soil erosion susceptibility within railway corridors. The empirically derived index, Normalized Difference Railway Erosivity Index (NDReLI), is based on the Landsat-8 SWIR spectral reflectances and takes into account the bare soil and vegetation reflectances especially in semi-arid environments. For the case study of the Botswana Railway Corridor (BRC), the NDReLI results are compared with the RUSLE and the Soil Degradation Index (SDI). The RUSLE model showed that within the BRC, the mean annual soil loss index was at 0.139 ton ha(-1) year(-1), and only about 1% of the corridor area is susceptible to high (1.423-3.053 ton ha(-1) year(-1)) and very high (3.053-5.854 ton ha(-1) year(-1)) soil loss, while SDI estimated 19.4% of the railway corridor as vulnerable to soil degradation. NDReLI results based on SWIR1 (1.57-1.65 mu m) predicted the most vulnerable areas, with a very high erosivity index (0.36-0.95), while SWIR2 (2.11-2.29 mu m) predicted the same regions at a high erosivity index (0.13-0.36). From empirical validation using previous soil erosion events within the BRC, the proposed NDReLI performed better than the RUSLE and SDI models in the prediction of the spatial locations and extents of susceptibility to soil erosion within the BRC.

AB  - The rapid increase of offshore wind installations in the south-China sea near the coast triggers a new demand for studying the effects of horizontal wind speed gradients and the wind power variation within the coastal zone. The advent of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data offers an opportunity to map wind speed gradients and wind farm wakes with high spatial resolution. We have retrieved wind maps at 10 m above mean sea level (m.s.l.) from Sentinel-1 SAR and Envisat Advanced SAR observations. Generally, the speed of the prevailing south-easterly winds and wind power declined about 8% and 22%, respectively. Although the southern offshore wind farms (OWFs) were not in operation before December 2019, the wind velocity deficit at the upstream side of northern OWFs were between 8-12 %. After the southern OWFs became online, the region between OWFs is subjected to wind wakes and coastal upwelling effects. The coastal upwelling phenomena speeds up the wind at the downstream sides of OWFs that reduce the wind wakes up to 8-10%. The wind wakes extended 20 km beyond the southern OWFs.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PIT LATRINES USING REMOTE SENSING AND MULTI-CRITERIA SPATIAL ANALYSIS IN ULAANBAATAR (GER AREA), MONGOLIA

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the environmental impact of pit latrines of ger-sprawl district areas (low rise sprawl area with detached "ger"- nomad's mobile tent surrounded by fences or with handmade dwellings) in Ulaanbaatar capital city of Mongolia using remotely sensed data and multi-criteria spatial analysis. Within the last two decades, the residential areas without infrastructure have been significantly expanded and changed due to the migration of people from rural areas. 50.1% of the total population of Ulaanbaatar city is lives in ger district areas. Due to the formation of unstructured residential areas, pollution from pit latrines poses a risk to the urban environment and human health by infiltrating shallow water, being carried by floodwaters, and being released into the air. Therefore, to reduce the number of pit latrines in ger areas, the total number and location of pit latrines in the city were determined using high-resolution satellite imagery. In addition, spatial multi-criteria analysis methods were used to assess the negative impact of pit latrines on the environment and human health and categorize them into four zones. A total of 144,992 pit latrines were counted in Ulaanbaatar, with 9,443 pit latrines in Zone IV, 43,377 pit latrines in Zone III, 71150 pit latrines in Zone II, and 21,022 pit latrines in Zone I. The results of this study are important for implementing management measures to reduce soil pollution, such as restricting and banning the use of pit latrines in ger areas, installing toilets that meet MNS 5924: 2015 standards, and carrying out disinfection.

AB  - - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the effect of ketogenic and West-ern diets on pressure wounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This random-ized controlled study used 33 male Sprague-Daw-ley rats. They were randomly divided into the con-trol, ketogenic, and Western diet groups. Pres-sure wounds were created on the rats' backs. RESULTS: Wound healing of the Western diet group on day 42 was better than the ketogenic and standard groups. In the microscopic exam-inations, wound closure, damaged muscle tis-sue repair, angiogenesis, vascularization, gran-ulation, and collagenization in the Western di-et group were faster than in the ketogenic and standard groups. CONCLUSION: The Western diet was po-tentially effective for pressure wound healing. Future research should be conducted to clari- fy how this affects the wound-healing process.

TI  - Maxim Gorky and Immanuel Kant: The Discussion about the Nature of Creativity in the "Story about a Novel" (Berlin, 1924)
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article contains the analysis of the influence of Immanuel Kant's philosophy on the work of A. M. Gorky. The author deals with the aesthetic aspect of the influence of Kant's philosophy on Maxim Gorky's prose, in particular, in the German period of Gorky's work. Gorky's heritage is perceived in the light of Immanuel Kant's influence. It opens up points of contact and moments of antagonism, reflected not only in Gorky's personal understanding of Kant (which is found in Gorky's correspondence with A. A. Bogdanov, M. M. Prishvin, A. K. Vinogradov, L. F. Khinkulova and others), but also in Gorky's artistic works. The author analyzes the writer's worldview in comparison with Kant's views, and also revealed that Immanuel Kant's philosophy played a vital part in Gorky's formation as a writer. A special case of this influence is the text "A Story about a Novel". This text is analyzed in more detail. Gorky's disagreement with some of the statements of Kant's philosophy (concerning the nature of creativity and aesthetic views) was largely revealed in this text. The author shows that the rejection of some aspects of Immanuel Kant's philosophy related to the understanding of creativity is caused not only by ideological differences, such as the difference in understanding the world and man, but also with different attitudes to aesthetics and the nature of creativity. The article is included in the current scientific context, as it allows us to understand Gorky's work differently. In addition, it indicates that Gorky's "rejection" of Kant's philosophy is also connected with theoretical and literary concepts, including the creative strategy of the writer, the features and nature of his prose, as well as fundamental discrepancy in the understanding of artistic creativity.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-COGRAFYA DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the bathymetry of shallow waters is important for managing coastal areas, river basins, and water resources. However, economic and practical difficulties in collecting bathymetric data cause disruptions in bathymetric studies. To overcome these challenges, a recent focus has involved the use of remote sensing technology as an alternative approach to the bathymetric mapping of shallow waters. This study uses Landsat-5 TM satellite imagery, which is free and open data, to determine the digital bathymetric model (DBM) of Atikhisar Reservoir. The study also uses the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to determine the reservoir's surface area and the Stumpf algorithm to perform the bathymetric mapping. Satellite image-based DBMs were obtained using the linear regression equations created from the blue/green log-ratio values from the Landsat-5 TM satellite image and the values obtained from a 1/5000 scale digital bathymetric map for five different training reference point sets. The root mean square error (RMSE) values were calculated by comparing the DBMs with the test data. The model with the best results showed the regression determination coefficient (R2) to be 0.701 and the RMSE to be 2.1 m. These results reveal the potential of low-cost bathymetric map production for preliminary investigation and general evaluation in reservoirs with easy data processing from Landsat images.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating gross primary production (GPP), the gross uptake of CO2 by vegetation, is a fundamental prerequisite for understanding and quantifying the terrestrial carbon cycle. Over the last decade, multiple approaches have been developed to derive spatiotemporal dynamics of GPP combining in situ observations and remote sensing data using machine learning techniques or semiempirical models. However, no high spatial resolution GPP product exists so far that is derived entirely from satellite-based remote sensing data. Sentinel-2 satellites are expected to open new opportunities to analyze ecosystem processes with spectral bands chosen to study vegetation between 10- and 20-m spatial resolutions with five-day revisit frequency. Of particular relevance is the availability of red-edge bands that are suitable for deriving estimates of canopy chlorophyll content that are expected to be much better than any previous global mission. Here, we analyzed whether red-edge-based and near-infrared-based vegetation indices (VIs) or machine learning techniques that consider VIs, all spectral bands, and their nonlinear interactions could predict daily GPP derived from 58 eddy covariance sites. Using linear regressions based on classic VIs, including near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), we achieved prediction powers of R-10-fold(2) = 0.51 and an RMSE10-fold = 2.95 [mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)] in a 10-fold cross validation. Chlorophyll index red (CIR) and the novel kernel NDVI (kNVDI) achieved significantly higher prediction powers of around R-10-fold(2) approximate to 0.61 and RMSE10-fold approximate to 2.57 [mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)]. Using all spectral bands and VIs jointly in a machine learning prediction framework allowed us to predict GPP with R-10-fold(2) = 0.71 and RMSE10-fold = 2.68 [mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)]. Despite the high-power prediction when machine learning techniques are used, under water-stress scenarios or heat waves, optical information alone is not enough to predict GPP properly. In general, our analyses show the potential of nonlinear combinations of spectral bands and VIs for monitoring GPP across ecosystems at a level of accuracy comparable to previous works, which, however, required additional meteorological drivers.

AB  - Tackling the accelerated human-induced biodiversity loss requires tools able to map biodiversity and its changes globally. Remote sensing (RS) offers unique capabilities of characterizing Earth surfaces; therefore, it could map plant biodiversity continuously and globally. This approach is supported by the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), which states that spectra and species (taxonomic and trait) diversities are linked through environmental heterogeneity. In this work, we evaluate the capability of the DESIS hyperspectral imager to capture plant diversity patterns as measured in dedicated plots of the network FunDivEUROPE. We computed functional and taxonomical diversity metrics from field taxonomic, structural, and foliar measurements in vegetation plots sampled in Spain and Romania. In addition, we also computed functional diversity metrics both from the DESIS reflectance factors and from vegetation parameters estimated via inversion of a radiative transfer model. Results showed that only metrics computed from spectral reflectance were able to capture taxonomic variability in the area. However, the lack of sensitivity was related to the insufficient plot size and the lack of spatial match between remote sensing and field data, but also the differences between the information contained in the field traits and remote sensing data, and the potential uncertainties in the remote estimates of vegetation parameters. Thus, while DESIS showed some sensitivity to plant diversity, further efforts are needed to deploy suitable biodiversity evaluation and validation plots and networks that support the development of biodiversity remote sensing products.

AB  - Anthropocene is the name of a new geological era proposed to reflect the phenomenon that human scientific, industrial, and economic activities leave indelible traces on Earth. Anthropocene has been a scientific concept, a new worldview and a paradigm for knowledge production, pursuing a new convergent approach to the Earth and humans, and has played a leading role in relational turn, academically calling for fundamental revision on human-centered social science research and modernity itself. Although it originally started in the field of natural science, it is emerging as a paradigm of "disaster response" to diagnose and overcome the Earth's crisis in various fields such as humanities, social sciences, and arts. In this paper, I would like to question the meaning of resilience that is necessary for disaster response from the perspective of the island that is emerging as an important sign and site of the anthropological crisis. In modernist thinking, the island has been understood to be isolated, backward, dependent, and vulnerable, but in the prospective of the Anthropocene Island, the island is viewed as a space for alternative thinking and practice. This paper seeks to find a clue to overcome the Anthropocene crisis through this new approach to the island.

Biotechnological advances have been implemented for diagnostic confirmation and the capacity of the national laboratory network has been expanded, maintaining efficiency, considering the diverse and complex realities of each region, and overcoming difficulties regarding communication and articulation between institutions. It is necessary to consolidate this system, with collaborative and coordinated work between its components, boosting its effectiveness and timeliness and promoting genomic surveillance of new viruses and variants, as is currently the case with SARS-CoV-2.

Two stacks of ascending and descending Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are processed with a small baseline multitemporal approach. A simple method to select interferograms with high coherence and eliminated images with low redundancy is implemented to optimize the interferogram netwrork. The estimated displacement maps and time series show the effect of both linear and impulsive ground motion and are validated against Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements.

TI  - Towards airborne laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy: A signal recovery method for LIBS instruments subjected to vibrations
T2  - SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sample or instrument vibrations can scatter laser impacts across the sample surface, which increases the un-certainty of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) measurements. The common sources of noise associ-ated to mechanical vibration are described and a method for isolating LIBS measurements from artifacts introduced by such fluctuations is presented. The approach circumvents the use of mechanical stabilizers by leveraging simple components common in LIBS systems. A camera was used to capture close-up images of the sample for each laser shot and the laser spot position in the sample surface was measured using common image processing techniques. By associating spectra with spatial coordinates in the sample surface, it was possible to reduce the relative standard deviation of the Cu(I) 427.51 nm signal in a patterned Cu/Al sample from 122.0% to 53.31%, similar to that measured for a pure Cu sample in the same vibration conditions. The spatial resolution of the method was found to depend on the laser spot diameter, the illuminance at the sample, the camera sensitivity and trigger insertion delay, and the speed of the laser beam sweeping the sample surface. The spatial resolution obtained with the setup used was & PLUSMN;0.6 mm at 15 m, i.e., 40 mu m per meter of separation between the instrument and the sample with a vibration speed limit of 12 cm.s(-1).

AB  - Using Sentinel-1 satellite data, differential interferometric synthetic- aperture-radar (DInSAR) retrieval techniques at C band are presented to estimate snowpack depth, combined with SAR backscattered data for wet snow discrimination and a physically based snowpack model. Optical satellite data from satellite multispectral imagers are used for snow extent mapping. The processing chain is tested in central Apennines (Italy), using several validation sites where in-situ snow measurements are daily available during the winter 2018-19. The potential of using analytical and statistical inversion algorithms, trained by forward SAR and snowpack model simulations of the same area, is discussed. Results, in terms of error bias, standard deviation and correlation between estimated and in situ snow data, are illustrated pointing out critical issues due to coherence loss.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a hybrid incoherent-coherent change detection (CD) approach to retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) from Sentinel-1 data. It combines time-series observations of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter and interferometric closure phase to deliver a method that does not require external calibration. A proof-of-concept assessment based on synthetic and experimental data is presented. Sentinel-1 and in situ data over a study site in Southern Italy during the Winter-Spring season 2017 that covered both bare and vegetated soil conditions have been acquired and analyzed. For bare soils, results indicate good performance, that is, Pearson correlation approximate to 0.8 and root mean square error (RMSE) approximate to 0.05 m(3)/m(3). Conversely, over vegetated surfaces, poor results are found.

AB  - This paper deals with the analysis of the backscattering sensitivity at C and X bands to the agricultural crop characteristics and the implementation of a method for estimating crop biomass. The study areas were located in Tuscany (Central Italy) close to Florence. Series of Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed images have been collected for several years.An accurate crop classification method was first realized in order to separate crops characterized by different scattering behaviors, namely broad- and narrow-leaf crops.The backscattering trends have been simulated by using electromagnetic models based on radiative transfer theory. Algorithms based on Neural Network approaches have been implemented for estimating the crop biomass by using multifrequency and multi-polarization SAR data at C and X band.

AB  - The research results described in this paper have been obtained in the framework of the 2019-2022 ALGORITMI project between the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and the Institute of Applied Physics of the National Research Council (CNR-IFAC). The focus of the research was the development of innovative algorithms for the estimation of geophysical parameters of soil, snow, and vegetation with the aim of monitoring soil, snow cover and agricultural crop conditions.The estimation of soil moisture, vegetation biomass, snow water equivalent, and crop classification was improved by using retrieval algorithms based on machine- learning approaches and temporal series of SAR images from COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and Sentinel-1 (S-1) missions, along with optical images from Sentinel-2. This paper provides an overview of the most recent and valuable results obtained during the project. In particular, the validation of soil moisture provided R=0.89 and RMSE=0.025 m(3)/m(3) by integrating data from S-1 and CSK and that one of snow water equivalent gave R=0.85 with RMSE=86.24 mm (CSK HIMAGE) and R=0.86 with RMSE=71.59 mm (CSK PP). Early mapping results showed an almost monotonic progression in overall accuracy over time higher than 90% by increasing the available images.

TI  - Data from: Multi-decadal changes in phytoplankton biomass in northern temperate lakes as seen through the prism of landscape properties
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Ecologists collectively predict that climate change will enhance phytoplankton biomass in northern lakes. Yet there are unique variations in the structures and regulating functions of lakes to make this prediction challengeable and, perhaps, inaccurate. We used archived Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite products to estimate epilimnetic chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass in 281 northern temperate lakes over 28 years. We explored the influence of climate (air temperature, precipitation) and landscape proxies for nutrient sources (proportion of wetlands in a contributing catchment, size of the littoral zone, potential for wind-driven sediment resuspension as estimated by the dynamic ratio) or nutrient sinks (lake volume) in a random forest model to explain heterogeneity in peak Chl-a. Lakes with higher Chl-a (median Chl-a = 2.4 mug L-1, n = 40) had smaller volumes ([less than]44 * 104 m3) and were more sensitive to increases in temperature. In contrast, lakes with lower Chl-a (median Chl-a = 0.6 mug L-1, n = 241) had larger volumes (≥ 44 * 104 m3), contributing catchments with smaller proportions of wetlands ([less than] 4.5% of catchment area, n = 70), smaller littoral zones ([less than] 16.4 ha, n = 137), minimal wind-driven sediment resuspension (as defined by the dynamic ratio; [less than] 0.45, n = 232), and were more sensitive to increases in precipitation. Lakes with larger volumes were generally less responsive to climate factors; however, large volume lakes with a significant proportion of wetlands and larger littoral zones behaved similarly to lakes with smaller volumes. Our finding that lakes with different landscape properties respond differently to climate factors may help predict the susceptibility of lakes to eutrophication under changing climate conditions. Air temperature and precipitation data were extracted from 60-arcsecond historical monthly air temperature and precipitation grids for each of 281 study lakes. Landscape factors (e.g., lake volume, depth, lake catchment size) were extracted using Digital Terrain Models (DEMs) for the province of Ontario (Canada) and georeferenced and digitized countour maps. The calculation of all factors was performed in ArcGIS 10.8 and Excel. Statistical analysis was performed in R 3.6.0. Copyright: MIT License Open Access

AB  - The main objectives of the Sentinel-3 mission are to support ocean forecasting systems, environmental and climate monitoring. However, the coverage of the visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with a 300 meter resolution and a revisit period of less than 2 days make it very appealing also for vegetation monitoring. In this paper we explore the possibility of using the Sentinel-3 Synergy surface directional reflectances and the PROSAIL model to reliably estimate biophysical variables in general and live fuel moisture content in particular. The latter is a fundamental variable in fire behaviour models and in fire danger assessment, and consequently of high interest in fire management activities. We performed a Global Sensitivity Analysis to identify the most significant PROSAIL parameters in each Synergy channel, and tested the results by implementing a simple Look-Up Table based retrieval algorithm. The outcome shows the potential of biophysical parameter estimation based on this Sentinel-3 product.

AB  - Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer(AVHRR) has accumulated nearly 40 years of data, making it essential for long time series snow monitoring. However, the majority of AVHRR snow algorithms and products are binary forms, which can have a significant impact on hydrological process simulations and estimates of water and energy cycles. Based on AVHRR data, three fractional snow cover retrieval algorithms are implemented in this study: the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis algorithm based on automatic endmember extraction (MEAMA-AGE), the Snow Index method and the Snow/no-Snow Two-endmember model algorithm. In order to compare and verify the accuracy of the three fractional snow cover retrieval algorithms, we use the high spatial resolution Landsat-8 image snow cover retrieval results as the "ground truth". The results show that all three algorithms can effectively retrieve fractional snow cover from AVHRR data, among which the Snow Index method and the Two-endmember model algorithm have higher accuracy, while the MESMA-AGE algorithm has lower precision due to the influence of the endmembers representation.

TI  - Systematic Geolocation Errors of FengYun-3D MERSI-II
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geolocation accuracy is a critical issue for remote sensing applications. To achieve subpixel accuracy, geolocation errors need to be systematically identified and corrected. In this study, we propose a geometric sensor model for FengYun-3D (FY-3D) MERSI-II, a second-generation visible (VIS)/infrared (IR) spectroradiometer, to generate the geolocation lookup table (GLT). The geometric sensor model retrieves the imaging rays from the focal plane to the K-mirrors, 45 degrees scanning mirrors, the platform, and the earth's surface. After refining the attitude errors with ground control points (GCPs), the rigorous sensor model can achieve subpixel geolocation accuracy. However, significant systematic geolocation errors were identified from the residuals, especially for the area with large view angles. To study the errors of MERSI-II, we proposed a homogenous coordinate in the focal plane. As proven by both theory and experiments, the attitudes were adjusted to a wrong value and introduced systematic errors when there were principal point errors. The pitch angle error of K-mirrors caused the oscillation in the flight direction. The principal distance error introduced line coordinate-related error in the flight direction. Meanwhile, the initial phase angle error between the K-mirror and 45 degrees scanning mirrors caused the line coordinate-related errors in the scanning direction. After correcting all the above-mentioned errors, the systematic geolocation errors of MERSI-II were removed. With 23 independent datasets, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 250 m bands were approximately 0.4 pixels, 100 m at nadir.

TI  - Band-to-Band Registration of FY-1C/D Visible-IR Scanning Radiometer High-Resolution Picture Transmission Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The visible-IR scanning radiometer (VIRR) of FY1-C/D meteorological satellites consists of 10 bands with 4 different focal plane assemblies (FPAs). However, there are significant band-to-band registration (BBR) errors between different bands, which cannot be compensated for by a simple shift in the along-scan direction. A rigorous BBR frame was proposed to analyze the sources of misregistration in the whisk-broom camera. According to theory, the 45 degrees scanning mirror introduces tangent function style misregistration in the along-track direction and secant function style misregistration in the across-track direction between different bands if the bands are not in the same optical axis. As proven by the experiments of both FY-1C and FY-1D, the image rotation caused by the 45 degrees scanning mirrors plays a major role in the misregistration. However, misregistration between different FPAs does not strictly adhere to this theory. Therefore, a polynomial-based co-registration method was proposed to model the BBR errors for the VIRR. To achieve 0.1 pixel accuracy, a fourth-degree polynomial was used for BBR in the along-scan direction, and a fifth-degree polynomial was used for the along-track direction. For the reflective bands, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of misregistration could be improved from 3 pixels to 0.11 pixels. Limited by matching accuracy, the RMSEs of misregistration between thermal bands and reflective bands were approximately 0.2 to 0.4 pixels, depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.

AB  - Ecological assets are an important material base of the national economy and sustainable social development. Shangri-La, China is an important area of forest and farmland that has been returned to forest, but the ecological environment is fragile. It is urgent to start to an ecological asset values estimation study. Choosing remote sensing data, meteorological data, surface observations and statistics as the data sources. The results show: (1) From the perspective of ecological assets, adjusting climate and water conservation contribute the most.(2) In the context of single ecological asset value per unit area, the sequence from highest to lowest is the following, water conservation > adjusting climate > soil and water conservation > production of organic matter > nutrient circulation > cultural entertainment.(3) From the perspective of the type of ecological system, forest and shrub grassland contribute the most. (4) From the value of ecological assets per unit area of each ecosystem type, agricultural land > forest > shrub grassland > waters > wetland > artificial land > permanent snow glacier > unutilized land. It is particularly significant for people to make reasonable decisions when exploiting and utilizing natural resources which can be aided by an ecological asset values estimation study.

AB  - Land cover classification is important for effectively protecting and developing land resources. This study investigates the joint use of the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data in land cover classification with random forest (RF) in Yunnan province, China, to explore the application potential of photon counting light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data in land cover classification. The contributions of this letter are: 1) the joint use of ICESat-2 and Landsat 8 image datasets can provide better land cover classification accuracy, achieving 10% and 3% accuracy gains for five types (forest/low-vegetation/water/construction-land/barren) and four types (vegetation/water/construction-land/barren)of land cover, respectively; 2) the proposed feature selection improves the overall accuracy by 1.5% and 1% for five and four land cover types, respectively; 3) the accuracy of the land cover classification reached 82% and 98% for five and four types of land cover; and 4) the terrain factors, the number of canopy photons, and solar conditions significantly impact land cover classification for a complex terrain area.

AB  - High-resolution (HR) satellite images can provide detailed information about land usage/land cover. Often, it is necessary that the satellite sensor inherent spatial resolution is increased through algorithmic processing of the image data acquired. Machine-learning and in particular deep-learning based super-resolution (SR) techniques are an effective tool for increasing the spatial resolution of images. In the current work, Sentinel-2 images are super-resolved to spatial resolution equal to 2.5 m/pixel by means of deep-learning based SR techniques. The area of study is Zakynthos island in Greece. A novel index called Normalized Carotenoid Reflectance Index (NCRI) is proposed for the assessment of land cover by olive trees.

AB  - Multitemporal satellite images can serve for monitoring the same geographical area on the earth and recognize potential changes that have occurred. Actually, high-resolution (HR) satellite images can provide detailed pieces of information about change detection. In the current work automatic change detection is carried out in urban and suburban areas of Crete, Greece. QuickBird images of spatial resolution 60 cm/pixel and WorldView images of resolution 30 cm/pixel, that have a relative time difference of 13 years, are utilized. The scene is classified into buildings, vegetation, water and ground as soon as multiindex representation has been applied on the images. Afterwards, automatic change detection is feasible by pixel-per-pixel comparison of the classified multi-temporal images.The water index and the vegetation index which are utilized in the current work are compared with vegetation and water detections which appear in the literature. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the particular spectral indices. Moreover, the presented methodology not only specifies if changes have arisen or not but also provides particular information regarding the types of changes. In the future, further experimentations could lead to the optimization of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Prediction of reservoir inflow is an important aspect of water supply management in an urbanized region. In this regard, this study aims to improve the reservoir inflow prediction using the calibration of the MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) evapotranspiration (ET) data in addition to the streamflow in the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. The results of this study show that constraining SWAT parameters to the ET combined with streamflow helps to improve the simulation of ET. Thereby, it enhances the representation of vertical fluxes in regional hydrology. The reservoir inflow was calibrated with streamflow alone with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.63, whereas the inclusion of ET provides an NSE of 0.59. However, the simulation of ET has improved by 10%. The results of this study demonstrate that the inclusion of ET data helps to improve the simulation of hydrologic processes in the region.

AB  - Remote sensing satellites allow users to acquire detailed information about the Earth's surface on a temporal basis. Widen timeseries analysis at a large geographical scale involves a huge amount ( in Terabytes) of satellite data downloading and processing operations. Such processes need good computational power, large storage, and sophisticated tools. Maintaining such infrastructure can cost heavily to the research/commercial enterprises. To overcome such issues, Amazon Web Service (AWS) offers a sophisticated cloud computing environment. We developed an in-house automated satellite data downloading and processing (ADDPro) pipeline on the AWS platform. The ADDPro pipeline employed Sentinel-2 satellite data to offer current and relative vegetation health information of the agriculture region on a temporal basis at the pan- India scale. Image compositing and multisensor data fusion technique have been incorporated into the ADDPro pipeline to produce cloud-free raster (GeoTIFF) outputs. ADDPro pipeline also facilitates lossless raster data compression, which reduces AWS data transfer costs between regions. Data compression also aids in reducing raster publishing time on GeoServer. Operationally, AWS allows users to download only the bands required to generate a certain index (e. g. NDVI) rather than the entire Sentinel-2 data package. The entire ADDPro pipeline is extremely cost-effective, efficient, and scalable.

TI  - Estimating Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus Contents of West-East Grassland Transect in Inner Mongolia Based on Sentinel-2 and Meteorological Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents of a large-span grassland transect is essential for evaluating ecosystem functioning and monitoring biogeochemical cycles. However, the field measurements are scattered, such that they cannot indicate the continuous gradient change in the grassland transect. Although remote sensing methods have been applied for the estimation of nutrient elements at the local scale in recent years, few studies have considered the effective estimation of C, N, and P contents over large-span grassland transects with complex environment including a variety of grassland types (i.e., meadow, typical grassland, and desert grassland). In this paper, an information enhancement algorithm (involving spectral enhancement, regional enhancement, and feature enhancement) is used to extract the weak information related to C, N, and P. First, the spectral simulation algorithm is used to enhance the spectral information of Sentinel-2 imagery. Then, the enhanced spectra and meteorological data are fused to express regional characteristics and the fractional differential (FD) algorithm is used to extract sensitive spectral features related to C, N, and P, in order to construct a partial least-squares regression (PLSR) model. Finally, the C, N, and P contents are estimated over a West-East grassland transect in Inner Mongolia, China. The results demonstrate that: (i) the contents of C, N, and P in large-span transects can be effectively estimated through use of the information enhancement method involving spectral enhancement, regional feature enhancement, and information enhancement, for which the estimation accuracies (R-2) were 0.88, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively. Compared with the estimation results of raw Sentinel-2 imagery, the RMSE was reduced by 3.42 g/m(2), 0.14 g/m(2), and 13.73 mg/m(2), respectively; and (ii) the continuous change trend and spatial distribution characteristics of C, N, and P contents in the west-east transect of the Inner Mongolia Plateau were obtained, which showed decreasing trends in C, N, and P contents from east to west and the characteristics of meadow > typical grassland > desert grassland. Thus, the information enhancement algorithm can help to improve estimates of C, N, and P contents when considering large-span grassland transects.

TI  - An Efficient Machine Learning Enabled Non-Destructive Technique for Remote Monitoring of Sugarcane Crop Health
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop health can be predicted based on various biochemical variables of crops, which include chlorophyll, phenol, carbohydrate, lipid, protein, hydrogen peroxide, and proline as these variables play a critical role in maintaining the intricate phytochemistry of crop plants. In-situ monitoring of the above- mentioned variables is very cumbersome and laborious, so it is atrociously needed to identify some alternatives to monitor these variables in crop plants. Assessing these variables using satellite data may be a good choice provided it has a high spatial and temporal resolution. Sentinel-2 satellite sensor contains VNIR/SWIR spectral region, two red-edge bands, and also has good spatial as well as temporal resolution so it may be the finest option. Precise information of the field is required for the development of a retrieval algorithm for which the drone data is used, as it is highly accurate ground truth reference data. In previous studies, the researchers have primarily focused on the monitoring of biophysical and morphological parameters of crop plants like leaf area index, plant height, and stomatal conductance using these spectral features. Because monitoring biochemical variables of crop plants using satellite derivatives is still a difficult undertaking for academics, just a few studies have been published. As a result, in this study, an attempt is made to establish a methodology for monitoring sugarcane crop biochemical characteristics utilising satellite-derived variables. Satellite derivatives, i.e., vegetation indices are extracted using Sentinel-2 data while biochemical variables of the crop (as mentioned above) are analyzed using leaf samples in the laboratory using optimized protocols. Subsequently, a Machine learning-based Gaussian process regression model is developed for all the biochemical variables using the different combinations of vegetation indices. The developed model showed promising results with R-2 greater than 0.7 and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) less than 0.2 thus holding good potential for effective monitoring the crop health condition remotely.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to implement and evaluate five different models namely Support Vector Machine using radial basis function (SVM - RBF), Support Vector Machine using polynomial (SVM - P), Support Vector Machine using sigmoid (SVM - S), Minimum Distance (MD), and Parallelepiped (PP) classifier for glacier surface facies mapping of Samudra Tapu glacier using data from ALOS-1 PALSAR satellite. Since the quantitative and qualitative assessment of monitoring glaciers is one of the most efficient means to observe the glaciated terrain, there is a prerequisite to examining the accuracy of different algorithms for glaciated features classification to identify the best classifier for the selected study region. Our evaluation showed that with optimal tuning parameters, the SVM-RBF classifier with penalty parameter 100 yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 80%, performing better compared to other methods.

TI  - Classification of Different Irrigation Systems at Field Scale Using Time-Series of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maps of irrigation systems are of critical value for a better understanding of the human impact on the water cycle, while they also present a very useful tool at the administrative level to monitor changes and optimize irrigation practices. This study proposes a novel approach for classifying different irrigation systems at field level by using remotely sensed data at subfield scale as inputs of different supervised machine learning (ML) models for time-series classification. The ML models were trained using ground-truth data from more than 300 fields collected during a field campaign in 2020 across an intensely cultivated region in Catalunya, Spain. Two hydrological variables retrieved from satellite data, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and soil moisture (SM), showed the best results when used for classification, especially when combined together, retrieving a final accuracy of 90.1 +/- 2.7%. All the three ML models employed for the classification showed that they were able to distinguish different irrigation systems, regardless of the different crops present in each field. For all the different tests, the best performances were reached by ResNET, the only deep neural network model among the three tested. The resulting method enables the creation of maps of irrigation systems at field level and for large areas, delivering detailed information on the status and evolution of irrigation practices.

TI  - Disaggregation of SMAP Soil Moisture at 20 m Resolution: Validation and Sub-Field Scale Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a modified version of the DisPATCh (Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change) algorithm to disaggregate an SMAP surface soil moisture (SSM) product at a 20 m spatial resolution, through the use of sharpened Sentinel-3 land surface temperature (LST) data. Using sharpened LST as a high resolution proxy of SSM is a novel approach that needs to be validated and can be employed in a variety of applications that currently lack in a product with a similar high spatio-temporal resolution. The proposed high resolution SSM product was validated against available in situ data for two different fields, and it was also compared with two coarser DisPATCh products produced, disaggregating SMAP through the use of an LST at 1 km from Sentinel-3 and MODIS. From the correlation between in situ data and disaggregated SSM products, a general improvement was found in terms of Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) for the proposed high resolution product with respect to the two products at 1 km. For the first field analyzed, R was equal to 0.47 when considering the 20 m product, an improvement compared to the 0.28 and 0.39 for the 1 km products. The improvement was especially noticeable during the summer season, in which it was only possible to successfully capture field-specific irrigation practices at the 20 m resolution. For the second field, R was 0.31 for the 20 m product, also an improvement compared to the 0.21 and 0.23 for the 1 km product. Additionally, the new product was able to depict SSM spatial variability at a sub-field scale and a validation analysis is also proposed at this scale. The main advantage of the proposed product is its very high spatio-temporal resolution, which opens up new opportunities to apply remotely sensed SSM data in disciplines that require fine spatial scales, such as agriculture and water management.

TI  - Biodistribution of intravenous [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tc-phytate in mouse models of chemically and foreign-body induced sterile inflammation
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - When injected intravenously, [Tc-99m]Tc-phytate forms particles in the nanometer range. This size can favor its extravasation into tumor and inflammation through pores of the vasculature. The aim of this work is the evalua-tion of the use of [Tc-99m]Tc-phytate to assess sterile inflammation in mouse models. Biodistribution studies of [Tc-99m] Tc-phytate were performed in two groups of male Swiss Albino mice. Sterile inflammation was induced after intra-muscular injection of turpentine in the first group (chemically induced sterile inflammation model) and after implan-tation of sterile metal bolts in the second group (foreign-body induced sterile inflammation model). [Tc-99m]Tc-phytate was intravenously injected after the development of inflammation in both groups and ex vivo biodistribution of the radiolabelled complex followed at different time-points. Biodistribution was expressed as percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g). Target-to-background ratios were also recorded. For the chemically induced sterile inflammation model, ex vivo biodistribution evaluation measurements revealed a pronounced uptake in the inflamed muscle when compared to uptake in the control/non-inflamed muscle. Moreover, as expected, there is a high uptake in the liver and spleen. For the foreign-body induced sterile inflammation model, a significantly higher uptake was observed in the inflamed muscle post [Tc-99m]Tc-phytate injection, both for the 24 hours post-bolt implantation and for the 7 days post-bolt implantation groups. The nanoparticle properties of [Tc-99m]Tc-phytate are potentially useful in the imaging of different types of sterile inflammation with translational potential clinical SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging applications in humans.

AB  - The potential use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for estimating moisture contents at sandy beaches is discussed. These systems are considered all-weather satellites, can provide data during storm events, and allow for the monitoring of sandy beaches during adverse conditions. SAR images are composed of the backscatter coefficient, which is a representation of the returned energy. It is impacted by radar properties (wavelength of the transmitted signal, incidence angle, and polarization) and terrain characteristics (dielectric properties, surface roughness, and feature orientation). Typical trends in backscatter, moisture content, surface roughness, and roughness category are presented for a case study from the sandy Atlantic beach in Duck, North Carolina, and potential models how to address these factors in a data analysis framework are discussed. Moisture contents here ranged from 3.7% to 23%, backscatter coefficient ranged from -20.5 dB to -13.3 dB, and standard deviation of the surface height variation (or RMS height) ranged from 0.101 to 0.491 cm. Preliminary results indicate that SAR images are a feasible option for the derivation of moisture content data, especially for images collected at intermediary incidence angles (-30 degrees-46 degrees).

TI  - Attentional Dense Convolutional Neural Network for Water Body Extraction From Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water bodies from remote sensing data is certainly an essential task to supervise the actual conditions of the available water resources for environment conservation, sustainable development, and many other applications. Being Sentinel-2 images some of the most attractive data, existing traditional index-based and deep learning-based water extraction methods still have important limitations in effectively dealing with large heterogeneous areas since many types of water bodies with different spatial-spectral complexities are logically expected. Note that, in this scenario, optimal feature abstraction and neighborhood information may certainly vary from water to water pixel, however existing methods are generally constrained by a fix abstraction level and amount of land cover context. To address these issues, this article presents a new attentional dense convolutional neural network (AD-CNN) especially designed for water body extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery. On the one hand, the AD-CNN exploits dense connections to allow uncovering deeper features while simultaneously characterizing multiple data complexities. On the other hand, the proposed model also implements a new residual attention module to dynamically put the focus on the most relevant spatial-spectral features for classifying water pixels. To test the performance of the AD-CNN, a new water database of Nepal (WaterPAL) is also built. The conducted experiments reveal the competitive performance of the proposed architecture with respect to several traditional index-based and state-of-the-art deep learning-based water extraction models.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES OF THE BEACHES ALONG THE SEGMENT VALENCIA - CULLERA (E SPAIN) FROM SATELLITE-DERIVED SHORELINES
T2  - CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Beaches are spaces of paramount importance for coastal societies currently threatened by coastal erosion. Their preservation requires accurate quantification of their changes in order to understand their behavior and to propose efficient solutions. Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 mid-resolution satellites offer free-of-charge images with great potential for coastal monitoring. From them, it is possible to automatically extract the shoreline position as a quantitative indicator of the beach morphology over large territories and with high temporal frequency.Beach changes take place at different spatial and temporal scales, typically responding to coastal storms and human interventions on the coast. The collection of large packages of satellite-derived shorelines (SDS) at the coastal sector Valencia-Cullera (W Mediterranean) covering the period 2013-2020 makes it possible to characterize the state of its beaches and their width changes over space and time.Results reveal a widespread erosional trend, most likely caused by a shortage of sediment in the coastal system. Thus, the majority of the beaches are not capable of restoring their previous conditions after storm-driven retreats. The information provided by the SDS also shows the ineffectiveness of the nourishment actions, at least in the way they have been carried out, and the urgent need for a strategy to address the erosion problem.

AB  - To perform specific environmental analyses with high accuracy and spatial resolution, typically dedicated Earth Observation (EO) data are acquired via aircraft or drones. Although valuable, these data can be: (i) limited and sparse in time and space due to their acquisition cost, and (ii) asynchronous to field data collection. To consistently ingest asynchronous EO data and field surveys, this paper generates a spatio-temporal framework by exploiting the ability of Sentinel-1 satellites to provide frequent EO data with global coverage. Experiments, conducted in Indonesia to estimate changes in forest Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) between 2017 and 2019, demonstrate the ability of the spatio-temporal framework to integrate Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data acquired in 2020. The method achieved a R-2 of 0.76 and a RMSE of 21.24 compared to 0.50 and 0.57 and 28.65 and 23.93 for the standard bi-temporal approach (using field data and Sentinel-1 data) and the bi-temporal approach including the LIDAR data without any adaptation, respectively.

TI  - A Scalable High-Performance Unsupervised System for Producing Large-Scale HR Land Cover Maps: The Italian Country Case Study
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an operational system for the automatic production of high-resolution (HR) large-scale land cover (LC) maps in a fast, efficient, and unsupervised manner. This is based on a scalable and parallelizable tile-based approach, which does not require the collection of new training data. The method leverages the complementary information provided by the existing LC maps and recent acquisitions of HR Earth observation (EO) images to identify map units that have the highest probability of being correctly associated with their labels, and exploit the obtained "weak" training set to produce an updated HR LC map by classifying the recently acquired EO data. Both steps, performed at tile level, can be implemented on a high-performance computing (HPC) environment, which simultaneously process all required tiles (independently of each other) for the entire study area. The method was tested considering the publicly available 2018 Corine LC map having a minimum mapping unit of 25 ha and the Sentinel-2 images to generate an HR LC map of Italy. The obtained map has a spatial resolution of 10 m and presents the nine major LC types (i.e., "artificial land," "bareland," "grassland," "cropland," "broadleaves," "conifers," "snow," "water," and "shrubland"). Validation was performed using the 2018 European Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey database made up of in situ data. The overall accuracy achieved for the Northern, Southern, and Central part of Italy and the Italian Islands is 91.29%, 91.63%, 92.21%, and 91.06%, respectively.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to consider a research methodology suitable for Christian counseling research that presupposes a Christian worldview. First, in the relationship between the worldview and research method, which is the basis of the counseling research method, research methodology is worldview-dependent. In addition, the content of the Christian worldview was reviewed in terms of ontology, epistemology, and value theory. From a Christian worldview perspective, an individual's life can be the subject of scientific study as a contextual case in the great story of the kingdom of God. Among the scientific methods of analyzing cases, the philosophical point of view that positivism presupposes does not correspond to the Christian worldview, and constructivism is consistent with the epistemological aspect. Critical realism, which resolves ontological conflicts, is the perspective that narrows the distance from the Christian worldview in terms of ontology and epistemology. Therefore, the case studies emphasized from this point of view are suitable for research based on the Christian worldview, and science and communication are also emphasized. Through this study, it is meaningful in that it awakens the importance of worldview in research and that case studies provide a valid basis for Christian worldview-based research.

AB  - Zainichi Korean writer Kim Seok-beom(1925-) wrote “In a journal around 1949 – A passage from ｢Mountain of Death｣” in 『Joseon Criticism』(1951.12.) under the nickname of ‘Park Tong’, and he debuted in Japanese literature. Kim Seok-beom grew up in a Zainichi Korean society in Ikaino, Osaka, where Korean was his native language. As a bilingual writer, he studied Japanese at Tsuruhashi 2nd primary education school, an Osaka municipal school. Kim Seok-beom, who debuted in 1951, has written Japanese novels such as ｢Gansu Park Seobang｣(Munyesudo, 1957.8.), ｢Death of a Crow｣(Munyesudo, 1957.12.), ｢Poop and Freedom｣(Munyesudo, April 1960), and ｢Kwandukjung｣(Culture Criticism, May 1962). As early as the 1970s, he began to explore his literary language and the linguistic theory of novel creation with the question ‘Why write in Japanese’. Kim Seok-beom, who still writes novels in Japanese today, published four Korean novels written during the 1960s when he was active in the Korean Association of Korean Residents in Japan.Early in the 1960s, he published several short stories, including ｢Pheasant Hunt｣(Josunsinbo, 1961), ｢Honbaek(Soul)｣(Literary Arts, 1962), and ｢At a Pier｣(Literary Arts, 1964). In May 1965 to June 1967, he published 『Hwansando』, an unfinished serialized novel. Following the end of 『Hwansando』, Kim Seok-beom stops writing Korean novels and writes Japanese novels instead. Meanwhile, research on Kim Seok-beom literature has focused on Japanese novels and works translated into Korean. Kim Seok-beom's Korean language usage and literary worldview in his Korean novels, however, are the main subjects of study.An analysis of the author's method of characterization and dialogue in the novel, ｢At a Pier｣, has been conducted. This novel was published before the serialization of Kim Seok-beom's first Korean novel, ｢Pheasant Hunt｣. The novel ｢Pheasant Hunt｣ is set in Jeju Island in the late 1950s when the ban on going out of Mt. Halla was lifted. A Korean interpreter named Ryang and an American officer named Caera are the main characters in this novel. The brutality and cunning of an American officer who shot and killed the Jeju people who entered Hallasan is contrasted with ‘lyang’, who appears as a reflective person. This American officer represents the United States, the imperialist power that led the Cold War system on the Korean Peninsula.In ｢At a Pier｣, the story is set in a small port city near Shimonoseki, where Sunyok, a major figure associated with Chochongryun, meets sailors from South Korea. It takes place in South Korea in 1964, during protests against the Korea-Japan negotiations. Using the character of ‘Chief of Sailors’, the author portrays the reality of state-led economic development in the 1960s. Moreover, the language spoken by a ‘Joseon Grandmother’ belonging to the Korean Residents' Association in Japan to Cho Chongryon and the Chief of Sailors from South Korea is a mixed regional language (Chungcheong-do and Pyeongan-do).It expresses Kim Seok-beom's ideological conflict with the Korean Residents in Japan, who were members of Chochongryon at the time. It is also the character's expression of literary imagination aimed at transcending the Korean Peninsula's division and becoming a unified independent nation.Writing in Korean in Chochongryun, which follows North Korean ideology, was therefore written as a political ‘constraint’. It reinforces the dogmatic ideology of a divided Korean peninsula based on a Cold War imperialist system after liberation. ｢Pheasant Hunt｣ contains anti-American ideology that targets the U.S. military government that consolidated the division of Joseon, connecting it to the author's consciousness inherent in Kim Seok-beom's 1950s Japanese novels. In ｢At a Pier｣, the author expresses an independent worldview that pursues a ‘new alternative modernity’ which differs from North Korea's literary policy and its dogmatic ideology.

AB  - This study was motivated by the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the start of the pandemic, numerous studies have investigated the ensuing crisis, but few have analyzed it from the perspective of philosophical counseling and suggested alternative ways of thinking. This paper aims to address the mental health issues impacting many people, especially individuals facing an uncertain future due to the struggle to adjust to the extremes of the pre- and post-pandemic periods. To this end, we first outline a worldview that provides important theoretical grounds and insights into philosophical counseling, focusing on the ideas of Karl Jaspers. We then examine the concepts of “perimeter” and “between” of “Trans-Sophia” and “Self-Transformation” in the era “between” the pre- and post-pandemic periods. Based on this examination, we propose a “mental vaccine” for enhancing individuals’ resilience and self-existence by increasing their mental strength to respond to crises and withstand unpredictable situations.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Herman Bavinck (1854-1921) argues that modern thought and theology are prone to separate faith from knowledge by emphasizing one aspect of faith among the propositional, empirical, or ethical aspects when the relationship between faith and knowledge is related to a methodology. This tendency has its roots in the rejection of supernatural reality and miracles in conformity with the principles of natural law and autonomy, eventually leading to the denial of Christ's deity. This paper aims to provide Bavinck's norms for an integrative view on faith and knowledge of the deity of Christ and special revelation based on that by synthesizing the objective, subjective and applicable elements of Christianity found in Bavinck's “Het Christendom” and the historical, organic, whole-person and soteriological aspects of special revelation found in his Reformed Dogmatics. Bavinck's norms provide significant insight into a relevant discussion; when participating in a theological enterprise or preparing a sermon, the norms make one more properly see what one is engaged in by comprehensively considering all relevant issues. As the background for an integrative view on faith and knowledge of Christ's deity, the significance of Christ's deity and the necessity of a supernaturalistic worldview are discussed, while Christological unity is viewed as the foundation for such an understanding. From both perspectives, I demonstrate how, although the supernaturalistic worldview appears to have dualistic elements, all the opposing elements are united in Christological unity, in which the universality of Mediatorship occupies a central role.

AB  - This study analyzes the non-human agency represented in oral-narratives. Based on posthumanism, this study focuses on the type “Trees against Logging”, which represents the most hostile case of a relationship between non-humans and humans. In “Trees against Logging”, trees “resist” the logging by humans. Particularly in the “Trees against Logging” documented in the premodern era, the trees are represented as anthropomorphic figures, which have agency and will. Here, the possibility of reinterpreting the curse[殃禍] that the trees put on the logging human as an act of “resistance” is suggested. On the other hand, in those investigated in the modern era, the trees’ agency is represented negatively, or the agency itself is denied. This is because the modern worldview, based on Western thoughts, conceals and dismantles the network between non-humans and humans, all “persons”. Here, the trees’ perspective, intention, and agency are also concealed. Therefore, the curse is not represented as a “resistance” by the trees, but as a thing of incomprehensible fear to be suppressed. However, since the relationships between all “persons” constitute the world, “hybrids” of non-human agency in the modern world can inevitably be imagined. “Hybrids” are not just in the “informal” area but also the “official” area of the state, exhibiting the agency. “Hybrids” overpass and disturb the division line between the premodern and modern, non-humans and humans. Posthumanism attempts to reveal the form of the world connected and intertwined with relationships between all “persons” and the non-human agency that emerges from such relationships. Considering posthumanism, it is necessary to discover non-humans who act like humans, that is, anthropomorphic non-humans represented in oral-narratives.

AB  - Soil water content in agricultural land is a major factor for forecasting drought, estimating crop yields, and grasping methane emissions. The needs of spatiotemporal soil moisture data are increased recently. However, spatially seamless soil moisture estimations are challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the small spatial representativeness of point-based in-situ measurement. In contrast, microwave imagery has an advantage for soil moisture monitoring with high sensitivity to dielectric constant of land surface. Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) provides stable accuracy and high resolution at 6.25m spatial resolution microwave images with L-band observation using PALSAR-2 sensor of ALOS-2 since 2014. The objective of this study is volumetric soil water content estimation using dielectric constant derived by Dubois algorithm with PALSAR-2. Then we converted the dielectric constant result into soil moisture using Topp model. As the result, the average of soil water content in Ibaraki field was estimated as 28% by using PALSAR-2. When it was compared with in-situ, the RMSE was 5.2%. Further spatial and quantitative comparisons have shown.

AB  - This study looks at ‘Does Spring Come Even to these Stolen Fields’ by Sang-hwa Lee (1901-1943), focusing on the figurative expression ‘The Spring Spirit appears to have spread (bbomsillyeongi jeopyeonnaboda)’ which is used repeatedly.Interpreting the work of this outstanding poet is greatly influenced by these figurative expressions, so it is important to examine whether we have an authentic understanding of his meaning.In Lee Sang-hwa’s poems, ‘Spirit (sillyeong)’ signifies a being of a divine nature assumed at the same time to have a personality which sets it apart from the mundane world. Thus the ‘Spring Spirit (bbomsillyeong)’ symbolizes a transcendent and impersonal spring not confined to the physical manifestation of spring. The phrase ‘appears to have spread (jeopyeonnaboda)’ refers to being touched by the divine (接神), and this idea of being possessed by a deity reflects Korea’s traditional worldview, rooted in shamanism, in which the spirits of heaven and earth are personified.This study argues that even if the entire poem ‘Does Spring Come Even to these Stolen Fields’ were rewritten in the language used today, there would be no need to change the expression ‘The Spring Spirit appears to have spread’. In context, its meaning is perfectly clear, despite the changes which the Korean language has undergone. Moreover, there have been several attempts to update other examples of figurative language which have demonstrably distorted or rendered ambiguous the original.

However, the survival outcomes of SLN mapping compared with lymphadenectomy have not been established via a prospective study.METHODS: A multi-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial has been designed to determine the prognostic value of SLN mapping alone compared with conventional lymphadenectomy for patients with clinical stage I-II endometrial cancer. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio between the group to undergo SLN mapping using indocyanine green and the conventional lymph node dissection group. A high-risk group will undergo a 2-step SLN mapping procedure. The primary endpoint is the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary endpoints are 3-year overall survival (OS), 5-year DFS, 5-year OS after surgery, pattern of recurrence, immediate surgical outcomes, success rate of SLN mapping, postoperative lymph-related complications, postoperative quality of life, and postoperative cost effectiveness. The role of pathologic ultrastaging of SLNs will also be assessed.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT number): NCT04845828.

AB  - Metaverse is regarded as a growth engine that will lead the future industry. Many lives of children in this age overlap with the metaverse through games or other services. Education must acknowledge the world of children and prepare for the metaverse era in which various changes in worldview are possible. However, studies on what students want to do, how to understand, and immerse themselves in learning in education are lacking despite their importance. In particular, the department of social studies should find answers to metaverse as a subject that understands social phenomena and equips members of society with necessary values and attitudes. This study analyzed the learning flow factor with a focus on metaverse-based social studies class with such a sense of problem. According to analysis results, space, sound, and other functions in consideration of interaction and learner experience were found to be significant as important factors for learning flow for metaverse-based social studies class. Therefore, metaverse-based social studies class is expected to play a sufficient role in changing the perception of a new space, cultivating citizenship, and future education by using a more systematic learning flow factor.

AB  - Donghak (東學), which appeared in the late Joseon Dynasty, and Jeungsando (甑山道), which emerged during the Japanese colonial period, are the indigenious new religions of modern Korea, organically combining and reconstructing the traditional Thought of Sinseon (神仙) and Theism (神敎) to re-appropriate East Asian Sinseon thoght. Both pursued the magico-ritual communication with gods (通神) through incantation (呪誦) rather than the Daoist cultivation and meditative practice, and revealed alternative religious aspects that embody a revolutionary worldview through the magic of harmonization for the purpose of prolonging life or achieving prosperity, which are popular concerns.In this article, while examining the similarities of these religions in terms of relieving the pain and resentment of the subalterns, the differences between Donghak and Jeungsando in the aspect of communication with gods that organically combines Donghak and Jeungsando, and the art of harmony, I compared how their magico-ritual techniques (道術) made the differences between Donghak’s thought of earthly immortality (地上神仙) and Jeungsando’s thought of harmonious immortal land (造化仙境).

TI  - Spatiotemporal inhomogeneity of total column NO<sub>2</sub> in a polluted urban area inferred from TROPOMI and Pandora intercomparisons
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal inhomogeneity of the total column NO2 amounts (TCN) in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), Korea, was quantitatively assessed through year-round (October 2019-May 2021) TROPOMI and ground-based Pandora measurements. The average TCN over the SMA was comparable to that of major Chinese megacities, being consistently high (> 0.8 DU; Dobson Unit) during the daytime (10-17 local standard time). The autocorrelation scores of the Pandorameasured TCNs demonstrated high temporal variability attributed to the spatial inhomogeneity of NO2 emissions within the SMA and near-surface advection. Accordingly, the adequate temporal collocation range for Pandora measurements for the intercomparison with the satellite sensors was considered to be +/- 5 min to avoid significant uncertainty from the temporal variability (RMSE < 0.1 DU, R-2 > 0.96). TROPOMI showed better agreement with conventionally collocated Pandora measurements (0.73 < R-2 < 0.76, 26-29% negative bias) than the other two satellite sensors (OMI and OMPS) attributed to its highest spatial resolution. The application of the wind-based collocation revealed that the TROPOMI showed a greater negative bias on the upwind side, which was less affected by anthropogenic emissions from the urban area, than the downwind side, and the increasing distance of the TROPOMI pixel from Pandora was the most critical factor deteriorating the intercomparison scores. The FRESCO-S TROPOMI cloud algorithm update to FRESCO-wide yielded a general increase in TROPOMI TCN, especially in the partially cloudy pixels, leaving only 11% (downwind) and 29% (upwind) negative bias from coincident Pandora measurements. Furthermore, the wind-based collocation method revealed the spatial distribution pattern of NOX (NO + NO2) emissions in the SMA, with significant emission sources in the northeastern and southeastern sides of the ground-based Pandora site in Seoul.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assimilated Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter observations over snow-covered terrain into the Noah-Multiparameterization land surface model using support vector machine (SVM) regression and an ensemble Kalman filter to improve the modeled terrestrial snow mass estimates. The data assimilation (DA) experiment was conducted across Western Colorado from September 2016 to August 2017. As part of the DA experiments, the impact of a rule-based update was evaluated by comparing snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates via DA (with [DA(v1)] and without [DA(v2)] the rule-based update) against SNOTEL SWE measurements. Results confirmed that rule-based update helped minimize SVM controllability issues, and in turn, improved the accuracy of SWE estimates relative to both open loop (OL) and DA(v2). Comparison of SWE estimates from Sentinel-1 DA(v1) against SNOTEL SWE revealed that 75% of stations showed improvements in bias and correlation coefficient relative to the OL. Assimilated SWE estimates also showed statistical improvements during both the snow accumulation and snow ablation periods. However, unbiased root mean square error showed a slight increase during the snow ablation period due to the large variability in the electromagnetic response of C-band backscatter over deep and/or wet snow. Improvement of the SWE estimates also resulted in improving river discharge estimates compared to in situ measurements. River discharge using Sentinel-1 DA(v1) improved the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency at all available stations. These results suggest that physically constrained SVM can serve as an efficient observation operator for snow mass DA through explicit consideration of the first-order C-band scattering mechanisms over different terrestrial snow conditions.

AB  - This study attempts an appropriate Christian understanding and application of the metaverse. To this end, the general concept, type, and utilization of the metaverse were examined, and the main characteristics of the metaverse were analyzed in three main categories by the association of the concepts and the common factors. Based on this, the main focus of the Christian understanding of the metaverse found in this study is, first, the "transcendental worldview" of the metaverse. Applications include restructuring the Christian worldview and creating a Christian metaverse environment for future generations. Second, it is a "fusion and composite on- and offline" understanding of the metaverse. An integrated on- and off-line understanding of the church, worship, mission, and the missional acceptance of the metaverse are its applications. Third, in the metaverse, it is an "extension of the functionality of the avatar." This presents its application tasks, such as establishing human identity, expanding the concepts of empathy and communication, and expanding Christian ethics and economic views. At the heart of the Christian understanding of the metaverse is worldview, mission, and understanding on human being.

TI  - Decadal Measurements of the First Geostationary Ocean Color Satellite (GOCI) Compared with MODIS and VIIRS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The first geostationary ocean color data from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) onboard the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) have been accumulating for more than ten years from 2010. This study performs a multi-year quality assessment of GOCI chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and radiometric data for 2012-2021 with an advanced atmospheric correction technique and a regionally specialized Chl-a algorithm. We examine the consistency and stability of GOCI, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) level 2 products in terms of annual and seasonal climatology, two-dimensional frequency distribution, and multi-year time series. Overall, the GOCI agrees well with MODIS and VIIRS on annual and seasonal variability in Chl-a, as the central biological pattern of the most transparent waters over the western North Pacific, productive waters over the East Sea, and turbid waters over the Yellow Sea are reasonably represented. Overall, an excellent agreement is remarkable for western North Pacific oligotrophic waters (with a correlation higher than 0.91 for Chl-a and 0.96 for band-ratio). However, the sporadic springtime overestimation of MODIS Chl-a values compared with others is notable over the Yellow Sea and East Sea due to the underestimation of MODIS blue-green band ratios for moderate-high aerosol optical depth. The persistent underestimation of VIIRS Chl-a values compared with GOCI and MODIS occurs due to inherent sensor calibration differences. In addition, the artificially increasing trends in GOCI Chl-a (+0.48 mg m(-3) per 9 years) arise by the decreasing trends in the band ratios. However, decreasing Chl-a trends in MODIS and VIIRS (-0.09 and -0.08 mg m(-3), respectively) are reasonable in response to increasing sea surface temperature. The results indicate GOCI sensor degradation in the late mission period. The long-term application of the GOCI data should be done with a caveat, however; planned adjustments to GOCI calibration (2022) in the following GOCI-II satellite will essentially eliminate the bias in Chl-a trends.

AB  - As a result of urban concentration, colonisation, increased physical distance from tribal homelands, and globalisation, many indigenous people, including Maori, are seeking digital solutions to connect to their culture and identity. Through co-design, close collaboration with our indigenous partners, and careful consideration of cultural context, we show that mixed reality experiences can be an effective mechanism for the growing diaspora of Maori to access and experience their language, genealogy, families, histories and knowledge. Inductive analysis of semi-structured interviews highlights the importance of cultural values and context in this experience, and confirms that this approach can support connections to community and culture. Our work is deeply embedded in a particular indigenous group's context and culture, but we believe that it holds important lessons that can generalise to other groups. In particular, collaborative co-design and recognition of cultural values throughout the project are essential for producing experiences that meet the needs of specific communities, and that reflect and respect their culture and worldview.

AB  - D. H. Lawrence’s Aaron’s Rod records the main character Aaron Sisson’s breaking away from ‘home’ and the subsequent nomadic adventure in a strange country. The abrupt dislocation, as if a total negation of ‘home’, creates a structural rupture in the novel. The second half of the novel is featured by the intrusive and self-referent narrator. The disjunctive and jerky narration exposes the failing authoritative narrative which cannot configure Aaron’s adventure. Yet the structural complicity of Aaron’s Rod defeats any easy application of postmodern narratology which is predicated on the notion of the novel as a linguistic autonomy constitutive of the endless deferral of meaning. This structural oddity rather reveals the nature of the writer’s quest for a new mode of representation, which revolves around the concerns about community and individuality. The conflation of structural oddity and theoretical engagement with community invites Jean-Luc Nancy’s reflection on ‘unworking’ and totalitarianism in connection with the Western metaphysics. Nancy’s totalitarianism denotes the tendency to view a community as an embodiment of the essence or spirit. Nancy suggests the immanence of totalitarian worldview will be destroyed by reviving ‘a thinking of community’. Nancy calls this process ‘unworking’ of community, which belongs to the anti-philosophical tradition of ‘ungrounding’. In so doing, Nancy alludes ‘unworking’ to the ‘unended and unending’ literature. Here Nancy’s anti-philosophical notion of literature, with a strong resonance of Lawrence’s reiteration of the novel as a means to debilitate totalitarianism, sheds new light on the the intrusive narrator of ‘word-user’.

AB  - When a satellite image has low spatial resolution, it is difficult to detect small objects. In this research, we aim to check the effect of super resolution on object detection. Super resolution is a software method that increases the resolution of an image. Unpaired super resolution network is used to improve Sentinel-2’s spatial resolution from 10 m to 3.2 m. Faster-RCNN, RetinaNet, FCOS, and S2ANet were used to detect vessels in the Sentinel-2 images. We experimented the change in vessel detection performance when super resolution is applied. As a result, the Average Precision (AP) improved by at least 12.3% and up to 33.3% in the ship detection models trained with the super-resolution image. False positive and false negative cases also decreased. This implies that super resolution can be an important pre-processing step in object detection, and it is expected to greatly contribute to improving the accuracy of other image-based deep learning technologies along with object detection.

AB  - This study focused on the existence of and relationship between Oneuli and Oneuli in Woncheon Gang Bonpuri, which is centered on Park Bong-chunbon but set in the mythical space of Woncheon Gang Bonpuri. The study found that spatial movement has major meaning in Oneuli‘s journey to find parents. This study adopted Claude Levi-Strauss’s confrontation structure analysis method to reflect the specificity and universality of Korean mythology. The research analyzed this myth’s spatial structure by changing the confrontation structure analysis framework of Levi-Strauss’s Oedipus myth. Additionally, this study focused on the mythical pixel along with the spatial structure, synthesizing the structural characteristics and meaning of the mythical space to investigate the mythical meaning of Woncheongang Bonpuri.The nature of the space in Woncheongang Bonpuri and the “character of scarcity” they go through occupy a very important point in this myth. This myth’s defining feature is not the clear confrontation between the characters and the world but rather that each creature is identifiable through their problems. Through the sum of different beings’ problems, we can see that the world is aiming for balance amidst imbalance, and Oneuli’s spatial movement is important because it is revealed through Oneuli’s existence and relationship. Oneuli’s trip is a process of discovering that the answer is within us and close to us, including answers to the questions facing snakes, lotus trees, the Jade Emperor, Maeil, and Jangsang.This study assessed that when Oneuli asks what he discovered in the Woncheon River, Oneuli experiences both this and that, and it is found that here and there are “not different.” This reveals the worldview of Korean mythology, along with the behavioral meaning, confirming that “this side and that side,” the “real and sacred dimension,” and “sky and Earth” do not differ from one another. Oneuli crosses the sea in search of the Woncheon River, but there is no answer there. The space thought of as heaven is no different from Earth, representing the dynamic relationship between heaven and Earth and referring to the paradox of heaven and Earth. Oneuli’s “integration” is achieved through spatial movement and the four seasons seen in the Woncheon River, and finally, knowing the reason for this world and gaining enlightenment comprise Oneuli’s “integration” method.In Woncheongang Bonpuri, the principle of harmony and change in this world is centered on boundaries and mediating spaces, and “from the afterlife to the afterlife” and “from the afterlife” are key. Oneuli identifies exploration and movement  the situation of isolation and disconnection, and finally, the answer to enlightenment in the Woncheon River and moves back toward Earth. Enlightenment is connected to and expanded by the beings that Oneuli encounters in the process of regression. Therefore, the core of this myth lies in Oneuli’s “discovery and integration” in the spatial structure of this world and the underworld. This proceeds in the following order: disconnect (overstagnation)  connection  improvement  discovery  integration. Such spatial structures in each space are connected, leading to expansion and converging to produce one result. In other words, it can be seen that the place where Oneuli crosses the water is nothing but a place symbolizing another Earth, not the sky. This realization shows the paradox of gaining eternity in heaven. The summer and winter seasons seen from the Woncheon River are important, and pain and happiness coexist. Further, the equal existence of the “four seasons” of “spring, summer, fall, and winter” shows the space of a “monolithic cycle.” Through Oneuli and spatial movement, we discover the properties of Earth in the heavens and the properties of Earth on Earth in order to gain enlightenment, and this realization is “monistic integration and paradox,” leading to paradoxical integration, which is the mythical worldview of Woncheongang Bonpuri.

AB  - This paper presents a two-stage spatio-spectral fusion method (2SSFM) based on area-to- point regression kriging (ATPRK) to enhance spatial and spectral resolutions using multi-sensor satellite images with complementary spatial and spectral resolutions. 2SSFM combines ATPRK and random forest regression to predict spectral bands at high spatial resolution from multi-sensor satellite images. In the first stage, ATPRK-based spatial downscaling is performed to reduce the differences in spatial resolution between multi-sensor satellite images. In the second stage, regression modeling using random forest is then applied to quantify the relationship of spectral bands between multi-sensor satellite images. The prediction performance of 2SSFM was evaluated through a case study of the generation of red-edge and short-wave infrared bands. The red-edge and short-wave infrared bands of PlanetScope images were predicted from Sentinel-2 images using 2SSFM. From the case study, 2SSFM could generate red-edge and short-wave infrared bands with improved spatial resolution and similar spectral patterns to the actual spectral bands, which confirms the feasibility of 2SSFM for the generation of spectral bands not provided in high spatial resolution satellite images. Thus, 2SSFM can be applied to generate various spectral indices using the predicted spectral bands that are actually unavailable but effective for environmental monitoring.

AB  - With the unprecedented spread of Covid-19, education has particularly been hit hard and education is the first service halted. Education contributes to the development of individuals and countries. And it has been a key tool of missions from the early days of modern Protestant missionary history including the Chosun dynasty to now.It is apparent that God created humankind with creative ability, an ability that can be used to produce art, music, literature, and technology. In fact, our technological creativity might be directly attributed to the fact that we ourselves are created in the image of God, the Creator. Science and technology must be taught and accompanied by Christian worldview education to educate the right values. Guatemala and many other developing countries in Latin America have very low Internet speed and bi-directional communication channels are not available due to digital divide and Internet networking problems.This paper introduces education as a mission(EAM) which is a part of God’s cultural mandate. The goal is to teach students in Guatemala the ICT(Information and Communication Technology) needed for the 4th Industrial Revolution(4 IR) and to nurture Christian leaders by teaching them a Christian worldview lecture that produced very positive results. For social services, we are developing a solar electric lamp system using appropriate technology and are preparing a Country Partnership Strategy(CPS) proposal for the construction of a high-speed Internet network in Guatemala.ICT training, which can have a direct impact on future industries, will enable developing countries to lift themselves out of poverty and ensure the sustainability of their countries and society.

AB  - Intense, durational, and frequent heat wave becomes a concern in the modern era as they directly effect on human mortality and climate. In this paper, heat wave detection is accomplished through satellite observation and air temperature over the Gujarat region for the period of 15th - 17th March 2022. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) was derived from Indian National Satellite System (INSAT-3D) images for the normal and heat wave year, which indicates severe conditions in some parts of the state. The LST analysis over different land cover types for the year 2019-2022 was observed, which indicates LST intensity on cropland is higher than on other land covers during heat wave. We also qualitatively analyze the correlation between Moderate Resolution Imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite LST and air temperature over the last 15 years by fitting a linear trend line. It describes the dynamic behavior of land covers over the years. The comparison of an air temperature of normal and heat wave years shows a surge in air temperature during the heat wave in the daytime. This finding shows the potential of satellite remote sensing as it is promising means of accurate study and detection of heat waves from the synoptic view as well as it will help to understand the heat wave pattern.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we produced annual 30-m resolution maps of vegetation lifeform cover (tree, shrub, herb, and an additional class denoted as "other") and their spatially explicit uncertainties for the conterminous United States for the period of 1984-2018, modeled using a quantile regression forest calibrated from a fusion of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR)/multispectral data and Landsat imagery. The resulting predictions were compared to available fractional cover products with the same temporal and spatial resolution and to different types of documented land cover change to determine the relative accuracy of the percent cover predictions. We found that our approach yielded a higher accuracy of the shrub, herb, and "other" cover estimates than existing products and had a similar performance of the resulting tree cover estimate compared to other products. Our results indicate that the use of spatially dense training and validation data from airborne multisensor acquisitions facilitates the incorporation of a large range of variability in the response variables into model construction. The produced percent lifeform cover maps, which are publicly available through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center, represent a consistent dataset of medium spatial resolution and long temporal record that can be a valuable input into a variety of applications such as the analysis of vegetation change processes, as well as ecosystem conservation and management.

AB  - Brazil has established itself as one of the world leaders in food production. Different types of remote sensing mapping techniques have been undertaken to support rural planning in the country. However, due to the complex dynamics of Brazilian agriculture, especially in the Cerrado biome (tropical savanna), there is a need for more feasible crop discrimination and monitoring initiatives, which require a consistent time series of remote sensing data at medium meter and potentially up to 3 day Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite time series, minimizing the cloud cover limitations for rainfed agricultural monitoring. This paper aims to explore the potential of the Harmonized Landsat 8 Sentinel-2 (HLS) data cube to map agricultural landscapes in the Brazilian Cerrado. The HLS multispectral bands from 27 scenes with less than 10% cloud cover, from October 2020 to September 2021, encompassing one entire crop growing season, were processed by the Random Forest algorithm to produce a map with four land use/cover classes (annual crops, sugarcane, renovated sugarcane fields, cultivated pastures, and native Cerrado). We performed accuracy assessment through 10-fold cross-validation and confusion matrix analyses. The results showed a high level of overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient, both with 99%, as well as high user's and producer's accuracies of at least 99%. The HLS dataset has been continuously improved, showing very promising results for rainfed agricultural mapping and monitoring.

AB  - Some researchers have reported subsidence in Bali. However, the main factor and the subsidence mechanism remain unclear due to a lack of data. One possibility is due to groundwater extraction. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of visitors to Bali decreased significantly. Using the persistent interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) and the trend model method, we found a strong relationship between the number of visitors and the subsidence velocity. The subsidence velocity decreased rapidly during the Covid-19 pandemic. It may cause a decrease in groundwater extraction. It may be proven that groundwater extraction is one factor of subsidence in Bali. However, a detailed field investigation, such as groundwater table measurement, is required to validate this new finding.

AB  - This paper attempts to present the relation between Gorbhani type of Amplifier distortion and doppler for varying levels of normalized signal. The Intersatellite links are subjected to doppler phenomenon due to relative motion between the satellites. Doppler and Amplifier distortion together significantly degrade the data transmitted on the Inter-Satellite links. The cumulative degradation is presented via Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) metric as it helps to understand both qualitative and quantitative signal degradation. In view of significant number satellite constellations being deployed around the globe for data transmission,the results presented in this paper helps satellite constellation designers to understand and estimate the cumulative distortion. An expression for the Error Vector magnitude is derived and presented for a PSK(I/Q) modulated signal. The results presented corelates two different types distortions component induced Amplifier distortion and physical(channel) distortion Doppler. The results present in this paper helps Satellite Constellation/System designers in the selection of components( Amplifier) whose distortion is less sensitivity to doppler.

AB  - This paper addresses the semantic segmentation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images through the combination of fully convolutional networks (FCNs), hierarchical probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), and decision tree ensembles. The idea is to incorporate long-range spatial information together with the multiresolution information extracted by FCNs, through the multiresolution graph topology on which hierarchical PGMs can be efficiently formulated. The objective is to obtain accurate classification results with small datasets and reduce problems of spatial inconsistency. The experimental validation is conducted with several COSMO-SkyMed satellite images over Northern Italy. The results are significant, as the proposed method obtains more accurate classification results than the standard FCNs considered.

TI  - Semantic Segmentation of Remote-Sensing Images Through Fully Convolutional Neural Networks and Hierarchical Probabilistic Graphical Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL) is currently the dominant approach to image classification and segmentation, but the performances of DL methods are remarkably influenced by the quantity and quality of the ground truth (GT) used for training. In this article, a DL method is presented to deal with the semantic segmentation of very-high-resolution (VHR) remote-sensing data in the case of scarce GT. The main idea is to combine a specific type of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), namely fully convolutional networks (FCNs), with probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Our method takes advantage of the intrinsic multiscale behavior of FCNs to deal with multiscale data representations and to connect them to a hierarchical Markov model (e.g., making use of a quadtree). As a consequence, the spatial information present in the data is better exploited, allowing a reduced sensitivity to GT incompleteness to be obtained. The marginal posterior mode (MPM) criterion is used for inference in the proposed framework. To assess the capabilities of the proposed method, the experimental validation is conducted with the ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge datasets on the cities of Vaihingen and Potsdam, with some modifications to simulate the spatially sparse GTs that are common in real remote-sensing applications. The results are quite significant, as the proposed approach exhibits a higher producer accuracy than the standard FCNs considered and especially mitigates the impact of scarce GTs on minority classes and small spatial details.

TI  - 4D-Var Data Assimilation of Sea Surface Temperature in a Regional Model of the Andaman Sea
T2  - 2022 OCEANS HAMPTON ROADS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - OCEANS Hampton Roads Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Andaman Sea (AnS) is a marginal sea in the eastern Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the least studied in Indian Ocean, making it challenging to simulate. Using data assimilation with satellite sea surface temperature observations is a feasible approach to obtaining high-quality simulations. Our goal is to develop such a system for the AnS. First, we perform a high-resolution data-driven numerical Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) control run. Second, a data-assimilative ROMS run with MODIS SST observations is performed and compared to the control run. Initial and boundary conditions are taken from the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) model for both the control and data assimilation runs. We use an Incremental Strong Constraint 4-Dimensional Variational (I4D-Var) data assimilation scheme. This is the first study to implement the time-evolving data assimilation ocean model in the AnS region at such a high resolution and gives a good estimate of the ocean state in AnS. The data assimilation run significantly reduces the difference between the AnS simulations and the BD12 observations over the control run. Significantly, the data assimilation run reduces the surface Temperature error by 0.5 degrees C when compared with the control run, when MODIS SST data is assimilated. This data assimilation set-up is essential to improve our ability to understand the synoptic dynamics of the region better.

TI  - Comparative analysis of 1D hydrodynamic flood model using globally available DEMs - a case of the coastal region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is a natural catastrophe that can lead to major disasters and hence it becomes necessary to develop precautionary measures to minimise flood impacts. The present study is a comparative analysis of three globally available DEMs in flood modelling. This research demonstrates the usefulness of the SRTM in 1D hydrodynamic flood modelling using HEC-RAS mapper on the River Purna at Navsari city, Gujarat, India. Additionally, other DEMs like ALOS PALSAR, and Cartosat-1 are used to make a comparative analysis. The outcomes of these models are compared with the observed data; the R-2 values for ALOS PALSAR, Cartosat 1, and SRTM are 0.9677, 0.9342, and 0.9914, respectively, which shows that SRTM provides the best match with the observed values. The approach presented in this study gives the applicability of the DEMs for flood modelling in the data-scarce region, which will be helpful for decision-makers to take precautionary measures and to predict the severity caused by an event.

TI  - Self-care behaviours among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in South Asia: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background The burden of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in South Asian coun-tries is increasing rapidly. Self-care behaviour plays a vital role in managing T2DM and preventing complications. Research on self-care behaviours among people with T2DM has been widely conducted in South Asian countries, but there are no system-atic reviews that assess self-care behaviour among people with T2DM in South Asia. This study systematically assessed the studies reporting self-care behaviours among people with T2DM in South-Asia. Methods Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, we searched six bibliographic databas-es (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and PsychInfo) to identi-fy the relevant articles published between January 2000 through March 2022. Eligi-bility criteria included all observational and cross-sectional studies reporting on the prevalence of self-care behaviours (ie, diet, physical activity, medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, and foot care) conducted in South Asian countries among people with T2DM. Results The database search returned 1567 articles. After deduplication (n= 758) and review of full-text articles (n= 192), 92 studies met inclusion criteria and were included. Forward and backward reference checks were performed on included stud-ies, which resulted in an additional 18 articles. The pooled prevalence of adherence to blood glucose monitoring was 65% (95% CI=49-80); 64% for medication adher-ence (95% CI=53-74); 53% for physical activity (95% CI =39-66); 48% for diet (95% CI = 38-58); 42% for foot care (95% CI = 30-54). About a quarter of people with T2DM consumed alcohol (25.2%, IQR= 13.8%-38.1%) and were using tobacco products (18.6%, IQR= 10.6%-23.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that the prevalence of self-care behaviours among people with T2DM in South Asia is low. This shows an urgent need to thoroughly in-vestigate the barriers to the practising of self-care and design and implement interven-tions to improve diabetes self-care behaviour among people with T2DM in South Asia.

TI  - Superficial lymphatic drainage of the vulva and its relation to the regional nodes: an experimental study
T2  - FOLIA MORPHOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel node biopsy in vulvar cancer is associated with much less morbidity than inguinofemoral node dissection. Our study focused on describing the morphology of superficial lymphatic drainage of the vulva and its relationship to regional nodes, which may facilitate orientation during surgery.Materials and methods: In 24 female cadavers, injections of patent blue (at various localisations medially, unilaterally and bilaterally) were used to visualise the lymphatic drainage of the vulva. After dissection of lymphatic vessels and nodes, their course was documented by photograph and then analysed. Subsequently, a map of vulvar superficial lymphatics was created.Results: The cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue of the vulva primarily drained to superficial inguinal nodes. There was no evidence of a solitary lymph node that drained the unilateral vulva. Each area of the vulva drained to its own lymph node, which was variably localised in the subcutaneous groin around the great saphenous vein. Anastomoses between individual inguinal superficial lymph nodes are likely. Right-left symmetry in the course of lymphatic collectors was not detected. Natural drainage of the medial and paramedial areas to contralateral inguinal nodes was also not detected. The drainage pattern to ipsilateral inguinal nodes was consistent in cadavers without evidence of vulvar disease and may be applicable in the early stages of vulvar cancer.Conclusions: There was no evidence of a solitary node that drained the unilat-eral vulva. Each part of the vulva may drain to a corresponding lymph node in a different localisation of the groin. The surgeon should take this variability into account. (Folia Morphol 2022; 81, 4: 917-922)

TI  - Axillary reverse mapping in breast cancer surgery - functional study
T2  - NEOPLASMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to map the lymphatic drainage of the upper extremity that traverses the axilla and elucidate its relationship with the lymphatic drainage of the breast. In 79 breast cancer patients indicated to the axillary lymph node dissection for category cN1, cN2, Technetium-99m (particle size <80 nm) was applied prior to surgery at two injection sites between the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints to visualize upper extremity lymphatics. During the surgery, the axilla was anatomically divided into 6 quadrants. A C-Trak (R) device was used for the intraoperative detection of radioactivity. After verifying activity, the nodes were resected and their position was recorded. Active nodes were sent separately according to topographic localizations for microscopic examination. All affected nodes (both macro- and micrometastases) were recorded as positive. The location, involvement and radioactivity, and the number of lymph nodes obtained were analyzed. In total, 1,109 lymph nodes were removed and examined. Radioactive nodes were found in all 79 patients. A total of 230 radioactive nodes were found. 21 nodes were both radioactive and metastatically affected. Results show that part of the lymph from the upper extremity flows through the nodes in the central part of the axilla and mixes with the lymph from the breast. This suggests that lymphatic drainage of the upper limb cannot be functionally separated from lymphatic drainage of the breast. The results also explain the possible mechanical cause of arm lymphedema after sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Christian Physicalism: on the Frontiers of Orthodoxy Anthropology and Analytic Philosophy of Mind
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - This article attempts to develop Christian Physicalism within the boundaries of Orthodoxy theology, and it also offers an assessment of their conceptual compat-ibility. Christian Physicalism is the result of the application of the physicalist ap-proach in the analytic philosophy of mind to the circle of problems of Analytic Theology. This is a thesis postulating the physical character of the soul. It im-plies anthropological monophysitism because it holds that body and soul have the same nature. Orthodoxy Theology generally operates within the framework of ancient philosophy while Christian Physicalism is the crown of the contempo-rary analytic tradition. Comparison of these two types of discourses is possible since Christian Physicalism it do not touch the dogmatized areas of Orthodoxy Theology. However, it implies some substantial consequences both for the whole of Christian Anthropology and for the Chalcedonian Christology in many re-spects proceeding from it. In particular, difficulties arise in explaining human posthumous experience, the hypostatic identity of Christ, and trichotomous an-thropological models. Moreover, there is not clear whether physicalists' views on these questions are compatible with the Christian worldview at all. The latter characterized by the idea of the personal and phenomenal character of human ex-perience. The main question, therefore, is what kind of explanation of these at-tributes does Christian Physicalism offer? The theoretical speculations of Chris-tian Physicalism go against not only the beliefs of common-sense but also the strong intuitions of a religious worldview. But the point is not so much in the ter-minology of analytical metaphysics, as in the very human way of describing the world. Trying to think rationally about God, we use concepts designed to de-scribe the facts of the physical world, which inevitably leads to a biasing of our picture of the world.

AB  - Mining-induced deformations are characterized by high deformation rates. These deformations consist of both vertical and horizontal components, which should not be neglected during the monitoring of such areas. Unfortunately, Differential Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) can only measure deformations in the line of sight (LOS) direction towards the satellite. Combining data from ascending and descending geometry allows reconstruction of the vertical and east-west deformation components. Theoretically, at least information from one ascending and one descending geometry is enough to reconstruct the vertical and east-west deformation components; however, for the area of interest three various Sentinel-1 datasets (one ascending and two descending) are available and have been used in the study. Furthermore, considering the availability of other SAR missions with slightly different geometries, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ALOS-2 use on the accuracy of estimating the east-west and vertical cumulative deformation component estimated for a time span of approximately one year. Unfortunately, we have access to only five ALOS-2 scenes within the area of interest. However, the comparison of the decomposed results with GNSS measurements shows that the application of additional ALOS-2 data, even five scenes, allows the root mean square error (RMSE) to be decreased for the vertical and horizontal deformation component from 0.038m to 0.032m and from 0.031m to 0.018m, respectively. This means that the application of ALOS-2 data has a positive value on the accuracy of decomposed vertical and horizontal deformation components.

AB  - This study aims to determine the affected area or post- forest fire scar on the paper pulp production crops in the municipalities of Yumbo, La Cumbre and Dagua from Landsat 8 images. The methodology starts from choosing Landsat satellite images 8 with minimal cloud cover, to which radiometric corrections are made by converting digital levels (ND) to radiance and reflectance values, as well as atmospheric and topographic corrections. Subsequently, the normalized vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized moisture difference index (NDMI), as well as the adjusted to the soil (NMDISoil) and finally the normalized fire radius (NBR) are estimated, which were used for the estimation of the vegetation cover before the drought season, the detection of possible sources of fire and finally for the mapping of the post-fire scar, additionally the product brightness temperature was estimated that served to validate the results obtained with the indices before mentioned. By having different capture dates, several phases were obtained, between January and April the vegetation cover was estimated and the areas prone to forest fires for the drought season were determined through the relationship between the NDVI and the brightness temperature, in In the second phase that includes captures between June and August, the detection of forest fires was carried out through the NDMI and NDMISoil indices, giving a positive focus for the image captured on June 1, 2014, additionally for this same date it was shown The calculated temperature result, which reached temperatures higher than 50 degrees Celsius in areas close to the detected focus, this product was also obtained for the images corresponding to August 20 and September 5, showing temperatures higher than 30 degrees Celsius, which corresponds to dates after forest fires, in the third phase corresponding to the month of September the NBR was calculated, allowing the m felling of the post-fire scar, the sequence of the three phases ended with the estimation of affected production areas, where it was found that the crops were affected by almost 38%, which could mean a loss of almost 50% in the pulp production.

TI  - Landsat 9 Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 On-Orbit Calibration and Initial Performance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) on Landsat 9 (L9) was launched on September 27, 2021, and underwent a variety of tests during its commissioning phase to establish its postlaunch performance. We report on the calibration updates performed to maintain its calibration and generate high-quality imagery. This is done by transferring the SI-traceable prelaunch calibration to on-orbit while accounting for changes in the TIRS-2 response as detected through on-board calibrator observations. Additional empirical corrections were implemented to mitigate image striping observed on-orbit. The detector arrays were monitored through its commissioning phase to ensure that stable detectors were chosen for operations. TIRS-2 has demonstrated similar to 0.025% instability over its orbit, similar to 80-mK noise equivalent delta temperature (NEdT), and an absolute radiometric uncertainty <1.4% in its nominal temperature range enabling a wide array of Earth science applications.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a case of ciliochoroidal melanoma with massive spontaneous hemorrhagic retinal and choroidal detachment that presented a diagnostic challenge because of poor fundus visualization and atypical imaging features.METHODS: Case report.RESULTS: A 71-year-old white man on apixaban for atrial fibrillation presented with sudden onset of pain and vision loss in the left eye. The patient was found to have total hemorrhagic retinal detachment and was referred for our opinion. On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and light perception in the left eye. Intraocular pressures were 10 mmHg in the right eye and 21 mmHg in the left eye. The unaffected right eye demonstrated only macular retinal pigment epithelial alterations. Evaluation of the left eye revealed dilated episcleral sentinel vessels superonasally, shallow anterior chamber, and total hemorrhagic retinal and choroidal detachment to the back of the crystalline lens. There was no view of the choroid. Transillumination demonstrated diffuse blockage of light from blood and no specific shadow. B-scan ultrasonography revealed total retinal and choroidal detachment with dense echoes of blood under the retina and in the suprachoroidal space with elevation of 12 mm and no definite mass or spontaneous vascular pulsations. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse high signals within the globe on T1-weighted images with no specific mass. On gadolinium enhancement, a localized enhancing area temporally of 12-mm thickness and a localized nonenhanced area nasally of 11-mm thickness was noted. Both areas showed low signal on T2-weighted images. Despite atypical features, suspicion for underlying ciliochoroidal melanoma and poor visual prognosis lead to enucleation. Histopathology confirmed an extensively necrotic, mushroom-shaped ciliochoroidal melanoma with total hemorrhagic retinal and choroidal detachment.CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of necrotic posterior uveal melanoma can be challenging, because these tumors can be camouflaged by overlying hemorrhagic retinal and choroidal detachment and can present with atypical features on ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with spontaneous hemorrhagic retinal and choroidal detachment should be evaluated for possible underlying malignancy.

AB  - The integration of Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) displacement data with ground-based monitoring and ancillary multi-source information (deriving from geological-geomorphological-geotechnical analyses and damage surveys to the built-up environment) can nowadays provide a useful support to activities pursuing the management and protection of structures (e.g., buildings) and infrastructure (including roads, bridges, embankments) exposed to slow-moving landslide risk. Indeed, the implementation of the most suitable risk mitigation strategies requires appropriate procedures tailored on the quality and quantity of available datasets and their joint use according to the scope and the related scale of analysis.As a result of a 15-year multidisciplinary joint research activity, this paper presents a multi-scale methodology which is applied to buildings affected by slow-moving landslides located in selected areas of the Cosenza Province (Calabria region, southern Italy).

Trends extracted from land cover classifications between the years 2000 and 2020 informed on general land cover trends occurring in the study area, the THLD District of Ghana. Remotely sensed environmental and anthropogenic variables were combined with road and soil data to form the foundations of a suitability analysis. These classifications were then integrated along with time-series remote sensing variables and road and soil data into the suitability analysis, which analyses the validity of land areas for predetermined uses. The preliminary results of the classification show that urban areas have largely expanded throughout the THLD District, while there have been losses in forested areas. The baseline results from the suitability analysis effectively determined transportation accessibility and soil quality for areas across the THLD District. These results provide a strong foundation for the impacts of land use decisions on land cover and environmental trends.

AB  - The Sentinel-2 is a high resolution optical satellite mission, developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) for the European Commission. Currently the mission has two satellites in orbit: Sentinel-2A from 23rd June 2015, and Sentinel-2B from 7th March 2017. Revisit time for this twin constellation is five days. The twin satellites represent a very stable data source, but for the first six operational months (i.e. the second half of the 2015). From the very start of the mission, the Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (ZRC SAZU) is collecting its own archive of Sentinel-2 data for the extent of the Republic of Slovenia. The data is saved in its original processing state (Level-1C) and in four levels of processing. The archive has now been operating for six full years, which is a good milestone for a statistical overview. We analyse the archive of Sentinel-2 data of Slovenia from several aspects at the country level. A special focus is placed on cloud cover, as only cloud-free data can give an impression of the actual spatial and temporal usability of optical data.

TI  - Processing Techniques for Nadir Echo Suppression in Staggered Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a class of high-resolution imaging radar particularly suitable for satellite remote sensing with diverse applications, such as biomass and ice monitoring, generation of digital elevation models, and measuring of subsidence. Staggered SAR is a novel mode of operation under consideration for the next-generation SAR missions such as Tandem-L and NASA-ISRO SAR. It uses digital beamforming and a continuous variation of the pulse repetition interval (PRI) to achieve high azimuth resolution over a much wider, continuous swath than is traditionally possible. This PRI variation renders infeasible use of existing methods to avoid nadir echoes, which might impair the quality of staggered SAR images. This work proposes processing techniques that mitigate the impact of nadir echoes in staggered SAR through localization and thresholding-and-blanking of these echoes in range-compressed data and recovery of part of the underlying useful signal through interpolation. The performance of these processing techniques is evaluated through simulations using real TerraSAR-X data. The proposed technique can be implemented as an optional stage in the processing chain of future staggered SAR missions and leads to improved image quality at a reasonable additional computational cost.

TI  - VARIATION IN THE FUNCTIONS OF NARRATIVE IN MILITARY DISCOURSE
T2  - FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article identifies the kinds of variation in the functions of narrative in military discourse and the conditions that determine their realization. It proves that the function of narrative proper is observed only in certain types of military didactic discourse, when the speaker's goal is confined to providing accurate information (teaching someone how to use weapons, teaching self-defense techniques, and so on). In other types of didactic discourse, the narrative function is supplemented by the functions of educating and affirming society's value priorities. The types of variation are determined by discourse conditions: the social context of the communication and the speaker's illocutionary goal. In instructive speeches, the function of conveying information can be supplemented by that of affirming society's value priorities. In informative speeches, the narrative function is often accompanied by the functions of the evaluation and refutation of rumors, myths, or individual statements. Speeches on special occasions are characterized by the rearrangement of functions: the narrative function becomes supplementary, and the functions of evaluation, worldview formation, and the affirmation of value priorities become central. Inspirational speeches are most often built on the syncretism of narrative and persuasion. In all speech genres of military discourse, the function of a grand narrative is the formation of the positive image of military personnel.

TI  - Food Security Policies in Burkina Faso and Women's Participation in Rice Production: the Case of the Rural Municipality of Douna
T2  - DROIT ET CULTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Burkina Faso is developing lowlands in rural areas for rice production. These developments induce changes in the rice production system. The objective of this work is to show the changes in norms and facts that the dissemination of certified seeds within the framework of the legal seed system generates in farms. Survey work was carried out between January 2018 and July 2021 in the rural municipality of Douna. The main results show that the development policy leads to changes in land use and a land redistribution of plots to the detriment of women. Indeed, these dynamics that modernize the sector tend to exclude women. It is the international injunctions in favor of the defense of women's rights that manage to maintain them in the production of rice in developed areas. We are thus witnessing varietal replacements with the decline of old varieties and a masculinization of seed systems. In view of the particularity and value associated with African red rice, called pere in the local language, in Douna, the & DLANGBRAC;slow food sentinel & drangbrac; is very interested in it. Through this study, we show that rice, moving from undeveloped lowlands to developed areas, goes from a marginal production largely dominated and controlled by women to a major production in the male-dominated agrosystem.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning methods for water depth estimation using remote sensing require accurate prior depth measurements. The successful operation of the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission provides depth in shallow water directly; however, its spatial coverage is limited. Machine learning has been used to link optical remote sensing images and ICESat-2 data for bathymetric mapping. Compared with other machine learning models, convolutional neural network (CNN) models utilize the local spatial correlation between adjacent pixels and can, thus, reduce the effect of environmental noise. However, existing CNN and other machine learning models rely on data mining to build a general relationship between water depth and spectral information, and they ignore the known physical law. In this article, we propose a physics-assisted convolutional neural network (PACNN) model. This model incorporates knowledge from radiative transfer theory into a normal CNN model by building a series of spectral feature input layers. In the PACNN model, the spectral information, which is directly related to water depth, is emphasized. Multitemporal ICESat-2 data and Sentinel-2 images were used to validate the model. In experiments with data from three study areas, the PACNN model outperformed the existing CNN model, achieving an accuracy of over 98%. The proposed method can effectively solve the underestimation in deeper water (20-30 m) and reduce the variance of estimates. The superiority of the PACNN model demonstrates how a machine learning model can be assisted by physics theory.

TI  - Understanding the Role of Receptive Field of Convolutional Neural Network for Cloud Detection in Landsat 8 OLI Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep semantic segmentation networks perform better in cloud detection of satellite imagery than traditional methods due to their ability to extract high-level features over a large receptive field. However, a large receptive field often leads to loss of spatial details and blurring of boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the role of the receptive field on the segmentation results, which has rarely been investigated for cloud detection tasks. This study, for the first time, explored the relationship between the receptive field size and the performance of a cloud detection network. Six typical networks commonly used for cloud detection and nine modified UNet variants with different depths, dilated convolutions, and skip connections were evaluated based on the Landsat 8 Biome (L8 Biome) dataset. The theoretical receptive field (TRF) and the effective receptive field (ERF) were introduced to measure the receptive field sizes of different networks. The results revealed a negative correlation between the ERF size and cloud segmentation accuracies for different cloud distributions and a relatively weak negative correlation between the TRF size and segmentation accuracies. Furthermore, ERFs were considerably smaller than the corresponding TRFs for most networks, implying that large-scale contextual information was not learned after training. This result indicates the importance of using networks with a small receptive field for cloud detection of Landsat 8 OLI imagery. Moreover, as the boundary accuracies are significantly lower than the region accuracies, future efforts should be devoted to addressing inaccurate boundary localization rather than exploring the contextual information over a large receptive field.

TI  - Reconstruction of Optical Image Time Series With Unequal Lengths SAR Based on Improved Sequence-Sequence Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing time series are optimal for understanding and monitoring biochemical changes of key phenological parameters, which is essential for the assessment of vegetation health. However, due to cloud contamination, optical images often lack several days' to months' worth of information. Therefore, reconstructing optical time series based on the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is necessary, which has the advantage of the production of continuous images under all weather conditions. In this study, an improved sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model was proposed, which integrated teacher forcing (TF) with the attention mechanism to handle input and output time series with unequal lengths. The proposed model could be used to reconstruct optical full-band time series using SAR time series data and reduce sample requirements based on the modification of the loss calculation method. To explore the spatiotemporal scalability of the proposed model, the test samples were divided into three categories: same time but different spatial (STDS) domain, different time but same spatial (DTSS) domain, and both different temporal and spatial (DTDS) domains. The major findings can be summarized as follows: 1) 72.7% of the generated Landsat 8 sequence values had an absolute error (AE) of less than 0.05; 2) the mean AE (MAE) of all bands was less than 0.0812; 3) the mean squared errors (MSEs) of all samples were lower than 0.015 regardless of the type of the test sample; and 4) TF was introduced to the model to improve the accuracy of the generated Landsat 8 sequence, yielding an increase of more than 5.97%. We concluded that the proposed model had good robustness both temporally and spatially. It performed well in the reconstruction of optical image time series, provided a basis for the use of time series pairs with unequal lengths, and can be applied to cloud removal and vegetation index reconstruction.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - In deep learning based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) change detection, selecting samples of high quality is a crucial step. In this work, we have proposed a refined sample selection algorithm for unsupervised SAR change detection. The propose and incorporation of volume control factors and multi-hierarchical fuzzy c-means (MH-FCM) algorithm generate samples of large diversity and high confidence, thus satisfying the needs for high quality samples. The method includes two phases: firstly, an enhanced difference image is constructed according to the difference consistency between single pixels and their neighbourhoods, and a triangular threshold segmentation method is then proposed to determine the volume control factors for sample selection. MHFCM is developed to classify the log mean ratio difference image into 4 classes. Secondly, a dual-channel convolution neural network with an adaptive weighted loss is adopted to learn and predict the input and to obtain the change detection result. Experimental results of the Gaofen-3 dataset in Beijing have validated the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method.

TI  - Global estimates of 500 m daily aerodynamic roughness length from MODIS data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerodynamic roughness length (z0(m)) is a key parameter in the characterization of land surface turbulent heat fluxes and widely used in many surface and climate-related process models. The global products of time series of z0m at finer spatio-temporal resolution, however, have never been publicly available. Here we presented a practical method for global estimates of 500 m daily z0(m) with a combination of machine learning techniques, wind profile equation, observations from 273 sites and MODIS remote sensing data. Results showed that the random forest (RF) model outperformed the deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models, and it could well reproduce the magnitude and temporal variability of daily z0(m) at almost all sites for all land cover types. In the validation of the RF-estimated daily z0(m) with the in-situ observations, the root mean square error (RMSE) varied between 0.02 m and 0.09 m, the mean absolute error (MAE) varied between 0.01 m and 0.05 m and the coefficient of determination (R2) was 1 for medium-to-high canopy shrublands, savannas and forests; for short-canopy croplands, grasslands and wetlands, the RMSE and MAE were 0.02 m and 0.01 m, respectively, and the R2 varied between 0.94 and 1. Compared to the Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2, 0.3/monthly) and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5, 0.25/monthly) products in 2019, the RF-estimated z0m was found to have the similar global spatial pattern but significantly larger temporal variability, and it also showed a higher and lower global mean of z0(m) over forests and non-forests, respectively. The RF-estimated z0(m) displayed a higher temporal variability but a similar global spatial pattern of this variability compared to the CFSv2, whereas the ERA5 z0m product exhibited almost no temporal variability except for grasslands and croplands. This study is beneficial for improving the simulation of the momentum, water and energy transfer between land and atmosphere and helping boost the development of high-resolution land surface models and Earth system models.

AB  - The exploitation of sequences of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for change detection analyses has become a common practice for the analysis of changes that occurred in different ecosystems. As the first step of any Change Detection approach is the reduction of the speckle effects in every single SAR image. Local and non-local filters have been properly designed to reduce the noise effects and make more efficient the retrieval of changed features. In this work, a joint space-time non-local mean filter, relying on the mutual exploitation of similarities in time and space, is applied to the Kerala region, India, to determine the areas and the extent of a large flood that hit the region in 2018. The methods can be extended for the analysis of different phenomena, such as landslides, coastal flooding, crop monitoring changes depending on the resolution of available SAR images and the number of available SAR scenes that are compared to one another. In this work, some preliminarily results with sequences of Sentinel-1 SAR images are shown.

AB  - In this study, we show the potential of a synergistic use of COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for the analysis of ground deformations in coastal regions potentially subjected to flood risk. The global climate change and the inherent increase of the mean sea level exacerbate the risk. In this work, we want to focus on the capability of high-resolution CSK images, combined with medium-resolution Sentinel-1 data, to jointly provide a more comprehensive view of the changes occurring in highly urbanized coastal regions, such as the one represented by the megacity of Shanghai. Specifically, we have applied a split-spectrum method to identify a set of highly coherent SAR pixels. The location and spatial density of such permanent (and the semipermanent scatters) have revealed helpful to generate a flood risk map for the coastal area of Shanghai in a worst-case scenario. To this aim, we have used the LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model to forecast possible inundation patterns and used the estimated density of high-coherent SAR pixels into the inundated areas to quantify the coastal flood impacts. Similar analyses could also be extended to other coastal regions in the World, as the West Coast of U.S.

T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Landscape modifications often undermine habitat suitability for species' persistence, with initial effects observed through physiological responses of individuals and populations. However, some landscape features can allow tolerant wildlife species to persist in human-modified landscapes, but they are still overlooked. Across distinct agricultural landscapes, we assessed landscape features affecting the body condition (estimate through scaled mass index - SMI) of Caiman crocodilus (Crocodylia, Alligatoridae) in human-modified landscapes of the Araguaia floodplain, central Brazil. We used a spatial Bayesian model averaging approach to determine the effects of landscape attributes, ectoparasites, tail damage, and severe body injuries on caiman body condition. We found that caimans had higher SMI in anthropogenic (ditches and artificial ponds) than natural habitats (lakes or rivers). Overall, caiman SMI was negatively associated with wetland cohesion (an aggregation and connectivity metric). Otherwise, landscape composition did not influence caiman SMI. Further, ectoparasites and body injuries did not affect SMI, whereas tail damage negatively affected SMI. Our findings underscore that caiman populations can adapt to artificial wetlands and irrigated rice fields, provided they incorporate natural and semi-natural habitat patches that enhance environmental heterogeneity, prey availability, and waterbody availability and connectivity.

The annual flood pulse drastically changes the landscape (wet season: October-April; dry season: May-September), spanning about 88,000 km2 at maximum flood level (February/March) and interconnecting several waterbodies, while only 3.3% (2,930 km2) of water area is present in the low-water period, September-November (Irion et al., 2016). The Araguaia floodplain supports a rich and abundant biota, including many endemic and endangered species, protected by a RAMSAR site (Ilha do Bananal; noo. 624), parks, and indigenous lands (RAMSAR, 2002; SEPLAN, 2012). We carried out fieldwork between July and September of 2016 and 2018 (dry season), a period with a higher abundance of caimans in the waterbodies (Da Silveira, Magnusson and Thorbjarnarson, 2008; Portelinha et al., 2019). We sampled seven localities across the middle Araguaia River floodplain: Fazenda Praia Alta, Lagoa da Confusao, Tocantins (July 27 - Aug 03, 2016), hereafter Lagoa; Cooperativa Agroindustrial Rio Formoso - Cooperformoso, Formoso do Araguaia, Tocantins (July 21 - Aug 12, 2018), hereafter Cooperformoso; Cooperativa Mista Rural Lagoa Grande - Coopergran, Formoso do Araguaia, Tocantins (July 31 - Aug 14, 2018), hereafter Coopergran; Fazenda Xavante, Duere, Tocantins (Aug 16-23, 2018), hereafter Xavante; Fazenda Bananal-Frutacc, Lagoa da Confusao, Tocantins (Aug 25-28, 2018), hereafter Bananal; Centro de Pesquisas Cangucu, Pium, Tocantins (Aug 30-31, 2018), hereafter Cangucu; Fazenda Santo Antonio, Cristalandia, Tocantins (Sept 02-07, 2018), hereafter Cristalandia. The localities were separated from each other by at least 20 km to maintain a degree of spatial independence, based on migration and movement studies of South American crocodilians that indicate maximum movement distances of 20 km in 1-5 years (Gorzula, 1978; Ouboter and Nanhoe, 1988; Campos et al., 2006). Study design We sampled natural and anthropogenic/artificial habitats in each locality, comprehending 32 sites visited in total. We recorded landscape metrics for circular buffers (500-m, 1-km, and 3-km radius) with land use/cover rasters from the MapBiomas Project (http://mapbiomas.org, collection 4, year: 2016 and 2018). We redefined MapBiomas land-use classes considering five categories: water, forest, savanna (savanna, grassland, non-forest natural formation, and other non-forest natural formation classes), pasture (pasture and other non-vegetated area classes), and agriculture (annual and perennial crop class). We excluded the urban class due to low coverage representation, less than 1%. To improve water coverage, we generated a hydrography raster from a vectorial database acquired from Secretaria do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Hidricos of the State of Tocantins (https://semarh.to.gov.br/car/base-vetorial-digital-tematica-do-car/). Further, we improved MapBiomas land use mapping due to differences between supervised in loco coverage and MapBiomas rasters. We reclassified and redefined the topology guided by Landsat 8 satellite images for the same months of caiman sampling in 2016 and 2018, with a 30-m pixel spatial resolution obtained from the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais-INPE (Brazilian Space Agency; http://www.inpe.br/) using QGIS, version 3.12 (QGIS Development Team, 2020). For each buffer, we calculated landscape metrics for the designated classes with the landscapemetrics package (Hesselbarth et al., 2019): the percentage of landscape (PCLASS) and mean patch area (MPA) for all classes; the mean Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance (ENN), patch cohesion index (COHESION), and largest patch index (LPI) restricted to waterbody class; and the landscape shape index (LSI) and landscape division index (LDI) (McGarigal and Marks, 1995). Field methods We captured 294 caimans during the sampling through nocturnal spotlight surveys with the aid of locking cable snares or by hand after locating the animals by eye-reflection (Fitzgerald, 2012; Brien and Manolis, 2016). From each captured caiman, we recorded the following: habitat type; geographic coordinates, with a Garmin GPSMAP 62sc; snout-vent length (SVL), from tip of snout to posterior margin of cloaca, and total length (TTL), from tip of snout to end of tail, with a 0.1-cm precision tape; body mass, with a 0.1-kg precision spring scale; and sex, by cloacal examination and palpation of the penis. Moreover, we recorded the presence of ectoparasites (ticks and leeches) and severe injuries (amputations, lesions, fractures, and lacerations) in the animals. We conducted this study under permits SISBIO #13324-6 and #57940-3 (issued by Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservacao da Biodiversidade), FUNAI #08620.005147/2018-38 (Fundacao Nacional do Indio), and CEUA-UnB #94/2017 (Comissao de Etica no Uso de Animais da Universidade de Brasilia). We used the SVL as a body size estimate instead of total length due to bias resulting from tail loss and damage.

AB  - Landscape modifications often undermine habitat suitability for species' persistence, with initial effects observed through physiological responses of individuals and populations. However, some landscape features can allow tolerant wildlife species to persist in human-modified landscapes, but they are still overlooked. Across distinct agricultural landscapes, we assessed landscape features affecting the body condition (estimate through scaled mass index - SMI) of Caiman crocodilus (Crocodylia, Alligatoridae) in human-modified landscapes of the Araguaia floodplain, central Brazil. We used a spatial Bayesian model averaging approach to determine the effects of landscape attributes, ectoparasites, tail damage, and severe body injuries on caiman body condition. We found that caimans had higher SMI in anthropogenic (ditches and artificial ponds) than natural habitats (lakes or rivers). Overall, caiman SMI was negatively associated with wetland cohesion (an aggregation and connectivity metric). Otherwise, landscape composition did not influence caiman SMI. Further, ectoparasites and body injuries did not affect SMI, whereas tail damage negatively affected SMI. Our findings underscore that caiman populations can adapt to artificial wetlands and irrigated rice fields, provided they incorporate natural and semi-natural habitat patches that enhance environmental heterogeneity, prey availability, and waterbody availability and connectivity.

AB  - Coffee production is an activity of great economic and social importance in Brazil. This agribusiness segment stands out in the economy of small cities in southern Minas Gerais, as it involves family farming and the permanence of the rural population in the countryside. This study aimed to contribute and adapt geotechnology-based methods for the remote mapping of coffee and the strengthening of the permanence of this population, providing an online platform to simulate coffee trading. The municipality of Inconfidentes/MG was the study area. Orbital images of the Sentinel-2A satellite were used in the development of the study. Images were classified in a supervised way with the random forest classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and later used as a data source in the online platform developed in the Application Programming Interface (API) Leaflet to simulate coffee trading involving the cryptocurrency Coffee Coin. Results allowed the identification and mapping of coffee growing areas by remote sensing and, also, to demonstrate that the online platform can help in the planning of new investments in coffee production, in addition to presenting an overview of the economic importance of coffee to the municipality.

AB  - Mediterranean Europe is strongly affected by wildfires. In Portugal, the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests (ICNF) implemented the national fuel break (FB) network responsible for fire control and suppression. FBs are regions where vegetation is reduced to break up the fuel continuity and create pathways for the firefighting vehicles. The efficiency of this strategy relies on the correct implementation of FBs and on periodic fuel treatments. Multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2 (with high temporal and spatial resolution) facilitates the monitoring of FBs and the implementation of methodologies for their management. In this paper a two stages methodology is proposed for monitoring FBs. The first stage consists in detecting fuel treatments in FBs, to understand if those were correctly executed. This is done through a change detection methodology with resource to an Artificial Neural Network. The second stage monitors the vegetation recovery after a fuel treatment, to aid the scheduling of new treatments, ensuring the efficiency of FBs during the fire season. Both methodologies resort to reflectance bands and spectral indices from Sentinel-2; and timeseries and objects, exploiting the temporal and spatial information. The two stages were tested in different regions across the Portuguese territory, demonstrating their usability for all the national fuel break network. The detection of treatments achieved a relative error lower than 4%, and the vegetation recovery cycle estimated by the second stage match the expectations from ICNF.

AB  - With the advancement of sensor technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones revolutionize several fields including topographic surveying, agriculture, recreation, emergency, rescue and so on. The autonomous flight modes available in current UAVs make it broaden to manoeuvring by an unskilled person. This, of course, causes to widely use the drone technology among different user communities. Of the revolutionized fields, topographic surveying is prominent because many low cost UAVs with o-board light weight optical payloads often deliver mapping products such as ortho-photos and DEMs with centimetre level accuracy (in XY and Z) that had been exclusively bounded to the expensive field surveying methods earlier. Though drones enables to obtain centimetre level geometric accuracy, the main drawback of the technology is inability to see underneath vegetation canopy which hinders applicability of drones for a complete topographical survey. In order to view beneath the tree canopies, UAV LiDAR is a solution but due to its high cost, it is still not popular among several communities who involve with land surveying. To measure underside vegetation, field surveying methods such as total stations and theodolites traversing are being mainly practised by the users. But it is also not a viable solution since it consumes much time and money. If remotely sensed data collection is able to capture landscapes that had been hampers by the canopies, definitely it will be a cost effective and a rapid solution. As such, oblique imagery (UAV) acquired in manual flight mode at very low altitudes is a good solution. The objective of the study is to develop a novel approach to generate UAV deliveries without vegetation canopy in vegetated areas.First, autonomous flight mission is completed while maintaining 80% and 70% forward and lateral overlaps. For the terrain patches where they are covered by tree canopies, oblique imageries have been collected while operating the drone manually at low altitudes. Each UAV flight is separately processed and merged in to a single image to extract 2D maps without gaps beneath tree canopies. Resampling is fulfilled prior to stitching in order to gain a seamless product. Performed accuracy analysis confirmed that the developed approach is sufficient to produce DTMs and ortho-mosaics having average RMSE-XY 0.087m and RMSE-Z 0.177m at 4.0cm GSD which is really acceptable. Besides, there is not any significant accuracy variation between underneath canopy areas and open areas.

TI  - Evaluating the best spectral indices for burned areas in the tropical Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve, Southeastern Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical wetlands are ecosystems of great ecological importance, but their loss has accelerated in recent decades. Even though its hydrological, geological, and chemical characteristics make the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve (PCBR) the most significant wetland in Mesoamerica, it is the worst affected by forest fires area each year of Tabasco, Mexico. Satellite remote sensing is proposed as a cost-effective alternative to locate and delimit fire-affected surfaces in these difficult-to-access environments more precisely. The objective of the present study was to determine the optimal Landsat 8 spectral index for the detection of burned areas within the PCBR. It was possible to identify and extract 41 disturbed areas in six years. These areas were submitted to calculate six spectral burn indices, widely tested in detecting fire scars in forest areas, BAI, MIRBI, NBR, NBR2, NBRT1 , NBRT3 , including the best-known vegetation index NDVI. The capacity of each index to discriminate burned areas was estimated by comparing them with each other by using a separability index. The comparisons of the annual coefficients of variation allowed the evaluation of separability dispersion, indicating how homogeneous each index was. MIRBI was identified as the index with the highest potential for discrimination of burned areas in the PCBR, followed by far by NBR2. It is expected that these results can serve, among other things, to characterize, evaluate and prioritize monitoring areas to contribute by updating and improving the fire management plan in the PCBR. They are also expected to help subsequent studies on fire dynamics associated with human activities that cause and impact fire, such as burn severity, biomass loss, and post-fire vegetation regeneration.

AB  - The characteristics of the Filomena storm and its impact on the trees of Madrid are analysed using synoptic maps, centuries-old snowfall data and satellite images at different scales (Terra MODIS, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2). This historical snowfall affected half the surface of the Iberian Peninsula in January 2021, and its consequences were aggravated by the persistence of the subsequent anticyclonic situation, which kept surface temperatures in Madrid between -13 degrees C and -2.5 degrees C. The impact on the woodland, measured with images of changes in the NDVI, affected 11% of the winter vegetation cover of Madrid, with very notable damages to Pinus pinea, P. halepensis and Quercus ilex, both in the urban roads and in the city's many parks, gardens and forest spaces.

TI  - Scientist naturalism as pseudo religion and anti-natural theology
T2  - SCIENTIA ET FIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - After exposing the basic ideas of the naturalistic worldview (sections 1, 2 and 3), an attempt is made to show that naturalism is an interpretation of science that has an inescapable "mythological" dimension, in the sense that Midgley gives to this expression (section 5). This does not discredit it on principle but means that we cannot accept it uncritically by the mere fact that it appeals to the natural sciences to justify its validity. It is then argued that the central commitment of naturalists is the affirmation of atheism. In fact, the most radical contemporary naturalisms can be interpreted as an attempt to make every natural theology impossible, i.e., they seek to destroy the grounds on which reason classically relies to affirm the existence of God. It is argued that naturalism does not necessarily enjoy a priori epistemological superiority over theism.

TI  - Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Air Quality of the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo: Analysis Based on Satellite Data, Monitoring Stations and Records of Annual Average Daily Traffic Volumes on the Main Access Roads to the City
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the air quality of the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP). The effects of social distancing are still recent in the society; however, it was possible to observe patterns of environmental changes in places that had adhered transportation measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Thus, from the analysis of the traffic volumes made on some of the main access highways to the MRSP, as well as the monitoring of the levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), directly linked to atmospheric emissions from motor vehicles-which make up about 95% of air polluting agents in the region in different locations-we showed relationships between the improvement in air quality and the decrease in vehicles that access the MRSP. To improve the data analysis, therefore, the isolation index parameter was evaluated to provide daily information on the percentage of citizens in each municipality of the state that was effectively practicing social distancing. The intersection of these groups of data determined that the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the volume of vehicles on the highways by up to 50% of what it was in 2019, with the subsequent recovery of the traffic volume, even surpassing the values from the baseline year. Thus, the isolation index showed a decline of up to 20% between its implementation in March 2020 and December 2020. These data and the way they varied during 2020 allowed to observe an improvement of up to 50% in analyzed periods of the pollutants PM2.5, CO and NO2 in the MRSP. The main contribution of this study, alongside the synergistic use of data from different sources, was to perform traffic flow analysis separately for light and heavy duty vehicles (LDVs and HDVs). The relationships between traffic volume patterns and COVID-19 pollution were analyzed based on time series.

TI  - Retrieval of Land Surface Emissivities Over Partially Vegetated Surfaces From Satellite Data Using Radiative Transfer Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface emissivity (LSE) is a key variable for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from satellite data. In this study, five emissivity radiative transfer models (RTMs) for vegetation canopies are investigated together with a classification-based methodology to produce canopy LSE maps over the Iberian Peninsula with EOS Aqua-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The five canopy RTMs are FR97, Mod3, REN15, 4SAIL, and CE-P. The analysis of the RTMs' performance with satellite data gains interest over partially vegetated surfaces, for which these models can obtain accurate emissivities. The sensitivity analyses showed that FR97, REN15, 4SAIL, and CE-P models have higher uncertainty for low leaf area indexes (LAIs), while the Mod3 model increases the uncertainty with LAI. The produced LSEs were first intercompared with emissivities from the MODIS MYD21A1 product, which is obtained with the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) method. The RTMs agreed with the TES emissivities within the given uncertainty. In addition, the RTM emissivities were compared with MYD11A1 and MYD11B1 MODIS products, and the IREMIS and CAMEL databases, and they were used to estimate the LST at three specific homogeneous sites: shrubland, vineyard, and olive orchard. The LSTs estimated with each modeled emissivity and emissivity products were validated against reference data at these sites. All RTMs provided accurate LST data, equal to or even better than the MODIS products, with median values of differences between -0.7 K and 0.4 K depending on the site. Therefore, the canopy emissivity RTMs used in this study, together with the classification-based methodology, showed to be suitable for satellite LST retrieval.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE HISTORIA & CIENCIAS SOCIAIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes newspapers, reports from provincial and state presidents, as well as documents from the Espirito Santo Hygiene Inspectorate in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in order to understand the transformations in the meaning of the concepts of death and dying that occurred in the capital of Espirito Santo during the aforementioned period. The 'delay' in the removal of cemeteries from the city's central region is worthy to mention, because, unlike other Brazilian capitals, the construction of an extramural holy field in Vitoria was only possible in the second decade of the 20th century. In light of this untimely outcome, the article argues that, because of the clash between the Catholic worldview and the modern dictates about death, there prevailed the interests of a portion of the local agro-exporting elite. The latter not only influenced the redirection of funds to infrastructure constructions of their interest but also influenced the postponement of the construction of a new cemetery, thus overlapping its short-term economic interests with the benefits for the public health of the capixaba population.

TI  - How to Get the Most Out of U-Net for Glacier Calving Front Segmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The melting of ice sheets and glaciers is one of the main contributors to global sea-level rise. Hence, continuous monitoring of glacier changes and in particular the mapping of positional changes of their calving front is of significant importance. This delineation process, in general, has been carried out manually, which is time-consuming and not feasible for the abundance of available data within the past decade. Automatic delineation of the glacier fronts in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can be performed using deep learning-based U-Net models. This article aims to study and survey the components of a U-Net model and optimize the model to get the most out of U-Net for glacier (calving front) segmentation. We trained the U-Net to segment the SAR images of Sjogren-Inlet and Dinsmoore-Bombardier-Edgworth glacier systems on the Antarctica Peninsula region taken by ERS-1/2, Envisat, RadarSAT-1, ALOS, TerraSAR-X, and TanDEM-X missions. The U-Net model was optimized in six aspects. The first two aspects, namely data preprocessing and data augmentation, enhanced the representation of information in the image. The remaining four aspects optimized the feature extraction of U-Net by finding the best-suited loss function, bottleneck, normalization technique, and dropouts for the glacier segmentation task. The optimized U-Net model achieves a dice coefficient score of 0.9378 with a 20% improvement over the baseline U-Net model, which achieved a score of 0.7377. This segmentation result is further postprocessed to delineate the calving front. The optimized U-Net model shows 23% improvement in the glacier front delineation compared to the baseline model.

AB  - Object counting and object density estimation is a basic technology serving many applications. For that reason, a multitude of benchmarks are existing in the computer vision community allowing to evaluate and compare different solutions for object counting. However, in remote sensing, such benchmarks are not available, which hinders fair evaluations between different methods and paradigms. This work should lead to discussions on how to optimally design and set up object counting benchmarks in remote sensing for multiple object categories and also for various satellite data, including multi-resolution, multi-spectral, and multi-modal data from optical and SAR sensors.

T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. B cell-mediated immunity can be associated with favorable clinical outcomes in cancer patients. However, the mechanism and features of anti-tumor immune responses are not well understood. In particular, how B cells expressing tumor-specific antibodies are distributed (in the tumor vs. the circulation) has not been well defined. Methods. We performed an in-depth analysis of B cell antibody repertoires derived from the tumor, sentinel lymph nodes and peripheral blood of three treatment-naive patients with breast cancer. We integrated transcriptional analysis, next-generation sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements and phage display to define B cell responses and clonal architecture in the tumor microenvironment, and to identify antibodies against autologous tumor tissues. Results. B cell clonal lineage mapping across sequencing libraries generated from the tumor, sentinel lymph node and blood revealed that some expanded B cell clones overlap between tumor and lymph node, and fewer clones overlapped with the peripheral blood. Notably, tumor-associated or tumor-binding clones recovered in the phage panning and tracked back through the tissues harboured extensive somatic hypermutations in both the tumor and the lymph node. Conclusions. These findings suggest an evolving humoral immune response that targets the tumor and the possibility of monitoring B cell clones of interest in blood after identifying them in tumor or lymph node samples. Studying the dynamics and specificity of B cell responses may provide insights into the characteristics of successful anti-tumor immunity, provide a means for monitoring therapy and yield novel targets for personalised therapies.

TI  - Ideology, socialization and hegemony in Disciplinary International Relations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article argues that Disciplinary International Relations (DIR) does not only explain international affairs, but also socializes publics and professionals into a worldview of hegemonic liberalism. In the early twentieth century, UK scholars doubled as defenders of empire, today American scholars double up as policy-makers.This article argues that Disciplinary International Relations (DIR) does not only explain international affairs, but it also socializes and hegemonizes publics and professionals into an ideological worldview consistent with the interest of states that underwrite the world economic and security order based on hegemonic liberalism. Considerable emphasis is placed on tracing the continuities between the early theorization of IR in the United Kingdom and the United States, and the contemporary academic/foreign policy/security 'complex' dedicated to the maintenance of a hegemonic world order. The article demonstrates that the call for a greater theory-policy nexus in international affairs is redundant because leading American scholars double up as policy-makers, either directly or through other avenues such as consultancies. Some of the most prominent IR scholars, such as Michael Doyle, John Lewis Gaddis, Samuel Huntington, G. John Ikenberry, Stephen Krasner, Theodore H. Moran, Joseph Nye and Anne-Marie Slaughter, among others, have served in high-level positions in the United States foreign policy and security apparatus. The article also shows the ways in which in the early days of IR theorizing in the UK, scholars such as Lionel Curtis, Alfred Zimmern and Norman Angell doubled as staunch defenders of the British Empire, albeit in the language of liberal internationalism.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data acquired at C- and X-band to estimate forest aboveground biomass (biomass) at a test site in southern Sweden. The SAR data were acquired with RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X in September 2015, and the biomass estimations were cross-validated with 48 field inventoried plots of 40 m radius (0.5 ha), covering dominantly coniferous hemi-boreal forest. The quad-pol SAR data (HH, HV, VH, VV) were decomposed using the Yamaguchi model and the mean modelled scatter components for the plots were extracted and used as predictors in linear regression models to estimate the biomass.The model performances were quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE) and adjusted coefficient of determination, R-adj(2). The leave-one-out cross-validated RMSEs were 58.1 (37.1%) and 60.6 (38.6%) tons/ha for C- and X-band, respectively, and the R-adj(2) were 0.52 and 0.47, respectively. The regression model for C-band data used the volume and helix scattering components in the Yamaguchi decomposition as predictors, while the corresponding X-band model used the double bounce and surface components. The differences were likely due to the different penetrations at C- and X-band. We noticed a tendency to saturation at about 300 tons/ha in the X-band predictions, while no such tendency was noticed for the C-band model.We conclude that the Yamaguchi polarimetric decomposition technique is a useful approach when estimating biomass in a hemi-boreal forest. The strengths are not comparable to approaches where height information are available (e.g., single-pass interferometry from TanDEM-X), but this polarimetric approach based on single satellite images showed sensitivity to the entire biomass range (0 - 400 tons/ha) in our dataset. The potential of using quad-pol SAR data is, therefore, important to investigate further.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXVII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Long-term exposure to airborne fine particulate matter or PM2.5 is associated with an increase in the long-term risk of premature death that creates critical concerns for public health. This study uses twenty years (2002-2021) of daily remotely sensed data with multi-spatial resolution of 1 km to 3 km to examine the long-term spatiotemporal distribution of PM2.5 across Thailand. Good agreement is found between the in-situ measurements of PM2.5 and instantaneous estimates made from the satellite data with correlation coefficients of 0.51. Based on data analysis during the year 2002-2021, the region with the highest yearly averaged concentration level of PM2.5 was a central region of Thailand (19.91 mu g.m(-3)) followed by northern (19.11 mu g.m(-3)), northeastern (18.92 mu g.m(-3)), eastern (18.76 mu g.m(-3)) and southern (16.16 mu g.m(-3)) region, respectively. The period with the highest PM2.5 levels were during March and April with monthly averages 23.74 to 26.72 mu g.m(-3). For the 20-year record, monthly-mean PM2.5 concentration in northern Thailand showed statistically significant increase at the rate of 0.14 mu g.m(-3) month-1 in dry season, the same as in the northeastern (0.126 mu g.m(-3)month-1), eastern (0.12 mu g.m(-3) month-1) and Central region (0.083 mu g.m(-3) month-1). While the southern region has a negative trend (-0.018 mu g.m-3 month-1) which is different from other regions. The spatiotemporal variation and changing of PM2.5 concentrations were a result of both changing in meteorological factors and anthropogenic activities. Here, we discuss and present possible explanations for long-term spatiotemporal variation of PM2.5.

AB  - GEE-TED: A tsetse ecological distribution model for Google Earth Engine Associated publication forthcoming: Fox, L., Peter, B. G., Frake, A. N., and Messina, J. P. (Forthcoming). A Bayesian maximum entropy model for predicting tsetse ecological distributions. Journal TBD. Description GEE-TED is a Google Earth Engine (GEE; Gorelick et al. 2017) adaptation of a tsetse ecological distribution (TED) model developed by DeVisser et al. (2010), which was designed for use in ESRI's ArcGIS. TED uses time-series climate and land-use/land-cover (LULC) data to predict the probability of tsetse presence across space based on species habitat preferences (in this case Glossina Morsitans). Model parameterization includes (1) day and night temperatures (MODIS Land Surface Temperature; MOD11A2), (2) available moisture/humidity using a vegetation index as a proxry (MODIS NDVI; MOD13Q1), (3) LULC (MODIS Land Cover Type 1; MCD12Q1), (4) year selections, and (5) fly movement rate (meters/16-days). TED has also been used as a basis for the development of an agent-based model by Lin et al. (2015) and in a cost-benefit analysis of tsetse control in Tanzania by Yang et al. (2017). Parameterization in Fox et al. (Forthcoming): Suitable LULC types and climate thresholds used here are specific to Glossina Morsitans in Kenya and are based on the parameterization selections in DeVisser et al. (2010) and DeVisser and Messina (2009). Suitable temperatures range from 17-40°C during the day and 10-40°C at night and available moisture is characterized as NDVI 0.39. Suitable LULC comprises predominantly woody vegetation; a complete list of suitable categories is available in DeVisser and Messina (2009). In the Fox et al. (Forthcoming) publication, two versions of MCD12Q1 were used to assess suitable LULC types: Versions 051 and 006. The GeoTIFF supplied in this dataset entry (GEE-TED_Kenya_2016-2017.tif) uses the aforementioned parameters to show the probable tsetse distribution across Kenya for the years 2016-2017. A static graphic of this GEE-TED output is shown below and an interactive version can be viewed at: https://cartoscience.users.earthengine.app/view/gee-ted. Figure associated with Fox et al. (Forthcoming) GEE code The code supplied below is generalizable across geographies and species; however, it is highly recommended that parameterization is given considerable attention to produce reliable results.

AB  - In this work the classification of Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature (S3-SLSTR) images with a focus on volcanic cloud detection through a Neural Networks (NNs) approach is presented.Since the hazardous nature of eruptions, a fast and reliable method to monitor the evolution of volcanic clouds in real time is of primary interest. NNs represent a suitable tool for this purpose given their short processing time once trained, and their ability to solve complex problems as those related to natural events.The present research starts from the generation of the training patterns by means of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data collected during the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull (Iceland) eruption, it goes through the training of the NN, and ends with the application of the NN-based model to SLSTR data collected during the 2019 Raikoke (Kuril Island, Russia) eruption.

T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING XIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring XIV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The 2(nd) Reanalysis (RAN2) of the 4 km Global Area Coverage (GAC) data of the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR/2s and /3s) flown onboard ten NOAA satellites from Sep'1981 - present was performed, and global sea surface temperature (SST) dataset created with the NOAA Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Oceans (ACSPO) enterprise system. The RAN2 dataset includes two SST products retrieved in a full similar to 3,000 km AVHRR swath: "Subskin" (highly sensitive to true skin SST) and "Depth" (agreeing much closer with in situ SST, but with a reduced sensitivity). The performance of both RAN2 SST products were improved compared with RAN1, by mitigation of several AVHRR sensor issues. The long-term AVHRR calibration trends were mitigated by daily recalculation of the regression coefficients using matchups with in situ SSTs collected within limited time windows centered at the processed day. Biases with respect to in situ SST were further minimized on a monthly basis by adjustment of the offsets of regression equations based on 31-day moving windows. Massive cold SST outliers, caused by nighttime Sun impingements on the AVHRR's black body calibration targets, were corrected by interpolating the L1b calibration coefficients between the unaffected parts of the orbit. The Earth view pixels affected by stray sunlight were identified and screened out using the elevated signal in the AVHRR band 2 (0.86 mu m). This paper describes the methodology and demonstrates its effects on the RAN2 SST.

TI  - Foreign Policy Aspects in Attitudes of Germany Parliamentary Parties during Period of A. Merkel's Chancellorship (2005-2021)
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The main directions in the foreign policy agendas of the leading parties in Germany during the period of A. Merkel's chancellorship are considered. The relevance of the study is due to the need to study the strategic program settings of the German parliamentary parties, which will allow a better understanding of what the country's future foreign policy may be. It is emphasized that the party system of Germany is quite stable: only three parties have joined the parliamentary parties of the first convocation - the CDU / CSU, the FDP and the SDPG - at the present stage: the "Union 90 / Greens", "Left" and since 2017 - "Alternative for Germany". Particular attention is paid to the study of the election and fundamental programs of the parliamentary parties of Germany, as they reflect the party's "worldview", views on the place and role of the country in the world, the ultimate or most important goals to which the party should move, as well as the means and methods for achieving the set goals. Based on the analysis of these documents, it is concluded that there is a certain consensus among parliamentary parties on key issues related to the country's foreign policy. Demands for a revision of the chosen course are heard only from right and left populists, who do not have a significant impact on German foreign policy.

TI  - Tuvan and Belarusian proverbial parallels (typological community amid ethnocultural specificity)
T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the relevant objectives of contemporary paremiology as a separate linguistic discipline is to determine the typologi-cally common pattern in the proverbial collections of the world's languages amid their ethnocultural specificity due to the lack of linguistic affinity and areal proximity. An analysis of Tuvan proverbs in the typological aspect will allow to identify and measure the correlation of what is common with other languages and what is nationally specific in them. The research identifies typologically significant similarities of proverbs in the Tuvan language and reveals their ethnocultural features in comparison with proverbs in the Belarusian language. The research data comprised collections of Tuvan and Belar- usian proverbs and sayings, as well as examples of proverbs from vocabulary sources of the Tuvan and Belarusian languages. It has been found out that every eighth proverb in the Tuvan proverbial fund has either a complete analog in the Belarusian one, or a Belarusian proverb that is identical in its structural and semantic model, or a homologous image and/or concept in semantically correlative proverbs in Belarusian. Such a remarkable amount and variety of interlanguage parallels of Tuvan and Belarusian proverbs indicate the typological proximity of the proverbial vocabularies of the two languages. At the same time, most of the parallels to Belarusian proverbs are nationally marked in Tuvan. This indicates a tight interrelation and interaction of typologically general and ethnoculturally specific features in the Tuvan proverbial worldview.

TI  - Fast Urban Land Cover Mapping Exploiting Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid change and expansion of human settlements raise the need for precise remote-sensing monitoring tools. While some Land Cover (LC) maps are publicly available, the knowledge of the up-to-date urban extent for a specific instance in time is often missing. The lack of a relevant urban mask, especially in developing countries, increases the burden on Earth Observation (EO) data users or requires them to rely on time-consuming manual classification. This paper explores fast and effective exploitation of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data for the generation of urban LC, which can be frequently updated. The method is based on an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA), where one Multi-Spectral (MS) image is used to define clusters of similar pixels through super-pixel segmentation. A short stack (<2 months) of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is then employed to classify the clusters, exploiting the unique characteristics of the radio backscatter from human-made targets. The repeated illumination and acquisition geometry allows defining robust features based on amplitude, coherence, and polarimetry. Data from ascending and descending orbits are combined to overcome distortions and decrease sensitivity to the orientation of structures. Finally, an unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) model is used to separate the signature of urban targets in a mixed environment. The method was validated in two sites in Portugal, with diverse types of LC and complex topography. Comparative analysis was performed with two state-of-the-art high-resolution solutions, which require long sensing periods, indicating significant agreement between the methods (averaged accuracy of around 90%).

T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and inventorying proglacial lakes in the Maritime Antarctica region is essential for understanding the effects of climate change on these environments. This study uses Landsat images to create a map of lakes in ice-free areas of the South Shetlands Islands (SSI) for 1986/89, 2000/03 and 2020, and verification of patterns of change in lake areas and numbers. Normalized water difference index (NDWI) products, image segmentation, field records, and cartographic products from other studies were used to validate the results. Results show a 60% increase in the number of lakes from 1986/89 to 2000/03; and a 55% increase from 2000/03 to 2020. There was a 52% increase in lake areas from 1986/89 to 2000/03; a 79% increase from 2000/03 to 2020; and a 173% increase from 1986 to 2020. From 1986 to 2020, the most significant changes were a decrease in the average elevation and distance from glaciers and an increase in distance from the sea. In 2020, SSI lakes were predominantly coastal and ice-marginal, with an E and S orientations, fl at surfaces, and a low declivity.

AB  - In this paper, an investigation on the agricultural management in semi-arid Mediterranean regions is presented. The selected test areas are located in Tunisia, near the Kairouan town. The agricultural fields are mainly cultivated with olive trees together with cereals, fruit trees and vegetables. The possibility to monitor this area by means of COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) data, thanks to the ASI Open Call initiative, is an added value to retrieve information concerning the temporal evolution of crop conditions and the use of water in semi-arid regions. The CSK images have been acquired in the period 2018-2019 and the spring 2021. The objectives of this research concern the use of CSK data to evaluate the correct growth of agricultural crop. The preliminary analysis shows that X-band backscatter is able to follow the seasonal moisture conditions and to identify different types of crops.

TI  - Verbal and logical thinking of young patients with stroke (analysis of of the implementation of the Vygotsky-Sakharov technique)
T2  - VOPROSY PSIKHOLOGII
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of stroke which debuts at the age of between 18 and 45 years old becomes more acute. The number of strokes at the young age has significantly increased in recent years. For such patients, the primary task within rehabilitation is their returning to the previous social interaction and labor activity. This requires a sufficient level of the conceptual thinking. A concept is the main structural element of the verbal-logical thinking that implies the ability for understanding the essence of connections between objects, the person's worldview and disease insight. The main method of studying the development of the concept is the experiment for the formation of artificial concepts. The present work employs the Vygotsky-Sakharov technique which allows evaluating that process and finding pre-conceptual levels of thinking. The present paper includes the results of the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the technique performance by 50 patients with stroke at the young age and 150 healthy participants at the age from 18 till 45 years old (SD = 8,12 and SD = 8,65, respectively). The evaluation of the state of conceptual thinking is carried out according to such parameters as the time of the task performance, the quantity of steps made, the number of hypotheses, the number of repeated hypotheses (if there is any) and the pre-conceptual forms of thinking used. The obtained results demonstrate the state of the neurodynamics, regulation and operational components of conceptual thinking. It is shown that all of them are affected in stroke at the young age as well as that there are significant differences both between the control and experimental groups, and between patients with stroke who have solved and those who have not solved the task. Conclusions are drawn about the possibility of identifying criteria for the neuropsychological diagnosis of conceptual thinking disorders. The performed research is one of the stages of the standardization of the Vygotsky-Sakharov technique in order to use it in the neuropsychological diagnosis in the neurological clinic.

AB  - Sen2Cor is the atmospheric correction processor selected by ESA for operational, systematic processing of Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission data. It is used for generating the Level-2A products distributed to users by the Copernicus SciHub. Accurate atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 data and knowledge of its uncertainties are preconditions for high quality downstream applications.In this work we present the comparison of Sentinel-2 Bottom-of-Atmosphere products with measurements of surface reflectance on ground. Source of reference measurements are both surface reflectance data from RadCalNet and from dedicated field campaigns. The analysis shows, that the uncertainty of SR-retrieval with Sen2Cor is better than about 7% for bright surfaces and about 17% for darker. In addition to this performance evaluation, the data are also applied to compare the use of reference data coming from permanent operating bright RadCalNet sites and from ad-hoc field campaigns at darker sites.

TI  - Monitoring spatial-temporal dynamics of small lakes based on SAR Sentinel-1 observations: a case study over Nui Coc Lake (Vietnam)
T2  - VIETNAM JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time, this study estimates the variation of surface water extent of Nui Coc Lake located in Thai Nguyen province in North Vietnam at high spatial (20 m) and temporal resolution (bi-weekly). The classification methodology was developed based on the Otsu threshold algorithm applied to histogram of the backscatter coefficient of the SAR Sentinel-1 signal. Totally, more than 150 SAR Sentinel-1 images have been processed for the 2016-2020 period. Except for extreme drought and flood conditions, the average minimum and maximum of the lake's surface water extent are 17 km(2) (in May) and 24 km(2) (in September/October), respectively, and Nui Coc Lake's surface water was stable during the last five years. Classification results are in good agreement with the corresponding surface water extent maps derived from free-cloud Sentinel-2 images, with the occurrence map derived from the Landsat-derived Global Surface Water (GSW) product, and with in situ precipitation data. Compared to Sentinel-2, the lake's surface water extent detected from Sentinel-1 is 4-4.5% less. The water occurrence is similar between our results and that derived from the GSW product, but Sentinel-1 observations provide more details as its spatial resolution is higher than Landsat. This study clearly shows the great potential of SAR Sentinel-1 data for monitoring small lake's water surface at low costs, especially over tropical regions.

AB  - Wildfires in California are increasingly frequent and caused a vast range of damages to the land and society. Existing work in the field of machine learning aided fire susceptibility mapping contains promising results, however they focused on small fire prone areas or yielded less than impressive classification metrics, with even fewer groups focusing on California. In this paper, we applied five machine learning models for fire prediction using a series of remote sensing data and fire incident records of California. The fire incident records were used for labeling fire conditions, and remote sensing features (land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, and thermal anomalies) were selected for model training. Two datasets were created for analysis of wildfires in California based on different sized regions: the whole state treated as one region, and California being broken into counties. For the state level dataset, fire prediction accuracies were 89% for artificial neural network (ANN), and 87% for Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), knearest neighbors (KNN), and logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM). For the county level dataset, the prediction accuracies were 97% for KNN, 96% for ANN, SVM, and LR, and 94% for GuassianNB.

AB  - We proposed a combined machine learning approach with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to monitor forest utilization toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for data-scarce regions. First, we employed the Random Forest (RF) classifier using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for forest mapping. Then, we designed a deep CNN architecture that works for tree species/age mapping from coarse and polygonal ground-truth data. The proposed network has U-shape and comprises 3D Atrous Convolutions. The model was optimized by a weighted cross-entropy loss function. We trained the model with times-series Sentinel 1, 2, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data with sparse annotations. Our proposed models achieved 94.5% overall accuracy (OA) for forest mapping, 77.80% (OA) for tree species, and 81.74% (OA) for tree age classification, respectively in Ena city, Japan. The outcome of our study indicates the potential of remote sensing and machine learning in monitoring forest development, conservation, and utilization toward SDGs from coarse ground-truth data.

TI  - Assessment of land use change in the Thuma forest reserve region of Malawi, Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A study was conducted in Thuma area in central Malawi to quantify contemporary land cover and to explore the degree of land use change in the Thuma forest reserve area of Malawi by analysing and comparing satellite-derived land cover maps from 1997, 2007 and 2017. The study was carried out using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), focusing on analysis of Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 ORI/TIRS satellite images. The classification was conducted for the following distinct classes; closed forest, open forest, shrubland, savanna grassland, agriculture fields, and water. The analysis revealed that closed forest diminished from 19% in 1997 to 10% in 2007 to 6% in 2017. Open forest reduced from 30% to 21% from 1997 to 2007 but increased to 22% in 2017. Agriculture area almost doubled from 37% in 1997 to 64% in 2017. The actual area from 1997 to 2017, shows that closed forest has reduced from 7,000 ha to 3,000 ha while open forest from 12,900 ha to 7800 ha. Savanna grassland has doubled from 5,900 ha to 13,000 ha. However, future studies should use modern satellites such as Sentinel and Landsat 9 for improved quantification of changes. The findings show that even the protected forest reserve (previously dominated by closed forest) is not fully protected from deforestation by local communities. Government and other stakeholders should devise measures to meet the needs of the surrounding communities and the ecological/biophysical needs of the reserves. Based on this study, issues of re-demarcation of the forest reserve and the accessed area should also be explored. This study serves as a reference for the management of Thuma Forest Reserve as a refuge for natural tree species, rivers that harbour endemic fish species (Opsaridium microlepis and Opsaridium microcephalis) and the sustainable management of endangered elephants in the reserve.

TI  - Robust Correction of Relative Geometric Errors Among GaoFen-7 Regional Stereo Images Based on Posteriori Compensation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Correcting the relative geometric errors is an essential step in the generation of digital ortho maps and digital surface models from GaoFen-7 (GF-7) regional images, in which the block adjustment (BA) technology is always adopted. However, the traditional BA methods are typically ineffective and not universal due to their dependence on sufficient control data. Although recently developed BA methods using a large number of observation images can substantially eliminate the additional control data, they are not suitable for the BA with few images in the absence of sufficient control data, which is a situation that is often encountered in practical applications. In such situation, the inevitable elevation error caused by the initial positioning error of images will transfer and accumulate in the horizontal direction of the block, resulting in the inconsistent geometric accuracies among images. Aiming at this problem, this article proposed a practical method of combining a stable free BA and a posteriori compensation. Through the stepwise correction and integration of geometric errors, the elevation error and its cumulative effect in free BA could be eliminated at a small control cost, and a robust result with consistent accuracy could be achieved, even with only a few observation images. This method was validated through experiments performed on GF-7 stereo images, and the satisfactory results indicated that it effectively restrained error accumulation and improved the geo-positioning consistency of regional GF-7 images.

TI  - Robust Camera Distortion Calibration via Unified RPC Model for Optical Remote Sensing Satellites
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On-orbit geometric calibration (GC) is always performed to compensate for geometric distortion from the satellite's camera. However, the traditional GC method is complex and difficult to apply broadly due to its reliance on a rigorous physical model (RPM), which involves not only complex processing of attitude, orbit, and time but also the transformation among multiple coordinate systems. In addition, the RPM is closely related to the designs of satellites and cameras, which increases the complexity of the GC and thus reduces generalizability. This article proposes a practical and robust GC method to prevent camera distortion based on a standardized rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) model. Through a series of innovations, including stepwise optimization, a priori gross error elimination, the adjustment model with angular resolution, and the correction for the bias field-of-view (FOV) distortion, we were able to achieve robust GC for camera distortion, as well as accurate splicing and registration among segmented images. Method validation using data from the linear-array camera of the ZiYuan3 (ZY-3)-02 satellite, and the area-array camera of the GaoFen-4 (GF4) satellite, produced satisfactory results, indicating that our method effectively compensates for systematic geometric distortion such that consistent GC and accuracy comparable with that of traditional RPM-based methods can be obtained.

AB  - Wetlands, among the most valuable ecosystems, are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic impacts and climate change. Mapping wetland vegetation changes is crucial for conservation, management, and restoration of such sensitive environments. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are commonly applied for wetland mapping based on remote sensing data. However, scientific literature on this topic is often biased towards limited study areas, and lacking generalization testing over heterogeneous environmental conditions (e.g. latitude, ecoregion, wetland type). In this study, we compared eight ensemble and standalone ML methods, aiming at finding the best performing ones for aquatic vegetation mapping using Sentinel-2 over nine study areas and different seasons. The classifiers were tested to distinguish nine different classes - five aquatic vegetation classes and four background land cover classes - with seasonal monthly composites (April-November) of spectral indices as input. Results suggest that ensemble methods, such as RF, generally show higher predictive power with respect to most of common standalone classifiers (e.g. kNN or DT), which show the highest level of overall disagreement. SVM method overcame all the other classifiers, both standalone and ensemble, over our reference dataset, scoring an overall accuracy of 0.977 +/- 0.001; In particular, SVM was the best over transitional aquatic vegetation classes (helophytes and submerged-floating association), which are the ones most frequently misclassified by other methods. Further developments of this research will focus on assessing the influence on classification performance of predictor variables and variations in input features.

AB  - In this work a novel High Performance Computing Platform aimed at streamline the application of demanding Earth Observation algorithms is presented. The platform is today in the operational phase and it is opened to new users. The development of the High Performance Computing (HPC) services has been carried out during the execution of the DYDAS project, that was aimed at developing a collaborative platform for offering data, algorithms, processing and analysis services to a large number of users from different public and private user communities. The platform will also act as an e-marketplace enabling transactions for accessing data and added value services enabled by HPC and based on Big Data technologies, machine learning, AI and advanced data analytics. Such strategy has been implemented with the purpose to match demand and offer among those who own intellectual properties on data/methods for their use and those who need or want to exploit them. In this manuscript, an example of data processing using Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data in a supervised classification exercise is presented.

AB  - In this study we present a novel approach dedicated to the retrieval of volcanic ash parameters by means of data acquired from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer on board of the Copernicus Sentinel-3. In this framework, we developed a procedure combining Radiative Transfer Model simulations and Neural Network for estimating three volcanic ash parameters such as aerosol optical depth, effective radius and ash mass. The Radiative Transfer Model simulations have been considered for producing synthetic training sets, which have been used in the training phase of the Neural Networks development. In particular, nine latitude's belts have been identified for training several Neural Networks ensuring the global coverage of the method. The approach has been tested by comparing the results of the trained NN with the ones obtained by applied the state-of-art Look Up Table and the Volcanic Plume Retrieval procedures. The results of the methodologies applied on Raikoke, 2019 eruption demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach by registering values of the correlation coefficient between all the three methods ranging between the 65% and the 94%.

AB  - Satellite data are widely used to study the spatial component of epidemics: to monitor their evolution, to create epidemiological risk maps and predictive models. The improvement of data quality, not only in technical terms but also of scientific relevance and robustness, represents in this context one of the most important aspects for health information technology that can make further significant and useful progress in monitoring and managing epidemics. In this regard, this paper intends to address an issue that is not always adequately considered in the use of satellite data for the creation of maps and spatial models of epidemics, namely the preliminary verification of the level of spatial correlation between remote sensing environmental variables and epidemics. Specifically, we intend to evaluate the contribution of exposure to the pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on the spatial spread of the virus and the severity of the current COVID infection.

TI  - On the Relationship Between Stickiness in DMRT Theory and Physical Parameters of Snowpack: Theoretical Formulation and Experimental Validation With SNOWPACK Snow Model and X-Band SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at relating the stickiness parameter (tau) of the dense media radiative transfer theory in quasicrystalline approximation of Mie scattering of densely packed sticky spheres (DNIRT-QMS), to the physical parameters of the layered snowpack. A relationship has been derived to express tau, which modulates the attractive contact force between ice spheres, as a function of ice volume fraction (phi) and coordination number (n(c)). Since tau is not a measurable parameter, this is a step forward with respect to what is commonly made in the literature, where tau is assumed as an arbitrary parameter, generally ranging between 0.1 and 0.3, to fit simulated backscattering data with those measured. As a first validation, DMRT-QMS was integrated with the SNOWPACK model to simulate backscattering at X-band (9.6 GHz) driven by nivo-meteorological data acquired on a test area located in Monti Alti di Ornella, Italy. The simulations were compared with Synthetic Aperture Radar COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) satellite observations. The results show a significant agreement (R-2 = 0.68), although for a limited dataset of eight points in a unique winter season.

TI  - SLIC-Based Cloud Removal Approach with Inpainting for Landsat 8 SAR Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds that exist in optical remote sensing images can degrade their applicability for earth observation. Ground-cover information is degraded by thin clouds or even completely occluded by thick clouds, which limits further analysis and applications. Thus, a SLIC-based cloud removal approach is formulated for clustering the similar superpixels and forming column stack. Group sparsity constrained robust principal component analysis is used to detect cloud and generate a column stack mask. Discriminative robust principal component analysis is conducted to remove clouds. Finally, inpainting is performed by finding the similar patches to obtain the gaps filled. The experimental results of reconstructed Landsat 8 real images are compared with the Landsat 7 real images using PSNR and RMSE. The values for PSNR are varying from 25 in Landsat 7 real images to 90 in Landsat 8 reconstructed real images in green channel, and RMSE has changed from 175 in Landsat 7 real images to 3 in red channel. This indicates that Landsat 8 reconstructed real images have greater quality and the error rate is lower.

TI  - Self-reported questionnaire on periodontal condition validated for use in Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN ORAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a current expectation of instruments for periodontal condition surveillance worldwide. The present study aimed to validate the Oral Health Questions Set B (OHQB) for the Brazilian Portuguese and evaluate its temporal stability. This is a sequential mixed-method investigation. After the forward-backward translation process to the Brazilian Portuguese, the OHQB Brazil (OHQB-Br) was applied to 156 participants (39.5 +/- 14.14 years; 51.9% males). In sequence, through a full-mouth six- sites/teeth examination and in accordance with the original instrument, the periodontal diagnosis was obtained (March 2020). In January 2021, the OHB-BR was reapplied (n = 71). Ordinal alpha and McDonald's omega tested the internal consistency of the OHQB-Br. Temporal stability was investigated [Spearman correlation, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and the Bland-Altman]. The concurrent validity was also verified, considering the periodontal clinical diagnosis (Kruskal Wallis). The ordinal alpha (0.69) and McDonald's omega (0.73) coefficients showed an adequate internal consistency of the OHQB-Br. The OHQB-Br temporal stability was high, as demonstrated by the Spearman coefficient (0.80) and ICC (0.79) and by the Bland-Altman plot. A concurrent validity showed a direct relationship between the OHQB-Br and the clinical condition of no periodontitis, mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis (p < 0.05). Because the OHQB-Br shows internal validity, temporal stability, and adequately identifies periodontal health and moderate/severe periodontitis, the instrument might represent an important tool, at the public level or other settings, for periodontal surveillance in Brazil.

TI  - Preliminary Evaluation of the Mirror-based Empirical Line Method using FLARE System
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Empirical Line Method (ELM) is a widely applied technique of achieving absolute atmospheric correction assuming a linear relationship between the raw Digital Numbers (DNs) or at-sensor radiance and surface reflectance measurements collected in-situ. The ELM measures reference targets of known reflectance in an image. Labsphere has created an automated vicarious calibration system using the SPecular Array Radiometric Calibration (SPARC) mirror technology in the new Field Line-of-sight Automated Radiance Exposure (FLARE) network. In the FLARE system the known reflectance targets are convex mirrors - because of that it is titled Mirror based Empirical Line Method (MELM). In this context, the objective of this work is to present the initial results of the MELM using one the FLARE network system. The FLARE system evaluated in this work is the Alpha Node located at Arlington, SD. Initially, the data collected in 2020 and 2021 with the Alpha FLARE concomitant with the OLI sensor overpass on-board the Landsat-8 satellite were used in the assessment. In summary, the surface reflectance image product available to download for OLI sensor were compared directly with the surface reflectance image resulting from the MELM method. The preliminary results showed the mean absolute error data between the surface reflectance from the OLI Level-2 product image and the surface reflectance from the MELM was lower than 0.01 for the Blue, Green, Red and SWIR-1 bands; lower than 0.03 for the for the NIR and SWIR-2 spectral bands; and around 0.05 for Coastal Aerosol band (all in reflectance units). These results suggest the MELM technique using FLARE has great potential for reflectance surface evaluation of orbital sensors.

TI  - AmazonCRIME: a Geospatial Artificial Intelligence dataset and benchmark for the classification of potential areas linked to Transnational Environmental Crimes in the Amazon Rainforest
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article the challenge of detecting areas linked to transnational environmental crimes in the Amazon rainforest is addressed using Geospatial Intelligence data, open access Sentinel-2 imagery provided by the Copernicus programme, as well as the cloud processing capabilities of the Google Earth Engine platform. For this, a dataset consisting of 6 classes with a total of 30,000 labelled and geo-referenced 13-band multispectral images was generated, which is used to feed advanced Geospatial Artificial Intelligence models (deep convolutional neural networks) specialised in image classification tasks. With the dataset presented in this paper it is possible to obtain a classification overall accuracy of 96.56%. It is also demonstrated how the results obtained can be used in real applications to support decision making aimed at preventing Transnational Environmental Crimes in the Amazon rainforest. The AmazonCRIME Dataset is made publicly available in the repository: https://github.com/jp-geoAl/ AmazonCRIME.git.

AB  - The article deals with some features of the conceptual construction and context of post-representational cartography associated with critical Science and Technology Studies (STS). The place of STS in the public representation of science is preliminarily discussed. Despite the rapid development and relevance of the problematizations, approaches, and results of this field, they have had little impact on the public representation of science and the natural-science picture of the world. Moreover, they provoke resistance, which has clearly manifested itself in the "science wars" between scientists and researchers of science and continues to manifest itself in similar conflicts and debates. A clear embodiment of this displacement of the STS is the almost total absence of its narratives in museums and centers of science and technology. Meanwhile, the problematizations offered by this research field lead to a significant change not only in the content of popular representations of the structure of the modern world, but also in the conceptual form of such representations, such as the "world picture" or the "map." In the heterogeneous space discovered by scholars of science and technology, they turn out to be nothing more than the effects of sociotechnical practices, just like their preconditions, namely the oppositions of nature and culture, matter and meaning, representation and the represented, etc.The idea of a generalized critical approach, originating in the actor-network theory and allowing tracing the trajectories of ontological construction of these oppositions as well as of scientific facts and techniques, is briefly outlined. Its similarities with the deconstruction of Jacques Derrida and modern posthumanist projects of new materialism are shown. We then trace this idea to post-representational cartography projects, which shift the focus from the problematic of the map as representation to the study of the practices of map-making and map-use. The researchers of this tradition show the secondary nature of the representational function of the map in relation to its navigational function, thematizing the ways in which the map exists and becomes a part of heterogeneous networks of sociotechnical practices. In conclusion, it is suggested that the practice and idea of navigation can point the way to the formation of navigational attitudes instead of pictures of the world.

AB  - This study focuses on air pollution resulting from marine vessels following routes within the Central Mediterranean region. The concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2), are considered. The analysis is carried out on remotely-sensed data obtained through the high-resolution and state-of-the art TROPOMI sensor on board the SENTINEL-5P satellite that forms part of the COPERNICUS constellation. The pollution data is correlated with the density of passenger ships, fishing boats, as well as cargo and tanker vessels obtained from the official EMODnet Human Activities portal and which was recorded over the same time period and spatial extent. A total of 31 months between 2019 and 2021 are considered. As evident from the presented information, NO2 concentrations clearly follow the vessel route patterns. On the other hand, there is less confidence in the dependence of SO2 and CO levels.

AB  - The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite Sentinel-1 provides excellent traffic infrastructure monitoring capabilities due to its short revisit time, wide-scale coverage and free of charge data policy. However, pixels from Sentinel-1 have a medium spatial resolution so that traffic infrastructure is only covered by a few pixels. Moreover, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) yields deformation time series for coherent pixels only, thus limiting the number of pixels reporting the ground motion at traffic infrastructure. Although various InSAR time series methods have been successfully applied for traffic infrastructure monitoring, the selection of appropriate methods achieving a high pixel density has not yet been evaluated. In this study, we test whether we can improve the monitoring capabilities by combining different InSAR time series methods. On the one hand, we applied widely used Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) as a baseline method to retrieve the deformation time series. On the other hand, we enhanced the phase quality in a pre-processing step using the Phase-Linking (PL) approach and afterwards estimated the deformation time series also with StaMPS based on pixels selected by PL. We compared and evaluated the achieved pixel densities from both methods at main roads, highways and railways in a study area in Germany. We found that the InSAR time series methods selected complementary sets of pixels at all traffic infrastructure types. Moreover, the results indicate a great potential for railway monitoring using Sentinel-1 InSAR due to both high pixel density and homogeneous spatial distribution of pixels. Interestingly, coherent scatterers selected by StaMPS were observed to coincide with large traffic signs at highways which show a double-bounce scattering in the amplitude images. This study shows the benefits of combining PL and StaMPS for increased pixel density at traffic infrastructure and confirms Sentinel-1 data as a suitable data source for traffic infrastructure monitoring.

AB  - Neural networks were explored to achieve a binary classification for determining land corresponding to peat for a study area in the boreal forest of northern Ontario, Canada. Environmental covariates were employed as predictors and obtained from multiple sources, which included multispectral imagery, LiDAR, SAR, and aeromagnetic data. A dense neural network (DNN), as well as a convolutional neural network (CNN), were each implemented. Logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) approaches were also modelled. Neighboring pixels surrounding the soil sampling sites were incorporated as input into the CNN, that permitted training on additional information that was not exploited by other methods. Preliminary results indicate that a CNN can attain improved accuracies for peat classification, when compared against other approaches.

AB  - The upper ocean responses in the wakes of moving tropical cyclones are still an active area of analytical, numerical and experimental research efforts. Satellite data are essential to serve studying these phenomena. Together with a simplified model to model the upper ocean thermohaline response, satellite data are analyzed to more specifically assess self-similarity properties of surface temperature and salinity anomalies. Semi-empirical parametrisation for temperature and salinity anomalies under moving tropical cyclones are then suggested.

TI  - Cyto and xeno toxicity in turtle Trachemys sp erythrocytes subjected to different concentrations of metil-mercury.
T2  - Revista Veterinaria - Corrientes
M3  - Article
AB  - Methyl mercury (MeHg) is a xenobiotic that bioaccumulates and bio- magnifies in the food chain. The Trachemys scripta elegans (Tse) turtle is considered a sentinel of environmental pollution because of its longevity. Tse has nucleated erythrocytes (RBCs) with 90% affinity for MeHg. This study determined cyto-toxicity and geno-toxicity in vitro of MeHg on Tse RBCs at concentrations of 0, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 10, 20, 50 and 100 mg.L<sup>-1</sup> at 24 and 96 h of exposure. The RBCs were isolated by centrifugation and 1.69 x10<sup>6</sup> RBCs per treatment were used. The percentage of viability, mean lethal concentration (LC50) and cytological changes were determined at 24 and 96 h. It was evaluated the xeno toxicity by RAPDs markers with extracted DNA at 96 h, calculating the percentage of polymorphism, index of genetic stability (GST) and coefficient of Jaccard dissimilarity (dJSC). At 96 h, viability was maintained between 99-0% in 0.5-100 mg.L<sup>-1</sup> of MeHg. The LC50 was 22.55 mg.L<sup>-1</sup> MeHg. Cytological abnormalities were presented in 0.7-100 mg.L<sup>-1</sup> MeHg as crescent shape, cytoplasmic inclusions, membrane fading, eccentric nuclei and cell lysis. The polymorphism was 85-50% and the dJSC was 0.5-0.63 in 50-100 mg.L<sup>-1</sup> MeHg compared to the control group. GST decreased to 42% at 100 mg.L<sup>-1 </sup>MeHg. It is concluded that MeHg is cytotoxic and genotoxic at concentrations greater than 10 mg.L<sup>-1</sup> in Tse RBCs. This study represents a baseline for Hg toxicological studies in reptile RBCs.

TI  - Monitoring Climate Impacts on Annual Forage Production across US Semi-Arid Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem performance approach, used in a previously published case study focusing on the Nebraska Sandhills, proved to minimize impacts of non-climatic factors (e.g., overgrazing, fire, pests) on the remotely-sensed signal of seasonal vegetation greenness resulting in a better attribution of its changes to climate variability. The current study validates the applicability of this approach for assessment of seasonal and interannual climate impacts on forage production in the western United States semi-arid grasslands. Using a piecewise regression tree model, we developed the Expected Ecosystem Performance (EEP), a proxy for annual forage production that reflects climatic influences while minimizing impacts of management and disturbances. The EEP model establishes relations between seasonal climate, site-specific growth potential, and long-term growth variability to capture changes in the growing season greenness measured via a time-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) observed using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The resulting 19 years of EEP were converted to expected biomass (EB, kg ha(-1) year(-1)) using a newly-developed relation with the Soil Survey Geographic Database range production data (R-2 = 0.7). Results were compared to ground-observed biomass datasets collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and University of Nebraska-Lincoln (R-2 = 0.67). This study illustrated that this approach is transferable to other semi-arid and arid grasslands and can be used for creating timely, post-season forage production assessments. When combined with seasonal climate predictions, it can provide within-season estimates of annual forage production that can serve as a basis for more informed adaptive decision making by livestock producers and land managers.

TI  - COMPARING METHODS TO ESTIMATE CLOUD COVER OVER THE BAIKAL NATURAL TERRITORY IN DECEMBER 2020
T2  - SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper addresses the issue of how much cloud cover data obtained using satellite and model-interpolation techniques are suitable for monitor-ing the transparency of the atmosphere and determining conditions for airglow observations at a local geophysi-cal observatory. For this purpose, we compared the temporal dynamics of cloud cover from ECMWF's ERA5 reanalysis and NOAA satellites with the night atmosphere transparency according to a digital camera. We considered the dynamics of the addressed parame-ters at the Geophysical Observatory of the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, located in the Baikal Natural Territory near Tory village (Republic of Buryatia, Rus-sia), during December 2020. The comparative analysis showed a generally good agreement between cloud cov-er data from ECMWF's ERA5 climate reanalysis and those observed with the camera. Disadvantages are the lack of information on rapid variations in cloud cover in the reanalysis and positive and negative delays in the dynamics of cloud fields that last about two hours. Due to irregular satellite data, large time gaps between pass-es, and difficulties in estimating cloud cover at night, we could not come to reliable conclusions concerning the applicability of satellite data.

TI  - The Ural Poetic School: Phantom or Reality
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article problematises the use of the "modern Ural poetry" descriptive construction denoting the poetic space of a particular region and considers Ural poetry in a broader context of Russian-language literature. They can be understood differently depending on the researcher's approach and the research methodology. Thus, it may be regarded as a segment within regional literature, regional poetry, or as a cultural space that exists over territories and borders. What matters is the globalised concept which resolves the opposition between the centre and the province, which is imperative for Russian culture. The analysis of Ural poetry in such a conceptual framework actualises several issues. More particularly, to what extent can regional specificity be decisive for the poetry of the Urals? And what makes up this specificity: poetics, Ural identity, a set of Ural myths, or the structure of a poetic community? How are the boundaries of Ural poetry manifested? What is the degree of its correlation with what is done outside the region? The Ural Poetry School, a project of poet and literary manager V. O. Kalpidi, gives the most important answers to these questions. The article considers the conceptual basis of the project and those significant theoretical and practical changes that have taken place over more than two decades of its existence, especially after the emergence of poetic projects under the InVersiya brand in the late 2010s which presented an alternative view of the development of Ural poetry. This generational and worldview gap fostered the distinction between modern Ural poetry and the Russian-language poetry of the Urals. A closed poetic space with tangible boundaries, its structure and logic of development, which claimed to be the Centre as originally thought by the UPS, has turned into a space that is an organic part of something larger and decentralised. The article emphasises that the view of the poetry of the Urals as a segment of modern Russian-language poetry makes it possible to revise the existing set of myths and ideas and provides more accurate tools for describing it.

TI  - Strategies of Desacralization of Writers by Means of Merch
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the research is to outline the strategies of desacralization of writers by means of merch, to determine the positive and negative aspects of the search for new meanings in the reproduction of cult figures. Theoretical basis. The article examines merch as a tool that encourages people to change sacred meanings and ideas about writers as bearers of the sacred for Ukrainians. The source base of the study is the works devoted to the problems of the sacred in philosophical thought, as well as the process of desacralization in art and literature. The peculiarities of the destruction of tendencies regarding the notions in the perception of writers as idols of the nation, the formation and emergence of new meanings regarding sacred figures are highlighted and described. The relevance of this study is due to active searches in business, propaganda, agitation for the use of literary practice, transformation and new contexts of literary idols. Originality. Until now, the change in the processes of sacralization and desacralization of writers by means of merch has not been considered as a reversal of worldview in culture, vectors of changes in the dominants of spirituality in the world picture. It turned out that the metacategory of the sacred has been studied by many scholars, both foreign and domestic, in recent years. The problems of the sacred are in the centre of attention of sociologists, philosophers, literary critics, and culturologists, but merch as a basis for the desacralization of man was not considered in publications in the field of mass communication theory. Scientists considered the worldview vectors of the sacred and desacralization as processes that are inherent not only in postmodernity, but also those that accompanied Ukrainian culture during previous periods. It is determined that the most noticeable manifestations of desacralization are the reproduction of the figure of Kobzar, moreover, in quite unusual and even provocative images of him. However, the majority of Ukrainians positively perceive the updated images of the prophets of the Ukrainian nation and talk about the permanence of their worldview, despite the change and reinterpretation of many years of later development. Conclusions. Conscious desacralization of literary images is gradually gaining momentum. We observe a tendency to positive perception of merch with the figures of T. Shevchenko, I. Franko, H. Skovoroda, Lesia Ukrainka in a new interpretation: during the war, on the barricades - wherever the struggle for Ukrainian statehood is taking place. From the results of the survey it becomes clear that stereotypical perceptions of writers need to be changed, but only if it is an organic fusion with value imperatives, only emphasizes and affirms the spiritual greatness of Man and serves the growth of Ukrainian society and every Ukrainian.

TI  - Christian Reminiscences in Live Speech (in Old Believers' Subdialects of Prikamye)
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The article brings about the issue of book reminiscences in the live speech of the bearers of the Old Believers' tradition of Prikamye. Reflecting religious consciousness, they have dogmas about the meaning of life and laws of morality; reveal the essence of ethical guidance. Attention is paid to the functions of reminiscences, the ways of their use: introduction of the name of a Christian character or the name of a sacred object into the statement, inclusion of the names of precedential artifacts in live speech, the use of phraseological units from the texts of traditional literature and allusions. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that the Old Believers actively used references to the biblical, hagiographic and apocryphal texts. Book inclusions are endowed with worldview and didactic meanings; they express an analogy between the facts of Christian history and the phenomena of real life. It is proved that the use of elements of religious texts revives the meanings of these texts in the mind of a native speaker, endows oral speech with the properties of intertextuality. The use of religious reminiscences is characterized by their broad variation, due to the conditions of oral dialect communication, and reflects the decline of religious literacy. The relevance of the study is conditioned by the fact that the images of book and written culture involved in everyday speech remain a little-studied means of expressing the complex world of feelings and emotional experiences of a believer.

AB  - We develop a method of investigation to analyze the variability of the moment tensor solutions in case of light-to-moderate earthquakes. To this purpose, we compare the seismic-induced displacement field predicted from the available moment tensor solutions and estimated from Sentinel-1 InSAR data. The differences between simulated and real deformation scenarios are then evaluated both in terms of epicenter location and kinematics of the fault responsible for the event. Our test dataset consists of two events with a magnitude ranging from light to moderate occurred on 2019 in France and Turkey, respectively.

AB  - In this paper we want to investigate the ideological sources of Basque nationalism. Some of these sources are more remote than others, but all of them will come together in the 19th century writers and apologists, many of whom will develop pre-nationalist or proto-nationalist ideas. Therefore, we will not analyze the work of Sabino Arana himself. We will go further back, because we are interested in tracing where some of the ideological elements come from that later would become part of the worldview built by Basque nationalism. To investigate the origin of certain myths that would enter with force in the discursive apparatus of said political movement.

TI  - EPSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR SPECIALIZED MEDICAL CARE LATE
T2  - REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES-UNIVERSIDAD DEL QUINDIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Long intervals between detecting breast cancer and the beginning of treatment can influence the prognosis of the course of the disease and survival. This research aims to reveal the psychological characteristics of women with breast cancer who applied for specialized medical care late after detecting a mass lesion in the breast. The methods used in the study were a questionnaire, a test method, and methods of mathematical data processing. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method was used as a method of mathematical statistics. The study involved 149 women aged 32 to 80 years (mean age 55 years) with breast cancer of different stages under the care of an oncologist from the time of diagnosis up to 6 months, living in Chelyabinsk city and Chelyabinsk region, Russia, who took part in the study in 2019-2021. Based on empirical research, it was found that women who delayed contacting their doctor to diagnose and initiate treatment of breast cancer had a more positive worldview, a more diverse repertoire of coping strategies, expressed motivational and cognitive components of personal helplessness, and an internal locus of control, compared to women who addressed their physician at the first signs of breast cancer.

AB  - The article analyzes the Ukrainian mentality in the retrospect and current perspective, investigating it within deep structures of social and individual life practice. Based on the comparison with Western European spiritual path of development, it is shown that individualism as a trait of Ukrainian "soul" is different from western implementation of this concept. The uniqueness of Ukrainian mentality is deep spirituality, conscious feeling of surrounding nature beauty, which is expressed both in artistic practices and in the worldview and attitude to other people. At the same time, social upheavals of 20th century had a significant impact on the transformation of Ukrainian mentality, which is manifested also in the regional context.

M3  - Article
AB  - The theme of fish is present in literature, mythology, religion and also in phraseology. The sea has always been a meeting place for different peoples who spoke different languages. That is why the language of seagoing people has always been international. For this reason, expressions with a fish motif would seem to be an interesting research set. The first part of this article presents the history of Polish and Dutch maritime connections. The next part of the article presents collected ichthyological metaphors in both Polish and Dutch. The author then compares Dutch and Polish metaphors with fish/ water creatures to see to what extent the ichthyological metaphor is rooted in these languages, and what similarities and differences can be discovered. Furthermore, the concept of a linguistic worldview based on metaphors with fish species common to both languages is analysed.

TI  - POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEE IN RUSSIA: THE IDEALS OF CANDIDATES AND THE CONSENSUS OF EMPLOYEES
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article reveals the role of political culture in the activities of municipal employees in Russia. The work is based on an empirical study; its participants were candidates for positions in the municipal service, and then the same respondents, but already in the status of municipal employees with at least one year of experience. The main aim of the study was to identify various aspects of understanding political culture, its relationship with the value orientations of individuals, as well as to determine the importance of political culture for decision-making and in general attitude to business. Changes in the ideals of political culture that emerged among the candidates, and then were subjected to consensus when obtaining certain experience of municipal service, were also traced. The idealization of political culture, as the article shows, is associated with the worldview and value orientations of individuals focused on working in municipal bodies. Over time, having sufficient experience of municipal service, the study participants resort to a consensus regarding the role of political culture in their professional activities. As a result of this consensus, some characteristics and ideals of political culture do not change, but at the same time there are illustrative examples of critical views on political culture. The identification of the ideals of political culture makes it possible to assess individuals' attitude to this phenomenon, and these ideals become important for the development of certain views, ideas and opinions. Thus, in the article, political culture is conceptualized as a factor of effective municipal service and as consolidation of officials' value orientations correlated with political culture.

TI  - Impact of Incidence Angle Diversity on SMOS and Sentinel-1 Soil Moisture Retrievals at Coarse and Fine Scales
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Incidence angle diversity of space-borne radiometer and radar systems operating at low microwave frequencies needs to be taken into consideration to accurately estimate soil moisture (SM) across spatial scales. In this study, the single channel algorithm (SCA) is first applied to Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) brightness temperatures at vertical polarization (TBV) to estimate SM at coarse resolution (25 km) and develop a land cover-specific and incidence angle (32.5 degrees, 42.5 degrees, and 52.5 degrees)adaptive calibration of single scattering albedo (omega) and soil roughness (h(s)) parameters. These effective parameters are used together with fine-scale multiangular Sentinel-1 backscatter in a single-pass active-passive downscaling approach to estimate TBV at fine scale (1 km) for each SMOS incidence angle. These TB(V)s are finally inverted to obtain the corresponding high-resolution SM maps. Results over the Iberian Peninsula for year 2018 show an increasing trend of omega and a decreasing trend of h(s) with SMOS incidence angle, with almost no variability of omega across land cover types. The active-passive covariation parameter is shown to increase with SMOS incidence angle and decrease with Sentinel-1 incidence angle. Coarse and fine TBV maps from the three SMOS incidence angles show similar distributions (mean differences below 0.38 K). Resulting high-resolution SM maps have maximum differences in mean and standard deviation of 0.016 and 0.015 m(3)/m(3), respectively, and compare well with in situ measurements. Our results indicate that model-based microwave approaches to estimate SM can be adequately adapted to account for the incidence angle diversity of planned missions, such as Copernicus Microwave Imaging Radiometer (CIMR), Radar Observing System for Europe in L-band (ROSE-L), and Sentinel-1 next generation.

AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission ensures continuity of C-band SAR observations for Europe. The mission is characterized by large-scale and repetitive observations, systematic production and a free and open data policy. Sentinel-1 data are routinely used by Copernicus and many operational services, as well as in the scientific and commercial domain. Sentinel-1 is based on a constellation of two SAR satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B that have been launched from Kourou on a Soyuz rocket on 3rd April 2014 and 25th April 2016 respectively.At the time of finalising this paper (31 May 2022), the operations of Sentinel-1B have been interrupted due to an anomaly on the satellite power sub-system, that occurred on 23 December 2021. This is a major anomaly that will probably result in a permanent loss of the satellite. Detailed investigations are close to completion, and unfortunately, all attempts to bring back the faulty power unit to nominal operations have failed.The paper provides some details on the Sentinel-1B power anomaly and on the mitigation actions performed at mission level to compensate, to some extent, the lack of Sentinel-1B data.

T2  - CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the recommended procedure for axillary staging in clinically node-negative early breast cancer at diagnosis. The present study aimed to identify Cytokeratin-19 (CK19) gene profiles that accurately predicted the outcome of breast cancer patients. Fifty tumor samples from breast cancer patients were analyzed for the expression of the CK19 gene using quantitative PCR. Also, normal breast tissues (N = 50) were taken from the same patients that had undergone partial or total mastectomy. This gene signature was confirmed based on tumor's stage, grade, and estrogen receptor (ER) status, using conditional logistic regression. Based on these findings, the negative reported lymph nodes for metastasis had micrometastasis in significant values. There was a significant difference between normal and cancer samples in CK19 expression. In this sentinel node evaluation, the relationship of this gene with tumor characteristics needs to be established and discussed finding a clear role for this gene in tumor outcome.

AB  - Signal analysis approaches are a powerful and widely used tool in processing multi-spectral satellite images for detection of alteration zones. The main goal of this work is application of the spectrum-area fractal methodology based on the Landsat 8 OLI satellite images' data for separation alteration zones for iron oxides at the Tarom region (NW Iran). These alteration zones, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NWDI) are detected using the band-ratio and band combination methods. Then the calculated values are categorized by Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), k-means, and S-A fractal model. Considering a positive correlation of iron oxides alterations along with magnetite mineralization as an index of mineralization at the studied region, the promising areas are classified by a decision-making model using the TOPSIS method with an acceptable accuracy for presenting in the exploration models.

T2  - GEOGRAFIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to increase the green space factor to mitigate flash flood effects on urban storm water runoff in the Ankara Mamak region and to minimize the damages by flash floods. The land use/cover map was first obtained by using the images of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope satellites with the LIBSVM algorithm on the Google Earth Engine. The GSF value was then calculated and it was low (0.26) compared to world standards. This study was proposed as a solution for the flood disaster, using the extensive green roof scenario. After green roof conversion scenarios, the GSF value was recalculated. It was found to be above the minimum of green infrastructure that human settlements should achieve, regardless of density or land use (0.43). Offering high resolution images and the possibility of processing them via different algorithms of machine learning has revolutionized the environmental and urban-related studies as they help urban managers and planners to make decisions accurately and quickly.

AB  - In this study we compared Land Surface temperature (LST) computed from the high spatial resolution Landsat 8 and the high temporal resolution MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites to in situ near-surface air temperature (T-air) provided by IMD from 2013 to 2020. This study was carried out on Bhuntar station located in data sparse Kullu valley of Higher Himalayas. After spatiotemporal analysis with the IMD station, a total of 117 clear sky Landsat 8 scenes and 1771 clear sky MODIS scenes were analyzed using Google Earth Engine (GEE). LST was computed on these scenes on GEE using the Statistical Mono-Window (SMW) technique. The satellite derived LST values were extracted at the Bhuntar station and compared with IMD in-situ data. The result revealed strong correlation (R-2 around 0.84) between Landsat-8 LSTs and T-air. The averaged Night time LSTs obtained from MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites performed better than averaged Day time LSTs as the RMSE is lower during night time as compared to day time. The correlation between Landsat 8 derived LST is more in case of maximum T-air than mean T-air. Based on these correlation, we proposed empirical equations for calculating air temperature from remotely observed LSTs. We expect that our findings will be valuable in bridging data gaps in in situ monitoring with daily resolution.

AB  - Permafrost covers much of the Parvati valley, but mapping its distribution is difficult due to the scarcity of ground observed data sets and the region's high spatial heterogeneity. We show permafrost distribution maps for the Parvati valley from 2013 to 2021 based on the Mean Annual Air Temperature. We created maps of Mean Annual Air Temperatures (MAAT) using Landsat 8 Land Surface Temperature (LST) products in Google Earth Engine. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform that was utilised to quickly and efficiently obtain the spatial and temporal variations of permafrost distribution. Permafrost is defined as ground that maintains a temperature below zero degrees Celsius for at least two consecutive years. To justify the definition, we examined Mean Biennial Air Temperature (MBAT), Mean Triennial Air Temperature (MTAT), Mean Quadrennial Air Temperature (MQAT), Mean Quinquennial Air Temperature (MQnAT), Mean Septennial Air Temperature (MSpAT), Mean Octennial Air Temperature (MOAT), and Mean Novennial Air Temperature (MNOAT) (MNAT). Our findings demonstrate that the percentage of Permafrost distribution in the Parvati valley is about the same in all situations, accounting for 22 percent of the overall study area excluding glaciers. Our maps were divided into four categories: Continuous Permafrost Zone, Discontinuous Permafrost Zone, Sporadic Permafrost Zone, and No Permafrost Zone.

T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The study is aimed to analyze the evolution of the coastline of Padang Pariaman Regency, as well as some oceanographic and anthropogenic factors.Methods and Results. In this paper, the results of survey studies are quantified. The coastline evolution is observed using remote sensing techniques on Landsat image data collection and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. The coastline evolution is estimated using the overlay method. The evolution of the coastline of Padang Pariaman Regency is due to abrasion along the coast, especially in Katapiang village covering an area of 49.76 ha, where an increase of 27.63 ha from the previous period can be observed. The largest accretion occurred in the village of Malai V Suku with an additional 12.30 ha of land and the Pilubang village with an additional 4.84 ha of land. Such hydrooceanographic factors as wave speed, high current velocity, and tides affect coastal abrasion in the Padang Pariaman District.Conclusions. The evolution of the coastline is influenced by oceanographic and anthropogenic factors. An oceanographic factor in the form of the highest tide can be observed in Ulakan and Tapakis villages. Anthropogenic factors and the largest land changes can be found in the village of Malai V Suku, amounting to 29.21 ha, and in Katapiang village with an increase of 27.63 ha from the previous period.

AB  - (1) The existing frameworks for water quality modeling overlook the connection between multiple dynamic factors affecting spatiotemporal sediment yields (SY). This study aimed to implement satellite remotely sensed data and hydrological modeling to dynamically assess the multiple factors within basin-scale hydrologic models for a realistic spatiotemporal prediction of SY in watersheds. (2) A connective algorithm was developed to incorporate dynamic models of the crop and cover management factor (C-factor) and the soil erodibility factor (K-factor) into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with the aid of the Python programming language and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The algorithm predicted the annual SY in each hydrologic response unit (HRU) of similar land cover, soil, and slope characteristics in watersheds between 2002 and 2013. (3) The modeled SY closely matched the observed SY using the connective algorithm with the inclusion of the two dynamic factors of K and C (predicted R-2 (PR2): 0.60-0.70, R-2: 0.70-0.80, Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NS): 0.65-0.75). The findings of the study highlight the necessity of excellent spatial and temporal data in real-time hydrological modeling of catchments.

AB  - In this paper, we compare trends in air quality measured by official stations on the ground with remote-sensing-based measurements in Munich, Germany. With Earth Observation data from Sentinel-5P and Sentinel-2, this study investigates the discrepancies that may arise in trends and pollutant levels of NO2. We find that the defined fixed measuring stations in Munich cover the worst pollution levels in the city. However, we do also find inconsistencies in the information provided by ground measurements regarding pollutant concentrations in contrast to high spatial coverage remote sensing data.

TI  - Spit Evolution and Shoreline Changes Along Manamelkudi Coast Using Geo-Spatial Techniques and Statistical Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The historical shoreline changes from 1980 to 2020 along the Manamelkudi coast is studied using toposheet, satellite time-series Landsat data, and observed data. An attempt is made to recognise possible factors which are responsible for shoreline changes and spit growth at south Manamelkudi coast (Palk Strait), Eastern part of Pudukkottai district, Tamilnadu. During 1980-2020, the regions showed distinct spatio-temporal variability, which is discussed in relation to spit evolution and shoreline changes. The study also generated a long-term (1980-2020) shoreline change statistics (EPR, LRR, SCE and NSM, WLR) using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) at every 150 m interval for the Manamelkudi coast covering 42 km, identified the erosion and accretion and divide the shoreline into different classes of erosion and accretion. Identified lengths of shoreline with high erosion, low erosion, stable, low accretion and high accretion are, respectively, based on LRR. The results indicate that spit evolution is predominant along the Manamelkudi coast, with the highest percentage of erosion and accretion.

TI  - Tolerance as a Communicative and Socio-Cultural Strategy of Social Agreements
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of tolerance is analyzed against the background of the acute challenges of today and transformation of humanities from antiquity to postmodernism. Tolerance-related definitions arose in philosophy are examined retrospectively: patience, tolerance, respect, trust, harmony in diversity. The methodological significance of the integrative interdisciplinary prism in consideration of the phenomenon of tolerance is shown. Three leading sociocultural and communicative strategies of tolerance in social agreements have been identified: tolerant internal dialogue (agreement with oneself), tolerant communication with the world (worldview tolerance), tolerant interpersonal communication (important social agreements). The limits of tolerance are outlined, beyond which it becomes quasi-tolerance, because behind the simulacrum of tolerance hides indifference, conformism of communicators, or sprouts of intolerance, aggression, mobbing. With the help of sociological and synergetic theories the idea of balance of tolerance in psychological, mental and spiritual, physical aspects of human existence is defended. Autotolerance is due to human self-knowledge, sound self-esteem, developed mental and emotional quotient (EQ), and under such conditions it strategically determines a tolerant dialogue with the world, a constructive worldview. In turn, it needs critical thinking and an ecological attitude to information, especially in the context of media manipulation and phubbing. The simulacrum of modern pop literature on positive thinking is outlined, in contrast to which the life-creating potential of practical philosophy is revealed, which contributes to creation of sociocultural and communicative communities.

TI  - Regression Models for Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Stand Volume Using Landsat-Based Indices in Post-Mining Area
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the use of remotely sensed data to measure vegetation variables such as basal area, biomass, and stand volume. The objective of this research was developed regression models to estimate basal area (BA), aboveground biomass (AGB), and stand volume (SV) using Landsat-based vegetation indices. The examined vegetation indices were SAVI, MSAVI, EVI, NBR, NBR2, and NDMI. Regression models were developed based on least-squared method using several forms of equation, i.e., linear, exponential, power, logarithm, and polynomial. Among those models, it was recognized that the best fit of model was obtained from the exponential model, log (y) = ax + b for estimating BA, AGB, and SV. The MSAVI had been identified as the most accurate independent variable to estimates basal area with R-2 of 0.70 and average verification values of 16.39% (4-32.66%); while the EV7 become the best independent variable for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) with R' of 0.72 and average of verification values of 18,10% (9-28.01%); and the NDMI was recognized to be the best independent variable to estimate stand volume with R-2 of 0.69 and average of verification values of 24.37%(-15-38.11%).

TI  - IMPERIAL GOTHIC AND NEO-VICTORIAN ADAPTATIONS: THE SUPERNATURAL IN DAN SIMMONS'S NOVEL <i>THE TERROR</i> (2007) AND ITS TV ADAPTATION
T2  - KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the ways in which the supernatural, as an element of the Victorian genre of imperial Gothic, is used in Dan Simmons's neo-Victorian novel The Terror (2007) and its 2018 TV adaptation. Simmons's The Terror is based on historical facts about the 1845 Franklin Expedition which set out towards what is now Arctic Canada in search of the North-West Passage and then disappeared without a trace. Simmons reconstructs the historical events and introduces elements of the supernatural in order to imagine the destinies of the crew of the expedition's ships, Erebus and Terror. The article focuses on how the supernatural is employed in the depiction of the colonial Other in the novel and its TV adaptation by analysing the ways in which the Victorian imperial Gothic elements of Simmons's novel bring to life Victorian values and worldview. Simmons's use of the imperial Gothic is compared to the 2018 screen adaptation of the novel written by Dan Kajganich and produced by Ridley Scott for AMC. It is argued that the adaptation deconstructs Simmons's use of the supernatural and puts the focus instead on questions of personal and group responsibility within a wider frame of imperialist expansionist policies and the repercussions of these for the environment.

TI  - An Electromagnetic Simulator for Sentinel-3 SAR Altimeter Waveforms Over Land-Part II: Forests
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a crucial role in the climate change mitigation by acting as sinks for carbon and, consequently, reducing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and slowing global warming. For this reason, above ground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for effectively monitoring forest health around the globe. Although remote sensing-based forest AGB quantification can be pursued in different ways, in this work, we discuss a new technique for vegetation observation through the use of altimetry data that have been introduced by the ESA-funded ALtimetry for BIOMass (ALBIOM) project. ALBIOM investigates the possibility of retrieving forest biomass through Copernicus Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) measurements at the Ku- and C-bands in low- and high-resolution modes. To reach this goal, a simulator able to reproduce the altimeter acquisition system and the scattering phenomena that occur in the interaction of the radar altimeter pulse with vegetated surfaces has been developed. The Tor Vergata Vegetation Scattering Model (TOVSM) developed at Tor Vergata University has been exploited to simulate the contribution from the vegetation volume via the modeling of the backscattering of forest canopy through a discrete scatterer representation. A modification of the Soil And Vegetation Reflection Simulator (SAVERS) developed by the team for Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry over land has also been taken into account to simulate the soil contribution.

TI  - An Electromagnetic Simulator for Sentinel-3 SAR Altimeter Waveforms Over Land-Part I: Bare Soil
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - ALtimetry for BIOMass (ALBIOM) is a Permanent Open Call Project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) to explore the possibility of forest biomass retrieval by using Copernicus Sentinel-3 (S-3) Synthetic aperture Radar ALtimeter (SRAL) in low- and high-resolution mode at Ku- and C-bands. It represents an original work in the research of new techniques for vegetation observation using altimetry data. Because of the complexity of the land surfaces, no algorithm has been developed for a specific retracking of the altimetric land waveform. This calls for the development of a model able to reproduce the acquisition system and the target scattering phenomena to simulate the interaction of the radar pulse with the land. In this first work, we present the electromagnetic simulator of S-3 SRAL altimeter measurements over bare soil scenarios realized through a modification of the Soil and Vegetation Reflection Simulator (SAVERS) simulator developed by the team for Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) over land. The impact of topography has also been taken into account. We demonstrate that SAVERS for S-3 SRAL proved its capability to reproduce altimeter waveforms' main attributes for both flat and topography scenarios.

M3  - Article
AB  - The review analyzes the new edition of the travel notes of the Silesian nobleman Erich Lassota von Steblau (1550-1616). It was prepared by an international team of authors from Scandinavia and Germany led by Thomas Riis. Lassota's travel notes are the most important source on the history of the 16th century and a number of European countries. Lassota traveled as a mercenary commander and diplomat to Spain, Portugal, Poland, Sweden, and Ukraine. Until now, only historians of these countries have been interested in his testimonies. The focus of researches was mainly on ethnographic and political aspects. Meanwhile, for the first time since 1866, the new edition has united the entire corpus of Lassota's records known to us and enables to widen the scope of the discussion. How was the religious climate of the era reflected in his texts and to which extent? Were they written by a Catholic or a Protestant? Can we talk about the national or political preferences of the author? Finally, what was Lassota's gentry worldview, and how did he construct his own estate identity? In addition, a nobleman from Silesia was keenly interested in military affairs, in particular, in Spanish combat tactics. His notes also demonstrate the level of book culture, the author's acquaintance with the works of prominent contemporaries. All these aspects nowadays are noteworthy to European historians on a wide interregional material.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article publishes an analysis of opinions of teachers in the subject Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics in the secondary school in Russia. The relevance of the study is due to the necessity of empirical verification of already proposed and existing worldview-related and methodological approaches in the sphere of religious education. The study included in-depth interviews with teachers, assessment of children's knowledge, attendance of classes and workshops of teachers, interviews with teachers of further education courses, with university teachers specialising in religious studies and theology, as well as with researchers in theology. The project is region-specific; the article uses results of surveys and interviews carried out in St. Petersburg and Leningrad Region. Several pieces of evidence ae compared with results of surveys in other Russian regions. The main findings are as follows. The study reflects the contemporary Russian teacher with typical social and demographic characteristics; the modules of the Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics are taught by primary school teachers; most of them are positive about the introduction of this school subject; according to studies in St. Petersburg and Leningrad Regions, most teachers prefer non-confessional general modules; study materials are usually evaluated positively, but it is mentioned that they may have drawbacks in terms of the contemporary means of presenting information and in terms of the perception and demands of present-day students; most teachers have attended additional courses in the subject and evaluated them as useful, but said that they still do not have enough knowledge in religious cultures; interaction with religious institutions when teching modules in specific religious cultures is rare, the most successful interaction of this kind is seen in confessional schools; parents can discuss and choose the module in Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics in parents' meetings; the teachers say that in these meetings parents were offered an opportunity to discuss and select the module of Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics, any coersion being absent, but the role of the teachers is decisive. The main conclusion is that the implementation of the Fundamentals of Religious Cultures and Secular Ethics has gone through the formative stage and has gone over to the stage of discussing the content of the modules and accumulating the experience in teaching practices.

T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING XIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring XIV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The RAN2 sea surface temperature (SST) dataset has been created under the NOAA AVHRR GAC SST Reanalysis 2 (RAN2) project from 40+ years of 4 km Global Area Coverage (GAC) data of the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR/2s and /3s) flown onboard ten NOAA satellites (N07/09/11/12/14/15/16/17/18/19). The data were reprocessed with the NOAA Advanced Clear Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) enterprise SST system. The RAN2 reports two SSTs in the full similar to 3,000 km AVHRR swath: `subskin' (highly sensitive to true skin SST, while being anchored to in situ depth SST) and 'depth' (a closer proxy for in situ data, but less sensitive to true skin SST). Long-term orbital and sensor changes were minimized by daily recalculation of regression coefficients using matchups with drifters and tropical moored buoys, (D+TM), collected within limited time windows centered at the processed day. For N07/09, (D+TM) matchups were sparse and supplemented by ships. The adverse effects of nighttime Sun impingements on the sensor were mitigated by recalculating the AVHRR L1b calibration coefficients, while similar effects of stray light in Earth view were flagged and excluded. Massive cold SST outliers caused by atmospheric contamination following major volcanic eruptions (El Chichon in 1982, and Mt Pinatubo and Mt Hudson in 1991) were filtered out by more conservative cloud screening with the modified ACSPO clear-sky mask. This paper evaluates the performance of the RAN2 relative to the two others available AVHRR GAC SST datasets, NOAA Pathfinder v5.3 (PF) and ESA Climate Change Initiative v2.1 (CCI).

TI  - An Improved Forest Structure Data Set for Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, European forests face many challenges but also offer opportunities, such as climate change mitigation, provision of renewable resources, energy and other ecosystem services. Large-scale analyses to assess these opportunities are hindered by the lack of a consistent, spatial and accessible forest structure data. This study presents a freely available pan-European forest structure data set. Building on our previous work, we used data from six additional countries and consider now ten key forest stand variables. Harmonized inventory data from 16 European countries were used in combination with remote sensing data and a gap-filling algorithm to produce this consistent and comparable forest structure data set across European forests. We showed how land cover data can be used to scale inventory data to a higher resolution which in turn ensures a consistent data structure across sub-regional, country and European forest assessments. Cross validation and comparison with published country statistics of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicate that the chosen methodology is able to produce robust and accurate forest structure data across Europe, even for areas where no inventory data were available.

TI  - RESISTANCE AND CULTURAL TRANGRESSION IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: GLORIA ANZALDUA'S <i>PRIETITA AND THE GHOST WOMAN</i>
T2  - ANUARI DE FILOLOGIA-LLENGUES I LITERATURAS MODERNAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is based on the hermeneutic hypothesis that Prietita and the ghost woman (1996), a children's story by Chicano writer Gloria Anzaldua, can be conceived as a mode of resistance and transgression of the totalizing discourses of the dominant US society, at the same time that it deconstructs cultural practices of colonial roots from Mexican culture. Our analysis is framed by four central theoretical axes: the socio-critical notion of literature, the concept of frontier literature, the sociocultural function of myth and the construct of cultural identity. It is concluded that the story textualizes Chicano resistance and transgression by means of two discursive strategies: a) the appreciation of a Chicano worldview and cultural order, and b) the transgression of Mexican colonial and patriarchal mythology.

AB  - In a context of climate change and potential intensification of the hydrological cycle, improving representation of water fluxes within river basins is of paramount importance both for hydrological sciences and operational forecasts. New integrated approaches are required for exploring synergies between spatially distributed flow models and datasets, combining in situ observations with high-resolution hydro-meteorology and satellite data. To take advantage of this unprecedented observations of the critical zone, innovative approaches integrating hydraulic-hydrological modeling and multivariate assimilation methods are needed. They should enable ingesting spatially distributed forcings, physiographic descriptors hydrodynamic signatures from remotely-sensed and in situ observables, and tackle calibration problems in integrated hydraulic-hydrological models. Crucially, the pertinence of the information assimilation relies on model-data coherence: water surface observables are valuable to constrain hydraulic models of river reaches [12] and references therein and complex river network portions, forced by spatially distributed inflows [23] (Malou et al. under redaction). Since hydraulic modeling at the scale of a river basin can be computationally costly, a combination of effective 1D and 2D representations, complemented by hydrological modules, may be useful. Complex river-floodplain interaction zones may be modeled in 2D zooms, while 1D approaches can fit simpler reaches. This contribution presents the development of a complete hydraulic-hydrological toolchain based on the 2D hydraulic model and variational data assimilation platform DassFlow (http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/DassFlow). A 1D effective modeling approach based on a 2D shallow water model is tested. Then, the implementation of hydrological modules within the DassFlow VDA framework is presented.

TI  - Role of shear wave elastography as an adjunct to axillary ultrasonography in predicting nodal metastasis in breast cancer patients with suspicious nodes
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the role of shear wave elastography (SWE) of suspicious axillary lymph nodes and its combination with B -mode USG in predicting nodal metastasis in breast cancer patients. Methods: Prospective observational study was performed from June 2018 to August 2020 on breast cancer patients with suspicious axillary nodes on USG. B -mode features (cortical thickness, effacement of fatty hilum, non- hilar blood flow and round shape) and SWE parameters (Emax, Emin, Emean and ESD) of the node with the thickest cortex were evaluated. Diagnostic performances of USG, SWE and their combination were estimated using pathological status of the node on biopsy as the gold standard. Results: Of the 54 patients evaluated, optimal elasticity maps were obtained in 49 nodes of 49 patients (mean age, 46.3 ?? 12.1 years; 48/49 (98%) females). On biopsy, 38 nodes (77.6%) had metastasis, while 11 (22.4%) had reactive hyperplasia. Emax, Emin, Emean and ESD of both cortex and hilum were significantly higher in metastatic than reactive nodes. Emax (cortex) >_14.9 kPa had the best diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 73.7%; specificity, 81.8%). Cortical thickness >_6.7 mm had the best diagnostic performance among B -mode features (sensitivity, 89.5%; specificity, 72.7%). Combining cortical thickness with effacement of fatty hilum and/or non- hilar blood flow yielded sensitivity of 89.5% and specificity of 90.9%. Addition of Emax (cortex) to cortical thickness and combination of >_2 B -mode features increased their specificities to 90.9 and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: Metastatic axillary nodes are stiffer than reactive nodes on SWE in breast cancer patients. Emax (cortex) has the best diagnostic performance in differentiating between reactive hyperplasia and nodal metastasis. Combination of Emax (cortex) and cortical thickness increases the specificity for diagnosing metastasis, especially in nodes showing only cortical thickening. Advances in knowledge: Combination of SWE and B -mode USG is highly specific for differentiating metastasis from reactive hyperplasia in suspicious nodes of breast carcinoma patients, especially in nodes with only cortical thickening.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is an integral part of treatment planning for a variety of cancers as it evaluates whether a tumor has metastasized, an event that significantly reduces survival probability. However, this invasive procedure is associated with patient morbidity, and misses small metastatic deposits, resulting in the removal of additional nodes for tumors with high metastatic probability despite a negative SLN biopsy. To prevent this over-treatment and its associated morbidities for patients that were truly negative, we propose a tissue oxygen imaging method called Photoacoustic Lifetime Imaging (PALI) as an alternative or supplementary tool for SLN biopsy. As the hyper-metabolic state of cancer cells significantly depresses tissue oxygenation compared to normal tissue even for small metastatic deposits, we hypothesize that PALI can sensitively and specifically detect metastases. Before this hypothesis is tested, however, PALI's maximum imaging depth must be evaluated to determine the cancer types for which it is best suited. To evaluate imaging depth, we developed and simulated a phantom composed of tubing in a tissue-mimicking, optically scattering liquid. Our simulation and experimental results both show that PALI's maximum imaging depth is 16 mm. As most lymph nodes are deeper than 16 mm, ways to improve imaging depth, such as directly delivering light to the node using penetrating optical fibers, must be explored.

AB  - This paper describes an open-source dataset framework designed for machine learning remote sensing datasets called Finch after the finches Charles Darwin studied while developing the theory of evolution. The Finch Framework enables datasets to be created from annotations-to-images and to efficiently modify an existing dataset. Commonly, datasets are released once and never updated to become more challenging or to correct mistakes. Our proposed framework encourages datasets to evolve over time and provides a version control system for consistent comparisons between experiments. We utilize other open-source tools and unique attributes of remote sensing data to characterize entire datasets with a few lightweight configuration files. Generated datasets are accompanied with a dataset manifest file, providing a consistent and powerful format for referencing all data. The standard dataset representation reduces the time required to integrate datasets into machine learning pipelines.

TI  - Fractional Vegetation Cover Derived from UAV and Sentinel-2 Imagery as a Proxy for In Situ FAPAR in a Dense Mixed-Coniferous Forest?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FAPAR) is an essential climate variable for assessing the productivity of ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing provides spatially distributed FAPAR products, but their accurate and efficient validation is challenging in forest environments. As the FAPAR is linked to the canopy structure, it may be approximated by the fractional vegetation cover (FCOVER) under the assumption that incoming radiation is either absorbed or passed through gaps in the canopy. With FCOVER being easier to retrieve, FAPAR validation activities could benefit from a priori information on FCOVER. Spatially distributed FCOVER is available from satellite remote sensing or can be retrieved from imagery of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) at a centimetric resolution. We investigated remote sensing-derived FCOVER as a proxy for in situ FAPAR in a dense mixed-coniferous forest, considering both absolute values and spatiotemporal variability. Therefore, direct FAPAR measurements, acquired with a Wireless Sensor Network, were related to FCOVER derived from UAV and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery at different seasons. The results indicated that spatially aggregated UAV-derived FCOVER was close (RMSE = 0.02) to in situ FAPAR during the peak vegetation period when the canopy was almost closed. The S2 FCOVER product underestimated both the in situ FAPAR and UAV-derived FCOVER (RMSE > 0.3), which we attributed to the generic nature of the retrieval algorithm and the coarser resolution of the product. We concluded that UAV-derived FCOVER may be used as a proxy for direct FAPAR measurements in dense canopies. As another key finding, the spatial variability of the FCOVER consistently surpassed that of the in situ FAPAR, which was also well-reflected in the S2 FAPAR and FCOVER products. We recommend integrating this experimental finding as consistency criteria in the context of ECV quality assessments. To facilitate the FAPAR sampling activities, we further suggest assessing the spatial variability of UAV-derived FCOVER to benchmark sampling sizes for in situ FAPAR measurements. Finally, our study contributes to refining the FAPAR sampling protocols needed for the validation and improvement of FAPAR estimates in forest environments.

AB  - Nowadays, physical development is essential in any integrated urban development program. The rapid expansion in the physical form of cities in an unplanned and uneven growth in line with the various causes of irregular migration is considered one of the significant problems in Iran's cities, resulting in urban sprawl. With its numerous economic and environmental impacts, sprawling urban areas forced urban experts to explore strategies to deal with this phenomenon. The primary purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of urban growth boundaries in the Iranian metropolis of Karaj. This paper prepared the required data to explain the studied problem. The study was conducted using survey techniques, field operations, and GIS software to evaluate the measure of success and effectiveness of the urban growth boundary. Moreover, analyses and quantification of the spatial dimension of the urban expansion have been extracted using multi-classification techniques by Envi, ArcMap, and Snap software. On the other hand, the study collects multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite data, Landsat ETM with L8. The quantification and mapping of urban growth enabled us to quantify and spatially characterize urban growth and create a model to make sustainable cities. As awhole, outputs from our investigations highlight that the currently available free of charge long-term satellite time series provides an excellent low-cost tool for several applications, including urban growth analysis.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - With the continuous improvement of the number and capability of micro-nano satellites, on-board intelligent data processing becomes a necessary configuration. The constellation with hundreds micro-nano satellites has the ability to high-frequency detection of ship targets and realizes continuous awareness of the global ocean, which is of great significance in maritime rescue, waterway management and combating illegal fishing. In this paper, a fast on-board ship detection method for panchromatic image is proposed. Firstly, GPU (graphics processing unit) of commercial devices is used to form high performance and low power computing capability on the micro-nano satellite. Then, according to the characteristics of ship targets, a convolutional neural network based on lightweight model is designed to quickly obtain accurate number and location information of ship targets. The algorithm deployed on micro-nano satellite can transform massive remote sensing data into target slices, greatly reduce the pressure of satellite-ground data transmission and improve the application efficiency of remote sensing data. We test our method on a dataset of more than 90 panchromatic images. The results show that the detection rate of this algorithm is better than 0.95, and the average processing speed for a image block of 1024 x 1024 pixel is less than 0.2 seconds, which has a wide application prospect.

TI  - The 10-meter Winter Wheat Mapping in Shandong Province Using Sentinel-2 Data and Coarse Resolution Maps
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate large-scale mapping of the spread of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) is crucial to guarantee food security, study climate change, and monitor operational agriculture. Traditional winter wheat mapping frameworks are constrained by insufficient spatial resolution and heavy dependence on field surveys, while traditional machine learning models excessively rely on subjective judgment. Furthermore, collecting sufficient field samples covering a large area is expensive and time-consuming. In this context, an automatic label update deep learning solution is developed to produce 10-m resolution winter wheat maps using Sentinel-2 data and existing coarse-resolution (30 m) winter wheat mapping products. In particular, a label update module considering the unique phenological (seasonal) characteristics of winter wheat is designed to update labels in the training phase. The results indicate that our method yields a satisfactory classification result with an overall accuracy exceeding 92% and an F-1 score greater than 0.85 for all validation samples, even when no field survey data were used for training. In addition, a 10-m spatial resolution winter wheat map for the entire Shandong province is generated, showing a significant correlation between the computed winter wheat map and the agricultural statistical land, with correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.78 at the municipal and county levels, respectively. The proposed methodology can serve as a viable and promising method for high-resolution, operational agricultural monitoring over large areas.

TI  - Microwave Brightness Temperature Anomalies Associated With the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha and Mw 7.3 Dolakha Earthquakes in Nepal
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two catastrophic earthquakes (EQs) with magnitudes of Mw 7.8 and 7.3 occurred in Gorkha and Dolakha, Nepal on April 25 and May 12, 2015, respectively. By employing the spatio-temporally weighted two-step method (STW-TSM), significant positive and negative microwave brightness temperature (MBT) anomalies preceding the two EQs were uncovered with satellite microwave data from FY-3B. Two strip-shaped positive MBT anomalies appeared in the Higher Himalayan 1 day before the Gorkha shock and the Dolakha shock, respectively, which were parallel to the thrust belt and whose intensity distributions exhibited good topographic consistency with the elevation profiles of the central Himalayas. Referring to the P-hole theory and seismogenic mechanism of the Nepal EQs, seismically activated mobile positive charges are presumed to have caused the surface positive MBT anomalies by reducing the superficial dielectric constant and increasing the local temperature of the Himalayan cliffs. A significant negative MBT anomaly occurred plausibly as early as March 2015 in the southern Gangetic Plain and developed into a stripe parallel to the thrust belt on the days of the Gorkha and Dolakha events. The negative MBT anomalies are suggested to result from soil moisture increases due to local synchronous precipitation. This work presents the first case study to use data from the FY-3B microwave radiation imager (MWRI) to investigate seismic anomalies, and discriminate both positive and negative MBT anomalies preceding an EQ for the first time.

One of them, "The Record of Forgetting Sheep", recorded the exchange of his views on music and music between the two countries with Yin Jiaquan, Wang Minhao literati in the Qing Dynasty. Yin Jiaquan steamed a sheep to entertain Park Ziyuan, but because the three people were immersed in the joy of conversation, they forgot the steamed sheep, and  Park Ji-won in memory of this unforgettable wonderful conversation with foreign friends, solid name "The Record of Forgetting Sheep".In this article , the three men discuss their opinions on music, which involves the views of ancient music theory in China and South Korea. Park Ji-won 's thirst for knowledge and positive thinking about music are also important materials for studying his thoughts on the development of music. However, for a long time, the academic research on Park Ji-won and Rehe Diary has focused more on other aspects of Park Ji-won's Northern learning thoughts. Therefore, the author here should explore the inheritance of Park Ji-won 's music theory to the Northern learning thoughts through the analysis of the content of "The Record of Forgetting Sheep" in Rehe Diary. It can provide a new perspective for future scholars to study and analyze Park 's practical thoughts and a new thinking direction for the study of Chinese and Korean music at that time.

TI  - Basis Pursuit Denoising via Recurrent Neural Network Applied to Super-Resolving SAR Tomography
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding sparse solutions of underdetermined linear systems commonly requires the solving of L-1 regularized least-squares minimization problem, which is also known as the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN). They are computationally expensive since they cannot be solved analytically. An emerging technique known as deep unrolling provided a good combination of the descriptive ability of neural networks, explainable, and computational efficiency for BPDN. Many unrolled neural networks for BPDN, e.g., learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm and its variants, employ shrinkage functions to prune elements with small magnitude. Through experiments on synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR), we discover the shrinkage step leads to unavoidable information loss in the dynamics of networks and degrades the performance of the model. We propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) with novel sparse minimal gated units (SMGUs) to solve the information loss issue. The proposed RNN architecture with SMGUs benefits from incorporating historical information into optimization and, thus, effectively preserves full information in the final output. Taking TomoSAR inversion as an example, extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed RNN outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithm in terms of super-resolution power and generalization ability. It achieved 10%-20% higher double-scatterer detection rate and is less sensitive to phase and amplitude ratio difference between scatterers. Test on real TerraSAR-X spotlight images also shows the high-quality 3-D reconstruction of the test site.

AB  - Fantasy realism is the main characteristic and principle of creation that transforms reality into fantasy, but expresses and accuses the truth without missing out. The literary expression technique of fantasy realism is also applied to animation production, and it metaphorically expresses reality through artistic expression techniques that present fantasy reality and reveal fantasy nature. In this paper, we conducted a study focusing on the implications of worldview setting, expression techniques, and narrative construction in Masaaki Yuasa’s latest film, <Ride Your Wave>, and director Makoto Shinkai’s latest film, <Weathering with You>, based on this study. The characteristics of expression of the theme of fantasy realism were studied. Both directors are next-generation directors representing the Japanese animation industry, and their works have high value in terms of completeness and box office success. As a result of the study on the expression characteristics of the theme of fantasy realism, which appears in common despite their distinct style of work, At first, built a fantasy worldview in the real world through the relationship between humans and nature. met and formed their strong sympathy for the film’s story. Second, the film’s metaphorical visual language was expressed by breaking down the boundaries of space and time, and through these creative techniques, the two directors put the audience into a worldview where reality and fantasy intersect.

AB  - Using five remote sensing images, using the method of value equivalent factor and spatial statistical analysis, this paper explores the spatio-temporal dynamic changes of land use and ecological service value in Lanzhou from 1980 to 2020 in the upper Yellow River. The results showed that :(1) the grassland area accounts for more than 60 % of the natural ecosystem in Lanzhou, and the construction land increased by 228.83% after 2000, and the cultivated land decreased the most. The land use mainly showed the change characteristics of cultivated land into forest land and construction land, grassland transfer construction land. (2) The growth rate of ESV in Lanzhou was 7, 74% during the study period, of which grassland ESV accounted for more than 52%; In the individual ESV, hydrological regulation and soil conservation account for more than 40 % of the total value, (3) On the spatial distribution, the change of ESV in Lanzhou is generally consistent with the distribution of forest land and grassland. In time series, the high value area is shrinking while the low value area is gradually expanding. (4) The ESV and its changes in Five periods in Lanzhou have a very obvious positive spatial autocorrelation. The high value area tends to gather, while the low value area tends to be adjacent. Different stages show different spatial aggregation characteristics. but the ESV hot spot map is consistent with the spatial distribution characteristics of ESCI in the overall distribution.

TI  - U_EFF_NET: High-Precision Segmentation of Offshore Farms From High-Resolution SAR Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore aquaculture promotes the development of aquaculture industry and brings huge economic benefits to fishermen, while seriously affecting the near-coast environment. Accurate access to the range of offshore farms at home and abroad is of great significance for marine disaster warning and coastal management. Remote sensing is a very effective means of observing offshore farms. Offshore farms segmentation technology is more mature in high-resolution optical images. SAR images have the advantage of being available all day and all night. Using SAR images to extract offshore farms has become a recent research hotspot. Gaofen-3 and HISEA-1 satellites have high-resolution marine observation capabilities. Combined with their super observation capabilities, this article proposes a technical solution to extract offshore farms using Gaofen-3 and HISEA-1 images. First, the combine-crop component module is proposed to create a new SAR images dataset based the original dataset. Next, common data augmentation methods, such as flip, rotate, and copy-paste, are used, and the online multiscale resolution image expansion is proposed to enrich the dataset and enlarge the data volume. Finally, the U_EFF_NET model is proposed. The model uses encoder-decoder structure and the light-weight feature extraction network EfficientNet-b0 as backbone. The decoder embeds the attention mechanism. The optimization strategy uses joint loss function to achieve multitask learning, and the OHEM strategy is added to the joint loss function. The method proposed in this article has high accuracy and high practicality as the frequency-weight intersection ratio of the extracted results on the test set is 98.12%. And the inference time is at the forefront.

TI  - Drug Release from Gelsolin-Targeted Phase-Transition Nanoparticles Triggered by Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Current strategies for tumour-induced sentinel lymph node detection and metastasis therapy have limitations. It is essential to identify and provide warnings earlier for tumour metastasis to carry out effective clinical interventions. In addition, traditional cancer chemotherapy encounters drastic limitations due to the nonspecific delivery of antitumour drugs and severe side effects. We aimed to exploit the potential of gelsolin (GSN) monoclonal antibody as a targeting agent and perfluorohexane (PFH) as a phase-transition agent to maximize the cytotoxic effect of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle-based drug controllable release systems for Hca-F cells.Methods: We co-encapsulated PFH and doxorubicin (DOX) into PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) and further conjugated GSN monoclonal antibody onto the surface of NPs to form GSN-targeted phase transition polymer NPs (GSN-PLGA-PFH-DOX) for both imaging and therapy of tumours and metastatic lymph nodes. To promote and trigger drug release on demand, low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) was applied to achieve a controllable release of the encapsulated drug.Results: GSN-PLGA-PFH-DOX NPs exhibited characteristics such as a narrow size distribution and smooth surface. GSN-PLGA-PFH-DOX NPs could also specifically bind to Hca-F cells and increase the ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) image contrast intensity. GSN-PLGA-PFH-DOX NPs enable GSN-mediated targeting and biotherapeutic effects as well as LIFU-responsive drug release, resulting in synergistic cytotoxic effects in GSN-overexpressing cells in vitro.Conclusion: Our work might provide a strategy for the imaging and chemotherapy of primary tumours and their metastases.

TI  - Coupling Relationship Analysis of Gold Content Using Gaofen-5 (GF-5) Satellite Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data: A Potential Method in Chahuazhai Gold Mining Area, Qiubei County, SW China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The gold (Au) geochemical anomaly is an important indicator of gold mineralization. While the traditional field geochemical exploration method is time-consuming and expensive, the hyperspectral remote sensing technique serves as a robust technique for the delineation and mapping of hydrothermally altered and weathered mineral deposits. Nonetheless, mineralization element anomaly detection was still seldomly used in previous hyperspectral remote sensing applications in mineralization. This study explored the coupling relationship between Gaofen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral data and Au geochemical anomalies through several models. The Au geochemical anomalies in the Chahuazhai mining area, Qiubei County, Yunnan Province, SW China, was studied in detail. First, several noise reduction methods including radiometric calibration, Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH), Savitzky-Golay filter, and endmember choosing methods including Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation, matched filtering, and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) transformation were applied to the Gaofen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral data processing. The Spectrum-Area (S-A) method was introduced to build an FFT filter to highlight the spectral abnormal characteristics associated with Au geochemical anomaly information. Specifically, the Matched Filtering (MF) technique was applied to the dataset to find the Au geochemical anomaly abundances of endmembers with innovative large-sample learning. Then, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, a Back Propagation (BP) network, and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) were used to reveal the coupling relationship between the spectra of the processed hyperspectral data and the Au geochemical anomalies. The results show that the GWR analysis has a much higher coefficient of determination, which implies that the Au geochemical anomalies and the spectral information are highly related to spatial locations. GWR works especially well for showing the regional Au geochemical anomaly trend and simulating the Au concentrated areas. The GWR model with application of the S-A method is applicable to the detection of Au geochemical anomalies, which could provide a potential method for Au deposit exploration using GF-5 hyperspectral data.

TI  - Multitask Learning for Human Settlement Extent Regression and Local Climate Zone Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human settlement extent (HSE) and local climate zone (LCZ) maps are both essential sources, e.g., for sustainable urban development and Urban Heat Island (UHI) studies. Remote sensing (RS)- and deep learning (DL)-based classification approaches play a significant role by providing the potential for global mapping. However, most of the efforts only focus on one of the two schemes, usually on a specific scale. This leads to unnecessary redundancies since the learned features could be leveraged for both of these related tasks. In this letter, the concept of multitask learning (MTL) is introduced to HSE regression and LCZ classification for the first time. We propose an MTL framework and develop an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN), which consists of a backbone network for shared feature learning, attention modules for task-specific feature learning, and a weighting strategy for balancing the two tasks. We additionally propose to exploit HSE predictions as a prior for LCZ classification to enhance the accuracy. The MTL approach was extensively tested with Sentinel-2 data of 13 cities across the world. The results demonstrate that the framework is able to provide a competitive solution for both tasks.

AB  - This paper envisions a new data analysis paradigm to analyze the on-satellite data effectively motivated by the increasing privacy concern and computing capacity of nowadays satellites. To facilitate the new paradigm, we built an analytical model that uses a ground server to dispatch tasks to satellites and return aggregated results to analysts. In order to efficiently schedule tasks, we identified the characteristics of satellites in terms of intermittent connections and dynamic load levels, and then proposed a reinforcement learning-based scheduling algorithm. The preliminary simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm can jointly optimize latency and satellite resource consumption under various task arrival intervals.

AB  - Many deep learning architectures exist for semantic segmentation. In this paper, their application to multi-modal remote sensing data is examined. Two well-known network architectures, U-Net and DeepLab V3+, developed originally for RGB image data, are modified to accept additional input channels, such as near infrared or depth information. In both networks, ResNet101 is used as the backbone, while data-preprocessing steps, including data augmentation, are identical. We compare both networks and experiment with different fusion techniques in U-Net and with hyper-parameters for weighting the input channels for fusion in DeepLab V3+. We also evaluate the effect of pre-training on RGB and non-RGB data. The results show a minimally better performance of the DeepLab V3+ model compared to U-Net, while for the certain classes, such as vehicles, U-Net yields a slightly superior accuracy.

TI  - Retrieval of Sea Ice Drift From the Central Arctic to the Fram Strait Based on Sequential Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice drift (SID) is crucial for understanding sea ice dynamics and for navigation safety. This study focuses on a comprehensive analysis of SID retrieval in the Arctic based on spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. A state-of-the-art method combining feature tracking (FT) and pattern matching (PM) techniques was applied to sequential Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR data in 2020 to derive SID from the central Arctic to the Fram Strait. The SAR retrievals were validated with drifting buoys. For temporal intervals of S1 data of approximately 24 h, 15 254 collocations were collected from January to June and from October to December, yielding a 0.00 cm/s bias for the drift velocity magnitude and 0.27?; for direction with corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.47 cm/s and 4.73?. Using temporal intervals of S1 data of less than 24 h, we retrieved SID from July to September. A total of 644 collocations yields a comparison with a bias of 0.52 cm/s and 4.62? for the drift magnitude and direction, respectively. The corresponding RMSE values are 1.85 cm/s and 20.73?. The comparisons demonstrate better performance than the operational SAR-based SID product using the maximum cross correlation (MCC) method and are consistent with seasonal trends in drift velocity with the coarse-resolution product. We also analyzed the variations in SAR retrievals and further estimated appropriate temporal intervals, making it feasible to conduct long-term SID retrievals based on spaceborne SAR data at high spatial resolution in the Arctic.

TI  - High-Resolution Mapping Changes in the Invasion of <i>Spartina Alterniflora</i> in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The propagation of the invasive Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) has seriously affected the health of coastal wetland ecosystems in China and thus requires an urgent response. In this article, we construct a feature vector set containing phenological and other time-series features based on the google earth engine platform by combining dense time-series images from the sentinel-1 and sentinel-2 satellites. We obtained the dataset of the annual distribution of S. alterniflora in the Yellow river delta from 2016 to 2021 by developing an object-oriented random forest classification model. The results show that S. alterniflora has different phenological features from other wetland plants that played an important role in its classification based on the images. A combination of multiple phenological and temporal features improved the classification accuracy of S. alterniflora (multi-year average overall accuracy: 95.38%; user accuracy: 95.01%; producer accuracy: and 95.17%). Our results suggest that from 2016 to 2021, the growth rate of the area occupied by S. alterniflora was 2.17 km(2) per year, and a new patch of the S. alterniflora appeared in the south of the study area in 2018. The article here provides scientific data to support the monitoring and control of the invasive S. alterniflora at a large scale.

TI  - MSSL: Hyperspectral and Panchromatic Images Fusion via Multiresolution SpatialSpectral Feature Learning Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of hyperspectral (HS) and panchromatic (PAN) images aims to generate a fused HS image that combines spectral information of the HS image with spatial information of the PAN image. In this article, we propose a multiresolution spatial-spectral feature learning (MSSL) framework for fusing HS and PAN images. The proposed MSSL transforms the existing deep and complex network into several simple and shallow subnetworks to simplify the feature learning process. MSSL upsamples the HS image while downsamples the PAN image and designs multiresolution 3-D convolutional autoencoder (CAEs) networks with a spectral constraint to learn complete spatial-spectral features of the HS image. MSSL designs multiresolution 2-D CAEs with spatial constraint to extract spatial features of the PAN image, with a low computational cost. In order to effectively generate the pansharpened HS image with high spatial and spectral fidelity, a multiresolution residual network is presented to reconstruct the HS image from the extracted spatial-spectral features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used remote sensing data sets in comparison with state-of-the-art HS image fusion methods, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed MSSL method.

In this paper, the variations of atmospheric environment during SARS and COVID-19 pandemics were calculated and analyzed based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Atmosphere Monthly Global Product. Preliminary results show that: (1) aerosol optical depth is most affected by the pandemics, especially the duration and prevention and control measures; (2) the correlations between the variables of aerosol optical depth, cloud fraction, total column ozone and precipitable water vapor were not very strong during the two pandemics.

TI  - Monitoring Lodging Extents of Maize Crop Using Multitemporal GF-1 Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize crop lodging is a recurrent phenomenon which results in significant reduction of grain yield and quality in addition to the impediment of mechanical harvesting. The large-scale monitoring of maize crop lodging is important for production policy adjustment and agricultural insurance compensation. In this article, we derived a variety of features from multitemporal GaoFen-1 (GF-1) images before and after maize crop lodging. We screened the most sensitive features of the spectrum, texture, and vegetation index to monitor maize crop lodging. The recursive feature elimination method based on cross-validation and mutual information were compared to obtain the optimal feature combination for monitoring the lodging extents of maize crop. The random forest classifier was used to classify the lodging extents. The results showed that the most sensitive features of the spectrum, texture, and vegetation indices of lodging extents included the difference of reflectance in blue, green, and red bands, the difference of normalized difference vegetation index, the difference of ratio vegetation index, the difference of enhanced vegetation index difference, the difference of mean value of blue band, the difference of mean value of green band, and the difference of mean value of red band. The total accuracy of lodging extents classification was 87.50%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.83 for testing samples. Based on multiple features derived from GF-1 images before and after lodging, the lodging extents of maize crop can be monitored on a large scale.

TI  - On the Radiative Impact of Biomass-Burning Aerosols in the Arctic: The August 2017 Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal fires have increased during the last years and are projected to become more intense and frequent as a consequence of climate change. Wildfires produce a wide range of effects on the Arctic climate and ecosystem, and understanding these effects is crucial for predicting the future evolution of the Arctic region. This study focuses on the impact of the long-range transport of biomass-burning aerosol into the atmosphere and the corresponding radiative perturbation in the shortwave frequency range. As a case study, we investigate an intense biomass-burning (BB) event which took place in summer 2017 in Canada and subsequent northeastward transport of gases and particles in the plume leading to exceptionally high values (0.86) of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 500 nm measured in northwestern Greenland on 21 August 2017. This work characterizes the BB plume measured at the Thule High Arctic Atmospheric Observatory (THAAO; 76.53 degrees N, 68.74 degrees W) in August 2017 by assessing the associated shortwave aerosol direct radiative impact over the THAAO and extending this evaluation over the broader region (60 degrees N-80 degrees N, 110 degrees W-0 degrees E). The radiative transfer simulations with MODTRAN6.0 estimated an aerosol heating rate of up to 0.5 K/day in the upper aerosol layer (8-12 km). The direct aerosol radiative effect (ARE) vertical profile shows a maximum negative value of -45.4 Wm(-2) for a 78 degrees solar zenith angle above THAAO at 3 km altitude. A cumulative surface ARE of -127.5 TW is estimated to have occurred on 21 August 2017 over a portion (similar to 3.1 x 10(6) km(2)) of the considered domain (60 degrees N-80 degrees N, 110 degrees W-0 degrees E). ARE regional mean daily values over the same portion of the domain vary between -65 and -25 Wm(-2). Although this is a limited temporal event, this effect can have significant influence on the Arctic radiative budget, especially in the anticipated scenario of increasing wildfires.

TI  - Deep Learning Model Development for Detecting Coffee Tree Changes Based on Sentinel-2 Imagery in Vietnam
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientists and land managers have spent considerable time and resources monitoring coffee forests in the great basalt plateau. Deep learning models for coffee classification using remote sensing data have developed into a tool that may eventually replace manual image interpretation. This study proposes a U-Net model for classifying coffee planting regions using Sentinel-2 data, which aid in the annual monitoring of coffee plantation area changes. Numerous optimizer methods were evaluated and compared to support-vector-machine and random-forest methods. Twelve U-Net models were trained and compared in total. The trained deep learning models outperformed the two benchmark methods. As a result, the U-Net model with the Adadelta optimizer and 128 x 128 x 4 input data size was chosen due to its near-95 percent accuracy and 0.12 loss function value. The model was used to successfully detect location of the Vietnamese coffee ecosystem. The Net-Adadelta-128 model's output is consistent with data from statistical reports, which estimated the area of the coffee land cover to be 684, 681, and 676 thousand hectares in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The best U-Net model, which takes approximately 30 minutes to create a new classification for 55,000 square kilometres, may one day be used for coffee research and management.

AB  - The damping ratio is a calculated feature that measures the contrast between oil-slicked water and the open ocean in SAR data. To implement the damping ratio, the current literature suggests estimating the open water backscatter by taking strips of undefined width across the range direction, obtaining the damping ratio as a function of incidence angle. We show in this paper that the method proposed in the literature can be improved by instead sampling open water pixels randomly. The method is tested on RADARSAT-2 quad-polarimetric SAR imagery of a verified oil slick acquired during the 2013 NOFO oil-on-water exercise conducted in the North Sea. The results suggest that deviations in the derived damping ratio encountered by implementing the method proposed in the literature can be reduced from of order 10(0) - 10(-1) to 10(-3).

A view into the wide heritage of the German synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments and the paramount results obtained with the German X-band Missions will be provided.This paper will cover the Shuttle Imaging Radar missions (SIR-C/X-SAR) from 1994 and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) from 2000, followed by the current missions TerraSAR-X from 2007 and TanDEM-X launched in 2010. Since then, the TanDEM-X mission is providing high-resolution X-band images for scientific, commercial and governmental applications. The milestones of the TanDEM-X mission, like the generation of a global, high-resolution digital elevation model of the Earth surface, will be presented.The paper will also discuss the challenges faced by the current mission under planning: High Resolution Wide Swath (HRWS), which is a very ambitious multistatic SAR system exploiting the formation flight of one active main satellite and three smaller passive companion satellites. With HRWS, the MirrorSAR concept will be implemented in space for the first time.Finally, the future of the German SAR Program will be discussed.

TI  - PROBLEMS OF CLASSIFICATION AND VALUATION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the main problems of the classification and valuation of financial assets, namely, in terms of inconsistencies in the approaches proposed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The study found that in many countries that have begun to apply International Financial Reporting Standards, there are no uniform rules for the classification, assessment and determination of the fair value of financial assets. The need to address these issues is of particular importance in the context of the development of the OECD initiative to implement the BEPS. This determined the direction of the study and allowed formulating the aim of the study, which is to develop sound proposals for further development and improvement of IFRS provisions related to the classification and valuation of the fair value of financial assets. The methodological background of the research involved an institutional approach to the study of socio-economic processes and phenomena, as well as a system of principles and methods for creating and assessing value, which is based on philosophical, worldview, general scientific and special scientific methods. The study allowed systematising and classifying financial assets according to different features and characteristics. The proposed classification of financial assets makes it possible to determine the directions for improving accounting in terms of its arrangement based on the approximation of IFRS to the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines. The promising areas for further research include the development of a unified procedure for determining the real value of financial assets for taxation and accounting purposes.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) are the most important and widely used data sources in several applications-e.g., forecasting drought and flood, and managing water resources-especially in the areas with sparse or no other robust sources. This study explored the accuracy and precision of satellite data products over a span of 18 years (2000-2017) using synoptic ground station data for three regions in Iran with different climates, namely (a) humid and high rainfall, (b) semi-arid, and (c) arid. The results show that the monthly precipitation products of GPM and TRMM overestimate the rainfall. On average, they overestimated the precipitation amount by 11% in humid, by 50% in semi-arid, and by 43% in arid climate conditions compared to the ground-based data. This study also evaluated the satellite data accuracy in drought and wet conditions based on the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and different seasons. The results showed that the accuracy of satellite data varies significantly under drought, wet, and normal conditions and different timescales, being lowest under drought conditions, especially in arid regions. The highest accuracy was obtained on the 12-month timescale and the lowest on the 3-month timescale. Although the accuracy of the data is dependent on the season, the seasonal effects depend on climatic conditions.

AB  - Remote sensing data is characterized by a large degree of heterogeneity and variability. In this context, change detection in heterogeneous bitemporal satellite images has become an emerging and important topic in order to ensure monitoring continuity and to reduce the probability of missing important events. In this paper, we propose an image translation method between the pre-event and post-event modalities that is based on a modified fractal coding technique that determines a dictionary of locations of self-similar structures. Self-similar structures are identified using a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder as a mapping function between the compressed representations. The search for the k closest self-similar structures is performed using a vantage-point tree. Once the image modality translation is performed, the change map is obtained via an unsupervised Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach with spatial context constraints. The experiments conducted over several pairs of heterogeneous remote sensing images show the effectiveness of the proposed technique, if compared to other proposed methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - The current technological developments lead to increased heterogeneity and variability in remote sensing imagery. In this context, unsupervised multimodal change detection techniques are mandatory to perform a continuous monitoring and rapid damage assessment by means of heterogeneous remote sensing data. Taking advantage of the latest advances in deep learning, we address multimodal change detection from an intermodality image translation perspective. Intermodality translation is achieved by means of generative adversarial networks (GANs) built over U-Net architectures at both generator and discriminator levels and trained under CutMix transformations. A change prior is used to guide the learning process of the neural network framework and to reduce the impact of changed locations over the learned model. The change prior is derived in an unsupervised manner from comparisons between the postevent locations and k nearest neighbor (kNN) locations determined in the preevent image. The experiments were conducted over several pairs of heterogeneous remote sensing images, and the comparisons with current state-of-the-art approaches show the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal change detection framework.

AB  - Communication using acoustic signals from underwater sensors to the surface is not always well received. Missing messages can occur for various reasons. Based on the oceanographic phenomenon, this can occur due to changes in the speed of sound propagation at different depths in the water, or due to underwater currents that cause signal attenuation or scattering. Judging from other natural phenomena, communication failures can be caused by noise that interferes the receiving system near the water surface. For this reason, in this study, underwater acoustic noise measurements will be carried out start a certain point in Indonesian waters. The result will determine the characteristics of noise near the water surface, which can affect underwater communication systems. The noise measured, will distinguish based on environmental conditions such as rain, wind and others that result in certain sea state conditions at sea level. The research was conducted using a surface buoy which has been installed with data recording devices from two hydrophones facing up and down. Measurements were carried out continuously for 6 days with data recording every 5 minutes interval. To determine the real time weather conditions at the research location, rainfall prediction data obtained from GSMaP (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) satellite data were used. Hydrophone data analysis was carried out by applying the Fast Fourier Transform spectrum analysis method and correlated to the weather conditions at that time. The analysis is grouped into 3 parts, namely when the weather conditions are sunny, light and moderate rain.

CL  - Chiangrai, THAILAND
AB  - The Jorf Lasfar region, the subject of this study, is characterized by an establishment near its port, OCP factories, thermal power stations, hydrocarbon storage units, and numerous establishments specific to the chemical agro-food sector likely to emit atmospheric aerosols. To highlight the state of the air, this region is only equipped with approximately ten permanent ground measurement stations. Consequently, air quality monitoring has become necessary for assessing and monitoring the impact of air pollution on the population's health. Unfortunately, insufficient ground-based air pollutant measurement stations have generated accurate microparticle concentration maps at a fine scale. Therefore, to compensate for the lack of measuring stations, we resorted to satellite remote sensing by exploiting the relationship between the air quality measurements provided by existing measuring stations and satellite images. Given the correlation between aerosol rates measured in situ and data extracted from Landsat satellite images, maps derived from atmospheric scattering and surface temperature have enabled the extraction of a certain amount of helpful information better to understand atmospheric pollution in the Jorf Lasfar region. An analysis of these maps showed that the most significant correlation, in particular, was between aerosols in suspension and land surface temperature (LST), as deduced from the thermal infrared band, with a correlation coefficient R of 0.79. Another correlation with atmospheric scattering calculated using the atmospheric correction of the satellite image by the FLAASH algorithm is also noteworthy but is relatively less significant than the first. Therefore, maps of atmospheric diffusion and surface temperature derived from the processing and analysis of Landsat satellite images will be considered a new source of information, allowing for a better understanding of the spatial distribution of aerosols, especially in areas where the number of measuring stations is very limited, such as the Jorf Lasfar region.

CL  - Chiangrai, THAILAND
AB  - The forest ecosystem of the Argan grove in the region of El Guerdane, located at the heart of the plain of Souss, has experienced significant natural and anthropogenic pressure in recent decades, leading to observable changes in the landscape of the Argan grove. However, the nature and intensity of these changes remains unclear. This study aimed to draw up an inventory of the dynamics of environmental changes between 1985 and 2017 through the diachronic exploitation of Landsat satellite images. It appears that the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is an appropriate approach to highlight the evolution of this environment. It helped to identify the changes that occurred in 32 years and understand that the extension of the built environment and modern takes place at the expense of the argan tree stands. Thus, the loss of about 40.60% of the Argan forest area in this region during this period has negative impacts on biodiversity, the environment, the economy, and cultural and regional history; therefore, a quick and effective intervention could be a positive action for the sustainable development of this unique forest area.

TI  - Impact of Urbanization on Urban Heat Island Intensity in Major Districts of Bangladesh Using Remote Sensing and Geo-Spatial Tools
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is closely associated with land use land cover (LULC) changes that correspond to land surface temperature (LST) variation and urban heat island (UHI) intensity. Major districts of Bangladesh have a large population base and commonly lack the resources to manage fast urbanization effects, so any rise in urban temperature influences the population both directly and indirectly. However, little is known about the impact of rapid urbanization on UHI intensity variations during the winter dry period in the major districts of Bangladesh. To this end, we aim to quantify spatiotemporal associations of UHI intensity during the winter period between 2000 and 2019 using remote-sensing and geo-spatial tools. Landsat-8 and Landsat-5 imageries of these major districts during the dry winter period from 2000 to 2020 were used for this purpose, with overall precision varying from 81% to 93%. The results of LULC classification and LST estimation showed the existence of multiple UHIs in all major districts, which showed upward trends, except for the Rajshahi and Rangpur districts. A substantial increase in urban expansion was observed in Barisal > 32%, Mymensingh > 18%, Dhaka > 17%, Chattogram > 14%, and Rangpur > 13%, while a significant decrease in built-up areas was noticed in Sylhet < -1.45% and Rajshahi < -3.72%. We found that large districts have greater UHIs than small districts. High UHI intensities were observed in Mymensingh > 10 degrees C, Chattogram > 9 degrees C, and Barisal > 8 degrees C compared to other districts due to dense population and unplanned urbanization. We identified higher LST (hotspots) zones in all districts to be increased with the urban expansion and bare land. The suburbanized strategy should prioritize the restraint of the high intensity of UHIs. A heterogeneous increase in UHI intensity over all seven districts was found, which might have potential implications for regional climate change. Our study findings will enable policymakers to reduce UHI and the climate change effect in the concerned districts.

TI  - Spectral Reflectance-Based Mangrove Species Mapping from WorldView-2 Imagery of Karimunjawa and Kemujan Island, Central Java Province, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove mapping at the species level enables the creation of a detailed inventory of mangrove forest biodiversity and supports coastal ecosystem management. The Karimunjawa National Park in Central Java Province is one of Indonesia's mangrove habitats with high biodiversity, namely, 44 species representing 25 true mangroves and 19 mangrove associates. This study aims to (1) classify and group mangrove species by their spectral reflectance characteristics, (2) map mangrove species by applying their spectral reflectance to WorldView-2 satellite imagery with the spectral angle mapper (SAM), spectral information divergence (SID), and spectral feature fitting (SFF) algorithms, and (3) assess the accuracy of the produced mangrove species mapping of the Karimunjawa and Kemujan Islands. The collected field data included (1) mangrove species identification, (2) coordinate locations of targeted mangrove species, and (3) the spectral reflectance of mangrove species measured with a field spectrometer. Dendrogram analysis was conducted with the Ward linkage method to classify mangrove species based on the distance between the closest clusters of spectral reflectance patterns. The dendrogram showed that the 24 mangrove species found in the field could be grouped into four levels. They consisted of two, four, and five species groups for Levels 1 to 3, respectively, and individual species for Level 4. The mapping results indicated that the SID algorithm had the highest overall accuracy (OA) at 49.72%, 22.60%, and 15.20% for Levels 1 to 3, respectively, while SFF produced the most accurate results for individual species mapping (Level 4) with an OA of 5.08%. The results suggest that the greater the number of classes to be mapped, the lower the mapping accuracy. The results can be used to model the spatial distribution of mangrove species or the composition of mangrove forests and update databases related to coastal management.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that has attracted a lot of attention in recent times, especially, after PokemonGo and quite recently with the gaining popularity of metaverse. AR is not a new technology but its development to maturity has always been dependent on many other technologies like computer vision, mobile processing, optics, etc. We are at that stage in the development cycle of AR where all other technologies not only support but can benefit from its use. This research presents one such innovation in the domain of education - for school children or enthusiasts about geospatial technologies such as remote sensing. In this paper, we have discussed the idea, methodology, and demonstration of one such application which establishes a future trend for use of AR in the education of Geospatial Technology. Different types of remote sensing data, their acquisition method, satellite technology, and applications area are explained using AR for a more interactive experience. Learning about geospatial technology will be helpful as the new frontier of Geo-information is enhancing everyone's day-to-day life and will help in boosting interest in this field.

AB  - Over the years, due to the enrichment of paired-label datasets, supervised machine learning has become an important part of any problem-solving process. Active Learning gains importance when, given a large amount of freely available data, there's a lack of expert's manual labels. This paper proposes an active learning algorithm for selective choice of training samples in remote sensing image scene classification. Here, the classifier ranks the unlabeled pixels based on predefined heuristics and automatically selects those that are considered the most valuable for improvement; the expert then manually labels the selected pixels and the process is repeated. The system builds the optimal set of samples from a small and non-optimal training set, achieving a predefined classification accuracy. The experimental findings demonstrate that by adopting the proposed methodology, 0.02% of total training samples are required for Sentinel-2 Image Scene Classification while still reaching the same level of accuracy reached by complete training data sets. The advantages of the proposed method is highlighted by a comparison with the state-of-the-art active learning method named entropy sampling.

CL  - Seoul, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - Ocean SAR scenes classification is a challenging task under the SAR image classification domain. The main problem is the wrong classification of similar SAR images, primarily due to speckle presence. This study proposes a deep learning model developed from scratch to automatically classify oceanic and atmospheric phenomena from Sentinel-1 SAR wave mode (WV) vignettes. The proposed preprocessing technique reduces the speckle and can improve the minor features for discriminating the SAR images. We have experimented using a publicly available hand-curated dataset that describes ten ordinarily occurring atmospheric or oceanic processes. The experimental results indicate that our proposed deep learning model with preprocessing technique has good classification performance.

TI  - Crop Prediction Based on Characteristics of the Agricultural Environment Using Various Feature Selection Techniques and Classifiers
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is a growing field of research. In particular, crop prediction in agriculture is critical and is chiefly contingent upon soil and environment conditions, including rainfall, humidity, and temperature. In the past, farmers were able to decide on the crop to be cultivated, monitor its growth, and determine when it could be harvested. Today, however, rapid changes in environmental conditions have made it difficult for the farming community to continue to do so. Consequently, in recent years, machine learning techniques have taken over the task of prediction, and this work has used several of these to determine crop yield. To ensure that a given machine learning (ML) model works at a high level of precision, it is imperative to employ efficient feature selection methods to preprocess the raw data into an easily computable Machine Learning friendly dataset. To reduce redundancies and make the ML model more accurate, only data features that have a significant degree of relevance in determining the final output of the model must be employed. Thus, optimal feature selection arises to ensure that only the most relevant features are accepted as a part of the model. Conglomerating every single feature from raw data without checking for their role in the process of making the model will unnecessarily complicate our model. Furthermore, additional features which contribute little to the ML model will increase its time and space complexity and affect the accuracy of the model's output. The results depict that an ensemble technique offers better prediction accuracy than the existing classification technique.

TI  - Yield and Quality Prediction of Winter Rapeseed-Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest Models
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the greatest agricultural challenges, yield prediction is an important issue for producers, stakeholders, and the global trade market. Most of the variation in yield is attributed to environmental factors such as climate conditions, soil type and cultivation practices. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and random forest regression (RFR) are machine learning tools that are used unambiguously for crop yield prediction. There is limited research regarding the application of these mathematical models for the prediction of rapeseed yield and quality. A four-year study (2015-2018) was carried out in the Republic of Serbia with 40 winter rapeseed genotypes. The field trial was designed as a randomized complete block design in three replications. ANN, based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno iterative algorithm, and RFR models were used for prediction of seed yield, oil and protein yield, oil and protein content, and 1000 seed weight, based on the year of production and genotype. The best production year for rapeseed cultivation was 2016, when the highest seed and oil yield were achieved, 2994 kg/ha and 1402 kg/ha, respectively. The RFR model showed better prediction capabilities compared to the ANN model (the r(2) values for prediction of output variables were 0.944, 0.935, 0.912, 0.886, 0.936 and 0.900, for oil and protein content, seed yield, 1000 seed weight, oil and protein yield, respectively).

M3  - Article
AB  - The article investigates the problem of the ambiguous influence of modem information technologies on education. The authors analyse not only the positive effects of computerisation. They also identify the problems faced by the subjects of the educational process under the influence of digitalisation. As outlined in the article, uncontrolled information flows prevent students from forming the holistic worldview. The dominance of information technologies in education also leads to the transformation of subject-object relations in the process of cognition. The teacher, whose role is changed significantly, acts more frequently as a coordinator. The usage of gadgets in the educational process provides an opportunity to receive an education at a distance. However, the widespread use of distance learning technologies leads to a decline in the quality of educational services. This resulted from the need to develop new methods. In addition, the constant updating of information technologies does not allow the teacher to develop a sustainable methodology for teaching their subject. The authors prove that the active use of digital technologies in the information society implies the harmonious combination of traditional and modem information technologies. This fully applies to the modern Russian education system, which is in an intermediate state between traditional pedagogical methods and modern computer technologies. As the authors point out, the problem is to find the optimal educational option for the formation of a harmonious global-regional educational system. It should not only include all the advantages of the latest information technologies, but also preserve all the positive achievements of great practitioner-teachers and scientists.

AB  - The timeliness of using modern computer programs for modelling flood zones, the consequences of hydraulic accidents, dam breakthroughs, flood and flood forecasting in a complex system of rivers and channels for the prevention of hydro meteorological emergencies is beyond doubt. The use of BIM technologies will make it possible to move from point-based flood risk assessments to areal ones, which will significantly improve the reliability of planned measures to prevent natural and anthropogenic emergencies.The purpose - to perform works on modelling of hydrodynamic accident and forecast of its development by the example of tailings dumps in concentration plant in East Kazakhstan. As the initial data - digital model for the area of work, technical reports on engineering-hydrographical survey, topographic-geodetic works, engineering-geological survey, high-resolution satellite images in a panchromatic survey mode. On the basis of geoinformation modelling methods with use of initial and remote sensing data, final digital terrain model was built in Digital software. The method based on direct hydrodynamic modelling of area flooding was used to calculate hydrodynamic accidents, to model the dynamics of area flooding because of tailings dam break in several levels. The practical result is numerical hydrodynamic modelling of dynamics flooding area because of partial destruction, erosion of embankment dam of tailings concentrator, total area and extent of flooding, as well as the area and depth of partially flooded buildings of residential development was estimated, thematic maps of flooded area were created, as well as maps of water passage with flow velocities during the hydrodynamic accident.Thus, the application of advanced space imagery, GIS technologies in full measure allow for simulating the occurrence, development of hydrodynamic accidents in structures, to determine area, time of flooding.

AB  - Over the past decade, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has demonstrated its potentials in disaster mapping and management activities. In Assam, located at North-eastern part of India, the month of June-August receive usually heavy rainfall and results in large scale flooding and related damage. The reliable mapping of flood events using remote sensing technology will enable fast disaster management strategies. In this study, we make use of the freely available sentinel -1A pre- and post- flood datasets (2 scenes each), which enables cloud free and weather independent imaging capability. A multi-date imagery acquired before and during the flood event was used along with a change detection and data adaptive thresholding approach to estimate the extent of flood event. The approach is validated using the image acquired over upper Brahmaputra River in Assam state during the flood event on 07 June 2021. Further, the area of different Land use/Land cover affected by the flood event was analyzed. It is observed that around 13477.12 ha of agricultural land were inundated.

AB  - Through the textbook case of the dodo, bird native to Mauritius discovered at the very end of the 16th century by Dutch colonialists and whose species was totally eradicated by the end of the next century, an entire visual discourse, both scientific and popular was built a posteriori during the 19th century, as the first environmental concerns were expressed notably in British society. Other species of birds unfortunately succeeded to this role of sentinel that had been played by the dodo, for example the passenger pigeon whose billions of individuals were decimated in record time on the North American soil. Heir to this iconography, in 2013 the Canadian photographer Sara Angelucci wrote a new stage in this iconography of extinction, borrowing the canons in order to replay them in a critical way, in light of the Anthropocene era and in the midst of the sixth extinction of the mass of the living.

AB  - The Holocaust tragedy and the objective coverage of the events in Nazi-occupied Kyiv in 1941-1943 from Stalin's time to the final stage of perestroika were excluded from the Soviet historical narrative. Certain groups of Soviet intellectuals, Jewish and Ukrainian activists alone fought for the preservation of historical memory in spite of the actions of the totalitarian system in the USSR. Soviet model of historical memory was ideological and, thus, based on three worldview constructs. The first concept is the idea of the existence of the so-called "United Soviet People". The second one is embodied within the policy of the Soviet Union in the Middle East, where the Soviet Union took an anti-Israel position. The third one is the policy of state anti-Semitism, which was a part of the official policy from the Stalin era till the collapse of the Soviet Union.The last days of Stalin's regime were characterized by the overt anti-Semitic campaigns in the USSR. The acquired dynamics of Stalin's state anti-Semitism never lost its relevance both either during the thaw and during the command-and-control "standstill" period. These facts became known when archival documents became known to the broad scientific community. Furthermore, along with the Holocaust victims, the names of many thousands of sons and daughters of the Jewish people who fought heroically against Nazism during World War II were restored.The analysis of various historical sources allows the authors to build a complete picture of the attitude of the Soviet party and law enforcement agencies to falsification of the memory of Stalins repressions and the Genocide in Ukraine, the victims of which were representatives of different nationalities. Falsified versions of the Soviet history were actively supported by some representatives of academic and university history. Even the monument to the victims of Nazism was opened under the pressure from the world community in Kyiv in the summer of 1976, but it did not convey the meaning of the Kyiv tragedy that took place during the Nazi occupation. The team of the Ukrainian authors, under the leadership of People's Artist M Lysenko. who won the competition for the monument in Babyn Yar; was constantly pressured by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. Only after the proclamation of Ukraine's independence in 1991, it became possible to conduct various scientific studies regarding the history of the Holocaust. The Tragedy of Babyn Yar and the life of Ukrainian Righteous People has become a part of the modern Ukrainian narrative and modern Ukrainian memory. The proposed article, which is built on the principles of historicism and objectivity, is a part of a modern historical discourse on memory studies.

AB  - Ground deformation related to tunnel construction results from the change in effective stress of the underlying soil, posing threats to buildings, underground facilities, and people's safety. Thus, monitoring and predicting ground deformation are crucial to prevent the risk and mitigate damage from such a hazard. This study applied the Sentinel-1 Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technique for long-term remote monitoring of tunneling-induced ground deformation. The Gompertz function model is fitted to the PS-InSAR results and used to predict the behavior of ground subsidence. The maximum subsidence along the radar line-of-sight (LOS) estimated throughout the monitoring period from September 2016 to August 2020 in Guri, Republic of Korea, exceeds 50 mm, whereas the LOS mean displacement velocity reaches -15 mm/yr. Overall, the modeled results using the Gompertz function show excellent agreement with the PS-InSAR displacement estimates.

T2  - POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable urbanization under sustainable development goals requires quantitative information on urban landscape. Despite having the fastest growth of urban area and poor air quality, Faridabad, a constituent district of National Capital Region, fails to gain much research attention. Present study based on multi-temporal; freely available satellite image has indicated 3% increase in the built-up against 2% decrease arable land from 2008 to 2018. Further, spatial metrics (Shanon's entropy, class area (CA), number of patches (NP), largest patch index (LPI)) has indicated scattered development of built-up. Increase CA (11470 ha in 2008 and 13806 ha in 2018) and NP (221 in 2008 and 476 in 2018) have indicated isolated development of built-up with small area coverage. Increase in LPI (12.5% in 2008 and 13.5% in 2018) of built up indicated compact growth of dense built-up in the southern and eastern side leading to the vertical expansion of the city area. Linear expansion of the residential builtup, industrial, and commercial area along the highways, roads and railways and vehicular emission has contributed to the high aerosol concentration. While, in the rural region the high aerosol loading has also been observed because of the extensive use of fertilizer and stubble burning. Present research on land-use land cover changes and its impact on air quality could be contributed significantly in urban policy making for climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

TI  - Lithological mapping for complex geological formations with mixed classifiers using Landsat 8 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithological studies and geological unit mappings are generally applicable to many fields of natural resource management. Relatively suitable aquifers have been formed in complex formations in northwest Shahrood due to the presence of carbonate rocks as well as erosion and tectonic forces in the region. This study aims to identify and separate the calcareous formations that can form karst aquifers in the study area. As a result of erosion and tectonic forces, the rocks of the region exhibit spectral fluctuations, making it difficult for mapping geological formations using multispectral images. Therefore, Landsat 8 satellite-based images were processed by adopting the minimum noise fraction (MNF), independent component analysis (ICA), and band ratio (BR). The indices of calcareous formations and shale formations were created by the BR through the spectral behavior of pure pixels. Moreover, the support vector machine (SVM) and maximum likelihood (ML) were employed for classification. The SVM classifier proved more capable of classification than the ML classifier, and the transform ICA outperformed the MNF in the separation of formations. The lithological maps were extracted using the SVM with an overall accuracy (OA) of 68.04%. Furthermore, a method decision tree (DT) was employed to improve the classification accuracy. The DT classifier was then utilized to reclassify lithological maps that were classified by SVM and ML through morphological characteristics and indices of formations The DT classifier improved the lithological map accuracy by 10%. The boundaries of calcareous formations were extracted from non-calcareous formations with an accuracy of 93%, and the regional constructions were separated with an accuracy of similar to 80%. Finally, the lithological map was developed with a kappa of 0.734 and an OA of 78.59%. (C) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present three algorithms for aerosol parameters retrieval from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument measurements in the O-2 A-band. These algorithms use neural networks 1) to emulate the radiative transfer model and a Bayesian approach to solve the inverse problem, 2) to learn the inverse model from the synthetic radiances, and 3) to learn the inverse model from the principal-component transform of synthetic radiances. The training process is based on full-physics radiative transfer simulations. The accuracy and efficiency of the neural network based retrieval algorithms are analyzed with synthetic and real data.

TI  - Soil Moisture Drydown Detection Is Hindered by Model-Based Rescaling
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rate at which soils dry out after heavy rain has huge impact on the climate. It is important that these drying rates, known as soil moisture (SM) drydowns, are well represented in climate simulations. Satellite data allow us to study these events globally. Although there are many individual satellite sensors we can use, their data have gaps, both spatially and temporally. Merged products, such as the ones from the European Space Agency, collate data from these sensors to create datasets that are as complete as possible. However, we find that the merging algorithms used to create such products can hinder the detection of drydowns events calling for caution when using such datasets. The smaller SM dynamic range imposed on this combined dataset during its creation hinders drydown detection when using methods based solely on SM dynamics. Although fewer drying events are detected, the drydown time scales are mostly unchanged. Detection methods using external precipitation products are less affected by this rescaling, and however, we detect far fewer events and drydown time scales tend to be longer than when using SM-based methods.

AB  - This research addresses the use of machine learning for down scaling pollution information from multiple satellite sources. The proposed solution uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation architecture (U-Net [1]) to perform a resolution enhancement task. Readings obtained by spatially sparse ground stations are used as the ground truth to guide the task. A custom implementation of this solution won the AI4EO Air Quality & Health challenge [2] initiated in 2021 by the European Space Agency (ESA) [3], on a need expressed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) [4] and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) [5]. In that successful case, the algorithm was trained and tested on volatile particulate matter (PM2.5, from Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2, from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI) data over three Areas of Interest: Northern Italy, California and South Africa.

TI  - Coastline change and coastal islands development in the Feni estuary of Bangladesh through RS and GIS
T2  - AIMS GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal areas, to take any development plan, it is important to determine the stability of the coast and coastal islands. Therefore, the present research took an initiative to illustrate the development of coastal islands in the Feni estuary of Bangladesh through Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. Multi-dated Landsat images of 1978, 1989, 2014 and 2020 were used in the study. The research reveals that in 1978, 1989, 2014 and 2020, the total area of various islands in the estuary was 377, 650, 894 and 1063 km2, respectively. The islands show cyclical growth and erosion, but their main components have existed for decades. During the period from 1978 to 1989, 1989 to 2014 and 2014 to 2020 about 330, 386 and 379 km2 of new land added to the existing land mass and about 57, 142 and 210 km2 of existing land eroded, respectively. Finally, from 1978 to 2020, the size of the islands increased by about 14.64 km2 yr-1. During the same period about 110 and 40 km2 lands along the coastline were eroded and accreted, in the north-western and eastern parts of the estuary, respectively. The study further reveals that the islands of the estuary have developed over the past few decades, except Sandwip. Finally, the outputs of this study will be helpful for policy makers and planners for sustainable estuary management.

TI  - JAKOB VON UEXKULL'S OPPOSITION TO DARWIN
T2  - S&F-SCIENZAEFILOSOFIA IT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Estonian biologist Jakob von Uexkull is considered an important precursor of environmental ecology and a forerunner of zoosemiotics. He was at the centre of German scientific and philosophical debate in the early 20th century for his << theoretical biology >> and his theory of << subjective environments >>. His positions were radically opposed to Darwinian evolutionary theory; however, his arguments often appear flawed by profound misunderstandings, interpretative distortions and confusion between the positions of Darwin's supporters. Added to this is the strong prejudice against a revolutionary worldview regarded as a new religion.

TI  - Female Representation in Online Advertisements: A Feminist Stylistic Analysis of Beauty Products Advertised on Instagram
T2  - JURNAL KOMUNIKASI-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An advertisement is a promotional strategy to introduce a product, brand, or service to a targeted viewership; with the intent to pique their attention, encourage interaction, and ultimately, attract sales. Containing pictures, words and graphics that are familiar and present in the targeted group's realities, advertisements, in addition to financial gains, it also greatly reflects and influences the socio-cultural construct and worldview of a community. In advertising operations carried out particularly via social media platforms, the use of language to manipulate gender depiction as an advertising strategy is recurrently observed. On this premise, this qualitative study looked into the language used in Malay advertisements for beauty products available on Instagram, a social media application. The feminist stylistic framework (Mill, 1998) served as the foundation for the textual analysis approach used to examine 150 Instagram adverts for Malay beauty goods. The stylistic features in particular were evaluated based on Verdonk (2002)'s framework, with a focus on the use of language in depicting women and the role of the language in shaping the depiction. The results demonstrated that the stylistic features utilised in Malay beauty products advertisements contained characteristics that are stereotypically assigned to women. The extensive effect of patriarchy, stereotypes, and woman sexualisation as a marketing tactic is also evident in the seller's language use. This study aims to offer evidence-based justifications for changes to be made to the existing social media advertising practice, especially in terms of language appropriateness and ethics.

TI  - UnDIP: Hyperspectral Unmixing Using Deep Image Prior
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we introduce a deep learning-based technique for the linear hyperspectral unmixing problem. The proposed method contains two main steps. First, the endmembers are extracted using a geometric endmember extraction method, i.e., a simplex volume maximization in the subspace of the data set. Then, the abundances are estimated using a deep image prior. The main motivation of this work is to boost the abundance estimation and make the unmixing problem robust to noise. The proposed deep image prior uses a convolutional neural network to estimate the fractional abundances, relying on the extracted endmembers and the observed hyperspectral data set. The proposed method is evaluated on simulated and three real remote sensing data for a range of SNR values (i.e., from 20 to 50 dB). The results show considerable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method was implemented in Python (3.8) using PyTorch as the platform for the deep network and is available online: https://github.com/BehnoodRasti/UnDIP.

M3  - Data study
AB  - The spatio-temporal data contain annual phytoplankton bloom phenology from 2000 to 2016 on 580 lakes located in the province of Quebec, Canada, between 44 and 50°N and 67 and 80°W. The data include height phenological variables related to phytoplankton blooms, and 17 physiographical, morphological, and climatic descriptors of the lake and the watershed. For each studied year, phenological variables were established as follows: (1) the frequency (the number of days when Chl-a concentrations remained above the threshold), (2) the intensity (the maximum concentration of Chl-a detected during a bloom), (3) the relative area (the maximum area occupied by a bloom normalized by the lake area), (4) the onset date and (5) the end date (respectively, the first and last day of the year when a bloom was detected), and (6) the duration (the number of days between the onset date and the end date). Remote sensing determination of the end date and duration of blooms is challenging because the studied region is frequently covered by clouds during the fall, significantly reducing the number of MODIS images available for this period. This is especially true during the month of October, for which there was on average half as many MODIS images without full cloud cover than between May and September. The variables describe what can be considered as an annual-based phenology, compiling days with less than 25% cloud cover and for which remotely sensed Chl-a was above the established threshold, for any given pixel.A geo-referenced database of 17 morphological, physiographic, and climatic characteristics of the watershed of each studied lake was established. The boundaries and morphological descriptors of the watersheds (area, slope) were calculated from the Canadian Digital Elevation Model  with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 m. Climate data were calculated from North American Regional Reanalyses with a spatial resolution of approximately 32 km. The cumulative degree-days (°C day) was calculated by summing the recorded degrees (°C) each day above 20°C, considered as a threshold for cyanobacterial growth. Even though the remote sensing approach used here is not specific to cyanobacterial biomass, this climate proxy is considered valid since algal growth in general is stimulated by warm waters. Land use data (at 40 m spatial resolution) as well as agricultural and ecumene data (at 25 m spatial resolution) were provided by Natural Resources Canada. The environmental indicators were considered stationary over the period 2000-2016. THIS DATASET IS ARCHIVED AT DANS/EASY, BUT NOT ACCESSIBLE HERE.

AB  - For the future development of cultural technology, access to the cultural foundations of these culture carriers is necessary. One relevant aspect of this cultural foundation is the distinction between non-living things and living systems. Culture can be preserved, transported, and adapted by non-living things and living systems. Cultural development is only possible through living systems (e.g., humans). Non-living things (e.g., books, fossils, paintings, sculptures) are for preserving, archiving, and displaying the past. First, I present and discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the mechanistic worldview. Second, I give an overview of the ways to define non-living things and life forms. Third, I argue that our mechanistic worldview and the way we grasp the truth is limited by our way of thinking to deal with non-living things only. To resolve the main challenges, we must change our thinking and our acting in the world. Finally, I provide two primary sources of inspiration for this new way of thinking . the Asian way and the way of Indigenous people.

AB  - Rispana is an evolving river basin. The river has passed its youthful landform development stage and entered " maturity". Over the years, the river's flow has reduced due to various reasons. Despite the reduced flow, the region's physical landscape is vulnerable to soil erosion and floods. With the current trend of urban expansion and resource use, the area will face a severe shortage of freshwater. This work uses a combination of geomorphic markers to quantify the drainage basin and trace the changes. The morphometric parameters suggest the reducing influence of geological structure and the increasing control of climate and anthropogenic factors on the river's flow. Additionally, the circulatory ratio highlights that despite the region being vulnerable to floods, it is less prone to flash floods, and flood management would be easier. Using a combination of LANDSAT and ALOS-PALSAR datasets, it was also determined that the river intends to shift its meanders.

TI  - Radioguided parathyroid surgery with <SUP>18</SUP>FCH. Myth or reality
T2  - REVISTA ORL
M3  - Review
AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the main cause of hypercalcemia in non-hospitalized patients, being caused in 85-90% of cases by a solitary adenoma. Radioguided parathyroid surgery (RGPS), as a GOSTT (Guided intraOperative Scintigraphic Tumor Targeting) technique, uses SPECT-TC with Tc-99m-MIBI as the technique of choice. PET-TC with 18F-Choline ((FCH)-F-18) can be used in patients with negative Tc-99m-MIBI, obtaining sensitivities close to 95%. The use of (FCH)-F-18 in CRGP is very complex, recommending the use of other tracers such as Tc-99m-Macroaggregates (Tc-99m-MAA) or Iodine-125 seeds (I-125-Seed). RGPS reduces surgical time, hospital costs and patient morbidity, with high effectiveness and efficiency.

TI  - <i>Allas</i> and<i> weilawei:</i> Interjections in Some of Chaucer's<i> Canterbury</i><i> Tales</i> (Fragment III: Wife of Bath, the Friar, the Summoner)
T2  - ACADEMIC JOURNAL OF MODERN PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate Chaucer's use of interjections in Fragment III of the Canterbury Tales, which comprises "The Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale", "The Friar's Prologue and Tale", and "The Summoner's Prologue and Tale". We discuss the problem of how to distinguish interjections from other word classes, and we distinguish primary interjections such as allas, buf, ey, fy, hayt, lo, weilawei and secondary interjections, such as hayl, look, now, peace, welcome, why. As a third group we also take corroborative phrases such as by God into consideration. We look at the frequency of the various interjections: Now, lo, nay as well as a, by God, and pardee are frequent and occur in all the tales of Fragment III; on the other end of the frequency scale there are buf, which is a hapax legomenon, and the rarely attested hayt. We describe the interjectional spectrum used in Fragment III based on their functions. Interjections can, for example, serve as indicators of emotions (allas, weilawei), as corroboratives (by God) and expletives (a devel weye), as discourse markers (now thanne), as response forms (nay, ye, yis), as polite speech act formulae (grant mercy, no fors), etc. The paper further offers an analysis of the phonology, morphology, verse meter and stress pattern. As can be said of the Middle English vocabulary more generally, the etymology of the interjections is mixed: some go back to Old English, especially weilawei, but many were borrowed from French (or ultimately from Latin), e.g., allas, ey, fy, pardee. Chaucer's characters often use not just one, but two or three interjections in combination, e.g., Allas! and weylawey! or allas nay, nay, mainly probably for additional emphasis. We suggest that that the interjectional spectrum in Fragment III (1) expands on Biber et al's. (1999) inserts and Culpeper & Kyto's (2010) pragmatic noise; (2) undergoes change like words; and is indexical (3) of a multi-lingual social context (4) and of oral and conventions.

AB  - Multi-temporal remotely sensed data are a precious source of information for high spatial and temporal resolution flood mapping. We present a methodology for flood mapping through processing of long time series of Sentinel-1 SAR data, as well as ancillary information. A Bayesian framework is adopted to derive probabilistic maps of the presence of flood waters, through modeling of backscatter time series, based on the assumption that floods represent impulsive temporal anomalies. We illustrate some results on a time series of Sentinel-1 data acquired from 2015 to 2021 over a test area on the Basento river watershed, Basilicata Region, in Southern Italy, recurrently subject to floods.

AB  - We observe relatively high InSAR mean coherence levels over badlands, i.e. clayey bare soil areas, on a test site in the Basilicata region, in southern Italy. Time series of InSAR coherences on cascaded short-baseline image pairs, obtained from stacks of Sentinel-1 SAR images, exhibit oscillating behaviour, with significant correlation with cumulated rainfall levels on badland areas, while on other areas with crops or spontaneous vegetation the correlation is lower, and a seasonal trend is instead statistically significant. These observations seem to point to the possibility of investigating erosion phenomena over badland areas through InSAR time series, which involves a significant step forward, in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, with respect to traditional measurements which require repeated topographic surveys at long intervals, or sparse in-field point measurements.

TI  - Influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections among children under five years old in Morocco, September 2017 to March 2019.
T2  - Le infezioni in medicina
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The main aim of this research is to investigate the trend of influenza infection among children under 5 years with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) as well as those who suffer from a high burden of disease. This research is based on a survey conducted from September 2017 to March 2019. During this period nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in a group of 942 children under 5 years with SARI, admitted in pediatric services of 8 sentinel hospitals. The virological surveillance of influenza was carried out at the National influenza Center, located in the National Institute of Hygiene, using a Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRt-PCR) monoplex assay developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA). The median age of participants was 11 months, and 40% of them were female. A total of 112 samples were reported positive yielding a frequency of 11.88% (112/942). Among all the influenza confirmed cases, 68.75% (77/112), 15.17% (17/112), 16.04% (18/112) were subtyped as influenza AH1N1pdm09, AH3N2 and influenza B respectively. Meanwhile, the proportion of patients admitted at the intensive care unit was 5,35% (6/112). Out of which 83.33% (5/6) were AH1N1pdm09 and it was reported that just 1.78% (2/112) of the positive cases were vaccinated. The study confirms that influenza affects greatly children with SARI. Thus, the need for influenza vaccines is highly recommended for children under 5 years. Moreover, our findings highlight that influenza virus is not the only cause of SARI among this group of children. Accordingly, special attention should be paid to the non-flu respiratory viruses.

TI  - Land-Use/Land Cover Changes Contribute to Land Surface Temperature: A Case Study of the Upper Indus Basin of Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use/land cover (LULC) changes have an impact on land surface temperature (LST) at the local, regional, and global scales. To simulate the LULC and LST changes of the environmentally important area of northern Pakistan, this research focused on spatio-temporal LULC and associated LST changes since 1987 and made predictions to 2047. We classified LULC from Landsat TM and ETM data, using the maximum probability supervised categorization approach. LST was retrieved using the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) methodology. Furthermore, we simulated LULC using the integrated approaches of Cellular Automata (CA) and Weighted Evidence (WE) and used a regression model to predict LST. The built-up areas and vegetation have increased by 2.1% and 11% due to a decline in the barren land by -8.5% during the last 30 years. The LULC is expected to increase, particularly the built-up and vegetation classes by 2.74% and 13.66%, respectively, and the barren land would decline by -4.2% by 2047. Consequently, the higher LST classes (i.e., 27 degrees C to <30 degrees C and >= 30 degrees C) soared up by about 25.18% and 34.26%, respectively, during the study period, which would further expand to 30.19% and 14.97% by 2047. The lower LST class (i.e., 12 degrees C to <21 degrees C) indicated a downtrend of about -41.29% and would further decrease to -3.13% in the next 30 years. The study findings are useful for planning and management, especially for climatologists, land-use planners, and researchers in sustainable land use with rapid urbanization.

AB  - Satellite radar altimetry technology is used to monitor oceans and inland waters. However, inland monitoring is still in the development phase. New technologies and advanced algorithms are introduced to improve data accuracies at broader scales. Today's challenge is to ascertain altimetry usefulness at least at a regional level. This study compares satellite radar altimetry-derived inland water heights with in-situ data in Pakistan. Tarbela reservoir (mountainous region) and Guddu barrage (flat topography) on Pakistan's Indus River were selected, having extended altimetry and in-situ data time series. Gauge measurements from irrigation departments were acquired to evaluate altimetry products from the multi-satellite mission Database for Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters (DAHITI). DAHITI includes data from satellites Jason 2 and 3 at Tarbela, Envisat, Saral, and Sentinel 3A at downstream Guddu barrage. The evaluation periods are 2013-2020 for Tarbela reservoir and 2002-2020 for Guddu barrage, depending on the common availability of datasets. Statistically higher correlations were found for both cases ranging from 0.98 to 0.88 except for one dataset (R= 0.45 for Saral at Guddu). The root-mean-square error (RMSE) between in-situ and altimetry datasets at the Tarbela reservoir was much higher (340 to 531 cm) than the submeter errors (22-32 cm) at the Guddu barrage (Saral at Guddu gave a higher RMSE of 118 cm). Differences in satellite missions, data acquisition times, reference geoids, data processing methods, and topography may be the possible causes of these errors. While a more detailed investigation is required considering the inconsistencies of the datasets and the study sites (river vs. reservoir), it can be concluded that accuracies of altimetry derived Indus River water levels are better in flat areas than in the mountainous regions.

AB  - In this paper aims we seek to analyze the discursive construction of religious formulas used by benzedeiros and benzedeiras. Also intend to verify the organization of this discourse, as well as its relationship with exteriority. Thus, the theoretical and methodological foundations of the research involve the approach of French Discourse Analysis. The constitution of the corpus comprised written texts (prayers) used by a healer, resident of the city of Rubiataba (GO), located in the center-north of the state. We found that, from the blessings, specialists insert beliefs, thoughts and values in the population that believes. Thus, religious formulas aren't only curative resource to combat diseases, but they are also elements that are linked to community worldview.

TI  - GIS-based machine learning algorithms for mapping beach placer deposits in the southwest coast of India using Landsat-8 OLI images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beach placer deposits are economically enriched with Fe-Ti oxide, Zr, and rare earth minerals such as garnet, rutile, zircon, monazite, ilmenite, and sillimanite. Landsat 8-OLI image provides the distinct spectral signature of placer deposits in its multispectral bands that can be used as a key source for mapping placer mineral deposits. GIS-based machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are used for executing the subpixel-based classification of high-dimensional data products (multispectral images, i.e., Landsat 8-OLI image) based on its spectral signatures for mapping the placer mineral deposits. The Landsat 8-OLI images are executed using the four widely used MLAs such as maximum likelihood classification, random forest classifier (RFC), support vector machine, and artificial neural network for mapping placer mineral deposits in the southwest coastal stretches of Thiruvananthapuram district in the Kerala state of India. The resultant map shows the occurrence of placer deposits with a major concentration of ilmenite. The accuracy assessment reveals that RFC shows better performance for mapping beach minerals with an overall accuracy of 84.4925% and kappa coefficient of 0.8184. Our study proves that the MLAs are the vital tools for mapping the placer mineral deposits in the sandy beaches, and thereby, this approach is being used as a scientific key tool for opening the gateways for beach mineral mapping using multispectral satellite images.

TI  - Can we detect the damage of a heatwave on vineyards using Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data?
T2  - OENO ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change will exacerbate environmental threats, which will, in turn, affect agricultural production patterns. This study addresses the feasibility of using Sentinel-2 (S2) optical remote sensing data to map the consequences of heatwaves on vineyard plots. The proposed method to map damaged and undamaged vineyards is based on the use of an inter-annual (C1) and an intra-annual (C2) criterion derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated on S2 data. While the inter-annual criterion compares the NDVI of the heatwave year to the average NDVI of the previous years with no heatwave, the intra-annual criterion compares the NDVI values before and after the heatwave in the same year. Predictions from either criteria or both combined were tested against two datasets collected during two field surveys performed in 2020 and 2021, with different ways of recording the damage caused on the grapevine by the 2019 heatwave in southeastern France. Results showed that within the reference vineyard plots with heat damage, 46 %, 62 % and 40 % of the S2 pixels were correctly predicted as damaged using C1, C2 and their combination, respectively. Within undamaged plots, 91 %, 88 % and 99 % of the S2 pixels were correctly predicted as undamaged using C1, C2 and the combination, respectively. Results also showed that only severe leaf damage was detected using the S2 NDVI. The combination of C1 and C2 provides the most accurate detection of heatwave consequences on vineyards.

AB  - In order to invert the concentration of chlorophyll a in the water of Wuliangsuhai, based on the remote sensing image data of Sentinel-2 satellite, the data on the concentration of chlorophyll in Wuliangsuhai from the School of Water Conservancy and Civil Engineering of Inner Mongolia Agricultural University were used. The GA-BP neural network is constructed to improve the crossover operator and mutation operator of genetic algorithm by adding new decisions. At the same time, a new strategy is added to avoid the genetic algorithm falling into the local optimal solution. Finally, the inversion effect is compared with that of BP neural network. After BP neural network inversion, the determination coefficient R-2 = 0.876, mean square error MSE = 6.713 and mean absolute error MAE = 1.966 are obtained. GA-BP neural network shows that R-2 = 0.923, mean square error MSE = 4.619, mean absolute error MAE = 1.795. The above results can prove that GA-BP neural network has less error and high inversion accuracy as the model of chlorophyll a inversion in Wuliangsuhai water body.

TI  - Mapping High-Resolution Global Impervious Surface Area: Status and Trends
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface area (ISA) mapping at the global scale has entered a new era. Currently, the number of high-resolution global ISA products is gradually increasing; however, a literature review that systematically investigates these ISA products is still lacking, which limits the application of these products. Thus, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing high-resolution global ISA products, concentrating on the aspects of the data sources, training samples, features, and methods. Moreover, we evaluate these products at multitemporal and multispatial scales, using a series of independent test samples. The results demonstrate that the multitemporal accuracy of the ISA products presents an increasing trend, due to the increase of the available sensors. Among the continuous time-series products [e.g., the updated new global impervious surface area (GISA 2.0), the global impervious surface area (GISA), global annual urban dynamics, global human settlement layer, and global artificial impervious areas], the accuracy of the GISA 2.0 outperforms the others at global, continental, and regional scales. However, the mapping performance of these products in small towns and arid and rural regions needs to be enhanced. In particular, we focus on the spatio-temporal disagreement of the ISA products. We show that the high disagreement regions are predominantly concentrated in eastern Asia, western Europe, and eastern North America. In addition, the high disagreement regions are characterized by low ISA density, high vegetation coverage, and high albedo bare ground coverage. Additionally, this article concludes with some remarks about the future directions of global ISA mapping.

AB  - The Sentinel-3 synthetic aperture radar altimeter provides two kinds of rain flag by using the changes of the three backscatter coefficients, which provides a foundation for the comprehensive use of all the backscatter coefficients to determine rain conditions. This paper analyzes the statistical relationship between the two backscatter coefficients of Ku band SAR mode and PLRM mode and the C band backscatter coefficient when it is not rain, then the deviation generated by the backscatter coefficients of the two bands in the rainfall state is compared, provides a new method for determining rain flag. Finally, the measurement data of precipitation radar and altimeter data are matched and verified, and the result of the new method of updating the threshold judgment condition is more accurate.

TI  - A Locally Optimized Model for Hyperspectral and Multispectral Images Fusion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The maintenance of spectral variability between subclass objects and the relationship between hyperspectral (HS) bands have been a fundamental but challenging problem for fusing low spatial resolution (LR) HS and high spatial resolution (HR) multispectral (MS) images. This article presents a locally optimized image segmentation fusion (LOISF) framework for HS super-resolution reconstruction. First, LR HS and HR MS are clustered and segmented, and the label attributes of the segmented objects are identified by the prior information. Then, a novel joint fusion model for different typical ground objects is constructed based on spectral unmixing. The fusion problem is formulated mathematically as a convex optimization of a Frobenius norm, which includes spatial, spectral, and index constraints, with an alternating-directions & x2019; optimization featuring linearization providing the solution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LOISF preserves both spatial details and texture, achieving high spectral fidelity, and yielding significantly improved image quality compared to other state-of-the-art fusion methods.

TI  - CULTIVATED LAND SEGMENTATION OF REMOTE SENSING IMAGE BASED ON PSPNET OF ATTENTION MECHANISM
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of cultivated land area is an important content to ensure food security, among which the real-time monitoring of cultivated land using remote sensing image is one of the most important means to guarantee the same. Remote sensing image from the Gaofen-2 satellite is often affected by seasonal climate in the process of obtaining the information of topographical features, which makes the colour contrast of the data decrease and leads to classification errors. Therefore, the cultivated land images in spring and winter are taken as the experimental objects so as to address the problems of "the same spectrum foreign matter" between spring cultivated land and vegetation, winter cultivated land and bare soil. Paper contents are as follows: (1) The Pyramid Scene Parsing Network with residual attention mechanism is used to extract cultivated land; and the residual attention mechanism is applied to automatically adjust the weight to enhance the useful features and improve the segmentation effect; (2) to reduce the impact of semantic information loss on edge detail recognition with the deepening of network layer, the method of high-resolution representation of detail features in shallow attention network layer is integrated to optimize the network; (3) because of the unbalanced proportion of samples in the data set, the network training is easy to over fit and the dice loss function is used to solve the problem of imbalance between positive and negative samples. It can be seen from the experimental results that compared with the classic algorithm, under the influence of spring and winter, the cultivated land identification effect will be better and the application of farmland extraction can be realized.

TI  - Water pollution characteristics of inflowing rivers under different land-use patterns in the Daye Lake basin: pollution mode and management suggestions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) conditions can have a profound impact on the water quality of rivers, lakes, and other water bodies within a basin. Land use status of Daye Lake basin in 2019 has been shown by Landsat 8 OLI image, water quality of Daye Lake, and 12 inflowing rivers have been investigated once a month; this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the water pollution characteristics of the inflowing rivers and lake in the basin under different LULC patterns, and providing a reference for the scientific planning of land-use types in the basin and land use research in lake basins in subtropical areas. Pollutants are mainly introduced to Daye Lake from the west (such as Da Gang) and north (such as Linjiaju Gang), with concentrations gradually decreasing within the lake from west to east. Construction land is closely associated with the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) inputs to the basin, which can be trapped by vegetation. Agricultural dryland can contribute acid and dissolved oxygen (DO) to water. Precipitation can influence the input of pollutants, with a stronger effect on TN and weaker effect on TP. Pollutants accumulate from the inlets to the centre of the lake, with longer retention times during the dry season.

T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - The optical attenuation characteristics of water directly affect the clarity of lake and the survival of submerged macrophytes. Using the way of remote sensing to obtain the optical attenuation distribution characteristics of lakes can greatly improve the efficiency. Lake Daye, located in Huangshi City, Hubei Province, is a typical shallow lake in the middle reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River. Based on the in-situ survey data from 2017 to 2019, the remote sensing inversion model of Lake Daye water optical attenuation coefficient (K-d) is developed by using Landsat 8 OLI images, and the multi-year temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and driving mechanism of K-d in Lake Daye are analyzed, so as to provide reference for the restoration and management of Lake Daye basin. The results show that: the band ratio quadratic model was the best model (K-d = 9.61 (B1/B4)(2) -2.41 (B1/B4) -6.40), and its accuracy was R-2= 0.79, MAPE = 23.9%, RAISE = 0.89 m(-1). The main influencing factors of Kd of Lake Daye were suspended solids and turbidity, followed by chromophoric dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll-a. Moreover, the Kd value of Lake Daye decreased gradually from west to east in space, but it was also affected by wind speed, land-based input, human activities and microbial activities in some parts. The average of Kd is highest in summer and lowest in winter. Since 2013, the Kd value of Lake Daye has shown an overall downward trend.

TI  - A Deep Learning Model to Extract Ship Size From Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a deep learning (DL) model to extract the ship size from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, named SSENet. We employ a single shot multibox detector (SSD)-based model to generate a rotatable bounding box (RBB) for the ship. We design a deep-neural-network (DNN)-based regression model to estimate the accurate ship size. The hybrid inputs to the DNN-based model include the initial ship size and orientation angle obtained from the RBB and the abstracted features extracted from the input SAR image. We design a custom loss function named mean scaled square error (MSSE) to optimize the DNN-based model. The DNN-based model is concatenated with the SSD-based model to form the integrated SSENet. We employ a subset of the OpenSARShip, a data set dedicated to Sentinel-1 ship interpretation, to train and test SSENet. The training/testing data set includes 1500/390 ship samples. Experiments show that SSENet is capable of extracting the ship size from SAR images end to end. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) are under 0.8 pixels, and their length and width are 7.88 and 2.23 m, respectively. The hybrid input significantly improves the model performance. The MSSE reduces the MAE of length by nearly 1 m and increases the MAE of width by 0.03m compared to the mean square error (MSE) loss function. Compared with the well-performed gradient boosting regression (GBR) model, SSENet reduces the MAE of length by nearly 2 m (18.68x0025;) and that of width by 0.06 m (2.51x0025;). SSENet shows robustness on different training/testing sets.

C8  - 1
AB  - A Landsat-based machine learning algorithm (Reygadas et al. 2021, Environmental Research Communications) adapted from Wang et al. (2019, Remote Sensing of Environment) to the Southwestern Amazon was used to map intact forest, degradation, and deforestation in this region on a yearly basis during the 2003-2020 period. Degradation is defined as a long-term process in which forest is negatively affected but it is not converted into another land-cover. In contrast, deforestation is defined as the permanent, or long-term, conversion of forest into non-forest. The algorithm classifies forest covers by training a random forest model with sixty-six metrics derived from six time series variables (i.e., the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, two shortwave infrared bands, two Normalized Difference Water Indices, and the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) from which eleven descriptive statistics are calculated. As the algorithm uses statistical characteristics of time series to determine the forest conditions in the end of the study period, time series composed of the last 20 years prior the target year were used in each annual run. A pre-defined forest mask created from all areas covered by forest at least three consecutive years during the 2000-2020 period was used for the 2020 map, the remaining annual runs were executed over the same forest mask, except in areas classified as intact forest in the 2020 map. A data key is included in the description of each file. Note: Although the same algorithm is used in Reygadas et al. (2021), these data differ from those of the manuscript as they 1) are annual, 2) cover a larger area, and 3) use the aforementioned two-criterion forest mask.

AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is one of the most important parameters in the physics of land surface processes, combining the outgoing longwave radiation and turbulent heat fluxes at the interface between the atmosphere and the ground surface [1-3]. LST data is widely used in a variety of applications. This study conducted a systematic literature review to identify the research status and future trends of the application of Thermal Infrared (TIR) Land Surface Temperature (LST) satellites data during 20112021. The statistical analysis results show that the publications of papers related to TIR LST data have been steadily raising during 2011-2021. Keyword analysis illustrated that the most frequently satellites used in LST data applications were Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat.

TI  - Drought Cycle Analysis to Evaluate the Influence of a Dense Network of Small Reservoirs on Drought Evolution
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought-affected regions often contain high densities of small reservoirs, usually informally built, as drought-coping mechanism. These structures influence socio-hydrological dynamics and have the potential to alter hydrological processes relevant to drought emergence and development. This study aimed to analyze the influence of a high concentration of small reservoirs on the intensification and evolution of drought events. We present an innovative method, which we call "Drought Cycle Analysis", that tracks the concomitance of precipitation and water storage deficit and associates this with four drought stages: Wet Period, Meteorological drought, Hydro-meteorological drought and Hydrological drought period. The methodology was tested for the Riacho do Sangue River watershed located in the semi-arid region of northeast Brazil. We used a combination of satellite imagery (Landsat 5, 7 and 8) and an empirical equation to estimate the volume stored in the dense network of small reservoirs. Using the Drought Cycle Analysis, we show that the unmonitored small reservoirs induced and modified drought events, extending the duration of hydrological drought on average by 30%. Furthermore, this extension can double for specific drought events. The Drought Cycle Analysis method proved useful for monitoring and comparing the evolution of different drought events, in addition to being applicable as an auxiliary tool in the improvement of water resources management of large reservoirs. This study demonstrates the importance of considering small reservoirs in water resource management strategy development for drought-prone regions.

TI  - Modelling the spatial impact of regional planning and climate change prevention strategies on land consumption in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Area 2017-2030
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl is a ubiquitous with a complex network of driving forces and human and natural impacts on various scales of the coupled human-environment urban system. In Germany, a land consumption of 30 ha per day is envisaged. In that regard, the effect of growing metropolitan areas on the climate of local neighborhoods becomes more and more a topic in regional planning. Accordingly, the objectives of the study are a) to contribute to the climate change related land cover simulation efforts in Germany in a spatially explicit manner with a resolution of 30 m, b) to investigate future land consumption rates and population growth rates having a view on goal 11 of UN's SDG, and c) analyze the spatial impact of planning policies in regard to land use planning and official climate change prevention strategies using Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Area (RRMA) in Western Germany as a study area. The study makes use of land use and land cover classification of multispectral satellite data and the derivation of land surface temperature based on Landsat satellite in order to calibrate and validate the urban growth model SUSM (scenario-based urban growth simulation model). Two scenarios for future land consumption 2030 are implemented and the future impacts of urban growth with the projection of land consumption rate (LCR), population growth rate (PGR), and LCRPGR index on municipality level, as well as the impact on regions vulnerable to climate change evaluated. The comparison of simulated urban growth to observed urban growth from 2005 to 2017 shows that the PA of SUSM for historic scenario is 68.06% with an overall accuracy of 97.15%, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.66, a figure of merit of 0.51 and area under curve of 0.84. The total quantity of new urban areas of our SUSM simulation 2030 were approximately 283 km(2). While the difference in the simulated total quantity is nearly zero, the simulated allocation of new urban areas across the districts can differ by up to 25 km(2) in the two scenarios. The number of municipalities with efficient urban land development rates increases in the SUSM scenario where no regional land development plan has been incorporated. This holds true for the number of municipalities with inefficient land use where even an increase from no plan to plan can be observed. LCRPGR is negative in most municipalities reflecting opposing trends of population and land consumption development. Most of new urban areas are distributed in open spaces important for the regional climate change prevention strategy. 32.98 % of new urban areas in our region of interest can be found in these zones in the planning scenario and 25.76 % in the scenario without planning information in SUSM model. It can be concluded that regional planning in RRMA region has no positive effect on the interregional development of future land consumption in terms of quantity, allocation, and impact on climate change prevention.

AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide meters-scale images of the ocean surface roughness day-or-night in nearly all weather conditions. This makes it a unique asset for many geophysical applications. Sentinel-1 SAR wave mode (WV) vignettes have made possible to capture many important oceanic and atmospheric phenomena since 2014. However, considering the amount of data provided, expanding applications requires a strategy to automatically process and extract geophysical parameters. In this study, we propose to apply subaperture decomposition (SD) as a preprocessing stage for SAR deep learning models. Our data-centring approach surpassed the baseline by 0.7%, obtaining state-of-the-art on the TenGeoP-SARwv data set. In addition, we empirically showed that SD could bring additional information over the original vignette, by rising the number of clusters for an unsupervised segmentation method. Overall, we encourage the development of data-centring approaches, showing that, data preprocessing could bring significant performance improvements over existing deep learning models.

TI  - A Crime Fiction against the Murder of the Transcendent: Mario Levrero and a Program for the Subversion of the Genre
T2  - CATEDRAL TOMADA-REVISTA DE CRITICA LITERARIA LATINOAMERICANA-JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN LITERARY CRITICISM
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a critical reading of the novels Nick Carter se divierte mientras el lector es asesinado y yo agonizo (1975), La banda del ciempies (2010) and Dejen todo en mis manos (1996), which make up the crime trilogy, by Mario Levrero. The Uruguayan builds his figure as a "rare" author from the use of marginalized materials and disciplines, among them, the crime fiction that goes through his writing project. However, in a strategy of dissimulation, he points out it as a type of closed and commercial literature that closes the transformation of the reader. We argue that, through parody, display of artifice, or hyperbolic variants of paranoid fiction, Levrero sets out to subvert these boundaries. The writer appropriates the crime novel to develop another search which, while dismantling the protocols of the genre, enables its possibilities of modifying the subject. Against the crime of the transcendent by modern society that deprives the subject of luminous experiences, his poetics pursues contact with the Spirit or the Unconscious, interchangeable in his worldview. He thus manifests his program that conceives writing as a therapeutic device.

AB  - The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is able to acquire imagery over large swaths in Compact Polarimetric (CP) modes. The wide area coverage of CP, and revisit with this three satellite constellation, is of potential benefit for operational crop mapping carried out by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. This research examined the accuracy of Stokes parameters and m-Chi decomposition parameters, derived from CP data, for identifying crops with a Random Forest (RF) classifier. Stokes S-1 and S-2 parameters were plotted on the Poincare sphere and interpreted as a function of crop phenology. High overall classification accuracies (>90%) were reported when either Stokes vectors or m-Chi decomposition parameters were used in the RF classifier. The Stokes parameters also revealed that the ellipticity, orientation and handedness of scattering varies considerably as crops undergo changes in phenology.

TI  - Sebaceous Carcinoma of the Vulva: An Unexpected Diagnosis and Literature Review
T2  - ACTA MEDICA PORTUGUESA
M3  - Review
AB  - Sebaceous carcinoma of the vulva is a rare malignancy of the sebaceous glands, with potentially aggressive behaviour, that is usually found in the peri-ocular area. Nonetheless, there are sebaceous glands in the vulva and this diagnosis is especially rare, with only ten cases described in the literature. We report a case of 78-year-old female patient who presented with vulvar pruritus, previously treated with topical steroid and antifungal treatments, without improvement. The vulvar examination showed a visible yellow papule, 12 x 10 mm on the right major labia, which was biopsied and the microscopic examination revealed an invasive sebaceous carcinoma of the vulva, with an in situ component. We performed an uneventful excisional biopsy, followed by a subsequent margin widening. Three months after the diagnosis, she presented with the first recurrence. Two and half years after the diagnosis, she recurred with a larger lesion (13 mm) in the upper half of small right lip, more than 10 mm away from the midline. In a multidisciplinary meeting it was decided that the patient should undergo partial right vulvectomy with homolateral inguino-femoral sentinel node biopsy (one negative node). There was no evidence of recurrence one-year post-surgery.

AB  - The monitoring of ships which do not report their Automatic Identification System (AIS) information is important for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). In this paper, an improved maritime picture is generated by presenting a new methodology to map these so-called 'dark' ships over time. Firstly, a robust and accurate data association between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship detections and AIS data is carried out on multi-temporal SAR imagery and AIS data. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is applied to unassigned SAR ship detections to reveal the spatial distribution of `dark' zones (i.e. areas where repeated unassignments occur). This analysis helps identify areas where ships frequently do not report, which can help guide authorities in the best way to respond. The methodology is validated using Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode products and AIS data acquired from the English Channel, UK.

T2  - REVISTA PRAXIS EDUCACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The spirit of the valley represents the opening that entails all the opulences of human knowledge, in which the centenary, the firefly Edgar Morin in 101 years of life continues to shine and in the creation of his works. The deep inclusion of planetary decoloniality is the wide door of the spirit of the valley that encourages us to become more complex and complex in the light of complexity in any of its meanings: worldview, theory or transmethodology. Under this opening in the line of research: planetary decoloniality-complexity in re-linkage, we base the spirit of the valley on planetary decoloniality as the wide door in the recivilization of knowledge in education, in life, in the human being in general. The comprehensive ecosophical and diatopical hermeneutics was carried out with the transmethod at the moments: analytical, empirical and propositional. In the propositive moment in two rhizomes, it is concluded that: every human being must seek wisdom as the maximum formation; education should foster deep, high-level metacognitive thinking. The works of Edgar Morin rescue the spirit of the valley, as a satire of love that says that within us there is a potential to develop; using all our complex conformation: nature-body-mind-soul-spirit- God. If we become aware and aware that it is urgent to de-link and re-link to the problems of the planet, it incites us to a radical change in teaching, in education, let us return to the Freirian legacy, to make our harsh reality more complex, empower our students to seek their release.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Aquatic Weeds: A Case Study in the Guadiana River, Spain
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of aquatic invasive plants is a major concern in several zones of the world's geography. These plants, which are not part of the natural ecosystem, cause a negative impact to the environment, as well as to economy and society. In Spain, large areas of Guadiana (the second-longest river in Spain) have been invaded by such plants. Among the strategies to address this problem, monitoring and detection play an important role to control the spatiotemporal distribution of the invasive plants. The main objective of this work is to develop a methodology able to automatically detect the geolocation of aquatic invasive plants using remote sensing and machine learning techniques. To this end, several classification algorithms have been applied to freely available multispectral satellite imagery, collected by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite. A quantitative and comparative assessment is conducted using different machine and deep learning algorithms from classical methods, such as unsupervised K-means to supervised random forests and convolutional neural networks. This study also proposes a methodology for validating the obtained classification results, generating synthetic ground truth images based on available high spatial resolution imagery. The obtained results demonstrate the suitability of some of the considered algorithms for automatic detection of aquatic weeds in satellite images with medium spatial resolution.

AB  - Since 2015, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) has funded sites to engage in reforms intended to improve the national response to sexual assault cases. The goals of this initiative are to (1) create a coordinated community response that ensures just resolution to unsubmitted sexual assault kit (SAK) cases through a victim-centered approach and (2) build jurisdictions' capacity to prevent the development of conditions that lead to high numbers of unsubmitted sexual assault kits. Site efforts to address these issues include agencies such as law enforcement, prosecution, forensic laboratories, and victim advocacy service organizations. Westat was awarded a contract by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to assess components of BJA's Sexual Assault Kit Initiative (SAKI). The study includes (1) an evaluability assessment of 17 sites to determine their readiness for an evaluation, (2) a process evaluation and system reform assessment of the 17 sites, (3) a feasibility assessment of using case level data for an outcome evaluation, and analysis of a subset of unsubmitted SAK cases to identify how characteristics of incidents, offenders, and victims are associated with case processing decisions and outcomes, and (4) development of a long-term outcome evaluation plan. Two sources of data are archived with NAJCD: (1) coded qualitative data from primarily on-site interviews the Westat Team conducted in 2018 with stakeholders from 17 of the fiscal year (FY) 2015 SAKI grantees and 2 private lab facilities and 2) quantitative case-level data from the 2 FY 2015 SAKI grantees on SAKI cases associated with previously unsubmitted sexual assault kits that were determined to contain foreign DNA or biological evidence through laboratory testing. The interview data file contains coded data from 172 interviews the research team conducted with one or more agency representatives regarding their organization's goals, strategies, and activities for processing sexual assault kits, and associated lessons learned, challenges, and expected outcomes. The quantitative case-level data file includes case-level information on 576 sexual assault kits determined to have DNA and associated cases included in the 2 sites' SAKI inventories. The case-level data captures information on case or offense-level information (e.g., date of offense, date offense reported to police, number of victims and suspects involved, investigation and prosecution activities), victim-level information (e.g., victim age, sex, race, participation in investigation), and suspect-level information (e.g., suspect's age, race, sex, criminal history). The process evaluation and system reform assessment was designed to understand and gain perspective on two aspects of SAKI program implementation: (1) the strategies sexual assault kit initiative (SAKI) sites employed to address each stage (both discrete and iterative) of the unsubmitted SAK case process, including inventory, submission, testing, CODIS population, investigation, and prosecution, and (2) the system reform efforts sites implement and the extent to which they result in intended (or unintended) consequences. Criminal case file data can provide detailed information about the incidents, victims, and suspects associated with unsubmitted SAKs, as well as the course of action taken by investigators and prosecutors in both the original (i.e., before SAK testing) and follow-up (i.e., after SAK testing) investigations. Criminal case files may provide insights into reasons why investigations are suspended, including the nature and degree of victim participation in the investigation, victim credibility concerns, the relationship between the victim and offender, whether police personnel interviewed suspects, and whether police requested prosecutors issue an arrest warrant. As such, examining case files can provide information about the circumstances by which sexual assault cases proceed through the justice system and highlight ways to reduce the number of unsubmitted SAKs through improved policy and training. To collect site visit interviews for the assessment, Westat recruited all fiscal year (FY) 2015 grantees who were willing to participate in the evaluation. Participation entailed a site visit and ongoing communication about their site's sexual assault kit initiative (SAKI) program implementation progress. 17 of the 20 FY 2015 SAKI grantee sites elected to participate in Westat's data collection activities for the evaluability assessment, including 7 state-level sites, 3 county- or multicounty-level sites, and 7 city-level sites. Westat conducted 2-day visits at each of the 17 participating sites between February and September 2018 to interview key stakeholders regarding their organization's goals, strategies, and activities for processing sexual assault kits, and associated lessons learned, challenges, and expected outcomes. Westat gathered documents for all 20 sites and obtained Performance Measurement Tool (PMT) data as of Quarter 2 of 2019 from BJA for all 20 FY 2015 SAKI grantees. Westat used qualitative analytic methods for the interview data. Westat coded the interview data collected from the 17 participating sites using a set of inductive codes based on the key dimensions related to the research questions. Using a set of defined criteria, Westat identified sites well suited for participating in sharing case-level data. Of the 17 FY 2015 SAKI sites involved in the evaluability assessment, Westat contacted 9 to assess further the sites' capacity to provide case-level data and to solicit participation. Recruiting sites for participation presented many challenges. For example, several sites remained in the early stages of completing their grant work and would not yet have data on SAK testing results or post-SAK testing case outcomes. Many sites lacked sufficient staffing and other resources necessary for participating; and sites frequently faced administrative and legal constraints to data sharing. 4 of the 9 sites participated in the initial stages of the case-level, data sharing project and Westat ultimately obtained case-level data from 2 sites. Westat worked with 4 sites to develop a data collection instrument that captured information about the incident, victim, suspect, and investigation activities of each case. The instrument included measures of characteristics and activities that occurred at the time of the original investigation (i.e., before SAK testing) and at the time of the follow-up investigation (after SAK testing). The data collection and data sharing methods differed between the two participating sites. Site 1, a city-level site without a research partner, provided law enforcement agency case files in electronic form to Westat. Westat research staff reviewed the case files and recorded information onto the data collection instrument. Site 1 also shared spreadsheets that contained information about SAK testing results. Site 2, a county-level site with a research partner, shared an electronic database with Westat that contained case-level data as specified in the data collection instrument. Both sites initially shared data for all cases in their SAKI inventories with Westat (n= 1,287). Due to time and resource constraints, as well as participating sites' focus on cases associated with kits that contained foreign DNA because these were the cases most likely to receive follow-up investigations and proceed through to prosecution, Westat limited data extraction to those cases in which foreign DNA was identified during SAK forensic testing. Dataset 1: With the exception of the identifiers for site, lab, and interview, all of the variables included in the data file are dichotomous and represent the presence or absence of themes highlighted during the coding process. The themes address the range of activities, strategies, and processes sites implemented to reduce and resolve unsubmitted kit cases and improve current case processing through system reform efforts. Dataset 2: Variables in this dataset capture case or offense-level information (e.g., date of offense, date offense reporting to police, number of victims/suspects involved, investigation and prosecution activities), victim-level information (e.g., victim age, sex, race, participation in investigation), and suspect-level information (e.g., suspect's age, race, sex, criminal history).

AB  - Aerosols play a critical role in radiative transfer within the atmosphere and in climate change. As part of the validation of atmospheric correction of remote sensing data affected by the atmosphere, it is critical to utilize appropriate aerosol models as aerosols are a main source of error. Here, we define the aerosol model by recalculating the aerosol microphysical properties based on the optical thickness at 440 nm and the Angstrom coefficient obtained from numerous AERONET sites. The associated uncertainties are up to 23%, except for the imaginary part of the refractive index (about 38%). Uncertainties of the retrieved aerosol microphysical properties were incorporated in the framework for validating surface reflectance derived from space-borne Earth observation sensors. It yields an overall uncertainty of approximately of 1 to 3% of the retrieved surface reflectance in the MODIS red spectral band, well below the specification used for atmospheric correction.

AB  - Scientists continue to study the red tide and fish-kill events happening in Florida. Machine learning applications using remote sensing data on coastal waters to monitor water quality parameters and detect harmful algal blooms are also being studied. Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are often deployed on data collection and disaster response missions. To enhance study and mitigation efforts, robots must be able to use available data to navigate these underwater environments. In this study, we compute a satellite-derived underwater environment (SDUE) model by implementing a supervised machine learning model where remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) indices are labeled with in-situ data they correlate with. The models predict bathymetry and water quality parameters given a recent remote sensing image. In our experiment, we use Sentinel-2 (S2) images and in-situ data of the Biscayne Bay to create an SDUE that can be used as a Chlorophyll-a map. The SDUE is then used in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) application that solves an underwater vehicle localization and navigation problem.

CL  - Chennai, INDIA
AB  - Many studies suggest that water quality parameters can be estimated by applying statistical and machine learning methods using remote sensing or in-situ data. However, identifying best practices for implementing solutions appears to be done on a case-by-case basis. In our case, we have in-situ data that covers a large period, but only small areas of Biscayne Bay, Florida. In this paper, we combine available in-situ data with remote sensing data captured by Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS Collection 2 Level 2(L8), Sentinel-2 L2A(S2), and Sentinel-3 OLCI L1B(S3). The combined data set is for use in a water quality parameter estimation application. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we present a pipeline for data collection, processing, and co-location that results in a usable data set of combined remote sensing and in-situ data. Second, we propose a classification model using the combined data set to identify areas of interest for future data collection missions based on chlorophyll-a in-situ measurements. To further prove our methodology, we conduct a data collection mission using one of the predicted paths from our model.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities have caused inferior quality of environment and threatens all living forms on the planet. Everyday human activities create havoc to earth's climate. Any change in green-house gases affects the balance of earth's ecosystem. The major concern of increased trace gases is their ability to trap sun's energy, which is rising surface temperature. The rise in temperature is causing many extreme climatic events, melting of glaciers, uneven rainfall pattern, floods and droughts etc. The land of five rivers, Punjab is chosen as study area. The major green-house gases emission source is crop residue burning. This study forecast concentration of carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and methane for year 2021-2025 using satellite data. The methodology involves time series analysis using linear regression for three different iterations with different training period. The results shows that maximum concentration for CO2 in the year 2025 for 1st iteration is 424.46 +/- 5.58 ppm, 2nd iteration is 424.37 +/- 7.93ppm and 3rd iteration is 425.21 +/- 4.55ppm. The maximum concentration for SO2 rises to 0.19 +/- 0.03 DU for 1st iteration, 0.18 +/- 0.02DU for 2nd iteration and 0.19 +/- 0.03DU for 3rd iteration. Similarly, NO2 concentration rises to 24.45 +/- 2.56ppm for 1st iteration, 23.57 +/- 2.67ppm for 2nd and 26.85 +/- 2.99ppm for 3rd. Also, CH4 concentration rises to 1933.44 +/- 12.00ppbv for 1st iteration, 1932 +/- 13.81ppbv for 2nd and 1934 +/- 12.02ppbv for 3rd iteration. The study further concluded that the type of aerosols in the study area can be majorly categorized in anthropogenic aerosols. They are evenly distributed in the other three categories.

AB  - A quick analysis of gaseous content in volcanic plumes is possible by using hyperspectral remote sensing data. In the present work, an algorithm to calculate CO2 columnar abundance in tropospheric volcanic plumes is applied to two volcanic test sites. The algorithm is based on the CIBR (Continuum Interpolated Band Ratio) remote sensing technique which exploits spectroscopy measurements by analyzing gases absorptions features in the SWIR (Short Wave InfraRed) spectral range. Specifically, PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa) hyperspectral satellite acquisitions are used for CO2 retrieval purposes. The PRISMA space mission was launched by the ASI (Italian Space Agency) on March 22, 2019; the on board spectrometer is able to acquire images of the Earth in the VNIR (0.4-1.0 mu m) and SWIR (0.9-2.5 mu m) spectral ranges continuously, with a ground spatial resolution of 30 m. The inversion technique is applied to two Italian test sites: the Stromboli volcano and the Solfatara-Pisciarelli area (in the caldera of Campi Flegrei). The results show the capability of the method to detect and estimate strong CO2 concentrations at a local spatial scale.While the satellite data provide a wide view of the emissions, in situ measurements are able to achieve accurate estimates of gases concentrations at very high spatial resolution. Acquisitions by a miniature multi-Gas analysis system, mounted on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), are also considered. The multi-Gas instrument can measure H2O, CO2, H2S and SO2 gases. Specifically, data of carbon dioxide concentrations acquired on the Solfatara-Pisciarelli test site are here presented.

T2  - FOREST SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of study: Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential variable to monitor and characterize forest ecosystems. This variable has been consistently captured for almost four decades by the Landsat program. The current study aimed at identifying trends, knowledge gaps and opportunity areas in the use of Landsat derived LST for the monitoring and analysis of forest ecosystems.Materials and methods: A bibliometric analysis of scientific articles indexed in Scopus in the period 1995-2020 was conducted.Main results: Annual increase rate in the number of publications on the topic analyzed was 22.58%. The journal with more publications on the topic was Proceedings of SPIE, followed by Remote Sensing. The authors with the highest productivity on this topic were C. Quintano, I. Vorovencii, O. E. Yakubailik and M. A. Zoran. Regarding productivity by country, 38 countries with publications on this topic were identified, with the highest productivity located in China, USA and India. This group of countries also represented the most solid network of cooperation between countries. Forest ecosystems more frequently analyzed were temperate forests, followed by tropical forests. The analysis of keywords highlighted topics such as remote sensing, NDVI, MODIS and evapotranspiration. The analysis of thematic evolution indicated that areas of research and interpretation of LST data has evolved in parallel with remote sensing areas.Research highlights: Landsat LST analysis is an evolving topic with potential to contribute to improve ecosystem knowledge and to support diverse challenges in forest resources decision-making.

TI  - Analysis of Near-Surface Temperature Lapse Rates in Mountain Ecosystems of Northern Mexico Using Landsat-8 Satellite Images and ECOSTRESS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain ecosystems provide environmental goods, which can be threatened by climate change. Near-Surface Temperature Lapse Rate (NSTLR) is an essential factor used for thermal and hydrological analysis in mountain ecosystems. The aims of the present study were to estimate NSTLR and to identify its relationship with aspect, Local solar zenith angle (LSZA) and Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) for two seasons of the year in a mountain ecosystem at the North of Mexico. Normalized Land Surface Temperature (NLST) was estimated using environmental and topographical variables. LSZA was calculated from slope to consider the effect of solar position. NSTLR was estimated through simple linear models. Observed NSTLR was 9.4 degrees C km(-1) for the winter and 14.3 degrees C km(-1) for the summer. Our results showed variation in NSTLR by season. In addition, aspect, LSZA and ESI also influenced NSTLR regulation. In addition, Northwest and West aspects exhibited the highest NSTLR. LSZA angles closest to 90 degrees were related with a decrease in NSTLR for both seasons. Finally, ESI values associated with less evaporative stress were related to lower NSTLR. These results suggest potential of Landsat-8 LST and ECOSTRESS ESI to capture interactions of temperature, topography, and water stress in complex ecosystems.

M3  - Case Reports
AB  - A 53-year-old woman with a plantar malignant melanoma lesion was referred to our tertiary clinic for sentinel lymph node mapping. Lymphoscintigraphy with 99mTc-Phytate detected ipsilateral inguinal and popliteal sentinel nodes. After total resection of nodes, the pathology report confirmed that all specimens were involved by the tumor. As part of an institutional study evaluating somatostatin receptor avidity of melanoma by 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scan, she also underwent a whole-body octreotide scan, which surprisingly showed intense tracer uptake in the right cervical region, confining in SPECT/CT images to a mass at the C2 spinal level, adjacent to the right carotid bifurcation. Neck surgery with gamma probe after injection of another dose of 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC was performed successfully, and the pathology report was consistent with a carotid body tumor. To best our knowledge, our case is the first one in the literature, which reports an incidental paraganglioma with 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC scan which resected via radio-guided surgery, again with 99mTc-HYNIC-TOC tracer.

AB  - Monitoring vegetation is of great importance for many applications, for example agriculture or forestry. Commonly, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of space-born sensor is utilized for this task. However, as the NDVI is derived from multispectral optical data, cloud coverage prevents the acquisition of useful values. This results in data and monitoring gaps. Generally, this can be avoided using cloud penetrating radar sensors but the different sensing method and different image characteristics hamper the easy usage of the data. Therefore, in this paper a method is presented to allow global cloud-independent vegetation monitoring by estimating the NDVI from radar data using a deep learning model. The used U-Net architecture is trained on a newly created dataset called SEN12TP of globally distributed radar and optical imagery with a small difference in acquisition time. The resulting performance is evaluated and different input modalities are compared. Additionally, the ability of this approach to densify NDVI time series is demonstrated.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of surface and groundwater are fundamental concerns. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 80% of diseases are waterborne. This percentage mostly lies in developing nations and underdeveloped countries. Determining the relationship between land-use patterns and groundwater quality changes is one of the methods to evaluate the impact of land-use on the hydrological condition of each region which ultimately assists in managing natural resources. In the present study, the spatial-temporal model via satellite images of Landsat TM, ETM, and OLI for2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017 are used to investigate all these modalities in Shahriar Plain, Tehran, Iran. Following image processing and analysis, the land-uses of the study area are classified into urban, farming, and bare lands. In order to assess the water quality of the study area, the periodic sampling data of piezometric wells in the plain were used from 2002 to 2017. Based on the US Salinity Laboratory (USSL) diagram, water qualities for agricultural uses are classified. Results demonstrated that land area has changed over time indicating an increase in urban land area and declines in agricultural and bare lands. Additionally, the results of the groundwater quality indicated C3S1 class in the second and third periods have increased to 3.58% (1025.93 ha) and 12.82% (9367.85 ha) while C2S1 class has been decreased in second and third periods to 3.58 and 12.82%. C1S1 and C4S1 classes during the three periods have been 0.

TI  - Leaf Bidirectional Transmittance Distribution Function Estimates and Models for Select Deciduous Tree Species
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing increasingly has become an important tool for forest management. In the development of forest metrics from remote-sensing data, currently many models omit the individual leaf bidirectional scattering distribution function (BSDF). Past studies, and the currently available data, often do not adequately incorporate transmission, cover the broader reflective domain, and/or incorporate models to extend to any illumination and view angle combination. We estimated broadleaf bidirectional transmittance distribution functions (BTDFs) in this study using the goniometer of the Rochester Institute of Technology-Two (GRIT-T), which records spectral data in the UV-A through shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions (350x2013;2500 nm). We measured three species of large tree leaves, Norway maple (<italic>Acer platanoides</italic>), American sweetgum (<italic>Liquidambar styraciflua</italic>), and northern red oak (<italic>Quercus rubra</italic>). We accurately modeled leaf BTDF with extension to any illumination angle, viewing zenith, and azimuthal angle through nonlinear regression to a physically-based microfacet BTDF. The model fit showed a mean of less than 7x0025; normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) spectrally from 450 to 2300 nm (lower and upper wavelength range omitted due to detector noise). The microfacet models provide highly useful physical quantities such as a relative roughness, index of refraction, and absorption, which are all directly related to leaf optical properties. These physical quantities have implications for plant physiology, vegetation remote sensing, and physics-based image generation. Specifically, the accuracy of radiative transfer modeling in forest canopies depends on rigorous representations of leaves, and this increase in accuracy can lead to the development of higher fidelity data processing algorithms for remote sensing.

AB  - With many new hyperspectral imaging missions coming online, there is a growing need to apply existing science to generate reliable high level data products for end-users. Here we propose using a scenario analysis framework for evaluating the impact of upstream image acquisition processing decisions on the quality of derived hyperspectral data products. We demonstrate our framework on an example use case comparing a spectral index-based modeling approach against a partial least squares regression approach for estimating canopy chlorophyll content under both typical and edge image acquisition conditions. The results highlight the potential of scenario analysis as a tool for supporting both coarse and fine-scale processing decisions in an operational hyperspectral data pipeline.

AB  - At the end of the 19th century, Hulbert, who came to Korea as a teacher and missionary, did a holistic missionary work to spread the gospel while serving in various areas of society for Korea. The following factors were the foundation of the consciousness that led Hulbert's holistic mission.First, the educational environment in the process of growth became the basis of consciousness. He came from a Puritan family, and was influenced by family education and family culture, and developed various skills in school education. Second, a Christian's biblical worldview became the basis for his words and actions, and the values of justice, humanitarianism, and equality were cultivated. Third, the new American trends such as Pragmatism and Frontier Sprit were accepted inside and became the driving force for their activities. Fourth, rather than following the mission ideology instructed by the mission headquarters at the time, the foundation of consciousness to do missionary work was laid while enlightening and serving society through contextualization according to his values.

TI  - Factors influencing transferability in species distribution models
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) provide insights into species' ecology and distributions and are frequently used to guide conservation priorities. However, many uses of SDMs require model transferability, which refers to the degree to which a model built in one place or time can successfully predict distributions in a different place or time. If a species' model has high spatial transferability, the relationship between abundance and predictor variables should be consistent across a geographical distribution. We used Breeding Bird Surveys, climate and remote sensing data, and a novel method for quantifying model transferability to test whether SDMs can be transferred across the geographic ranges of 129 species of North American birds. We also assessed whether species' traits are correlated with model transferability. We expected that prediction accuracy between modeled regions should decrease with 1) geographical distance, 2) degree of extrapolation, and 3) were affected by a 'core-boundary' effect, which assesses distances to the boundary of a distribution. Our results suggest that very few species have a high model transferability index (MTI). Species with large distributions, with distributions located in areas with low topographic relief, and with short lifespans are more likely to exhibit low transferability. Transferability between modeled regions also decreased with geographical distance and degree of extrapolation. We expect that low transferability in SDMs potentially resulted from both ecological non-stationarity (i.e., biological differences within a species across its range) and over-extrapolation. Accounting for non-stationarity and extrapolation should substantially increase prediction success of species distribution models, therefore enhancing the success of conservation efforts. Data - Bird species and abundance We used data from the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to extract abundances of bird species in Canada and USA (Pardieck et al. 2019). BBS consists of routes surveyed once a year during the breeding season (typically June). A BBS route includes 50 three-minute point counts, separated by a distance of at least 0.5 miles (Sauer et al. 2003). We selected bird species (n = 138) using three criteria. First, a species had to be detected in at least 30 different routes per year. This provided for a minimum sample size in the number of routes where a species is present and helped ensure our models would predict reasonably well (Hernandez et al. 2006, Wisz et al. 2008). Second, we selected species with a prevalence (i.e., the percentage of routes where the species was present) of at least 20%. We also excluded highly common species (prevalence [greater than]75%). These prevalence values are recommended to improve the fit of SDMs (McPherson et al. 2004). Third, a minimum of 80% of the breeding distribution of each species had to be within the area covered by the BBS routes. We used breeding bird distributions from BirdLife International (2018). The area covered by the BBS routes was determined using a minimum convex polygon surrounding all BBS routes. For each BBS route and species, we used the mean abundance for the years of 2013 to 2017 (inclusively; Howard et al., 2014). This range of years represents the latest five years available at the time of download. Using the mean abundance across a short time frame enabled us to reduce the noise caused by yearly changes in detections, while limiting the impact caused by long-term changes in habitat and climate on bird abundance (Gutierrez-Illan et al. 2014, Betts et al. 2019). Data - Environmental covariates We used climatic and land cover covariates known to be correlated with bird abundance (Austin 2002, Shirley et al. 2013, Howard et al. 2015). Data were obtained from Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al. 2017) and were summarized for each BBS route and year (2013 to 2017), using a 400 m buffer (Bahn and McGill 2013). Datasets were selected based on their availability across North America. Climatic covariates were obtained from Daymet V3 (Thornton et al. 2017) and included summer precipitation (prcpSummer), winter precipitation (prcpWinter), maximum summer temperature (tMax), and minimum winter temperature (tMin). We used the equivalent of the band 3 (B3) and 4 (B4) of Landsat 7, from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 as land cover variables. These land cover data were summarized using the LandTrendr tools (Kennedy et al. 2018). LandTrendr includes pre-processing of the images including geometric rectification and cloud and shadow screening. It creates a yearly surface reflectance composite which we used to summarize data for each BBS route. We used B3 to discriminate between built-up environments and vegetation, and B4 to compare rates of chlorophyll absorption which is useful to distinguish between conifer and broadleaf as well as young versus senescent vegetation (Cohen and Goward 2004). The climatic and land cover covariates used in the analysis are summarized in Table 1 of paper. To be consistent with bird data and to increase model transferability (Tuanmu et al. 2011), covariates for each BBS route were then averaged over the period from 2013 to 2017.

AB  - The spatiotemporal variability of vegetation in the Middle East was investigated for the period 2001-2019 using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day/500 m composites of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; MOD13A1). The results reveal a strong increase in NDVI coverage in the Middle East during the study period (R = 0.75, p-value = 0.05). In Egypt, the annual coverage exhibits the strongest positive trend (R = 0.99, p-value = 0.05). In Turkey, both the vegetation coverage and density increased from 2001 to 2019, which can be attributed to the construction of some of the biggest dams in the Middle East, such as the Ataturk and Ilisu dams. Significant increases in the annual coverage and maximum and average NDVI in Saudi Arabia are due to farming in the northern part of the country for which groundwater and desalinated seawater are used. The results of this study suggest that one of the main factors affecting vegetation coverage in the Middle East are governmental policies. These policies could lead to an increase in vegetation coverage in some countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Iran, and Turkey.

TI  - Analysis of the recent trends in vegetation dynamics and its relationship with climatological factors using remote sensing data for Caspian Sea watersheds in Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - . This study used NDVI, ET, and LST satellite images collected by moderate resolution imaging spectroradiom-eter and tropical rainfall measuring mission sensors to investigate seasonal and yearly vegetation dynamics, and also the influence of climatological factors on it, in the area of the Caspian Sea Watersheds for 2001-2019. The relationships have been assessed using regression analysis and by calculating the anomalies. The results showed that in the winter there is a positive significant cor-relation between NDVI and ET, and also LST (R = 0.46 and 0.55, p-value = 0.05, respectively). In this season, the impact of pre-cipitation on vegetation coverage should not be significant when LST is low, as was observed in the analysed case. In spring, the correlation between NDVI and ET and precipitation is positive and significant (R = 0.86 and 0.55, p-value = 0.05). In this season, the main factor controlling vegetation dynamics is precipitation, and LST's impact on vegetation coverage may be omitted when precipitation is much higher than usual. In the summer, the correla-tion between NDVI and ET is positive and significant (R = 0.70, p-value = 0.05), while the correlation between NDVI and LST is negative and significant (R = -0.45, p-value = 0.05). In this sea-son, the main factor that controls vegetation coverage is LST. In the summer season, when precipitation is much higher than aver-age, the impact of LST on vegetation growth is more pronounced. Also, higher than usual precipitation in the autumn is the reason for extended vegetation coverage in this season, which is mainly due to increased soil moisture.

M3  - Article
AB  - The tourist system started to emerge as an organised phenomenon in Barcelona and Catalonia in the early years of the 20th century. Initially, the actions and initiatives take place against the backdrop of regionalism and regenerationism. In this context, a number of works were published that sought to influence the territory's tourism policies: Barcelona cosmopolita (1908) by Goncal Arnus, Organitzacio Turistica de Catalunya (1932) by Antoni Muntanyola, and El problema del turismo (1932) by Xavier Caldero. Although they derive from different ideologies, these texts share in common the idea that tourism is a public affair and link it to a patriotic rhetoric. Tourism is considered an identity-constituting phenomenon, insofar as it contributes to a culture's definition (projection and expression). All three works present a powerful territorial and class worldview and are written by authoritative voices, power brokers, who generate dominant discourses and hegemonic categories of tourism. This paper analyses the three works' content and reflects on their impact on tourism policies.

M3  - Article
AB  - The dome, pendentive, nave, and apse frescoes painted by Giovanni Battista Gaulli in the Gesu, the mother church of the Jesuit Order, are among the most stunning of all Baroque ceiling paintings in Rome (1672-1683). Commissioned by Gian Paolo Oliva, the eleventh superior general of the Order, previous scholarship has been primarily concerned with issues of their influence and the identification of the many figures in these paintings, paying little attention to the actual meaning of the three works, and even less to their meaning as a unified program. My concern in this paper is with the meaning of these frescoes, both individually and as a unified whole. At first glance, the whole is visually overwhelming, an effect that obscures the underlying program and discourages close analysis of the content. But after careful study of the individual parts, Oliva's program starts to emerge and Gaulli's whole begins to make sense. And what that whole presents to the observer is the Jesuit view of progress toward the end of time as a great battle under the standard of Christ, a great battle whose final victory is expressed by means of a strongly unified conceptual dynamic put forth in the dome (Part 1) through the macrocosmic entry of Christ into his kingdom of the community of the saved at the beginning of the end of the history of salvation, and in the nave (Part 2) through the microcosmic entry of Jesus into his kingdom of the individual soul throughout the course of the history of salvation. In the end, Oliva and Gaulli's program is nothing less than the visualization of the Jesuit worldview, of Jesuit spirituality, and of the Jesuit claim in the culture wars of the seventeenth century, phrased in terms of a distinctly Jesuit conception of the end of the history of salvation.

T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Photovoltaic solar plants are one of the main facilities away from urban centers for the generation of clean energy. Since its appropriate maintenance ensures its suitable operation, optimizing their maintenance tasks in a preventive way is key. This article presents a spatial data infrastructure called INSPECTORMAP that, based on the analysis of free satellite images within the optical spectrum, can detect unusual vegetation and bodies of water in the vicinity of photovoltaic plants that can affect their correct operation. Thanks to the implementation of a monitoring and alert system, it is possible to know and map the status of the photovoltaic plant in terms of unusual coverages appearing, both natural and artificial, at any moment. Thus, maintenance workers would travel to the solar plant to carry out their maintenance tasks in this regard only when the system detects a risk.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel metric for detecting coherence in global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) signals is presented and evaluated. It applies the Von Neumann information entropy metric for density matrices, a powerful indicator of the degree of mixing between states, coherent and incoherent, of the scene under investigation. The metric is applied to a set of raw IF data acquired by the cyclone global navigation satellite system (CYGNSS) observatories over Lake Okeechobee FL, in order to test the sensitivity of the entropy to different land cover types, including wetlands and open water. Visual comparison of results with Sentinel-1 images provides a first step in the validation of the effectiveness of entropy in detecting the presence of water covered by emergent vegetation. In addition, the entropy-based metric could be implemented on future space-based GNSS-R receivers to adapt the incoherent integration times to the observed scene, thus achieving an improvement in along-track resolution.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Learning to predict accurately from a few data samples is a central challenge in modern data-hungry machine learning. On natural images, human vision typically outperforms deep learning approaches on few-shot learning. However, we hypothesize that aerial and satellite images are more challenging to the human eye. This applies particularly when the image resolution is comparatively low, as with the 10m ground sampling distance of Sentinel-2. In this study, we benchmark model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithms against human participants on few-shot land cover classification with Sentinel-2 imagery on the Sen12MS dataset. We find that categorization of land cover from globally distributed regions is a difficult task for the participants, who classified the given images less accurately than the MAML-trained model and with a highly variable success rate. This suggest that hand-labeling land cover directly on Sentinel-2 imagery is not optimal when tackling a new land cover classification problem. Labeling only a few images and employing a trained meta-learning model to this task may lead to more accurate and consistent solutions compared to hand labeling by multiple individuals.

AB  - This paper presents the novel use of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based machine learning models for remotely detecting and monitoring retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) in high latitude northern permafrost using open-source Sentinel-2 satellite data. RTS are indicative of rapid permafrost thaw (RPT), the accelerated release of greenhouse gases (GHG) and potentially runaway changes in the cryosphere. Attempts to quantify GHG emissions from RTS are inhibited by a lack of information on RTS incidence and area affected. We show that site-specific CNN models can be used to produce time series data on rapid RTS development that allow for the approximation of associated GHG emissions. For the sites assessed we achieve good model precision, recall and F1 values of > 0.8. The short time series studied so far do not reveal clear trends in RTS development. These limitations arise from the low resolution of Sentinel-2 data (10 m) and limited availability and diversity of validated training data. The capability shown here is the first step towards achieving automated monitoring of rapid environmental change in permafrost using satellite data. This work highlights the need for ready access to open-source high resolution satellite data and permafrost field data if the potential of such approaches is to be fully realized.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern technologies give an opportunity to create a large number of bathymetric maps, hut less of them have been focused on processing the water depth data in order to study and estimate the subterranean sources of water object supply. This study aims to create a mechanism for estimating the productivity of subterranean sources of lakes water supply, based on bathymetric survey data. Lake Svitiaz was chosen as the study site as the deepest closed lake of natural origin in Ukraine with an area of 2500 ha and a maximum depth of 58.4 m. To get depth data, ground-based measurements were conducted using an echosounder Lowrance LMS-S27cDF. The Lake morphometric changes were investigated, using bathymetric data and Sentinel A, and B data in the digital elevation model (15x15 m). Bathygrahic analysis was performed, allowing selecting areas for further echo- sounding, taking into account complex relief and specific basin forms of the Lake. To develop an appropriate technique for estimating the productivity of subterranean water supply sources, GIS and image (echogram) processing techniques were applied. The research tasks are completed as a technique for detecting 'tracks' and a mechanism that is quite effective, particularly for early evaluation of subterranean sources of water supply productivity that can he repeated on any similar water objects.

TI  - The Impact of Chronic Electronic Cigarette Use on Alveolar Macrophage Lipid Content: Case Report.
T2  - Archives of clinical and medical case reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: While acute respiratory distress following electronic cigarette (e-cig) use has been described, the effects of chronic e-cig use on lung health are currently unknown. Acute e-cigarette/vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) has been highlighted recently in numerous cases across the United States. Numerous EVALI case reports highlight alterations in alveolar macrophages, justifying investigation of this key immune sentinel of the lung in habitual e-cig users.Case Presentation: After informed consent, we performed a bronchoscopy on a 25 year asymptomatic woman who reported daily e-cig use. To evaluate for evidence of abnormal lipid homeostasis, we performed histologic and Oil Red O stain evaluation of alveolar macrophages obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Our analyses demonstrate a prevalence of cells with high lipid accumulation in multiple, discrete cytoplasmic foci. We found a high lipid laden macrophage index within alveolar macrophages isolated from a chronic e-cig user. At the ultrastructural level, we found membrane-bound compartments filled with material of various densities segregated along curved phase separation lines reminiscent of suspensions of immiscible fluids.Conclusions: We found a unique ultrastructural pattern in alveolar macrophages isolated from a chronic e-cig user that is unlike any other previously reported in aspiration syndromes and may represent a defining diagnostic feature of chronic e-cig use.

TI  - Assessment of Land Cover and Land Use Change Dynamics in Kibwezi Watershed, Kenya.
T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) parameters influence the hydrological and ecological processes taking place in a watershed. Understanding the changes in LULC is essential in the planning and development of management strategies for water resources. The purpose of the study was to detect changes in LULC in the Kibwezi watershed in Kenya, using geospatial approaches. Supervised and unsupervised classification techniques using remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) were used to process Landsat imagery for 1999, 2009, and 2019 while ERDAS IMAGINE 14 and MS Excel software were used to derive change detection, and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to delineate the watershed using an in-built watershed delineation tool. The watershed was classified into ten major LULC classes, namely cropland (rainfed), cropland (irrigated), cropland (perennial), crop and shrubs/trees, closed shrublands, open shrubland, shrub grasslands, wooded shrublands, riverine woodlands, and built-up land. The results showed that LULC under shrub grassland, urban areas, and crops and shrubs increased drastically by 552.5%, 366.2%, and 357.1% respectively between 1999 and 2019 with an annual increase of 35.55%, 35.38%, and 33.86% per annum. The area under open shrubland and closed shrubland declined by73.7%, and 30.4% annually. These LULC transformations pose a negative impact on the watershed resources. There is therefore a need for proper management of the watershed for sustainable socio-economic development of the Kibwezi area.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the 21st century, Israel provided the world with several historians at once, who have significantly influenced modern historical research. This article analyzes the processes of development of the State of Israel and Israeli historical science, due to which this phenomenon appeared. The article examines the genesis of the worldview of modern Israeli scientists of the world level: Yu.N. Harari, Boaz Neumann and Alon Confino and the influence that each of them had on modern historical science. In particular, Yu.N. Harari tried to give answers to global problems of our time, and B. Neumann and A. Konfino abandoned taboos and sacralization when studying the topic of the Holocaust and the Third Reich. Their approaches have undoubtedly had a significant impact on the research of Western historians.

TI  - ABOUT CONTRADICTIONS AND HISTORICAL FORKS OF THE TRANSITION TO A DIGITAL SOCIETY
T2  - POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY OF POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the review of the main economic, so-cial, political and cultural problems and contradictions that arise in the pro-cess of the transition to a digital society. According to the author, this transi-tion is civilizational in nature, affecting not only economy and social relations, but also the way of life, the system of values and the worldview of most inhab-itants of the planet.The article shows that, as in any other transitional era, in the modern terms, new problems are intertwined with the old ones, strengthening con-flicts in the society and engendering uncertainty about the future. The econ-omy of the "capitalism of digital platforms" is much more monopolized than the capitalist economy of the 20th century. Digital monopolies are becoming real competitors of governments, and it is highly plausible that the struggle for power between them will ultimately result in the merge of the power of the state with the economic and intellectual potential of digital giants and the for-mation of a new version of the state-monopoly capitalism. Coupled with the increasing income gap, digital inequality expands the abyss between the rich and the poor and contributes to the formation of the pyramidal structure of society, where the place in the social hierarchy is determined by the possibil-ity of creating, using and commercializing modern information and commu-nication technologies. The fundamental changes in the labor market due to robotization and the expanding use of artificial intelligence carry the threat of the appearance of a huge layer of "non-demanded people". This means that, unlike most societal models that existed in the 20th century, the digital soci-ety will not be inclusive, which, in turn, will affect its stability. The looming transformation of the consumption society into the entertainment society will also have serious implications. The processes associated with this transforma-tion are fraught with the cultural retrogression of mankind and jeopardize the foundations of the human civilization in the form that took several millennia to develop.

TI  - Single-lens mass measurement in the high-magnification microlensing event Gaia 19bld located in the Galactic disc
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Microlensing provides a unique opportunity to detect non-luminous objects. In the rare cases that the Einstein radius theta(E) and microlensing parallax pi(E) can be measured, it is possible to determine the mass of the lens. With technological advances in both ground- and space-based observatories, astrometric and interferometric measurements are becoming viable, which can lead to the more routine determination of theta(E) and, if the microlensing parallax is also measured, the mass of the lens.Aims. We present the photometric analysis of Gaia 19bld, a high-magnification (A approximate to 60) microlensing event located in the southern Galactic plane, which exhibited finite source and microlensing parallax effects. Due to a prompt detection by the Gaia satellite and the very high brightness of I = 9.05 mag at the peak, it was possible to collect a complete and unique set of multi-channel follow-up observations, which allowed us to determine all parameters vital for the characterisation of the lens and the source in the microlensing event.Methods. Gaia 19bld was discovered by the Gaia satellite and was subsequently intensively followed up with a network of ground-based observatories and the Spitzer Space Telescope. We collected multiple high-resolution spectra with Very Large Telescope (VLT)/X-shooter to characterise the source star. The event was also observed with VLT Interferometer (VLTI)/PIONIER during the peak. Here we focus on the photometric observations and model the light curve composed of data from Gaia, Spitzer, and multiple optical, ground-based observatories. We find the best-fitting solution with parallax and finite source effects. We derived the limit on the luminosity of the lens based on the blended light model and spectroscopic distance.Results. We compute the mass of the lens to be 1.13 +/- 0.03 M-circle dot and derive its distance to be 5.52(-0.64)(+0.35) kpc. The lens is likely a main sequence star, however its true nature has yet to be verified by future high-resolution observations. Our results are consistent with interferometric measurements of the angular Einstein radius, emphasising that interferometry can be a new channel for determining the masses of objects that would otherwise remain undetectable, including stellar-mass black holes.

TI  - EVALUATION OF SELF-REHABILITATION OF THE TERRITORY OF THE DEGTYARSKY COPPER-PYRITE DEPOSIT (MIDDLE URALS) USING EARTH REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE TULA STATES UNIVERSITY-SCIENCES OF EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of the research is to assess the processes of self-rehabilitation and zoning of the territory of the Degtyarsky copper-pyrite deposit and the territory adjacent to the Elchevsk clarifying pond.The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the Degtyarskoye copper-pyrite deposit is located within the catchment area of the rivers flowing into the Volchikhin reservoir, which is the main source of drinking water supply in Yekaterinburg. The development of the deposit was completed in 1995, but so far the ecological situation is far from prosperous. Since 1999, within the former quarry of sh. "Pyrite" is the outpouring of acid mine waters, for the neutralization of which lime milk is used. Wastewater enters the Yelchevsky clarifier pond and is then discharged into the Volchikhin reservoir. Special measures for the rehabilitation of the territory were not carried out.Processing of multispectral images from the Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 satellites from 1986 to 2020, calculation of the vegetation index (NDVI), which is one of the most common indicators of vegetation vegetation activity.The flooded quarry sh. "Kolchedannaya", a waste heap sh. "Kapitalnaya-1" and sh. "Kapitalnaya-2", glin quarry, Yelchevsky pond-clarifier.On the waste heaps of mines, a very slow restoration of the vegetation cover is taking place; at present, vegetation is practically absent. The most prosperous state of the water area of the Elchevsky Pond was noted in 2007; in 2017 and 2020, it has a rich orange-red hue. The use of multispectral data made it possible to trace the change in the environmental situation within the depleted Degyatrsky mine, the objects of which continue to have a negative impact on groundwater, surface water and the general ecological state of the territory.

TI  - On deontology, duty and aestheticism
T2  - FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article raises the question of the place and role of deontology in philosophical discourse. In the works of the classics of deontological thought, we find different answers to this question: Aristotle understands delta epsilon omicron nu tau omicron sigma in the broadest context and seeks to combine "should be" (correct, established, "horizontal") and "ought to be" (corresponding to the model, the will of God, "vertical"); in the Kantian doctrine, duty-Pflicht as a vertical elevates a person above herself; J. Bentham criticizes the idea of duty as a fiction, "ought to" is criticized as an expression of violence and lays the foundations for consequentialism. The author of the article puts forward the thesis about the "inevitability of obligation", that is, the non-eliminativity of expressions of obligation from philosophical discourse: they play an effective role, transforming worldview into world-attitude, theory into practice, description into proscription. The ought to be ("should be") expresses the type of attitude that can be called "rejection" and can be seen to reveal the basis of what P.P. Gaidenko called "the tragedy of aestheticism" or the result of a contemplative and theoretical attitude to the world. It is characteristic of modernity, which does not abandon plans to transform (and nowadays technocratic "reassembly") the world. The possibility of such a world attitude is a distinctive feature of European philosophy, founded by the insurmountable gap between what is and what is due. The duty of action ("ought to do") is associated with the world-attitude as "acceptance" and a cardinal positive solution to the problem of the correlation between "ought to" and "can".

TI  - The Art of Doing Good or <i>On the Meaning of Philosophic Borrowings</i>
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - Amid the criticism of academic philosophy this article raises the question of what philosophy is capable of doing in order to achieve mutual understanding between cultures. Where shall reflexivity of a person, whose goal is to do good, be directed? What is the universal understanding of how to do good and whether Eurocentrism hinders its comprehension? While comparing two possible answers to these questions - the Kantian and the Buddhist one - the author is trying to avoid relativism and consumerism, where mutual understanding is either impossible or reduced to a relationship of worldview details exchange, to borrowings. Therefore, philosophic action is understood here as a matter of translation according to the model "the same but differently", where "differently" is associated with the knowledge of peculiarities of a different culture and "the same" is associated with the area of meaning. The European logic of meaning allows it to be expressed by a set of eternal (metaphysical) issues, to solve which free reflexivity may also turn to materials of another culture. The Kantian answer to the question "How to do Good?" has given a proactive lawmaker, which line of approach is implementation of the universal law of morality. Difficulties along this path make I.Kant consider virtue to be art and see "aesthetic mechanism" in it, ability to contemplate your own morals. Can a Kantian learn this art from Buddhists? Virtue for Vasubandhu is also a Path but there is no universal law along it and "giving Dharma" shall be done differently to different people. In addition, the abhidharmist does not separate "practice" of psychotechnics from absorption of "theory" and classification of dharmas, what European is prevented from understanding due to a different conceptual mold, another system of differences. Noting its specificity and answering the question of meaning of borrowings, the author expresses doubt in regards to its presence.

AB  - Cotton is one of the most economically significant crops in the South Asia region. Following the decline in cotton production in recent years, it is necessary to study and analyse cotton growth patterns by using modern precision agriculture techniques to enhance crop yield and quality. Multispectral imagery plays a vital role in estimating crop quantification by computing vegetation indices at different phenological stages of the crop. It facilitates in estimating plant health and impact on yield before the visible symptoms appear. In this study, four different vegetation indices maps are computed using two-band multispectral imagery acquired through Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The UAV multispectral data is collected from two fields with different sowing dates using Sentera NDVI single sensor. The variation in the vegetation indices map generated is analysed by vegetation index thresholding and k-means clustering. By using Sentinel-2A imagery, an average value of each vegetation index for every phenological stage is validated. The correlation coefficient of each vegetation index conveys a positive progression trend and validates the accuracy of UAV data computed results. In conclusion, vegetation indices computed using multispectral UAV imagery conveys vital information regarding the progression of crop phenology and growth pattern.

AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, our ability to obtain remote sensing data has been improved to an unprecedented level. We have entered an era of big data. Remote sensing data clear showing the characteristics of Big Data such as hyper spectral, high spatial resolution, and high time resolution, thus, resulting in a significant increase in the volume, variety, velocity and veracity of data. This paper proposes a feature supporting, salable, and efficient data cube for time series analysis application, and used the spatial feature data and remote sensing data for comparative study of the water cover and vegetation change. In this system, the feature data cube building and distributed executor engine are critical in supporting large spatiotemporal RS data analysis with spatial features. The feature translation ensures that the geographic object can be combined with satellite data to build a feature data cube for analysis. Constructing a distributed executed engine based on dask ensures the efficient analysis of large-scale RS data. This work could provide a convenient and efficient multidimensional data services for many remote sens-ing applications.

AB  - Since its inception in 2017, the European Space Agency's Phi-Lab has put some of its focus on Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR), and how such technologies can be exploited in the frame of Earth Observation (EO) use-cases. Together with NORCE, the Norwegian Research Centre, a setup has been developed and deployed physically in the Phi-Lab in 2018, based on the GeoViz software, which allows navigating a full 3D globe of the Earth and even flying to other planets/satellites (e.g. the Moon). Users are free to choose which locations to explore and, for each of those locations, which EO images/products to examine (Sentinel-2 band combinations, Sentinel-3 scenes and Sentinel1-derived products such as interferograms, coherence, intensity). GeoViz is also able to display 3D models (e.g. of spacecraft, buildings), point clouds (e.g. of cities, sites, inSAR showing soil subsidence), laser scans (e.g. of plantations) and even hyperspectral data. More recently, the hype around Digital Twins, and particularly the ESA Digital Twin Urban Pilot (DTUP) project, led to the generation of highly-detailed 3D model reconstructions of sites of interest (namely the ESA/ESRIN site and the city of Frascati), surveyed using drones. Using these 3D models partly as direct inputs, partly as inspiration, a second permanent VR/ XR installation was developed and deployed in the lab in 2021. This installation leverages the Unity game engine development platform, to produce an early extended reality (XR) precursor of a digital twin of the ESRIN campus. The ESRIN 3D model is integrated, through the Unity application, with real-time environmental data sensed in- situ by two different kinds of specialized device existing in ESRIN, one measuring air quality (PM25, PM10, CO2, NO2, NH3, CO, etc.) and one measuring vegetation health (NDVI, evapotranspiration, chlorophyl, etc.). The complete augmented model can then be explored using virtual reality headsets. Future plans include the implementation of an Augmented Reality experience using an Android mobile phone App, which would allow users present on-site to walk around and use their phone cameras for the augmented visualization and interaction experience.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the composition and functions of things used at the traditional sacrifices of the Trans-Kama Udmurts, the adherents of the ethnic religion from the Republic of Bashkortostan and the Perm Krai. Rites with sacrifices represent a vivid manifestation of the form of religious cult and involve an offering of sacrificial gifts (animals, things) to the deities and require the use of a wide range of objects of the material world like ritual dishes and utensils, working tools and devices, ritual clothing, textiles. The entire set of cult objects constitutes the material embodiment of ritual activity which clearly characterizes the worldview, evolution, and the current state of national culture. The results of the study show that the things used in the rituals are used for their utilitarian purpose while the ritual nature of their use endows them with symbolic functions, thereby preserving their sacred status. Comparison with historical data shows that the number, composition and functions of objects used for cult purposes have remained the same, but their types, shapes, material and manufacturing method have changed. The work was prepared on the basis of published and archival sources, the authors' own field ethnographic materials.

AB  - Hydraulics and hydrodynamics tools, along with remote sensing data, are used for flood modeling. Flood models rely on reliable ground data for calibration and validation purposes since factors contributing to floods are complex and affect the accuracy of models. Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) is one of the most used 1D and 2D flood modeling software. GeoHECRAS is the latest modified tool for flood modeling that uses HEC-RAS on its backend with a user-friendly interface that speeds up the process. This study used GeoHECRAS to simulate water levels downstream of the Guddu barrage on the Indus River (Pakistan). For calibration and validation of the model, water levels observed from the in-situ gauge downstream of the Guddu barrage were used. For calibrated model, the difference between simulated and observed water levels ranges from -0.1718 m to +0.1521 m. For the validated model, it was from -0.232 m to 0.138 m.

AB  - In the presented article, deep learning (DL) is employed on Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery to assess and delineate the wildfire-affected burnt area. The most important aspect is the use of densely layered capsule architecture as an alternative to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) and max pooling. The presented investigation is a practical capsule-based wildfire detection and burnt area segmentation. Moreover, the research work presents a comprehensive assessment of capsule-based segmentation architecture. Due to the limitation of freely available open access annotated data, a dataset is manually constructed from scratch. The proposed algorithm provides prognostic delineation of the burnt area with an overall accuracy of 96%. The quantitative measures demonstrate that the proposed capsule-based architecture outperforms other state-of-the-art segmentation models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+). The capsule-based architecture shows good promise and can be scaled to other similar topographic regions.

TI  - Sternotomy in thyroid surgery
T2  - Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: A bulky retrosternal goiter means for the surgeon to consider an extracervical approach, usually from a partial sternotomy.Methods: Retrospective evaluation of a group of thyroid operations requiring sternotomy in a ten-year period (year 2012-2021), in an attempt to predict the need for sternotomy.Results: We performed a total of 1254 thyroid operations, with partial sternotomy required in 11 cases (0.88%): in 6 women and 5 men aged 43-84 years (mean 73.1 years). For these, 3 total thyroidectomies and 6 hemithyroidectomies (lobectomies) were performed. In 2 cases, we operated on the mediastinal residue, or regenerate, after a previous thyroidectomy from the cervical approach. The duration of hospitalization was 5-14 days, once there was bleeding with the need for operative revision, otherwise the procedures were without complications, including phonation. The border of the lower part of the thyroid gland in relation to the upper border of the aortic arch was in the range of +20 to -22 mm. The mean was -8.5 mm.Conclusion: All sternotomy thyroidectomies performed by us had a close relationship to, or overlapped with the upper line of the aortic arch. Significantly retrosternal propagating goiters are mostly eufunctional (81.9 % in our group) and develop in patients in the seventh or eighth decade of life. Therefore, if only one lobe propagates intrathoracically, a hemithyroidectomy is sufficient. A carcinoma is rarely present; in one case in our group. We believe that the necessity of sternotomy cannot be accurately predicted, but it is necessary to be prepared for it, especially in the case of a goiter exceeding the level of the aortic arch. In case of greater retrosternal propagation, it is certainly appropriate to perform a CT, for surgical reasons (possibility of sternotomy, risk of leaving part of the gland) and anesthetic reasons (compression and deviation of the trachea).

AB  - Greenhouse gases (GHGs) play an important role in controlling local air pollution as well as climate change. In this study, we retrieved column-averaged dry-air (X) mole fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO) using a ground-based EM27/SUN Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The EM27/SUN spectrometers are widely in use in the COllaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON). The PROFFAST software provided by COCCON has been used to analyze the measured atmospheric solar absorption spectra. In this letter, the diurnal variation and the time series of daily averaged XCO2, XCH4, and XCO covering the period from December 2020 to May 2021 are analyzed. The maximum values of XCO2, XCH4, and XCO are observed to be 420.57 ppm, 1.93 ppm, and 170.40 ppb, respectively. Less diurnal but clear seasonal changes are observed during the study period. XCH4 and XCO from the Sentinel-5Precursor (S5P)/TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) are compared against the EM27/SUN retrievals. The correlation coefficient for the EM27/SUN retrieved XCH4 and XCO, with the S5P/TROPOMI products, are 0.75 and 0.94, respectively.

AB  - Distribution shift may pose significant challenges in Earth observation, especially when dealing with significantly different sensors like multispectral optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Deep learning models trained for optical image classification generally do not generalize well for SAR images. This is due to very marked differences between them. Though there is a considerable amount of works on domain adaptation, only few deal with such strong differences. Towards this, we propose a co-teaching based domain adaptation method using dual classifier head, a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier. The two classifier heads teach each other in an iterative manner, thus gradually adapting both of them for target classification. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on Sentinel 2 (optical) as source and Sentinel 1 (SAR) images as target - both product of Copernicus program of European Space Agency.

TI  - Change Detection in Image Time-Series Using Unsupervised LSTM
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning-based unsupervised change detection (CD) methods compare a prechange and a postchange image in deep feature space and require precise knowledge of the event date for selecting proper pre-/post-change images. However, in many applications changes may occur gradually over a span of time making pre-/post-dates difficult to establish or prior knowledge of event date is unknown. On the other hand, deep learning-based time-series analysis methods are generally supervised. Considering such scenarios, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning-based method to detect changes in an image time-series. The method does not make any assumption on the date of the occurrence of the change event. It treats CD as an anomaly detection problem by exploiting multilayer long short term memory (LSTM) network to learn a representation of the time series. The proposed method ingests a shuffled time series and uses an encoderx2013;decoder LSTM model to rearrange the input sequence in correct order. While the model fails to rearrange the changed pixels, unchanged data can be rearranged in the correct order. This enables the identification of the changed pixels. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we tested it on two multitemporal Sentinel-1 data sets over Brumadinho, Brazil, and Bhavanisagar, India.

AB  - Soil health is a fundamental condition in ensuring sustainable agriculture and maintaining food security. Hence, soil protection against degradation and intensive use is crucial for local governments. Salinization depicts one of the most common land degradation forms, requiring continuous monitoring to control and prevent its risks. This study aims to identify salinity levels in Hortobagyi National Park (HNP), using time series data retrieved from radar sensors, i.e., ERS1/2 and Sentinel-1 SAR. For this purpose, ground truth data were collected in the Hungarian Soil Monitoring System framework between 2000 and 2018 in the September-October period. Field data were used in combination with backscatter intensity values derived from SAR data. The preliminary results revealed a partial efficiency of radar imagery in salt detection with an outperformance of Sentinel-1 SAR compared to ERS-1/2 due to its higher resolution and its operation with a dual-polarized antenna which can identify better variation in salinity.

TI  - Integrating SAR and Optical Remote Sensing for Conservation-Targeted Wetlands Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) contains numerous depressional wetlands known as potholes that provide habitats for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species. Mapping these wetlands is essential for identifying viable waterfowl habitat and conservation planning scenarios, yet it is a challenging task due to the small size of the potholes, and the presence of emergent vegetation. This study develops an open-source process within the Google Earth Engine platform for mapping the spatial distribution of wetlands through the integration of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data with high-resolution (10-m) Sentinel-2 bands. We used two machine-learning algorithms (random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM)) to identify wetlands across the study area through supervised classification of the multisensor composite. We trained the algorithms with ground truth data provided through field studies and aerial photography. The accuracy was assessed by comparing the predicted and actual wetland and non-wetland classes using statistical coefficients (overall accuracy, Kappa, sensitivity, and specificity). For this purpose, we used four different out-of-sample test subsets, including the same year, next year, small vegetated, and small non-vegetated test sets to evaluate the methods on different spatial and temporal scales. The results were also compared to Landsat-derived JRC surface water products, and the Sentinel-2-derived normalized difference water index (NDWI). The wetlands derived from the RF model (overall accuracy 0.76 to 0.95) yielded favorable results, and outperformed the SVM, NDWI, and JRC products in all four testing subsets. To provide a further characterization of the potholes, the water bodies were stratified based on the presence of emergent vegetation using Sentinel-2-derived NDVI, and, after excluding permanent water bodies, using the JRC surface water product. The algorithm presented in the study is scalable and can be adopted for identifying wetlands in other regions of the world.

TI  - Limited-angle TOF-PET for intraoperative surgical applications: proof of concept and first experimental data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The intraoperative gamma probe (IPG) based on single gamma-ray detection remains the current gold standard modality for sentinel lymph node identification and tumor removal in cancer patients. However, IPGs do not meet the < 5% false negative rate (FNR) requirement, a key metric suggested by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). We aim to reduce FNR by using time of flight (TOF) PET detector technology in limited angle geometry system by using only two detector panels in coincidence. For proof of concept, we used two Hamamatsu TOF PET detector modules (C13500-4075YC-12) featuring 12 x 12 arrays of 4.14 x 4.14 x 20 mm(3) LFS crystal pixels with 4.2 mm pitch and coupled one-one to silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels. The measured detector coincidence timing resolution (CTR) was 271 ps FWHM for the whole detector. We 3D printed lesion phantom containing spheres 2-10 mm in diameter, representing lymph nodes, and placed it inside a 10-liter warm background water phantom. Experimental results showed that with subminute data acquisition, 6 mm diameter spheres could be identified in the image when a lesion phantom with a 10:1 activity ratio to background was used. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data by resolving 6 mm diameter spherical lesions with a 60 second acquisition time in a 25 cm deep background water phantom with a 10:1 activity ratio. As expected, the image quality improved as the CTR improved in the simulation and with decreasing background water phantom depth or increasing lesion-to-background activity ratio in the experiment. With the results presented here, we concluded that using a limited angle TOF PET detector system is a major step forward for intraoperative applications in that lesion detectability is beyond what conventional gamma-and NIR-based probes could achieve.

AB  - Above ground biomass (AGB) maps were estimated directly from microwave brightness temperatures (TB) using a machine learning approach. The accuracy of AGB retrievals from Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is explored using both a multi-angular (using TBs products from the SMOS mission) and multi-frequency approach (using multi frequency measurements from the AMSR-E mission), an additional ANN inversion including optical indexes (MODIS-DVI) is also discussed.Higher incidence angles have been shown to provide more information during the inversion process for AGB estimates than lower angles. Retrievals from the multi-angular lower-requency inversion (SMOS - 1.4GHz) performed better than any individual higher-frequency retrievals. The addition of multi-frequency TBs (AMSR-E) to lower-frequency multi-ngular TBs improves the performance of ANN models (from R-2 similar to 0.94 to 0.96). Adding MODIS-NDVI to the inversion process improves the performance in an additional similar to 0.05%.

AB  - Carbonate outcrops are widely studied due to their characteristic analogous to oil and gas reservoirs. Analyzes made with data from these outcrops are used to assist in the description of reservoirs located at great depths. These rocky exposures can be easily detected in satellite images using machine learning. Considering the diversity of techniques used in the identification/classification of features on the satellite image data, this work aimed to evaluate the best machine learning technique for identifying carbonate outcrops in Landsat 8 data, considering the carbonate outcrops from the Jandaira formation, in northeast Brazil. We employed techniques like Grid Search, cross-validation, and validation statistics like Friedman and Nemenyi. Considering the metrics F1 score and Mathews Correlation Coefficient, the MLP technique presented the best results, achieving a F1 score of 0.823, against the SVM with a F1 score of 0.810 and the Random Forest technique with a F1 score of 0.812.

TI  - Risk factors for lymphedema after breast surgery: A prospective cohort study in the era of sentinel lymph node biopsy.
T2  - Breast disease
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Observational Study
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Objective was to investigate the incidence of lymphedema after breast cancer treatment and to analyze the risk factors involved in a tertiary level hospital.METHODS: Prospective longitudinal observational study over 3 years post-breast surgery. 232 patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer at our institution between September 2013 and February 2018. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) were mandatory in this cohort. In total, 201 patients met the inclusion criteria and had a median follow-up of 31 months (range, 1-54 months). Lymphedema was diagnosed by circumferential measurements and truncated cone calculations. Patients and tumor characteristics, shoulder range of motion limitation and local and systemic therapies were analyzed as possible risk factors for lymphedema.RESULTS: Most cases of lymphedema appeared in the first 2 years. 13.9% of patients developed lymphedema: 31% after ALND and 4.6% after SLNB (p <0.01), and 46.7% after mastectomy and 11.3% after breast-conserving surgery (p <0.01). The lymphedema rate increased when axillary radiotherapy (RT) was added to radical surgery: 4.3% for SLNB alone, 6.7% for SLNB + RT, 17.6% for ALND alone, and 35.2% for ALND + RT (p <0.01). In the multivariate analysis, the only risk factors associated with the development of lymphedema were ALND and mastectomy, which had hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 7.28 (2.92-18.16) and 3.9 (1.60-9.49) respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The main risk factors for lymphedema were the more radical surgeries (ALND and mastectomy). The risk associated with these procedures appeared to be worsened by the addition of axillary radiotherapy. A follow-up protocol in patients with ALND lasting at least two years, in which special attention is paid to these risk factors, is necessary to guarantee a comprehensive control of lymphedema that provides early detection and treatment.

TI  - Monitoring Cropland Phenology on Google Earth Engine Using Gaussian Process Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring cropland phenology from optical satellite data remains a challenging task due to the influence of clouds and atmospheric artifacts. Therefore, measures need to be taken to overcome these challenges and gain better knowledge of crop dynamics. The arrival of cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) has enabled us to propose a Sentinel-2 (S2) phenology end-to-end processing chain. To achieve this, the following pipeline was implemented: (1) the building of hybrid Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) retrieval models of crop traits optimized with active learning, (2) implementation of these models on GEE (3) generation of spatiotemporally continuous maps and time series of these crop traits with the use of gap-filling through GPR fitting, and finally, (4) calculation of land surface phenology (LSP) metrics such as the start of season (SOS) or end of season (EOS). Overall, from good to high performance was achieved, in particular for the estimation of canopy-level traits such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content, with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) of 9% and 10%, respectively. By means of the GPR gap-filling time series of S2, entire tiles were reconstructed, and resulting maps were demonstrated over an agricultural area in Castile and Leon, Spain, where crop calendar data were available to assess the validity of LSP metrics derived from crop traits. In addition, phenology derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as reference. NDVI not only proved to be a robust indicator for the calculation of LSP metrics, but also served to demonstrate the good phenology quality of the quantitative trait products. Thanks to the GEE framework, the proposed workflow can be realized anywhere in the world and for any time window, thus representing a shift in the satellite data processing paradigm. We anticipate that the produced LSP metrics can provide meaningful insights into crop seasonal patterns in a changing environment that demands adaptive agricultural production.

AB  - Urbanization is often accompanied by succession of underlying land cover with impervious surfaces. Built intensification significantly alters the surface energy budget making cities warmer than their outlying suburbs, which signifies an ecological deterioration. Landsat imageries with scene covering Abuja city is processed using Google Earth Engine platform to estimate land cover and land surface temperature over the span of 30 years (1990-2020). Dimensions of land cover transitions were examined in-terms losses, gains, swaps, net-change and persistency. Thermal signature of each land cover type was estimated using land surface temperature. Urban thermal field variance index is computed from land surface temperature to evaluate the thermal conditions in the city. Results indicate that net-changes for built-up exhibited gains of 40% while agricultural land, bare-land and vegetation exhibited loss of 27%, 7% and 8% respectively. Built-up also showed the highest proportion of persistence (12%). Results shows that land surface temperature has increased by 2.01 degrees C from 1990 to 2020. Agricultural land, bare-land and built-up were found with the highest temperature. Lowest temperature was found in waterbody and vegetation. The ecological evaluation showed that 47% of the city is experiencing bad to worst thermal condition. These findings provide further information that can contribute towards an informed spatial planning in cities.

TI  - Mapping Blue and Red Color-Coated Steel Sheet Roof Buildings over China Using Sentinel-2A/B MSIL2A Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and efficiently updated information on color-coated steel sheet (CCSS) roof materials in urban areas is of great significance for understanding the potential impact, challenges, and issues of these materials on urban sustainable development, human health, and the environment. Thanks to the development of Earth observation technologies, remote sensing (RS) provides abundant data to identify and map CCSS materials with different colors in urban areas. However, existing studies are still quite challenging with regards to the data collection and processing costs, particularly in wide geographical areas. Combining free access high-resolution RS data and a cloud computing platform, i.e., Sentinel-2A/B data sets and Google Earth Engine (GEE), this study aims at CCSS material identification and mapping. Specifically, six novel spectral indexes that use Sentinel-2A/B MSIL2A data are proposed for blue and red CCSS material identification, namely the normalized difference blue building index (NDBBI), the normalized difference red building index NDRBI, the enhanced blue building index (EBBI), the enhanced red building index (ERBI), the logical blue building index (LBBI) and the logical red building index (LRBI). These indexes are qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated on a very large number of urban sites all over the P.R. China and compared with the state-of-the-art redness and blueness indexes (RI and BI, respectively). The results demonstrate that the proposed indexes, specifically the LRBI and LBBI, are highly effective in visual evaluation, clearly detecting and discriminating blue and red CCSS covers from other urban materials. Results show that urban areas from the northern parts of P.R. China have larger proportions of blue and red CCSS materials, and areas of blue and red CCSS material buildings are positively correlated with population and urban size at the provincial level across China.

TI  - RECEPTION OF THE ANCIENT MYTH OF THE ATREIDES IN WOODY ALLEN'S <i>CASSANDRA'S DREAM</i>
T2  - IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern Western artistic culture receives the Antiquity as the ancient myth. The myth of the Atreides enjoys an increased attention of playwrights in Western Europe and the United States, since it raises the universal issues of crime and punishment, awareness of guilt and assertion of truth. This article focuses on the reception of the Atreides myth in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream. The article analyses the cultural dialogue between Antiquity and Modernity: the director has transferred the ancient plot to modern reality and endowed the Americans with the features of ancient heroes. The plot of the film develops around a murder committed by the brothers for financial gain. It correlates with the murder of Agamemnon as well as his wife and Aegisthus. Ian's determination is reminiscent of Elektra's behavior: he incites his brother to commit a crime and feels no repentance after the murder has occurred. Like Euripides's Orestes, the other brother, Terry, cannot calm down after the crime, saying that he repents and wants to open himself to the police in order to suffer a well-deserved punishment. In the conflict between the brothers, killing a brother is the only way out of the situation, although Ian says that he feels the same "strange vision": he must kill again. While ancient heroes act under the will of gods, which gives the impression of conscious and controlled actions, modern heroes are driven by circumstances. While heroes of ancient literature take murders for granted, as a legitimate revenge or even a feat, modern artistic culture focuses on the ethical side of the bloodshed. A modern human is dominated by a new Christian morality, which though oftentimes unrealized, affects human desires and functions as a source of ethical reflections. The story of the heroes, consisting of a chain of uncontrollable events, would seem to confirm the unpredictability of life and the total dependence of people on circumstances. Fatalism is an integral part of the ancient worldview: it is not by chance that "Fate" is personified and becomes a separate character in ancient Greek tragedy. However, modern culture affirms human independence and freedom, which Terry discoveres at a moment of spiritual enlightenment after committing a crime, followed by utter repentance. The fmale of the film is strikingly different from the ancient interpretations of the myth of the Atreides: the killer-heroes die. The reception of antiquity in American culture of the 21st century is a reflection on what determines the behavior of a modem person in a critical situation, similar to that in ancient mythology, as well as what is the modem attitude of a criminal to their crime. Appealing to the ancient myth, Woody Allen proves that Christian morality allows making the right, "human" decision even in the most difficult circumstances. At the same time, he shows the duality of modem culture: the imposed ideals of mass culture beguile a morally developed person, who gets illusory freedom for a lost self-identity.

M3  - Article
AB  - The resilience capacity of vegetation in the Yucatan Peninsula is influenced by the winds and rains of tropical cyclones. There are no recent long-term studies on cyclonic impacts on natural vegetation in the region despite their significant effects on infrastructure and biodiversity. The objective of this study was to identify the area impacted by 21 tropical cyclones between 2000 and 2012 and to quantify the recovery capacity of the vegetation by using standardized anomalies of the normalized vegetation index (aNDVI). MODIS images from NASA's "Terra and Aqua" satellites were used to calculate the damaged areas by analyzing the frequency of pixels corresponding to each type of vegetation per impact zone. The results showed that in 67% of the tropical cyclones, the impacts on vegetation were negative-a decrease in aNDVI-but in 33% of the cyclones, positive effects were recorded-an increase in aNDVI-. The lapse rate of vegetation recovery varied in 52% of the cases; vegetation recovered between two and three weeks after each cyclonic event, while 38% of the cases recovered within four to five weeks of the cyclone landfall. Tropical forests suffered the most significant effects, followed by hydrophilic vegetation. The most destructive hurricanes were Emily, Wilma, and Dean. The rate of recovery laps ranged from 4 to 10 weeks after the hurricane hit. The results could improve assessments of vegetation vulnerability against severe hydrometeorological events and establish priority zones for prompt inspection.

AB  - Changes in glacier area and length need to be precisely assessed to be valuable as indicators of climate change. The Iztaccihuatl-Popocatepetl National Park covers 39,819.08 hectares and is located in the central Trans-Mexican Neovolcanic Belt in central Mexico. The peaks have maximum heights of 5,280 (Iztaccihuatl) and 5,482 meters (Popocatepetl). In this study to measure snow coverage, the normalised differential snow index (NDSI) was applied to data from 1985 to 2021 obtained from Landsat 5-TM and Landsat 8-OLI with fine spatial resolution (30 m). Snow coverage as measured by the NDSI ranged from 5 km2 to 122 km2. The maximum area of coverage in the study period was observed in July, 2010. Throughout the study years we found snowfall in each month of the year and snowfall in the park each year. It should be noted that the glaciers of the Izta-Popo National Park supply water to more than 13 municipalities in the states of Mexico State, Puebla, Tlaxcala and Morelos, and that these municipalities have experienced exponential urban growth over the past 20 years.

AB  - Empirical models including the Angstrom-Prescott (AP) model have been used to estimate solar radiation at sites, which would support a wide use of crop models. The objective of this study was to estimate two sets of solar radiation estimates using the AP coefficients derived for climate zone (APFrere) and specific site (APChoi), respectively. The daily solar radiation was estimated at 18 sites in Korea where long-term measurements of solar radiation were available. In the present study, daily solar radiation and sunshine duration were collected for the period from 2012 to 2021. Daily weather data including maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall were also obtained to prepare input data to a process-based crop model, CERES-Rice model included in Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). It was found that the daily estimates of solar radiation using the climate zone specific coefficient, SFrere, had significantly less error than those using site-specific coefficients SChoi (p<0.05). The cumulative values of SFrere for the period from march to September also had less error at 55% of study sites than those of SChoi. Still, the use of SFrere and SChoi as inputs to the CERES-Rice model resulted in slight differences between the outcomes of crop growth simulations, which had no significant difference between these outputs. These results suggested that the AP coefficients for the temperate climate zone would be preferable for the estimation of solar radiation. This merits further evaluation studies to compare the AP model with other sophisticated approaches such as models based on satellite data.

M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing interest in citizen science, this paper discusses how amateur naturalism, especially amateur entomology, is placed within citizen science discourses. Through a case study of amateur entomology in Finland, the paper discusses amateurs' diverse motivations for engaging with nature. The paper discusses especially the affective and ethical aspects of amateur entomology and its implications for citizen science. The discussion is based on an ethnographic study of an entomologist society. The paper suggests that amateur naturalism cannot be reduced to any single definition of citizen science, but amateur entomologists enact different epistemologies as knowledge producers and active citizens. The amateurs are often motivated by an ethical 'first contract' with nature. The rich amateur culture may democratize and 're-enchant' science, provided the scientist worldview of superior data is not allowed to conceal the diversity of amateur motivations.

AB  - Soil is an essential, non-renewable natural resource that provides vital goods and services for ecosystems, human life, and the production of crops and fuels. The phenomena of land consumption and land use change have a considerable impact on ecosystems. In addition, the poor and confusing regulatory framework contributes to the spread of processes related to soil sealing, such as the wild installation of wind farms, resulting in an increasing fragmentation of the territory with related phenomena of soil degradation.The research work has proposed an innovative methodological approach on issues related to land consumption and land use change, based on a robust territorial and landscape study. The whole research has been focused on the use and integration between geographic information systems and remote sensing techniques for the study of the territory. The increasing availability of cartographic data and the evolution of satellite data is the basis of a system that provides a continuous phase of analysis of the phenomenon. The work defines the picture of the phenomenon in Basilicata, investigating various aspects of land consumption, going into specific detail of some sample areas. The objective was the application of remote sensing techniques and change detection analysis for the qualitative and quantitative estimation of land take related to degradation phenomena. The methodologies and data developed in this work, could be the basis for the creation of a regional database on soil consumption, which could be made up of a robust infrastructure of spatial data and could provide a service and a system of data collection and collect data and reports from citizens, companies, institutions, research organizations, would support public bodies in the definition of policies, strategies and actions aimed at the containment of the phenomenon and would implement, in addition, measures of limitation, prevention, monitoring and mitigation of the same.

AB  - R. Santelices-Moya, A. Cabrera-Ariza, P. Silva-Flores, and R.M. Navarro-Cerrillo. 2022. Assessment of a wildfire in the remaining Nothofagus alessandrii forests, an endangered species of Chile, based on satellite Sentinel-2 images. Int. J. Agric. Nat. Resour. 85-96. Nothofagus alessandrii is an endangered species that is naturally distributed in a Mediterranean environment in central Chile. In recent years, this territory has been subject to the effects of climate change, especially an increase in summer temperatures and prolonged periods of drought. In the summer of 2017, there was a fire of great magnitude consuming 184,000 ha, which affected the forests of N. alessandrii. This study assessed the severity and recovery dynamics of postfire vegetation by using spectral indices from Sentinel-2 images. The differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), relative differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR), and relativized burn ratio (RBR) were calculated before and after the fire and, later, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) before the fire and during three consecutive years after the fire was utilized. The accuracy of the fire severity classifications was estimated using the kappa test (p<0.05). The three severity indices showed a similar classification in severity assessment and postfire response. The low-medium burn area in N. alessandrii forests ranged between 111.2 ha (RdNBR) and 130.3 ha (dNBR), and the high effect was between 46.1 ha (dNBR) and 66.0 ha (RdNBR), which was equivalent in both cases, approximately 11% of the total. Regarding the NDVI, vegetation recovery after three years of the fire showed a systematic return to prefire conditions. The assessment of the effect of a mega forest fire on the remaining forests of N. alessandrii based on Sentinel-2 images offers the opportunity for a better understanding of the severity of damage and the behavior of vegetation after the fire. All this information will help in a better recovery of these forests.

The technique combines Sentinel 1 and AMSR2 data with the aim of enhancing the spatial resolution of the vegetation biomass, expressed herein as Plant Water Content (PWC), and Soil Moisture (SM) products generated from AMSR2 by the HydroAlgo algorithm developed at IFAC.Validation is still in progress; however, the results obtained so far demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed disaggregation in mapping both PWC and SM at 100m resolution, thus overcoming the problem of coarse spatial resolution that hampers the potential of satellite microwave radiometers as the AMSR2 for operational applications in small scale basins.

TI  - On the Use of COSMO-SkyMed X-Band SAR for Estimating Snow Water Equivalent in Alpine Areas: A Retrieval Approach Based on Machine Learning and Snow Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at estimating the dry snow water equivalent (SWE) by using X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) satellite constellation. The time series of CSK acquisitions have been collected during the dry snow period in the Alto Adige test site, in the Italian Alps, during the winter seasons from 2013 to 2015 and from 2019 to 2021. The SAR data have been analyzed and compared with the in situ measurements to understand the X-band SAR sensitivity to SWE, which has been further assessed by dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) model simulations. The sensitivity analysis provided the basis for addressing the SWE retrieval from the CSK data, by exploiting two different machine learning (ML) techniques, namely, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR). To ensure statistical independence of training and validation processes, the algorithms are trained and tested using SWE predictions of the fully distributed snow model AMUNDSEN as reference data and are subsequently validated on the experimental dataset. Due to its influence on the CSK estimates, the effect of forest canopy was accounted for in the analysis. Depending on the algorithm, the validation resulted in a correlation coefficient 0.78 <= R <= 0.91 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) 55.5 mm <= RMSE <= 87.4 mm between estimated and in situ SWE. Further analysis and validation are needed; however, the obtained results seem suggesting the CSK constellation as an effective tool for the retrieval of the dry SWE in alpine areas.

TI  - Retrieval of nearshore bathymetry from Sentinel-1 SAR data in high energetic wave coasts: The Portuguese case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to derive bathymetry using remote sensing techniques enables rapid and cost-efficient mapping of large coastal areas. This contribution focuses on the application of both fast Fourier transform (FFT) and wavelet spectral analysis to obtain satellite-derived bathymetry maps of the nearshore, from freely available and easily accessible Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with 10 m pixel resolution. For this purpose, an extension of 220 km of the Portuguese west coast is analyzed using six satellite images obtained during the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. This extension allows to assess the applicability to coastal sectors with distinct geomorphological constraints. The peak wave periods corresponding to the acquisition of these images approxi-mately range between 11 and 16 s. The spectral analysis is carried to estimate the water depths in near-shore water regions from the observed wavelength patterns. This signature of the sea sur -face, reflected in the variations of the wavelengths, is captured by the satellite images, making it possible to infer the underlying bathymetry. The bathymetric estimates obtained from both methodologies are compared with data extracted from the Coastal Nautical Charts provided by the Portuguese Hydrographic Institute. Wavelet image processing methodology shows very pos-itive results, particularly extending the depth inversion limits of the FFT methodology, allowing to obtain bathymetric data for the entire shoaling zone where the wavelength patterns are visible. The achieved results also highlight that both FFT and wavelet methodologies are dependent from the seabed slope. For gentle slopes, the inferred depths from 2018 SAR images lead to relative errors between 2.5 and 20% when compared with the observed isobaths (10, 20 and 30 m). For steeper slopes, the errors are generally greater than 20% and increase with depth. The capabilities of the wavelet methodology to map shallow marine environments for high energetic coasts seems promising, regarding research purposes and management interventions.

TI  - IDENTIFICATION OF LEVELS OF ANTHROPIZATION AND ITS IMPLICATIONS IN THE PROCESS OF DESERTIFICATION IN THE CAATINGA BIOME (JEREMOABO, BAHIA-BRAZIL)
T2  - CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is one of the most serious current environmental problems and corresponds to the impoverishment and decrease of moisture in sandy soils located in regions with a sub-humid, arid and semiarid climate, with its main causes related to climatic variations and the resulting negative impacts of human activities. Studies show that the soils located in the Brazilian semiarid and especially in the Caatinga biome have been suffering an intense process of desertification due to the replacement of natural vegetation as a result of economic activities. Most municipalities that have an economy based on agropastoral activities are at the centre of desertification in several centres in Brazil. Based on this context and considering that the original vegetation cover is a preponderant factor for soil conservation, and subsequently for the maintenance of the ecological stability of the Caatinga biome, this work aimed to map the vegetation cover of the Vaza-Barris watershed corresponding to the municipality of Jeremoabo (Bahia-Brazil), with the purpose of identifying and quantifying, in terms of surface, the main types of interaction between human activities and the remnants of the vegetation cover, listing the potential impacts that have a direct consequence on the desertification processes. The delimitation of the vegetation cover was the result processing Sentinel 2A satellite images and the use of the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index - SAVI. Five thematic classes representative of the study area were identified, classified according to the increasing level of anthropization that allowed us to conclude that desertification causes damage to agriculture, making the areas unproductive, as well as excessive agriculture with inappropriate practices causes the loss of fertility of the soils, aggravating the desertification process. With this, the environmental and social quality is threatened, considering that the main source of income in the municipality of Jeremoabo comes from agricultural activities and these are dependent on climatic conditions, soil conservation and water resources.

AB  - Agricultural areas are naturally affected by significant variations within relatively short time intervals, in accordance with the growing season. These dynamics could, in principle, be exploited to classify different types of crops. Thus, this study aims to investigate methodologies and results of crop type classification making use of phenological information extracted from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. Vegetation indices (VI) retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery are evaluated to track the year-round vegetation behavior. Starting from a multi-temporal image series of the same scene, the phenological profiles can be extracted and introduced into a supervised classification process to detect crop fields, discriminating among different species. Following this, we propose a cross-correlation based model that, using a priori information from ground training data, searches for the best matching phenology. When compared to machine learning models for crop classification, the one proposed in this study can provide useful information about phenology that can be stored and used for better monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crops species through the future years and guiding agricultural management accordingly. Our case studies are the regions of Bothaville and Harrismith, located in South Africa, and the region of Jendouba in Tunisia. The results for the Bothaville region show 89.19% of user accuracy on the main crop type classification (maize crops). For beans and sorghum, the confusion matrix attests 93% and 74% of accuracy respectively, even if their statistics are less significant due to the limited number of available ground data for secondary crops.

TI  - Developing Multi-Source Indices to Discriminate between Native Tropical Forests, Oil Palm and Rubber Plantations in Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 18 years, Indonesia has experienced significant deforestation due to the expansion of oil palm and rubber plantations. Accurate land cover maps are essential for policymakers to track and manage land change to support sustainable forest management and investment decisions. An automatic digital processing (ADP) method is currently used to develop land cover change maps for Indonesia, based on optical imaging (Landsat). Such maps produce only forest and non-forest classes, and often oil palm and rubber plantations are misclassified as native forests. To improve accuracy of these land cover maps, this study developed oil palm and rubber plantation discrimination indices using the integration of Landsat-8 and synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1 images. Sentinel-1 VH and VV difference (>7.5 dB) and VH backscatter intensity were used to discriminate oil palm plantations. A combination of Landsat-8 NDVI, NDMI with Sentinel-1 VV and VH were used to discriminate rubber plantations. The improved map produced four land cover classes: native forest, oil palm plantation, rubber plantation, and non-forest. High-resolution SPOT 6/7 imagery and ground truth data were used for validation of the new classified maps. The map had an overall accuracy of 92%; producer's accuracy for all classes was higher than 90%, except for rubber (65%), and user's accuracy was over 80% for all classes. These results demonstrate that indices developed from a combination of optical and radar images can improve our ability to discriminate between native forest and oil palm and rubber plantations in the tropics. The new mapping method will help to support Indonesia's national forest monitoring system and inform monitoring of plantation expansion.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
AB  - Open-pit tin mining systems in Bangka Island have an outrageous impact due to massive changes in the landscape. The land clearing process in the coastal area before the mining activity and its tailings might cause the mangrove disruption. However, to date, spatially-distributed information on mangrove disturbance due to mining is limited. This research hence aims to fill this gap using remote sensing technology. Trends/dynamics in mangrove disturbance and recovery are studied for the period 1988 to 2021 using the LandTrendr-algorithm implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform. NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio), NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were used as vegetation indicators to detect the disturbance in mangroves areas. The results show that a significant disturbance occurred, shown by the decrease in NBR, NDMI, NDVI, and EVI values. Some observation areas are still experiencing ongoing disturbance by the end of observing time (2021).

TI  - MODIS solar diffuser calibration strategies for the post orbital drift era
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - MODIS is an imaging spectroradiometer onboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites with visible to short-wave infrared capability enabled through 20 reflective solar bands (RSB) in the wavelength range of 400 to 2200 nm. RSB gain changes are monitored by using observations of a fully sunlit solar diffuser (SD) for the on-orbit radiometric calibration. SD signal changes, due to degradation of the SD surface, are monitored by using the SD Stability Monitor (SDSM), which has 9 detectors in the wavelength range of 400 to 936 nm. These calibration approaches depend on the geometry of the spacecraft's orbit. Both Terra and Aqua have recently started to exit their respective constellations and are (or soon will be) in the process of drifting from their nominal orbits. These orbital changes will cause changes in the solar diffuser (SD) and solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM) viewing geometry and calibration conditions. This, in turn, will drive a variation in the calibration parameters used to calculate reference adjustments for the MODIS reflective solar bands (RSB). We examine the expected effect of orbital drift on the reflectance and transmittance functions, the evaluation of on-going SDSM detector response, the variation of SD surface incidence angle ranges, and the estimation of fully-illuminated observing condition for SD signal monitoring.

TI  - Pluralism versus Pluralization. How the Protection of Cultural Diversity Can Turn Against New Forms of Religious Diversity
T2  - COLOMBIA INTERNACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective/Context: This paper examines the arguments of the Constitutional Court of Colombia in a sentence declaring that Pentecostalism represents a threat to indigenous cultures and to the country's cultural diversity. The sentence was issued in 1998, a few years after the political Constitution (1991) declared that Colombia is a pluralist nation that protects the cultural diversity of the country and the right to religious freedom. Methodology: A qualitative and hermeneutical study of the sentence was implemented to understand the arguments presented by the Court. Subsequently, a critical analysis of those arguments was carried out, questioning the pluralist presuppositions related to key categories such as "indigenous cultures," "religion," and "diversity." Conclusions: The pluralist institution has been unable to recognize the dynamic and manifold realities of lived religion, as well as the problems related to the double marginalization of a religious minority within an ethnic minority. Furthermore, the pluralist imperative to protect cultural diversity places limits upon alterity and promotes new forms of exclusion. Originality: The jurisprudence under scrutiny is not studied in its legal or ethical dimensions-as it has been done in the past-but as the implementation of a pluralist ideology grounded in a certain worldview. Thus, pluralism is critically examined in its ontological, axiological, epistemological, and praxeological principles.

M3  - Article
AB  - Marine debris is a serious problem for marine ecosystems and related coastal activities. We carry out a study using in-situ debris clean-up data (collected by a local Japanese company) together with high spatial resolution satellite images to determine how well the satellite images can be used to estimate the amount and type of debris deposited on the beaches of the island in southern Japan. We use machine learning techniques to analyze the satellite images and find that Shannon's entropy computed from World-View 2 and 3 imagery from Maxar Corporation yields a useful detection and mapping of the coastal debris when compared with the in-situ clean-up data. We also assign a debris concentration to each satellite image pixel to visualize the distribution of the debris. The algorithm linking the satellite images to the ground truth clean-up data can now be used in areas, where no ground truth data are available.

TI  - Genesis of the Image of Seerkeen Sesen in the Olonkho Epic
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article attempts to reconstruct the genesis of the image of the elder Seerkeen Sesen, presented in the mythological outline of a major genre of Yakut folklore - the olonkho epic. Research materials included the texts of olonkho records from different times, namely the pre-revolutionary and Soviet periods. A phased analysis demonstrated the formation of the image of Seerkeen Sesen by layering elements of various historical eras. The image goes back to the female prototype of the fruiting forces of mother earth, and further evolves into the image of the giver of souls, the bearer of secret knowledge. Subsequent development, influenced by shamanic cosmology, contributed to the emergence of a wise old man who predicted the fate of the world. A later interpretation of the anthropomorphic image is associated with the attribution of the functions of the inventor of writing (equivalent to the creative act of a cultural hero). The work shows the complication and dismemberment of the initial prototype of the syncretic worldview; therefore, there is a clear genetic connection of the image in question with other olonkho characters - the mistress of earth, the deity of hunting, the thunder god, the creator god - is indicated. As a result, a conclusion was made about the complex genesis of the mythological image, which embodies chthonic, cosmic, zoomorphic, animistic features, as well as the features of the demiurge and a cultural hero, linked by the specific function of a mediator between the worlds, and classifies him as an immortal deity.

TI  - Global Environmental Issues: Food and Agriculture Education to Address Food Loss and Waste, Aiming at a Sustainable Supply Chain.
T2  - Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - It is estimated that during FY 2018, food waste of 25.31 million tons and food loss of 6 million tons occurred in Japan. Of this total amount, 3.24 million tons of waste was generated from business, including the food manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and restaurant industries, and 2.76 million tons of waste was generated from households. Thus, it is crucial to mitigate both upstream and downstream food loss. As consumption patterns greatly influence not only downstream but also upstream food loss, special emphasis must be placed on increasing consumers' awareness of this global issue, and several programs have been initiated to this end. Our research reveals that alongside awareness, enhancing consumers' skills is of vital importance to efficiently reduce downstream food loss. Additionally, business operators must invest in improving the skills of those in charge to minimize food loss in commercial setups. Educating both consumers and businesses with the requisite skills to lessen food loss is equally essential. The authors are developing impactful serious games to help impart such education. These include a vegetable supply chain game (Veggie Mart Game), where consumers are players, and a milk supply chain game (Milky-Chain Game), where businesses are players. This paper introduces the authors' current research on reduction of food loss.

TI  - Study of Atomic Oxygen Airglow Intensities and Air Temperature near Mesopause Obtained by Ground-Based and Satellite Instruments above Baikal Natural Territory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The research studied the comparison of the night air temperatures and the atomic oxygen airglow intensities at the mesopause obtained with satellite and ground-based instruments. Satellite data used in this study were obtained with the SABER limb-scanning radiometer operating aboard the TIMED satellite. Data of ground-based monitoring were obtained using the KEO Scientific "Arinae" Fabry-Perot interferometer adapted for aeronomic research. Since an interferometer detects parameters of the 557.7 nm line for the entire emission layer, it is not quite appropriate to perform a direct comparison between the upper atmospheric temperature obtained from ground-based observations and that from a satellite at a particular height. To compare temperatures correctly, the effective temperature must be calculated based on satellite data. The effective temperature is a height-averaged temperature profile with the weight factors equal to the 557.7 nm line intensity at relevant heights. The height profile of intensity of this natural green airglow of the upper atmosphere is calculated from the height profile of atomic oxygen concentration. Data on chemical composition and air temperature at the mesopause from SABER were used to calculate the profiles. The night intensity of the 557.7 nm emission obtained from satellite data in this way was in good accordance with the results of ground-based observations, but the temperatures were different. The reason for temperature discrepancy was assumed to lie in the incorrect position of the intensity maximum of the reconstructed emission layer. According to our calculations based on SABER data, the intensity peak was observed at the height of 94-95 km. By shifting it relative to the SABER temperature height profile, we re-calculated the effective temperatures and compared them with the interferometer data. The best coincidence between seasonal temperature variations obtained using the proposed method was achieved when the maximum of the reconstructed 557.7 nm intensity height profile was shifted to 97 km, but it could not eliminate minor local differences in temperature behavior.

AB  - Introduction. Air pollution heterogeneity and rapid urbanization impose numerous constraints on available near-surface air quality monitoring. The solution for effective warning comes with the integration of different data, including remote sensing. Satellite data cannot answer whether dangerous pollution levels are observed; however, it provides a complete picture and may detect air pollution transportation towards or away from cities. The possibilities for effective near-real time (NRTI) monitoring have significantly improved with the launch of the Sentinel-5P satellite. The study aimed to describe the developed system for NRTI air pollution monitoring over Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rig, Kyiv, and Odesa based on NO2 and CO data derived from the Sentinel-5P satellite.Data and methodology. The NRTI System was developed for tropospheric NO2 and total CO column number densities based on the Sentinel-5P NRTI products. After satellite scanning of Ukrainian territory, the NRTI System goes live in 2-3 hours. It is fully automatic, and modules were written using Python, VB.NET, and batch-scripting.Results. The NRTI System includes four main phases: preparatory, source data downloading, processing and post-processing with visualization, archiving, and result distribution among users. Source data filtering with a quality assurance index and downscaling with linear kriging interpolation were developed. The output of the NRTI System is data in regular grids with a spatial resolution of 0.02 degrees x0.02 degrees. Based on the NRTI System work during October - December 2021, we conducted preliminary analyses to understand the possibilities of data usage. Higher NO2 content was observed in Kyiv and Kharkiv, where traffic emissions play a crucial role in air quality worsening. The use of daily time series allowed the detection of an increase in NO2 variance during the heating season, as well as plume distribution from cities to rural areas due to the prevailing wind. CO content is more homogeneous; however, higher values were observed in industrial Kryvyi Rig and Odesa. It is emphasized the huge impact of shipping CO emissions on air quality in Odesa. The temporal averaging of the NRTI System output allowed us to define the most polluted districts within the cities of interest. We intend to continue developing the presented NRTI System and develop the same algorithms for all cities with populations greater than 500 000 people in order to provide operational air pollution monitoring based on satellite data.

TI  - PERSPECTIVES FOR SOIL MAPPING AND MONITORING BASED ON INTERPOLATION OF POINT DATA AND REMOTE SENSING METHODS
T2  - Vestnik Moskovskogo Universiteta Seriya 17 Pochvovedenie
M3  - Article
AB  - The current state of the problem of soil mapping is considered. It is shown that there has been a replacement of traditional soil mapping methods by methods based on geoinformation digital and remote sensing technologies. The main advantages and disadvantages of the currently used soil mapping methods are outlined, and the necessity of taking into account the level of generalization of the information used in the process of soil mapping is demonstrated. We demonstrated the errors arising in soil maps when digital spatial data with different levels of information generalization is used. The most promising directions in the development of soil mapping methods are identified. It is shown that the primary attention should be paid to the development of digital soil mapping methods based on remote sensing data, which contain the most accurate information on the spatial variation of the surface soil horizon properties. The use of methods of spatial interpolation of point data is less accurate than the use of remotely sensed data. But the latter allows us to confidently detect only certain soil properties and not all of those necessary to create soil maps in the traditional form. Mapping individual soil properties is a more promising approach. Maps of individual soil properties are more convenient and accurate for evaluating soil and land resources. In the future, they can be used as a basis both for the re-creation of soil units in terms of accepted soil classification and for the creation of soil maps in traditional form (with the reflection of classification units of soils on them). But for a complete transition to the mapping of soil properties, it is necessary to deepen research in studying the spectral reflectance of the soil surface and its relationship with the properties of the underlying soil horizons.

AB  - A new set of resources is now available that describe global shoreline characteristics. High resolution (30 m), globally comprehensive Coastal Segment Units (CSUs) and Ecological Coastal Units (ECUs) were developed in a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Esri, and the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON). The data were produced from a segmentation and characterization of a global shoreline vector extracted from year 2014 Landsat imagery. A total of 4 million 1 km shoreline segments were attributed with values from ten variables which describe the ecological settings in which the coastline occurs, including water-side properties, land-side properties, and properties of the coastline itself. These data were developed as part of a Group on Earth Observations (GEO) global ecosystem mapping initiative called GEO Ecosystems (GEO ECO). The development of the resource and its intended utility are reviewed herein.

TI  - Linkages between GRACE water storage, hydrologic extremes, and climate teleconnections in major African aquifers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources management is a critical issue in Africa where many regions are subjected to sequential droughts and floods. The objective of our work was to assess spatiotemporal variability in water storage and related controls (climate, human intervention) in major African aquifers and consider approaches toward more sustainable development. Different approaches were used to track water storage, including GRACE/GRACE Follow On satellites for Total Water Storage (TWS); satellite altimetry for reservoir storage, MODIS satellites for vegetation indices, and limited ground-based monitoring. Results show that declining trends in TWS (60-73 km(3) over the 18 yr GRACE record) were restricted to aquifers in northern Africa, controlled primarily by irrigation water use in the Nubian and NW Saharan aquifers. Rising TWS trends were found in aquifers in western Africa (23-49 km(3)), attributed to increased recharge from land use change and cropland expansion. Interannual variability dominated TWS variability in eastern and southern Africa, controlled primarily by climate extremes. Climate teleconnections, particularly El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole, strongly controlled droughts and floods in eastern and southern Africa. Huge aquifer storage in northern Africa suggests that the recent decadal storage declines should not impact the regional aquifers but may affect local conditions. Increasing groundwater levels in western Africa will need to be managed because of locally rising groundwater flooding. More climate resilient water management can be accomplished in eastern and southern Africa by storing water from wet to dry climate cycles. Accessing the natural water storage provided by aquifers in Africa is the obvious way to manage the variability between droughts and floods.

TI  - Improvement of Atmospheric Correction of Satellite Sentinel-3/OLCI Data for Oceanic Waters in Presence of <i>Sargassum</i>
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive species of brown algae Sargassum gathers in large aggregations in the Caribbean Sea, and has done so especially over the last decade. These aggregations wash up on shores and decompose, leading to many socio-economic issues for the population and the coastal ecosystem. Satellite ocean color data sensors such as Sentinel-3/OLCI can be used to detect the presence of Sargassum and estimate its fractional coverage and biomass. The derivation of Sargassum presence and abundance from satellite ocean color data first requires atmospheric correction; however, the atmospheric correction procedure that is commonly used for oceanic waters needs to be adapted when dealing with the occurrence of Sargassum because the non-zero water reflectance in the near infrared band induced by Sargassum optical signature could lead to Sargassum being wrongly identified as aerosols. In this study, this difficulty is overcome by interpolating aerosol and sunglint reflectance between nearby Sargassum-free pixels. The proposed method relies on the local homogeneity of the aerosol reflectance between Sargassum and Sargassum-free areas. The performance of the adapted atmospheric correction algorithm over Sargassum areas is evaluated. The proposed method is demonstrated to result in more plausible aerosol and sunglint reflectances. A reduction of between 75% and 88% of pixels showing a negative water reflectance above 600 nm were noticed after the correction of the several images.

TI  - Incidence Angle Dependence of Texture Statistics From Sentinel-1 HH-Polarization Images of Winter Arctic Sea Ice
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The proliferation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, its accessibility in open platforms like Google Earth Engine, and the development of automated classification and geophysical information extraction algorithms have prompted the need for understanding the role of incidence angle (IA) on radar scattering mechanism, backscatter intensity, and classification accuracy. This letter demonstrates the dependence of image texture parameters on SAR IA, using Arctic landfast sea ice samples extracted from C-band frequency Sentinel-1 SAR scenes collected during the winter period. Gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) derived texture parameters, and occurrence texture parameters, derived from undeformed first-year sea ice and multi-year sea ice, which are dominated by surface and volume scattering mechanisms, respectively, were analyzed. All GLCM texture parameters were found to be dependent on IA, highlighting the need for consideration of angular dependence in texture parameters, particularly in the development of image classification and inversion algorithms utilizing them. Occurrence texture parameters showed negligible influence by IA; however, feature discrimination capability was also lost. Some GLCM parameters had similar angular dependencies for both sea ice types, suggesting that, in some cases, global image normalization approaches for texture may be applied to account for the IA effect.

AB  - Transformer models have recently approached or even surpassed the performance of ConvNets on computer vision tasks like classification and segmentation. To a large degree, these successes have been enabled by the use of large-scale labelled image datasets for supervised pre-training. This poses a significant challenge for the adaption of vision Transformers to domains where datasets with millions of labelled samples are not available. In this work, we bridge the gap between ConvNets and Transformers for Earth observation by self-supervised pre-training on large-scale unlabelled remote sensing data(1). We show that self-supervised pre-training yields latent task-agnostic representations that can be utilized for both land cover classification and segmentation tasks, where they significantly outperform the fully supervised baselines. Additionally, we find that subsequent fine-tuning of Transformers for specific downstream tasks performs on-par with commonly used ConvNet architectures. An ablation study further illustrates that the labelled dataset size can be reduced to one-tenth after self-supervised pre-training while still maintaining the performance of the fully supervised approach.

TI  - Toward Global Estimation of Ground-Level NO<sub>2</sub> Pollution With Deep Learning and Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a central environmental problem in countries around the world. It contributes to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases, and adversely impacts the health of billions of people. Despite its importance, detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of pollutants is complex to obtain. Ground-level monitoring stations are sparse, and approaches for modeling air pollution rely on extensive datasets which are unavailable for many locations. We introduce three techniques for the estimation of air pollution to overcome these limitations: 1) a baseline localized approach that mimics conventional land-use regression through gradient boosting; 2) an OpenStreetMap (OSM) approach with gradient boosting that is applicable beyond regions covered by detailed geographic datasets; and 3) a remote sensing-based deep learning method utilizing multiband imagery and trace-gas column density measurements from satellites. We focus on the estimation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a common anthropogenic air pollutant with adverse effects on the environment and human health. Our local baseline model achieves strong results with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.18 +/- 0.16 mu g/m(3) NO2. Substituting localized inputs with OSM leads to a degraded performance (MAE 7.22 +/- 0.14) but enables NO2 estimation at a global scale. The proposed deep learning model on remote sensing data combines high accuracy (MAE 5.5 +/- 0.14) with global coverage and heteroscedastic uncertainty quantification. Our results enable the estimation of surface-level NO2 pollution with high spatial resolution for any location on Earth. We illustrate this capability with an out-of-distribution test set on the US westcoast. Code(1) and data(2) are publicly available.

AB  - Self-supervised learning has great potential for the remote sensing domain, where unlabelled observations are abundant, but labels are hard to obtain. This work leverages unlabelled multi-modal remote sensing data for augmentation-free contrastive selfsupervised learning. Deep neural network models are trained to maximize the similarity of latent representations obtained with different sensing techniques from the same location, while distinguishing them from other locations. We showcase this idea with two self-supervised data fusion methods and compare against standard supervised and self-supervised learning approaches on a land-cover classification task. Our results show that contrastive data fusion is a powerful self-supervised technique to train image encoders that are capable of producing meaningful representations: Simple linear probing performs on par with fully supervised approaches and fine-tuning with as little as 10% of the labelled data results in higher accuracy than supervised training on the entire dataset.

TI  - SURFACE MOISTURE INDEX BY RADIOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS AND ORBITAL DATA
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - As an indicator of surface moisture, TVDI has great potential for application in agriculture in different types of climates, but the best results have been obtained in arid climates, given the presence of areas with contrasting water conditions. Some studies under subtropical climate conditions have shown good results in the use of TVDI as an indicator of surface moisture but some uncertainties still need to be better understood. This study aimed to evaluate the coherence of temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI) values, obtained from sensors installed on the surface, compared to data obtained using orbital images in an agricultural area in southern Brazil under humid subtropical climate conditions. The analyses employed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (T-S) data obtained through sensors installed on the surface, with continuous monitoring, as well as Landsat OLI/TIRS images, covering the period of the soybean cycle. The TVDI values, obtained from NDVI and T-S radiometric sensors installed in the field, indicated consistency of using Landsat-OLI/TIRS orbital images to map the surface moisture condition, representing the spatial and temporal variations of the water condition of soybean cultivations under subtropical climate conditions.

TI  - Water monitoring of soybean crops using the TVDI obtained from surface radiometric sensors
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of the surface moisture data generated by the temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI), obtained from sensors positioned on the surface of a soybean (Glycine max) agricultural field. The dry and wet limits of the index were obtained using Landsat-8 images covering the region around the crop. To assess the quality and consistency of the TVDI, a correlation analysis was carried out between the TVDI, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface temperature (T-S), and the variables that are usually used to express surface moisture. The TVDI showed a significant correlation with soil moisture, water storage in the soil, water deficit, real evapotranspiration, and the real evapotranspiration/potential evapotranspiration ratio. The displacement of radiometric data measured on the surface (NDVI and T-S) within the evaporative triangle, adjusted with orbital data, consistently describes the variability of water conditions during the study period, being a tool to support decision-making in crop management.

AB  - Being able to survey the sky at ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths, astronomical spectrographs can study objects almost impossible to see in visible light alone. Very low light intensities of small objects require single-photon sensitivity. The unique optical properties of fused silica, e.g., highest transmission, best homogeneity, and lowest absorption, enable next-generation observations, space-bound as well as earth-bound. However light absorption in the range >800 nm limits the performance of IR spectrographs when using standard fused silica. Metallic impurities and OH groups embedded in the fused silica matrix need to be reduced to achieve best operation. The MOONS camera system at ESO's Very Large Telescope observes the universe in the NIR range using low OH synthetic fused silica lenses up to a diameter of 900 mm. In the UV spectrum of 160-350 nm, standard fused silica performs in earth-bound systems extremely well. However, in space-bound applications, radiation damage reduces the transmissivity over time. Radiation hard fused silica windows for the PLATO M3 mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) protect the sensitive telescope from damage due to solar protons. Key optical instruments require calibration of the light source to normalize spectroscopic measurements. A radiation resistant fused silica diffusor with Lambertian scattering behavior supports ESA's Copernicus program in the Sentinel 5 satellite.

AB  - Plastic pollution is a threat to both human health and ecosystems. Quantification efforts often rely on observations in the field, which can be costly and labour-intensive. Satellite remote sensing offers an opportunity for upscaling plastic detection in time and space, as it enables covering large areas and using historical images. To date, several approaches have been successful for the detection of marine plastics, but detecting riverine plastics with satellite imagery are lacking. In this paper, we explore the use of satellite imagery for direct and indirect detection of floating plastics in rivers, ultimately calculating river surface plastic densities. The direct detection was done using Worldview-3 imagery and enables to detect large objects (similar to 1.2 m of size). The indirect approach uses plastic entrapped in water hyacinths as a proxy for plastic density at the river surface. Sentinel-1 imagery allowed to estimate water hyacinth coverage, which we combined with field data to estimate entrapment ratio and plastic density within hyacinths. Items as small as 2.7 cm could be detected with field data. The indirect approach detects a thousand more plastic items (2.1x10(4) items km(-2)) than the direct approach (5.8 x 10(1) items km(-2)), a likely result of the larger range of item size detectable with this method.

AB  - In big cities, the complexity of urban infrastructure is very high. In city centers, one construction can consist of several building sections of different heights or roof geometries. Most of the existing approaches detect those buildings as a single construction in the form of binary building segmentation maps or as one instance of object-oriented segmentation. However, reconstructing complex buildings consisting of several parts requires a higher level of detail. In this work, we present a methodology for individual building section instance segmentation on satellite imagery. We show that fully convolutional networks (FCNs) can tackle the issue much better than the state-of-the-art Mask-RCNN. A ground truth raster image with pixel value 1 for building sections and 2 for their touching borders was generated to train models on predicting both classes as a semantic output. The semantic outputs were then post-processed with the help of morphology and watershed labeling to generate segmentation on the instance level. The combination of a deep learning-based approach and a classical image processing algorithm allowed us to fulfill the segmentation task on the instance level and reach high-quality results with an mAP of up to 42 %.

AB  - Spatial structural diversity refers to the spatial, i.e. horizontal arrangement of landscape elements and can reveal itself as landscape features, such as patches and linear features. The 'R' package 'StrucDiv' provides methods to quantify spatial structural diversity in continuous remote sensing data, or in other data in raster format. Structure is based on the spatial arrangement of value pairs. The 'R' package 'StrucDiv' includes methods to combine information from different spatial scales, which allows to quantify multi-scale spatial structural diversity. Copyright: GPL (= 3)

AB  - Sentinel-2 time series are increasingly used in forest mapping and monitoring. However, previous studies have dealt with a limited number of tree-species classes and rarely included Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. We compared the temporal fingerprints of sixteen forest stand types in Northern Germany for the Sentinel-1 Radar Vegetation Index and Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. From the federal state forest inventory of Lower Saxony, we extracted up to 500 samples for each class. For all samples, we produced time series for the years 2018 to 2020. Then, we did an exploratory data analysis of the applicability of both sensors for individual species detection and phenology monitoring. We found clear benefits of Sentinel-1 SAR data for the detection of specific tree species. For the temporal delimitation of phenophases like spring leaf/ needle flush and autumn leaf/needle fall, the optical Sentinel-2 sensor is more robust.

AB  - Nowadays, it is a reality to launch, operate, and utilize small satellites at an affordable cost. However, bandwidth constraint is still an important challenge. For instance, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors generate a significant amount of data subjected to communication channel impairments, which is addressed mainly by source and channel coding aiming at an effective transmission. This paper targets a significant further bandwidth reduction by proposing an on-the-fly analysis technique on the satellite to decide which information is effectively useful for specific target applications, before coding and transmitting. The challenge would be detecting clouds and vessels having the measurements of red-band, green-band, blue-band, and near infrared band, aiming at sufficient probability of detection, avoiding false alarms. Furthermore, the embedded platform constraints must be satisfied. Experiments for typical scenarios of summer and winter days in Stockholm, Sweden, are conducted using data from the Mimir's Well, the Saab AI-based data fusion system. Results show that non-relevant content can be identified and discarded, pointing out that for the cloudy scenarios evaluated, up to 73.1% percent of image content can be suppressed without compromising the useful information into the image. For the water regions in the scenarios containing vessels, results indicate that a stringent amount of data can be discarded (up to 98.5%) when transmitting only the regions of interest (ROI).

T2  - US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - At the behest of Pope Pius XI and the U.S. Catholic bishops, the Catholic University of America launched in 1939 the Commission on American Citizenship, which sought to "reaffirm the traditional allegiance of the Catholic Church in the United States to free American institutions; and make the ideals of Christian Social Living motivating factors in the daily lives of children in Catholic schools in order that they may thereby become citizens who would exercise the responsibilities as well as the rights of their freedoms." Through a curriculum, civic clubs, and other fora, the Commis-sion developed a program that would instill a Catholic sensibility in stu-dents and inform their political engagement as adults. Doing so would help them evangelize the public square. But this effort fell short. The gener-ation that came of age in the 1960s and early 1970s was the primary cohort exposed to the Commission's outreach. As many of these young Catholics took opposing sides in the ever-fierier culture wars, the Commission's com-prehensive and shared worldview revealed a fractured Church.

AB  - C.S. Lewis's A Grief Observed remains one of the most popular and highly recommended books on grief for bereaved people, and yet some of the experiences Lewis recounts strike readers as distinctive and unfamiliar. In this paper I draw attention to these distinctive, less familiar experiences, and make sense of them in the light of Lewis's theology. In so doing, I provide one example of how a person's worldview can shape their experience - in this case, how the phenomenology of grief is infused by the person's conceptual world. At the end, I point to some of the practical (pastoral and clinical) implications of my analysis, and also to some implications about our understanding of the nature of grief.

TI  - CALENDRIC FEAST BANS AND THE PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLATING THEM IN THE BULGARIAN TRADITIONAL CULTURE
T2  - FOLKLORE-ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF FOLKLORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper offers an interdisciplinary ethnolinguistic and semiotic analysis of the Bulgarian calendric prohibitions and the consequences of violat-ing them. Special attention is paid to linguistic data - the chrononyms which characterize these days as ambivalent, both blessed and malevolent, days which must be observed as work-free and free from other types of activity. Folk etymol-ogy of some terms for holidays reveals how language constructs the calendric order and offers an insight into the ritual restrictions of some feasts. The list of bans in an ethnographic context is scrutinized according to which holidays are "dangerous", who is the subject of the bans, and what punishment will follow for breaking the rules. Holidays for which non-observance is most seriously punished are Christian calendric feasts which often have many pre-Christian elements and occasionally reflect the cult of animals. Many restrictions affect women only, especially those who are pregnant and mothers, as they concern female biological and social functions. Folklore parallels to the theme of the article are investigated and a poetic means of depicting the punishment for the sins is shown. A reverse development of the motif of 'sin and punishment' is represented in the songs about Saint Nedelia, who does not punish the sinners but suffers herself because people work on 'her days', Sundays. Some of the bans and recommendations rel-evant for calendric rituals are still evident in Bulgarian society, confirming the continuation of certain features of the archaic worldview. The paper is based on field research data collected by the author during the last three decades and on published and archival materials.

AB  - This paper presents an approach that aims to produce a Time-Series (TS) of consistent Land-Cover (LC) maps, typically needed to perform environmental monitoring. First, it creates an annual training set for each TS to be classified, leveraging on publicly available thematic products. These annual training sets are then used to generate a set of preliminary LC maps that allow for the identification of the unchanged areas, i.e., the stable temporal component. Such areas can be used to define an informative and reliable multi-year training set, by selecting samples belonging to the different years for all the classes. The multi-year training set is finally employed to train a unique multi-year Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, which enhances the consistency of the annual LC maps. The preliminary results carried out on three TSs of Sentinel 2 images acquired in Italy in 2018, 2019 and 2020 demonstrates the capability of the method to improve the consistency of the annual LC maps. The agreement of the obtained maps is approximate to 78%, compared to the approximate to 74% achieved by the LSTM models trained separately.

TI  - THE ASSOCIATIVE POTENTIAL OF THE PRECEDENT ONYM <i>CHERNOBYL</i> IN THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE PICTURE OF THE WORLD
T2  - VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Internet space of the beginning of the 21st century is rich in wide selection of figurative language units, which reflect modern realities in network communication by referring to already known events, facts, and situations. The purpose of the proposed article is to identify the semantic-and-pragmatic and associative potential of the Chernobyl precedent situation onym as a component of the Russian language picture of the world. The analysis of the current Internet space allowed the authors to conclude that the frequency of appeals to the precedent toponym Chernobyl has increased in the last decade. Thus, in online media, chat rooms and blogs, parallels are drawn between the tragic events of 1986 and the alarming situations of our time. It can be noted that the image of Chernobyl is projected not only on states and political associations, but also on particular politicians, while the variety of integral components that underlie metaphorical images and scenarios attracts attention. The associative image of Chernobyl is constructed by means of linguistic units of the figurative system relevant to the representation of the disaster. Such words and constructions in media texts acquire new connotative backgrounds and have a high transformational potential. A wide range of connotatively labeled linguistic means used in modeling the image of Chernobyl is the basis for the formation of a fragment of the worldview of a modern linguistic personality reflected in actual network communication.

TI  - Biophysical Determinants of Shifting Tundra Vegetation Productivity in the Beaufort Delta Region of Canada
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature increases across the circumpolar north have driven rapid increases in vegetation productivity, often described as 'greening'. These changes have been widespread, but spatial variation in their pattern and magnitude suggests that biophysical factors also influence the response of tundra vegetation to climate warming. In this study, we used field sampling of soils and vegetation and random forests modeling to identify the determinants of trends in Landsat-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index, a surrogate for productivity, in the Beaufort Delta region of Canada between 1984 and 2016. This region has experienced notable change, with over 71% of the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands and over 66% of the Yukon North Slope exhibiting statistically significant greening. Using both classification and regression random forests analyses, we show that increases in productivity have been more widespread and rapid at low-to-moderate elevations and in areas dominated by till blanket and glaciofluvial deposits, suggesting that nutrient and moisture availability mediate the impact of climate warming on tundra vegetation. Rapid greening in shrub-dominated vegetation types and observed increases in the cover of low and tall shrub cover (4.8% and 6.0%) also indicate that regional changes have been driven by shifts in the abundance of these functional groups. Our findings demonstrate the utility of random forests models for identifying regional drivers of tundra vegetation change. To obtain additional fine-grained insights on drivers of increased tundra productivity, we recommend future research combine spatially comprehensive time series satellite data (as used herein) with samples of high spatial resolution imagery and integrated field investigations.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the philanthropic activities of Friedrich Josef (Fyodor Petrovich) Haass (1780-1853), a Moscow physician who moved to Russia in the early 19th century. Haass was actively involved in the work of the Prisoners' Aid Society, established by Emperor Alexander I. The Society was based on the ideas of the British prison reformer John Howard. Not limiting himself to the development of prison medicine, Haass strove for the precise implementation of the rules of the Prison Board. This involved teaching the prisoners to read, instilling in them the basics of a Christian worldview and rules of conduct. Haass distributed thousands of copies of books and pamphlets free of charge. This study shows the repertoire of books distributed, the statistics of book distribution; it highlights the most popular book titles and different audiences for whom Haass bought books. The spread of literacy and book reading was influenced by a combination of Haass' personal character, the traditiona of German Catholic Enlightenment, Church pastoralism, the principles of social Christianity, and Post- Rousseau's pedagogy. The article draws upon the documents of the Moscow Synodal printinghouse ( Russian State Archives of Ancient Documents, f. 1184) and other archival funds.

TI  - Experimental evaluation of fire weather conditions during periods of wildfires in Ukraine in 2020
T2  - VISNYK OF V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-SERIES GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Almost every year, the territory of Ukraine is affected by drought of different intensity and duration, what is a favorable condition for wildfires. In the forest areas of the country arose about 106.8 thousand fires with a total area of 139.2 thousand hectares during 1990-2017. An analysis of the long-term dynamics shows that wildfires in Ukraine are a sustainable phenomenon. In 2020, under the severe drought conditions, 209 forest fires occurred, the most significant of them were in the Chernobyl zone and in the Lugansk region.Formulation of the problem. There is still no universally accepted method to describe all drought related processes due to complexity of drought phenomena. Although drought indices and fire weather indices usually have different time scales, their combination can be a basis in the prediction scheme in which the drought index acts as a background indicator, which enhances or decreases the current fire weather index.The purpose of this study is evaluate informativeness of a new fire weather index HDW (Hot-Dry-Windy Index) for the territory of Ukraine, which takes into account the main meteorological parameters necessary to describe the degree of wildfire danger due to weather conditions, so this index may become a component of the drought and fire monitoring system.Data and methods. The HDW index has a physical justification as the atmosphere affects the fire, namely, the combination of three atmospheric parameters characterizes the current conditions for the ignition and distribution of fire: wind, temperature, humidity. For the calculation of the HDW index, the data of GFS global numerical model with grid step 0.25 degrees is used. The calculation of the daily fields of the HDW index was carried out for the territory of Ukraine and for local areas. To localize areas of wildfires, in the study were used daily hotspots data provided by the web-resource FIRMS (https://firms2.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/), which are determined using satellite instruments MODIS (AQUA and Terra Satellites) and VIIRS (S-NPP and NOAA-20 satellites).Research results. Comparison of the calculated HDW fields in Ukraine with the position of hotspots showed that the maximum values of the HDW index are generally concentrated in fire areas. Comparison with the synoptic situation showed that the maximum values of the HDW are located in the zones of advection of warm and dry air in the lower troposphere and zones of strong surface winds, which usually correspond to the periphery of anticyclone or the warm sector of cyclone. The analysis of the time courses of the HDW index showed the typical feature, which expressed in the fact that in all cases there was an increase in the index values in the period before the wildfire, maximum of the HDW is fixed at the time of ignition and after that the index values sharply decreases.Scientific novelty and practical significance. The fields of new HDW index reflects the weather conditions typical for wildfires periods in the territory of Ukraine. The presence of specific features and extreme values in the index time course can be used to track the process of increase of fire danger under changing weather conditions to make short- and medium-range fire danger forecasts with evaluation of fire danger classes.

AB  - There is no doubt that air pollution harms human health. Municipal areas are the most affected by the degradation of the air quality by discharging anthropogenic gases from transport and industrial activities. This research collected remote sensing data from numerous satellite sensors to efficiently monitor the air quality in near-real-time. This paper deliberates the developed software based on the complex event processing calculating in streaming the air quality level in Morocco and Spain. Therefore, this computer program extracts only useful information rapidly from remote sensing big data helping decision-makers. This investigation takes up also a validation between the air quality measured by the ground station data of Andalucia and Madrid regions and the used satellite sensors data.

TI  - Axiology of conscience in the prose of Yeremey Aypin
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: modern Finno-Ugric literary criticism recognizes the axiological principle of a literary' text as one of the relevant aspects of the study. which allows us to form a well-defined idea of the axiological content of the worldview as a separate creative personality and the artistic worldview characteristic of the literature of the people as a whole.The subject of the research is the axiological principles of the existence of conscience as a moral consciousness of a person in the prose of the Khanty writer Yeremey Aypin; the peculiarity of the embodiment of the understanding of conscience and the attitude towards it of both the author and his characters.Objective: to discover in the writer's literary texts the moments of existence, the embodiment of conscience as a psychological category; to analyze the different understanding of its assessment, role, significance and relevance in the life of a person, people, state, both by the author and his characters. as a manifestation of the originality of the national consciousness of the northern people.Research materials: prose works by Ye. D. Aypin, in which the category of conscience is most expressively represented.Results and novelty of the research: the author analyzes the presence and author's understanding of conscience and its role in the life of both the human community and an individual in the author's version, which is represented by the specific artistic texts of the Khanty writer. As a result of the conducted historical and cultural analysis with elements of structural analysis, as well as with an appeal to the method of descriptive poetics, a conclusion was made according to which the existence and understanding of conscience in the prose of Yeremey Aypin has semantic diversity, acts as a fundamentally important sign consistently reflecting the author's worldview and intentions, largely forming the content structure of works, creating ideological and symbolic code. Such a code includes the characterization of conscience as an individual and personal principle, in which it is possible to identify national peculiarities of vision, understanding of oneself in the concrete historical space of the current time, as part of the national picture of the world explicated in the text, which is based on social, spiritual, moral, aesthetic traditions and ideas.The scientific novelty of the article is determined by the fact that conscience as a component of the artistic picture of the world in the writer's prose and in Khanty literature in general, has not been analyzed before, especially in the axiological aspect.

T2  - ENGINEER-JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERS SRI LANKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is one of the major factors affecting the ecological condition and urban thermal comfort of cities, particularly in developing countries like Sri Lanka. This study explores the impact of vegetation cover, built-up density, and land surface temperature on urban thermal comfort and ecological condition in Colombo, Sri Lanka using multi-temporal remotely sensed data. Landsat 8 satellite images from 2014 to 2023 were used to assess the spectral indices such as NDVI, NDBI, LST and UTFVI in Colombo. The results show that ecological condition and thermal comfort are fluctuating throughout the study period. Specifically, between 2020 and 2022, Covid-19 pandemic is one of the major influencing factors for the good ecological condition since the air quality was controlled by limited human activities due to lockdown. After people adapted to live with Covid-19 and continued their day-to-day activities, industrial activities returned to their normal conditions again in 2023; a pattern leading to ecological condition going back to worst was identified. So, these findings highlight the importance of incorporating green spaces and built-up density in urban planning to mitigate the adverse effects of surface temperature on ecological condition and thermal comfort.

AB  - Due to the effect of climate change on the hydrological cycle process, the severity and frequency of drought have increased. Typically, drought begins with meteorological drought, after which it propagates to agricultural and hydrological drought. Thus, it is essential to investigate the process involved in the drought propagation from meteorological to groundwater drought. In this study, we investigated groundwater drought by calculating the standardized groundwater level index (SGI) using predicted groundwater storage changes (GWSC) based on satellite data-driven deep learning models. The GWSC was predicted using two deep learning models (the convolution neural network-long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) and LSTM), and the results were validated using in situ observation data. In addition, the SGI was compared to meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought indices based on remote sensed data, and the drought propagation was analyzed. This study revealed the potential of satellite data-driven deep learning models for assessing groundwater droughts, which is important for the development of multi-scale drought monitoring systems.

TI  - Potential of AOD Retrieval Using Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols in the atmosphere play an essential role in the radiative transfer process due to their scattering, absorption, and emission. Moreover, they interrupt the retrieval of atmospheric properties from ground-based and satellite remote sensing. Thus, accurate aerosol information needs to be obtained. Herein, we developed an optimal-estimation-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval algorithm using the hyperspectral infrared downwelling emitted radiance of the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI). The proposed algorithm is based on the phenomena that the thermal infrared radiance measured by a ground-based remote sensor is sensitive to the thermodynamic profile and degree of the turbid aerosol in the atmosphere. To assess the performance of algorithm, AERI observations, measured throughout the day on 21 October 2010 at Anmyeon, South Korea, were used. The derived thermodynamic profiles and AODs were compared with those of the European center for a reanalysis of medium-range weather forecasts version 5 and global atmosphere watch precision-filter radiometer (GAW-PFR), respectively. The radiances simulated with aerosol information were more suitable for the AERI-observed radiance than those without aerosol (i.e., clear sky). The temporal variation trend of the retrieved AOD matched that of GAW-PFR well, although small discrepancies were present at high aerosol concentrations. This provides a potential possibility for the retrieval of nighttime AOD.

AB  - There are many books and papers on Sodongpa. However, there are very few articles on the study of Sodongpa in terms of Buddhist thought and practice compared to its importance. Some of the writings on the subject of the Sodongpa even have no Buddhism at all. The reason for this is that, above all, the study of the Sodongpa is so famous in Chinese literature that the study of the Sodongpa has been inclined towards literature. However, it was Buddhism that had the most ultimate influence on his life and studies, and the So-dong-pa reached a very deep state in thought and practice. In particular, he attained great enlightenment through meditation and rose to the position of great master. Until now, there are books and papers that have studied the academic relationship between Buddhism and Sodongpa in Korea. Based on such achievements, this thesis approached the two aspects of “Pratitya-samutpada(Connection)” and “Absence of ego”, which have not been attempted yet. Sodongpa overcame the Connection-worldview and lived in the great freedom of Absence of ego for later years. However, his Absence of ego was not a Absence of ego cut off from reality. The reality he faces every day is a reality in “empty, bright and quiet”. He was faithful to his position as a public figure entrusted to him, and at the same time, he was truly passionate about writing, as well as the realm of art. His perspective led to a new interpretation of Confucius's Sa-mu-sa (there is nothing wrong with thinking). In other words, it was interpreted in terms of 'reflection' rather than 'thought', which accurately judges and processes real-world objects.

AB  - Remotely sensed data have been used in various fields, such as disasters, agriculture, urban planning, and the military. Recently, the demand for the multitemporal dataset with the high-spatial- resolution has increased. This manuscript proposed an automatic image matching algorithm using a deep learning technique to utilize a multitemporal remotely sensed dataset. The proposed deep learning model was based on High Resolution Net (HRNet), widely used in image segmentation. In this manuscript, denseblock was added to calculate the correlation map between images effectively and to increase learning efficiency. The training of the proposed model was performed using the multitemporal orthophotos of the National Geographic Information Institute (NGII). In order to evaluate the performance of image matching using a deep learning model, a comparative evaluation was performed. As a result of the experiment, the average horizontal error of the proposed algorithm based on 80% of the image matching rate was 3 pixels. At the same time, that of the Zero Normalized Cross-Correlation (ZNCC) was 25 pixels. In particular, it was confirmed that the proposed method is effective even in mountainous and farmland areas where the image changes according to vegetation growth. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed deep learning algorithm can perform relative image registration and image matching of a multitemporal remote sensed dataset.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study traced the formation process of the Five Emperors (五帝) through the traditional literature of ancient East Asia, and examined its essential form through the excavated Oracle bone script data. The representative great men selected as Five Emperors appear slightly differently depending on the times and literature. As a result, the Five Emperors concept was created to secure their historical legitimacy and legitimacy of state management by creating a Chinese-centered worldview during the warring states period and Qin and Han Dynausty. Five Emperors were selected from the main great men who influenced ancient China during the Pre-ancient era.The principle applied to the selection is the theory of the application of five elements claimed by the Chueh-yeon of the Warring States Period, and based on this, a genealogy in the form of the history presented in a series of biographies was written. In the Shanghai dynasty era, there was already a systematic recognition of the five direction and their areas, which divided the geographical perspective into five types: East, South, West, North, and Center. At that time, the five districts were appointed to represent themselves in the form of the Five the king’s servants (五官), and the concept was expanded and changed with the flow of the times, with the names Five vassals (五臣), Five kings, or Five administrative assistants (五佐). Also, an unique the East Asian Philosophical Concept of Relationship system was formed in which everything was assigned to elements that represent five directions.After East Zhou dynasty, the use of five spatial-centered elements was systematized by a new theory of the mutual generation (相生) or the mutual overcoming (相克), and attempts were made to interpret the phenomenon of everything based on the concepts. The rise and fall of the dynasty and the change of history were also interpreted based on the mutual generation (相生) or the mutual overcoming (相克) concepts. Strictly speaking, the Five Emperors distributed in five geographical spaces and the Five Emperors based on the mutual generation and the mutual overcoming concepts are completely different results.This new concept is interpreted as being used to secure the rationality and legitimacy of the construction of the dynasty by expanding its meaning from a spatial perspective that exists in reality to a temporal perspective. In conclusion, the emergence and formation of a new concept, Five Emperors, was based on the mutual generation and the mutual overcoming concepts during the East Zhou dystiness and Qin and Handy periods. As a result, the new concept of Five Emperors is a genealogy created to highlight the legitimacy and claim historical legitimacy of their history while creating a Chinese-centered world view during the Warring States and Qin and Handysts.

Outside the field of literature, it is almost impossible to find works on emotions and feelings in the existing research on the May Uprising. Fact-finding about 5.18 is still in progress, and at the public level of truth-finding, emotions and feelingswhich are usually considered privateare not receiving enough attention. Among the motives of citizens' participation in the uprising, emotions and feelings are not irrelevant to the prevailing notion and common sense, emotional customs, and normal social consciousness of the time. A collective affect emerged as fear, shame, and anger overlapped, which could have been understood as twisted and separated values and customs of the era of developmental dictatorship that framed people's thinking and restrained their actions in the extraordinary reality of the uprising. This study aims to reveal that affectas a complex of feelings and emotions related to the uprisingis an important heritage of 5.18.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study of patterns of socio-cultural level on the material of musical creativity, which in both Ukrainian areas of the interwar period played a significant role in influencing individual consciousness and served as manifestations of national consciousness and worldview, allowed comparing different layers of socio-cultural life and detail the idea of the processes of that time - consolidating and confronting, local and national. The purpose of this research is to understand the reasons for the introduction of ideological patterns in Ukrainian music of the interwar period and an attempt to adapt the term "pattern" in the field of cultural studies of a particular artistic situation based on different research profiles. In addition to such fundamental principles, it was necessary to rely on an interdisciplinary approach. As a result, historical-stylistic, systematic, genre-stylistic, semantic, comparative, and executive methods are involved in the arsenal of this research In the historiographical approach, synchronistic analysis proved to be valuable, which allowed comparing unrelated opuses and concepts of different areas as part of the supranational cultural and historical integrity. The following conclusions follow from this investigation: neither ideological patterns nor any others can be reduced to genres or correlate in scale with the factors that influence the development of a particular tend, in particular - genre and style. Identifying patterns in this area is based on comparing options for their embodiment in specific images in different genres and styles. Significant prospects for the systematization of information flow to study the realities of musical culture are revealed.

TI  - Modeling walkability by remote sensing as latent walking speed extracted from multiple digital trail maps
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coordinating and managing teams searching for missing persons in wilderness areas is challenging. Local terrain characteristics and environmental conditions strongly influence how searchers accomplish their search tasks. When making decisions, searchers consult various maps of the area. In this paper we proposed a methodology for mapping characteristics of the area that influence user behavior when walking the area, and define a walkability model of the terrain. We define walkability as a measure of how fast a person can walk through terrain. The observed walking speed depends on factors such as the fitness and motivation of a person walking through the terrain, as well as on assistive fea-tures and the configuration of the terrain. In our method, walkability is predicted only as a feature of terrain configuration. We used singular value decomposition (SVD) to transform datasets to extract latent features of the terrain and users from multiple Global Positioning System (GPS) trails. We define the walkability measure as a latent component of walking speed, which is a function of terrain features. Finally, we use a polynomial regression algo-rithm to build a model for predicting terrain walkability based on remote sensing imagery from the Sentinel-2 mission. The application of the proposed model is demonstrated in the Kozjak mountain region in the Republic of Croatia.

TI  - The potential impact of increased urbanization on land surface temperature over South-West Nigeria
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the negative consequences of urban heat islands (UHI) on urban ecology, Identifying the regional variation of land surface temperature (LST) offers a clear picture of the UHI phenomena and will aid in the introduction of appropriate mitigation techniques to address the UHI's advancing impact. Delineating the impact of UHI on land cover changes and land surface temperature (LST) is of uttermost importance due to its dynamic nature. This study makes use of Landsat Images TM, ETM and OLI sensors over the southwestern region of Nigeria, consisting of Ekiti, Osun, Ondo, Oyo, Ogun and Lagos. A supervised classification was performed by creating a training sample from four classifications consisting of vegetation, built-up, water body, and bare surface. Our results during the observed period (1986, 2002, and 2007) shows that the distribution pattern has changed as a result of changing urban surface characteristics and the influence of anthropogenic activities. The result of the research revealed that Southwest Nigeria has gone through rapid urban expansion that is expected to continue in the future, 20% decline in vegetal coverage 15% increase in bare soil amounting to a total of 35% change caused by human activities during the investigation period. The result further reveals the existence of an inverse connection between LST and NDVI with correlation coefficients of -0.8738, -0.8594, and -0.8546 respectively, which suggests that the growth of vegetation in any geographical location reduces the intensity of the land surface temperature over the area, which might be used to minimize the impacts of Urban Heat Island. In addition, thermal and evapotranspiration capacity of water also contributed to the comparatively high temperature. Hence, to achieve the sustainable environment in this region, urban planning strategies that include embracing green initiatives such as planting of trees to improve urban forestry should be adopted.

TI  - A Quadratic Morphological Deep Neural Network Fusing Radar and Optical Data for the Mapping of Burned Areas
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are considered as one of the most disturbing factors in forest areas and high-density vegetation regions. The mapping of wildfires is particularly important for fire prediction and burned biomass estimation. Therefore, accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is of great importance and has a key role in disaster management. Estimation of burned areas from multispectral datasets is challenging, because of the complexity of the background and the different reflections of wildfires on the targets. To this end, this study presents a novel burned-area mapping framework based on the fusion of multitemporal Sentinel-1 coherence imagery and post-event Sentinel-2 imagery. The proposed framework uses hybrid quadratic morphological (QM) operations and convolution layers for deep feature extraction. The proposed architecture is known as the QMDNN-Net, where the overall framework of QMDNN-Net is based on a deep Siamese network. QMDNN-Net has double streams for extracting deep features from multitemporal coherence data and Sentinel-2 imagery. The streams are similar to each other and have the same number of group-dilated convolution blocks and QM layers. QMDNN-Net is defined based on quadratic dilation and erosion, and then it takes the average of these as output. The results of wildfire mapping with QMDNN-Net are evaluated here with two real-world wildfire datasets based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The results show that QMDNN-Net achieves an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 95.5% and 0.9, respectively, and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Assessment of drought stress in arid olive groves using HidroMORE model
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The olive tree is well known for being adapted to the arid conditions of the Mediterranean basin. However, prolonged drought periods which are expected to become more frequent because of climate change could result in severe water stress. In order to map the spatial distribution of drought stress in the olive groves in the arid regions of southeastern Tunisia (governorate of Medenine), we made recourse to the HidroMORE model (based mainly on FAO56 ET, NDVI from Sentinel 2 images and other physical parameters) to compute the water balance in a GIS environment. The outputs were compared to in situ soil water content measurements in four selected sites representing the various agro-ecological zones (mountains, piedmont, inner plain and coast) of the study site during the observation period from January 2016 to December 2019. The model outputs performed relatively well (the overall correlation coefficient R-2=0.72; index of agreement IA=0.76). The simulation results show that during normal years or average droughts, the water stress is least in the mountain and piedmont zones because of the additional runoff water supplied by the traditional water harvesting structures (Jessour and Tabias) and in the coastal zone, thanks to the higher air humidity and rainfall. In contrast, the olives in the inner plains are the most affected. Nevertheless, in case of severe droughts, the stress is generalised. Thus, the model could be used as a decision tool for prioritizing areas of intervention for drought control and mitigation (supplemental irrigation for trees safeguard, etc.)

AB  - Full-spectrum remote sensing images can simultaneously provide reflectance and emission information about objects, which has great application value. Hyperspectral imaging can record hundreds of spectral bands, but due to technical and space limitations, full-spectrum hyperspectral images (HSI) are difficult to obtain. Recently, we proposed a spectral super-resolution method based on the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM), which can generate full-spectrum hyperspectral images (HSI) from multispectral images (MSI). After the spectral-unmixing of MSI, we transform MS endmembers into full-spectrum HS endmembers by spectral library. Since the abundance of MSI and HSI with the same spatial resolution is consistent, we linearly mixed the abundance and HS endmember to obtain the full spectrum HSI. In this work, we use Sentinel-2 dataset and EO-1 ALI/Hyperion images to verify the accuracy and applicability. Compared with other works, our method can simulate full-spectrum HSI of large-area scenes without real HSI, which has a certain accuracy and provides more comprehensive information for applications.

TI  - Possible Thermal Anomalies Associated With Global Terrestrial Earthquakes During 2000-2019 Based on MODIS-LST
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent advances in satellite-based earthquakes (EQs) precursors provide an opportunity to correlate the seismic variation on lithosphere with atmosphere during the EQ preparation period through a rigorous atmospheric monitoring system. In the present study, seismic-induced thermal anomalies from cloud-free satellite thermal images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Land Surface Temperature (MODIS-LST) are analyzed within a time interval of three months (precedent two months and succeeding one month to each EQ day) of 13 M-w >= 6.0 terrestrial EQs during 2000-2019. All these EQs occur in low vegetation and no snow cover regions except M-w 6.7, Siberia Russia event. Remote sensing data show evidence of significant perturbation with reference to confidence bounds in LST within 5-20 time window upon the antecedent and the descendant of EQ day. The studied thermal anomalies are obtained from LST values over the epicenter region. This work endorses the performance of MODIS-LST for detecting EQ-induced thermal anomalies in terrestrial regions with no vegetation and snow cover and also assisting to the development of lithosphere-atmosphere hypothesis over the epicenter region.

AB  - This study investigates a pixel-based image analysis methodology built on unsupervised Deep Learning (DL) for rapid landslide detection. The utilized data includes the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 images and the topographic slope factor derived from the ALOS PALSAR sensor. We used a Convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) for extracting deep features from our input data. The Mini Batch K-means is then used for clustering the resulting deep features. The resulting landslide detection maps were then compared with a landslide inventory dataset for accuracy assessment. The proposed approach achieved the highest values of 76%, 91%, 83%, and 70% in terms of precision, recall, f1-score, and mIOU, respectively. This is the first study investigating unsupervised DL for landslide detection using Sentinel-2 images to the best of our knowledge.

AB  - Monitoring ground deformation at national and regional level with millimetre-scale precision, nowadays, is possible by using Advanced Differential Interferometric SAR (A-DInSAR) techniques. This study concerns the results of the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS), part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, which detects and measures land displacement at European scale. This Service provides reliable and consistent information regarding natural ground motion phenomena such as landslides and subsidence. The ground motion is derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time-series analysis of Sentinel-1 A/B data. These data, which provide full coverage of Europe from two different observation geometries (ascending and descending) every six days, are processed at full resolution. The paper is focused on the exploitation of the basic product of EGMS for both regional and local purposes. Analysing the slope and aspect of the deformation field is the novelty of this investigation. In particular, the focus is put on the generation of wide-area differential deformation maps. Such maps indicate the gradient of the deformation field. The obtained information is not only beneficial for monitoring anthropogenic phenomena but also vital for urban management and planning Most of the significant damages to manmade structures and infrastructures are associated with high deformation gradient values. Thus, monitoring the temporal and spatial variations of deformation gradient is essential for dynamic analysis, early-warning, and risk assessment in urban areas. Although EGMS productions are prepared for monitoring at regional level, their resolutions are high enough to investigate at local level. Therefore, this paper considers the local deformations that affect single structures or infrastructures. Local differences in such deformation can indicate damages in the corresponding structures and infrastructures. We illustrate these types of analysis to generate differential deformation maps using datasets available at CTTC.

TI  - Religious Coercion on Public University Campuses: Looking Beyond the Street Preacher
T2  - JOURNAL OF COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on how undergraduate students on five public university campuses perceived and reacted to religious coercion. We identified three sources of coercion: (a) public proselytizers, (b) peers, and (c) academic faculty whose expression of beliefs was perceived as implicitly coercive by students who often connected religious beliefs to political ideology. This paper makes significant contributions to conversations about the place of religion in education, a topic that is often neglected by educational researchers. Our findings demonstrate that worldview coercion is complex, multi-dimensional, and not restricted to explicit or public forms. Further, the findings provide insights on the manifestations of Christian privilege in the public sphere and invite further discussion about religion in education.

AB  - We present a qualitative study with 36 diverse social media users in India to critically examine how low-resource communities engage with fake videos, including cheapfakes and AI-generated deepfakes. We find that most users are unaware of digitally manipulated fake videos and perceive videos to be fake only when they present inaccurate information. Few users who know about doctored videos expect them to be of poor quality and know nothing about sophisticated deepfakes. Moreover, most users lack the skills and willingness to spot fake videos and some were oblivious to the risks and harms of fake videos. Even when users know a video to be fake, they prefer to take no action and sometimes willingly share fake videos that favor their worldview. Drawing on our findings, we discuss design recommendations for social media platforms to curb the spread of fake videos.

AB  - Italy has witnessed a significant increase in wildfires in recent decades. Forest fire fuel maps play a vital role in the prevention, management and risk assessment of wildfires, and this paper presents the procedure implemented to develop a dynamic wildfire fuel map using PRISMA hyperspectral data and Sentinel-2 multispectral data. Freely available multispectral datasets are widely used for land cover and land use mapping, but they have limited utility for fuel mapping due to their coarse spectral resolution. So, in this study, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from PRISMA has been used for fuel types classification. The feed-forward neural network showed an overall accuracy of 79% by validation. To convert the classification map into a dynamic fuel map, the knowledge of the proportion of live/dead herbaceous loads available in that area is essential. The Relative Greenness approach, which places the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the time series of measurements, was implemented using Sentinel - 2 multispectral data. By fusing the fuel types classification, relative greenness map and iso-bioclimatic map, a dynamic fuel map for the west of Latium in Italy was developed with reference to Scott/Burgan fuel models.

AB  - In Khartoum/Sudan the consumption of water per capita in urban areas far below the real need and WHO standard and huge volume of untreated municipal wastes water and industrial waste is discharged directly to an upstream from the town's sewage water and treatment plants. Only 5% of resident received waste water treatment services, and 95% of waste discharge in unregulated dumps and injected into ground, these leading to pollution of the atmosphere, surface and ground waters, and poses a serious environmental hazard downstream. The main objective of this paper to Simulate pollutant produce from water sector demands being prime indicators of water and environment challenge, using WEAP model, and GIS software.The methodology used in this study to identified appropriate indicators and creates a model that represents water resource status, and pollution generator sectors for a specific system boundary. Khartoum satellite Landsat Mosaic Image (copy write), and Digital elevation model, (DEM) for Sudan, from Global ESRI map, and Land cover map, acquired from Sudanese remote sensing and seismology authority are used in this study to create maps. The Basin Catchment model WEAP21 system scenarios with Remote Sensing, and GIS predicted response and evaluated water deterioration risk quantity and quality related to river Nile catchment area in Khartoum. The model software selected provides decision makers with watershed environmental response factors, with allocation for sustainable water concern lower River Nile catchments.The model approach across user was taken into consideration to ensure withdrawals, assumed improvement in consumption, researcher assumed building a reservoir to improve quality, and reduces people suffering from water shortage, building expansion to reform waste, with reference time from 2015 and projected year by 2030.To fulfill objectives the models was used for pollutant transport from upstream to watershed, to evaluate the effect of applying alternative management practices by development of different Scenarios.Water quality data are collected from Ground water central laboratories, also from Khartoum state data base center. While Waste water data collected from waste water treatment plants in the towns, and from constructional and environmental laboratories, centre. Also, field samples were collected from discharge point in lagoons near river shore and from the cross point of discharge into the river. The study result show how satellite technology combined with local monitoring, GIS, and advanced modeling system can be used to investigate the improved accuracy of the model results, and to improve operations and performance of service providers downstream. The result indicated that scenarios can be developed to explore options for the future and sustainability, and implication of various policies can evaluated. For environmental carrying capacities, the model results indicated that, 90% of water consuming by sector demands end at the receptors as waste water need to be treated. The pollutant load produced by those waste water treatment plants were measured and simulated including pollutant (BOD, COD, TSS, Phosphate, Nitrate, Total organic carbon, heavy metals (Pb, Cr, Zn, Cu), which in turn affects the quality of water resources available for direct use. The improvements in water collection systems affect water supply and wastewater treatment, while the improvement in waste water treatment plants after built new environmental expansion and technology may reduce the flow of waste water to receptors 50% by 2030. In order to ensure a long term development of water resources, and to avoid water becoming a limiting factor in the development of dependent activities, we recommend that country should develop environmental pollution reform and management policy based on an integrated management which associates management of surface and underground waters, qualitative and quantitative measures and management of use by various water sector.

T2  - NEIZVESTNYI DOSTOEVSKII-THE UNKNOWN DOSTOEVSKY
M3  - Book Review
AB  - The peer-reviewed collective monograph is a series of articles, each of which, filling a certain lacuna of the least studied first half of F. M. Dostoevsky's life, is an example of a real investigation of confusing, unclear or completely distorted facts about the writer and his genealogy based on a strict systematization of the already known and newly discovered documentary sources. The main body of articles and the appendix were prepared by the project manager B. N. Tikhomirov, three sections - with the participation of E. D. Maskevich, and one - in co-authorship with N. A. Tikhomirova. The study includes various aspects that in one way or another influenced the formation of the personality and worldview of the classic, and his artistic system. The reader will learn numerous new details not only about Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky, but also about his milieu (father, brothers, especially Mikhail, with whom he was closest; fellow students, teachers and colleagues in the Main Engineering School and the Drawing Room of the Engineering Department), as well as about the collisions of this period, the vicissitudes of the time of Dostoevsky's entry into the literary circle, months of imprisonment in the Peter and Paul Fortress, and the details of sending convicted Petrashevites to Siberia. Through the prism of the writer's scientific biography, little-known facts of Russia's history and culture are revealed to the general public, i. e., the peculiarities of the education system (using the example of the educational process at the Main Engineering School) and the provision of material assistance from the imperial treasury to the families of political prisoners, including Mikhail Dostoevsky. The literary block of the study included a scrupulous analysis of the reading circle of the young Dostoevsky, which in a certain sense determined the features of his artistic poetics: the book "One Hundred and Four Sacred Stories of the Old and New Testaments" by I. Gibner, as well as Gothic novels by A. Radcliffe, and numerous "pseudo-Radcliffians." Many archival documents reflected in the monograph are published and introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. The logical conclusion of the data added by the authors to the scientific biography of Dostoevsky of the pre-Siberian period was the first complete publication of the memoirs written by Baron A. E. Rizenkampf, a friend of the writer's youth, with a commentary by B. N. Tikhomirov, which supplements and corrects certain points in the previous editions of the memoirs. The importance of the reviewed monograph cannot be overestimated. It seems necessary to continue the monumental work of the authors to fill in the gaps in the scientific biography of F. M. Dostoevsky.

TI  - High-Temperature Disaster Risk Assessment for Urban Communities: A Case Study in Wuhan, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - High-temperature risk disaster, a common meteorological disaster, seriously affects people's productivity, life, and health. However, insufficient attention has been paid to this disaster in urban communities. To assess the risk of high-temperature disasters, this study, using remote sensing data and geographic information data, analyzes 973 communities in downtown Wuhan with the geography-weighted regression method. First, the study evaluates the distribution characteristics of high temperatures in communities and explores the spatial differences of risks. Second, a metrics and weight system is constructed, from which the main factors are determined. Third, a risk assessment model of high-temperature disasters is established from disaster-causing danger, disaster-generating sensitivity, and disaster-bearing vulnerability. The results show that: (a) the significance of the impact of the built environment on high-temperature disasters is obviously different from its coefficient space differentiation; (b) the risk in the old city is high, whereas that in the area around the river is low; and (c) different risk areas should design built environment optimization strategies aimed specifically at the area. The significance of this study is that it develops a high-temperature disaster assessment framework for risk identification, impact differentiation, and difference optimization, and provides theoretical support for urban high-temperature disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Reflectance Fusion Using a Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal reflectance fusion method is used to blend high-temporal and low-spatial resolution images with their low-temporal and high-spatial resolution counterparts that were previously acquired by various satellite sensors. Recently, a wide variety of learning-based solutions have been developed, but challenges remain. These solutions usually require two sets of data acquired before and after the prediction time, making them unsuitable for near-real-time predicting. The solutions are always trained band by band and thus do not consider the spectral correlation. High-resolution temporal changes are difficult to reconstruct accurately with the network structure used, which lowers the accuracy of the fusion result. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel spatiotemporal adaptive reflectance fusion model using a generative adversarial network (GASTFN). In GASTFN, an end-to-end network, including a generative and discriminative network, is simultaneously trained for all spectral bands. The proposed model can be applied to the one-pair case, consider the spectral correlation of each band, and improve the process of producing super-resolution imagery by adopting the discriminative network for image reflectance values rather than temporal changes in reflectance. The proposed model has been verified with two actual satellite data sets acquired in heterogeneous landscapes and areas with abrupt changes, with a comparison of the state-of-art methods. The results show that GASTFN can generate the most accurate fusion images with more detailed textures, more realistic spatial shapes, and higher accuracy, demonstrating that the GASTFN is effective for predicting near-real-time changes in image reflectance and preserves the most valuable spatial information.

CP  - IEEE International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Big Data and Algorithms (EEBDA)
CL  - Changchun, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Glaciers can very sensitively reflect environmental changes in a certain area and are one of the important factors commonly used to study climate change. The Kunlun Mountain glacier and its glacial melt water are the most important water resources in western China, and are of great significance to maintaining the fragile ecological balance of the region and the sustainable development of social economy. Based on the remote sensing images of Landsat TM, MSS and Landsat 8 OLI from 1997 to 2017, this paper studies the changes of glaciers in the region over the past 20 years by extracting information from the images. The research results show that the Kunlun Mountain glacier as a whole shows a phenomenon of shrinking glacier area. Based on the analysis of meteorological data, we infer that the changes in the Kunlun Mountain glacier area are mainly caused by the combined effects of average temperature and annual cumulative precipitation. The increase in precipitation from 1997 to 2007 led to an increase in the area of glaciers, while the area of glaciers from 2007 to 2016 increased. The reduction is related to the average temperature.

TI  - A Novel Framework for Exploring the Spatial Characteristics of Leisure Tourism Using Multisource Data: A Case Study of Qingdao, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial characteristics of leisure tourism resources are essential for human life, the urban economy, and tourism planning. This article presents a novel framework to explore these characteristics based on multisource data, such as points of interest, OpenStreetMap roads, Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument images, and other data, and proposes a new tourism area identification method by integrating the attractiveness of attractions with term frequency-inverse document frequency. The roles of the influencing factors were measured by using the geodetector and related statistical analyses. The results showed that the resources were centered on Jiaozhou Bay, and their axial direction was "northeast to southwest." The distribution of the overall resources was characterized by "one cluster with multiple core points," and different types of resources had different aggregation distributions. The recreational recreation and cultural leisure zones were more likely to be distributed in and near the center of each district, and their numbers were high, while the shopping leisure and natural recreation (NR) zones were the opposite. The distribution of each type of resource was the result of a combination of factors working together, except for NR resources, which were mainly influenced by natural factors, while others were mainly affected by socioeconomic factors. The study findings are instructive for tourism planning.

T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY & DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY-JDDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tuberculids are considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction to endogenous tuberculosis (TB). Papulonecrotic tuberculid (PNT) is a rare tuberculid occurring in < 5% of active TB. An 18-year-old male presented with recurrent necrotic papules for 6 years on limbs, trunk, and neck which healed with scars. Biopsy from lesion revealed caseating granulomas with lymphohistiocytic vasculitis. Ziehl-Neelsen stain was negative for acid-fast bacilli, but Mantoux was strongly positive. The polymerase chain reaction was not done due to monetary constraints. The final diagnosis of PNT was confirmed and he was started on anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) for which he responded. PNT should be treated as a sentinel lesion and a meticulous search for systemic involvement of TB should be carried out. Awareness about PNT is essential for its diagnosis and to institute ATT at appropriate time.

TI  - Mid-Term Simultaneous Spatiotemporal Prediction of Sea Surface Height Anomaly and Sea Surface Temperature Using Satellite Data in the South China Sea
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine forecasting techniques based on data-driven method generally treat each variable as independent and analyze the time series of a single and specific variable, while the real marine environment is the result of the interaction of multiple variables. In this letter, a data-driven method combining the empirical orthogonal function of multivariate (MEOF), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), and multilayer perceptron (MEOF-CEEMD-MLP in brief) is proposed to perform mid-term prediction of daily sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and sea surface temperature (SST) simultaneously, considering that there is a correlation between them in the real marine environment. In this model, application of MEOF not only considers the correlation between SSHA and SST but also establishes the temporal and spatial relationship between discrete points, making predictions more accurate. A case study in the South China Sea (SCS) that predicts the daily SSHA and SST 30 days ahead shows that MEOF-CEEMD-MLP model is highly promising for mid-term daily prediction of SSHA and SST simultaneously. Also, the correlation between these two kinds of ocean variables can be simulated very well by this prediction model.

T2  - THERMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a study of the formation of cooling and steam fogs on the Yenisei River during 2020. The formation of the above types of fogs resulted from changes in the hydrothermal regime downstream the Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric power station after its construction and it is also associated with a combination of weather conditions and water temperature in the river. Advective cooling fogs form in summer when moist air cools over the surface of cold moving water. The formation of steam fogs in winter, autumn, and spring is associated with the cooling of water vapor above the river surface by cold lower layers of air. The conditions for the formation of fogs are analyzed depending on the air temperature and humidity, water temperature, and wind speed. Based on the remote sensing data, the spatial distribution of steam fogs along the river is determined.

TI  - Improving Spatial Representation of Soil Moisture Through the Incorporation of Single-Channel Algorithm With Different Downscaling Approaches
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of microwave observations in the low-frequency range is a complementary tool for mapping surface soil moisture. The L-band (1-2 GHz) region is a lower frequency band of microwave radiations, and currently, only two satellite soil moisture data products are available in the L-band frequency range through the satellites Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS). Both these have almost the same spatial resolution around 36-40 km. Although SMAP also provides an enhanced soil moisture product at 9 km, still finer scale information of soil moisture is required. The present study tries to enhance coarse-scale soil moisture by incorporating the single-channel algorithm (SCA). The results obtained by SCA were used as the inputs for the downscaling algorithms instead of directly using the satellite soil moisture product. Through this study, we implement and compare three approaches: approximation of thermal inertia (ATI), triangle, and dispatch methods. The results illustrated that the downscaling algorithms perform better with the estimated SMAP soil moisture through SCA in comparison to direct SMAP soil moisture, and the thermal inertia-based approach is the best performing among the three methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims at evaluating the morphometric parameters of Baner, Neogal and Awa river basins in Himachal Pradesh, India for making important assessments about the morphometric characteristics and geo-hydrological conditions of these watersheds. Georeferenced Survey of India toposheets, Cartosat-DEM are the datasets used in ArcGIS software for the delineation of watersheds and calculating important morphometric parameters along with the preparation of relief, slope, aspect and drainage basin asymmetry maps. The results show that the Neogal and Awa rivers are of 6(th) order whereas Baner river is of 7(th) order. The basins are of elongated shape and the drainage is mainly of sub-dendritic to dendritic type. In the northern regions of these river basins, the slopes are very steep and the relief is very high that results in rapid runoff and increases the intensity of erosion. High drainage density (>2.8) and fine drainage texture (>9) indicate moderately permeable subsurface material that causes groundwater deficit. These watersheds have developed asymmetrical drainage and their high ruggedness values (>12) refers to the rejuvenated stage of their geomorphic development. The study concludes that erosion-prone areas with rapid runoff are present in the area and adequate measures will assist in the sustainable management of land and water resources.

AB  - Due to a change in the landscape, the climate of Uttarakhand state is changing rapidly, impacting the weather, further affecting human beings and vegetation. Nowadays, remote sensing is a favorable tool for monitoring the vegetation condition using NDVI and EVI. Studying the relationship between vegetation and climate more extensively, it is necessary to better understand the anomaly of ecosystems with climate change. This study is carried out to evaluate the vegetation cover dynamics by establishing the association between climate parameters and vegetation indices over the rain-fed districts (Nainital, Bageshwar, Champawat, Dehradun) of Uttarakhand for the period of 20 years. In this study, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is used to extract the MODIS NDVI and EVI at 250 m spatial resolution & 16-day temporal resolution data. The climate parameters for the rain-fed district (study area) are extracted from Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) Pun website for the period from 2000 to 2020. According to the annual vegetation dynamics, the peak attained by both indices is during the monsoon season, and hence they both show identical patterns to each other. Linear Regression Analysis results show a strong impact of climate on vegetation. Both indices shows a positive correlation with climate parameters where minimum temperature and rainfall are strongly correlated with EVI. Thus, the study reveals that EVI is proven to be more appropriate indices for monitoring vegetation cover as compared to NDVI for the study area.

TI  - FYODOR DOSTOEVSKY'S <i>THE GAMBLER</i> IN HUNGARIAN TRANSLATIONS: THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONCEPT 'PASSION IN LOVE' ('LYUBOVNAYA STRAST')
T2  - IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the first attempt to study the Hungarian translations of Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Gambler. The research aims at determining the completeness of the translation of sensemaking elements in the two most popular Hunagarian translations by Endre Szabo (1900) and Erzsebet Guthi Devecserine (1957) to assess the impact of the translation shifts on the preservation of the novel's idea. The method of studying the original and the translations is based on the concept analysis. Studying the original, the authors have revealed that the concept of passion (composed of such concepts as passion in love, passion for gambling, greed, and pride) is one of the sensemaking elements in the novel. The article focuses on passion in love in three episodes of the introduction which verbalise this concept in the image of Alexey Ivanovich, thus establishing his psychological portrait and describing his attitude to Polina. The worldview in Dostoevsky's novels is built upon the orthodox values, which define the dominants of the novel axiology. The Hungarian culture is catholic. The contradictions between the Orthodox and Catholic interpretation of passion in general allow hypothesizing that the reproduction of some features of passion in love in translation may be challenging. The analysis of the translations has revealed that the translators rendered some features of the concept practically without loss (appetence, hatred, murder, jealousy, desire, appetite, agony / excruciation, suicide, disease). Theidentified losses (pleasure, extinction of appetence, loss of control) do not distort the sense of the episodes studied as well as the portrait of the character. The authors believe that it was possible to preserve the concept due to a number of factors. Firstly, the translators focused on the similarities rather that differences in the Orthodox and Catholic interpretations of passion. Secondly, the approach of the Hungarian translators is distinguished by an extremely careful attitude to the original: Szabo adheres to the literal reproduction of the original style and Devecserine aspires after the balance between the original and the Hungarian linguistic norm.

TI  - Strong regulation of daily variations in nighttime surface urban heat islands by meteorological variables across global cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the day-to-day dynamics of surface urban heat island (SUHI) as well as their underlying determinants is crucial to a better design of effective heat mitigation. However, there remains a lack of a globally comprehensive investigation of the responsiveness of SUHI variations to meteorological variables. Based on the MODIS land surface temperature and auxiliary data in 2017, here we investigated 10 000+ cities worldwide to reveal day-to-day SUHI intensity (SUHII) variations (termed as SUHIIdv) in response to meteorological variables using Google Earth Engine. We found that: (a) meteorological variables related to the thermal admittance, e.g. precipitation, specific humidity (SH) and soil moisture (SM) (represented by daily temperature range in rural area, DTRr), reveal a larger regulation on SUHIIdv than those related to the air conditions (e.g. wind speed and near-surface air temperature) over a global scale. (b) Meteorological regulations on SUHIIdv can differ greatly by background climates. The control of SH on SUHIIdv is significantly strengthened in arid zones, while that of wind speed is weakened prominently in equatorial zones. SUHIIdv is more sensitive to SM in cities with higher background temperatures. (c) All meteorological variables, except that related to SM (DTRr), show larger impact on SUHIIdv with antecedent precipitation over the global scale. Precipitation is observed to mitigate the SUHIIdv globally, and such effects are even more pronounced in equatorial and arid zones. We consider that our findings should be helpful in enriching the knowledge of SUHI dynamics on multiple timescales.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundChronic anal fissures are longitudinal tear in the anoderm below the dentate line, typically occurring in the midline, with visible sphincter fibers at the fissure base, anal papillae, sentinel piles, and indurated margins. The gold-standard method of treatment is lateral internal sphincterotomy, which can be done by either open or closed technique. Medical sphincterotomy refers to pharmacological manipulation of anal sphincter tone as an alternative modality to surgery.ObjectiveTo compare the efficacy of treatment among patients receiving glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) treatment for chronic anal fissure with that among patients receiving percutaneous posterior tibial-nerve stimulation and those undergoing closed lateral internal sphincterotomy.Patients and methodsIn total, 120 patients were randomly allocated into three groups: 40 patients treated with percutaneous posterior tibial-nerve stimulation, 40 patients treated with GTN ointment, and 40 patients treated with closed lateral internal sphincterotomy.ResultsThis study showed that treatment with percutaneous posterior tibial-nerve stimulation had led to complete healing in 27.5% of patients in posterior tibial-nerve stimulation group, 70% of patients in the GTN group, and 95% of patients in closed lateral internal sphincterotomy group.ConclusionClosed lateral internal sphincterotomy remains the gold standard for treatment of chronic anal fissure.

AB  - Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and affected by floods from the Yangtze River basin every year, where the fluctuation of water level affects the ecological environment of Poyang Lake. The Sentinel satellites, provide persistent data for lake water area and level monitoring. Sentinel-1 overpasses Poyang Lake more than 2 times a month. With its high temporal-spatial resolution, the Sentinel-1 SAR data can be used to retrieve the water area accurately. Sentinel-3, equipped with SRAL altimeter, can be used to monitoring lake water level in high tempral/spatial resolution. After pre-processing, the Sentinel-1 SAR data were used to map the water surface using U-Net convolutional network. The Sentinel-3 altimeter data were processed to retrieve the day water level for Poyang Lake. Meanwhile, we collected the water level data from hydrologic information wetsite. Finally, we compared these 3 kind of hydrologic data and found that 1) the U-Net water body mapping method can extract water body in high accuracy, 2) our water level retrieval algorithm can retrieve water level, 3) compared to the water level data, there exists a high correlation between the water area and water level.

TI  - Learning Time-Frequency Information With Prior for SAR Radio Frequency Interference Suppression
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the complex electromagnetic environment, radio frequency interference (RFI) from other radiation sources often conflicts with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, which overlaps and destroys useful data in the same frequency band, causing an adverse impact on the quality of SAR imaging. When faced with wideband or mixed complicated RFI, traditional methods inevitablely damage the original signal and cannot effectively protect and reconstruct the useful information. Besides, the current semiparametric algorithms have large computations and limited generalization ability. To address these issues, this article proposes a prior-induced interference suppression network (PISNet) to achieve RFI suppression and useful signal recovery in time-frequency domain (TFD). Both narrowband and wideband interferences are uniformly modeled as a sparse distribution in the TFD, and the stationarity of SAR echoes determines its low-rank characteristic. These properties of RFI and SAR data are treated as prior knowledge to inject into our PISNet. An iterative reconstruction module is raised to achieve low-rank reorganization of the fused residual features. Meanwhile, a novel loss function is put forward to induce the network training to ensure that each component conforms to the prior. The proposed approach innovatively integrates deep learning with semiparametric methods for RFI suppression, which achieves superior performance on simulated and real data. Compared to existing learning-based methods, the image quality of the restored Sentinel-1 data is improved by 9.37% AG. The code and dataset will be available online (https://github.com/JyuanShen/PISNet).

TI  - PS-ESD: Persistent Scatterer-Based Enhanced Spectral Diversity Approach for Time-Series Sentinel-1 TOPS Data Co-Registration
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Sentinel-1 terrain observation with progressive scan (TOPS) mode, this azimuth sweeping introduces an extra high-frequency Doppler term into the impulse response function, which requires the azimuth co-registration accuracy of 0.001 pixels to make the interferometric phase difference of adjacent bursts less than 3 degrees. The enhanced spectral diversity (ESD) and developing versions are usually used to correct such residual azimuth misregistration. However, in fast decorrelation scenario, the distributed scatterers (DSs)-based ESDs need to perform lots of complex data processing to reduce the decorrelation impact on high-precision co-registration, including multilooking, spatial filtering, network construction, and least square adjustment. The DS-based co-registration methods are complicated and inefficient, which is not suitable for big synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing. Therefore, this letter proposes a persistent scatterers-based ESD (PS-ESD): to estimate the amplitude dispersion index (ADI) with double samples over the burst overlap regions and select the satisfied PS pixels to compute the double differential phase under the one-master interferometric framework for correcting the time-series azimuth shifts. Based on the Sentinel-1 TOPS SAR data over the mountainous area in Three Gorges, China, experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed PS-ESD can achieve higher co-registration accuracy and faster convergence rate, especially in the case of dynamic co-registration of newly added TOPS images.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Spatially Downscaled Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence to Monitor Drought Effects on Gross Primary Production in Winter Wheat
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of drought on the terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) are the most intense and widespread in all extreme climate events. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is considered as a direct representative of actual vegetation photosynthesis and has better performance in monitoring vegetation conditions than greenness-based vegetation indices (VIs) during drought events. Based on the spatially downscaled SIF (SIFds), VIs and GPP products, we explored the potential of SIFds to monitor drought effects on GPP in winter wheat. First, the spatiotemporal dynamics of hydrometeorological factors and vegetation variables in winter wheat during drought events were observed. Then, the SIFds-GPP relationships in different phenological stages were examined in the rainfed area. Finally, the drought-induced GPP losses in different phenological stages were evaluated by scaling SIFds to GPP based on the linear SIFds-GPP relationship in the rainfed area. Results showed that SIFds could capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of drought-induced GPP variations in winter wheat during drought events, and it could quantify accurately the drought-induced GPP losses, with higher sensitivities to GPP changes during the vigorous growing periods. Our study reveals the applicability of SIFds to achieve regional agricultural drought detection and drought-induced GPP loss assessment, which can provide some help for crop adaptation management.

TI  - Functional Hallmarks of Healthy Macrophage Responses: Their Regulatory Basis and Disease Relevance
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Macrophages are first responders for the immune system. In this role, they have both effector functions for neutralizing pathogens and sentinel functions for alerting other immune cells of diverse pathologic threats, thereby initiating and coordinating a multipronged immune response. Macrophages are distributed throughout the body-they circulate in the blood, line the mucosal membranes, reside within organs, and survey the connective tissue. Several reviews have summarized their diverse roles in different physiological scenarios and in the initiation or amplification of different pathologies. In this review, we propose that both the effector and the sentinel functions of healthy macrophages rely on three hallmark properties: response specificity, context dependence, and stimulus memory. When these hallmark properties are diminished, the macrophage's biological functions are impaired, which in turn results in increased risk for immune dysregulation, manifested by immune deficiency or autoinununity. We review the evidence and the molecular mechanisms supporting these functional hallmarks.

Doronin, A. Bryzhinsky, E. Chetvergov.Results and novelty of the research: anthroponymic space of a Mordovian modern novel is analyzed; the meaning and functions of anthroponyms in the content and semantic structure of a novel are considered. As a result of the semantic, functional and etymological analysis of anthroponyms we come to the conclusion that a name of a character in a Mordovian novel of the turn of the XX-XXI centuries has semantic versatility. It acts as a polyfunctional sign; through it the author's worldview and intentions are reflected, the content structure of a work, the ideological and symbolic code, and the spatial and temporal chronotope are formed. In addition to the identifying, characterizing role, a literary anthroponym provides information about the nationality of a character; it becomes a part of the national picture of the world; it reveals social, spiritual and moral problems and conveys subtext information. The scientific novelty of the article consists in concretizing and supplementing the functional, semantic features of anthroponyms, clarifying the naming structures in a Mordovian novel of recent decades.

AB  - Introduction: the article is devoted to the study of the prose of contemporary Mordovian female authors. The subject of the study is the means, methods of modeling artistic reality, the principles of structuring the figurative system, plot-forming concepts in the works of Tamara Bargova, Valentina Mishanina, and Tatyana Razgulyaeva.Objective: to reveal the specifics of the individual author's picture of the world and man in the works of national writers.Research materials: stories by T Bargova, V. Mishanina, T. Razgulyaeva.Results and novelty of the research: as a result of the study, we come to the conclusion that in the works of modern Mordovian women authors the original concept of the world and man is explicated. The texts are characterized by an original solution to the pressing problems of reality, thematic diversity, deep psychologization of character, special attention to gender relations, the reconstruction of women's fate, the assertion of national ethical norms and universal moral principles. The stories of V. Mishanina, T Bargova, and T Razgulyaeva reflect the features of the milestone era - sociocultural manifestations, material and spiritual preferences of society, the leveling of national foundations, the destruction of traditional ethnic consciousness, and the tragic worldview of a contemporary. In the process of modeling a picture of the world, the authors develop an individual aesthetic concept. They use an arsenal of certain techniques, means of revealing the character (memory, dream, vision, stream of consciousness, a critical situation or a situation of loneliness, circumstances, an author's position, subtext, and letter). The authors turn to the possibilities of a symbolic imagery, this testifies to the high aesthetic level of Mordovian women's prose in general. The scientific novelty of the article is determined by the fact that the research material is analyzed for the first time in the aspect of the stated problem.

AB  - Extracting the seismic deformation field and analyzing the surface deformation after an earthquake occurs are of great significance for explaining earthquake mechanism and earthquake relief. Through the dual polarization mode of the two-pass method D-InSAR technology, this paper extracted the coseismic deformation fields based on two Sentinel-1A SAR images covering the Yulin earthquake area, and analyzed the surface deformation. The results show that the subsidence area obtained by VV and VH polarization modes are consistent. The uplift center areas are located in Tongxin Village in Rong County and Mapo Town in Luchuan County, and the subsidence center area is located in Fuxin Town of Beiliu City in the northeast. In the earthquake area, the maximum uplift derived by the VV mode SAR data is 12.1 cm, and the maximum subsidence is 5.8 cm. the maximum uplift obtained by the VH mode SAR data is 11.2 cm, and the maximum subsidence is 9 cm. The results obtained by the two polarization modes are consistent. D-InSAR technology can accurately obtain the coseismic deformation field, which provides data guarantee for the follow-up study of the inversion of seismic source parameters in the region.

TI  - A Comprehensive Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion Method (CFSDAF) for Generating High Spatiotemporal Resolution Land Surface Temperature in Urban Area
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion of land surface temperature (LST) has a vital significance in studying the temporal and spatial variation of urban heat islands. But most existing LST fusion methods do not consider the highly heterogeneous urban surface and complexity of the spatial layout. In this study, a Comprehensive Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (CFSDAF) method was proposed to generate a high spatiotemporal resolution urban LST image, which was an improvement of the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF). The CFSDAF first adjusted the differences between coarse-resolution LST and fine-resolution LST. Then, the visible and near-infrared image of a fine resolution was introduced to execute spectral unmixing and to conduct soft classification, which considered the mixed pixel of fine-resolution LST. The inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation was used in improving the computational efficiency, and the constrained least square was selected to better distribute the residual. The performance of CFSDAF was compared with the temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and FSDAF. The results indicate that the predicted images by CFSDAF are better than STARFM and FSDAF from both visual comparison and quantitative assessment in two experiments, and CFSDAF can reserve more spatial details and accurately restore the spatial continuity of urban LST than others. Moreover, CFSDAF has high computational efficiency and can monitor land cover changes the same as FSDAF. Due to the above advantages, the CFSDAF has great potential for studying spatiotemporal changes of LST and UHI in an urban area.

TI  - Large-Gradient Interferometric Phase Unwrapping Over Coal Mining Areas Assisted by a 2-D Elliptical Gaussian Function
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phase unwrapping (PU) is a key step in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface monitoring, which is directly related to the accuracy of the line-of-sight (LOS) displacement observations. Underground coal mining generally results in large gradient displacements, producing dense and aliasing fringes in interferograms. In this case, it is challenging to accurately unwrap interferometric phases using traditional methods. This letter proposes an iterative algorithm to unwrap interferometric phases over underground coal mining areas. First, differential interferogram is unwrapped by the minimum cost flow (MCF) method to obtain unwrapped phases at the edge of the mining subsidence basin. Then, a 2-D elliptical Gaussian function, which could approximately describe the spatial shape of mining subsidence basin, is used to iteratively reduce the phase gradients of interferograms, so that residual wrapped phases at more pixel in subsidence basin can be unwrapped. The presented method was tested over Datong coal mine, China, based on 16 TerraSAR-X acquisitions. The result suggests that the accuracy of time-series displacements along the LOS direction solved from the unwrapped phases using the new PU method is 1.1 cm, indicating an improvement of 73.2% compared with that of using the traditional MCF method.

AB  - The meteorological satellite named Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) was launched on November 15th, 2017 (UTC+8). The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Occultation Sounder (GNOS) is loaded on the FY-3D, which can use the received the GNSS signals including Global Positioning System (GPS) and Chinese Beidou (BDS) to detect the global atmosphere. The combination of FY-3D and FY-3C plays an important role in improving the accuracy of atmospheric detection and enhancing the detection of space environment and meteorological remote sensing capabilities. Radiosonde data from 201 stations around the world are used to evaluate the FY-3D radio occultation (RO) wet profile products (temperature and specific humidity) in 2020. The results show that the bias between the temperature profile of FY-3D and radiosonde is about -0.0073 K, and the mean standard deviation (STD) is 1.84 K at 15 pressure layers. In the range from 925 hPa to 250 hPa, the bias between specific humidity profile of FY-3D and radiosonde is 0.2 g/kg-1.7 g/kg at 7 pressure layers, and the mean STD is about 25%. The results show that the RO wet profile products of FY-3D in 2020 have reached a high precision, the temperature profile is 8% higher than that of FY-3C, and the quality of specific humidity profile is comparable to FY-3C.

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-a Concentrations in Small Water Bodies: Comparison of Fused Gaofen-6 and Sentinel-2 Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a concentrations in water bodies are one of the most important environmental evaluation indicators in monitoring the water environment. Small water bodies include headwater streams, springs, ditches, flushes, small lakes, and ponds, which represent important freshwater resources. However, the relatively narrow and fragmented nature of small water bodies makes it difficult to monitor chlorophyll-a via medium-resolution remote sensing. In the present study, we first fused Gaofen-6 (a new Chinese satellite) images to obtain 2 m resolution images with 8 bands, which was approved as a good data source for Chlorophyll-a monitoring in small water bodies as Sentinel-2. Further, we compared five semi-empirical and four machine learning models to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations via simulated reflectance using fused Gaofen-6 and Sentinel-2 spectral response function. The results showed that the extreme gradient boosting tree model (one of the machine learning models) is the most accurate. The mean relative error (MRE) was 9.03%, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 4.5 mg/m(3) for the Sentinel-2 sensor, while for the fused Gaofen-6 image, MRE was 6.73%, and RMSE was 3.26 mg/m(3). Thus, both fused Gaofen-6 and Sentinel-2 could estimate the chlorophyll-a concentrations in small water bodies. Since the fused Gaofen-6 exhibited a higher spatial resolution and Sentinel-2 exhibited a higher temporal resolution.

AB  - In this paper, a new semantic change detection (CD) dataset based on Chinese Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite images with high spatial resolution ( HSR) namely Wuhan Urban Semantic Understanding (WUSU) dataset is built up and a CD framework combining binary and semantic CD tasks based on deep learning and a conditional random field model (SDCRF) is proposed. Existing CD datasets mostly focus on "change/no change". Traditional CD methods pay attention only on either of the binary CD task or the semantic CD task. Although there are methods to handle both tasks simultaneously but they ignore the inconsistency between the two tasks. In the SDCRF framework, any stateof-the-art feature extraction model can be used to extract the class and change probabilities as the unary potential of a fully connected conditional random field (FC-CRF) model which is adopted as a post-processing to enhance the location information of deep networks and reduce outlier noise.

TI  - Comparison of methods to derive river water temperature using thermal infrared imagery : A case study of the upper Yangtze River catchment
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Water temperature is an essential factor that affects the ecology and environment of the river. Conventional river water temperature (RWT) measuring methods are limited by the geographic location of the hydrological station; thus, RWT data is under a sparse spatial resolution. With the improvement of the spatial resolution of thermal infrared sensors mounted on the satellites within the past twenty years, thermal infrared imagery has gradually been used to retrieve RWT. Currently, most research focuses on using sole sensor and specified processing methods without comparing with other sensors and retrieval approaches. Taking the upper Yangtze River catchment as a case study, this paper evaluates the impact of the following three steps within the entire process on the accuracy of RWT : thermal infrared data (MODIS and Landsat) ; atmospheric correction methods (the radiation transfer model and JM&S single-channel algorithm) ; atmospheric correction parameters (Atmcorr and GEOS-5 FP-IT). The results indicated that (i) MODIS data cannot meet the requirements of the study area due to its low spatial resolution; (ii) As the atmospheric water vapor content is relatively high in the study catchment, the JM&S single-channel algorithm performs poorly on the retrieval; (iii) When there is measured RWT within the study catchment, the proper retrieval process will be using the RTM combined with Atm- corr atmospheric correction parameter and further corrected by using the logistic regression while the final RMSE is about 1.0-1.1 degrees C ; (iv) For the basin without measured RWT, the more suitable way is to use the GEOS-5 FP-IT instead and set an atmospheric correction parameter threshold. Its RMSE is approximately 1.2 degrees C. Meanwhile, the results also present that atmospheric transmittance and upward radiation are the key parameters affecting the accuracy of RWT. Therefore, we highly recommended that a similar sensitivity analysis should be applied to other catchments for further studies.

TI  - Feasibility and efficiency of contrast enhanced ultrasound real time guided fine needle aspiration for sentinel lymph node of breast cancer
T2  - CLINICAL HEMORHEOLOGY AND MICROCIRCULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: To assess the feasibility and efficiency of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) real-time guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) of breast cancer.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 21 breast cancer patients who scheduled for surgical resection performed CEUS real-time guided SLN-FNA and intraoperative SLN biopsy (SLNB). The success rate of CEUS real-time guided SLN-FNA was analyzed. The FNA diagnostic efficiency of SLN metastasis was analyzed compared to SLNB.RESULTS: Twenty-six SLNs were detected by intradermal CEUS whereas 130 SLNs were detected by SLNB. The median SLNs detected by intradermal CEUS (n = 1) and by SLNB (n = 5) was significantly difference (p < 0.001). All 26 CE-SLNs of 21 patients were successfully performed intradermal CEUS dual image real-time guided SLN-FNA including 5 SLNs of 4 patients which were difficult to distinguish in conventional ultrasound. Compared to SLNB, FNA found 2 of 5 cases of SLN metastasis, the diagnosis sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false negative rate, false positive rate and Yoden index were 40%, 100%, 100%, 84.2%, 60%, 0% and 40%, respectively.CONCLUSION: SLN-FNA real-time guided by dual CEUS image mode was technically feasible. Patients with a positive SLN-FNA should be advised to ALND without intraoperative SLNB according to Chinese surgeon and patients' conservatism attitude. But a negative SLN-FNA did not obviate the need of conventional SLNB because of the high false negative rate.

TI  - Retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration based on Sentinel-2 images in inland lakes
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Eutrophication of water is becoming more and more serious, especially Case 2 waters in inland lakes. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is an important characterized parameter of inland lakes. Its monitoring can effectively reflect the eutrophication degree and changes of inland lakes. This study takes Chagan Lake as the research area, which is located in Jilin Province, Northeast China. Using Sentinel-2 images combined with the in-situ measurements at the same day to establish the inversion model of Chl-a concentration through single-band and band-ratio methods. In the process, models with these two methods using in-situ hyperspectral data which is corresponding to bands on Sentinel-2 are also developed. The experimental results show that the band-ratio method has a better effect on inhibiting the effects of total suspended sediments (TSS) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) compared with single band method. In-situ model (R-2= 0.69) and model for Sentinel-2 (R-2= 0.69) have RMSE at 2.54 ug L-1 and 2.51 ug L-1, respectively. Thus, it is feasible to retrieve Chl-a in inland lakes from northeast China by remote sensing using the band-ratio method, which is of great significance for monitoring and early warning of water eutrophication.

TI  - Parallelized Nonlinear Target Detection for Asbestos Identification in Large-Scale Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the side effects of asbestos on human health and environments, many countries have banned the use of asbestos-containing materials, but there are still illegal products with asbestos in daily life. In order to investigate the distributions of asbestos to facilitate its removal, this letter studies the feasibility of asbestos identification with hyperspectral (HS) and panchromatic (PAN) data, taking images captured by the PRISMA and ZY1E 2-D satellites over Pavia, Italy, as examples. In this work, a pansharpening method with guided filter was used to improve the HS image quality in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial details. Then, the possible location of asbestos could be obtained by a nonlinear target detector named bilinear sparse target detector (BSTD). Considering high computational cost for large-scale remote sensing data processing, we further develop BSTD to its parallelized version (denoted as PBSTD). Given the ground truth of asbestos over Pavia by the Regional Environmental Protection Agency-ARPA, Lombardia, our PBSTD and several popular methods are evaluated from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives, showing that most algorithms could correctly detect large-size asbestos roofs, and the nonlinear PBSTD and MSDinter perform better in small-size asbestos identification than other linear detectors. However, the detection accuracy on small-size asbestos is insufficient in practical applications, which indicates that there are still issues to achieve accurate small-size asbestos identification using coarse-spatial-resolution spaceborne remote sensing.

TI  - A Multiscale Land Use Regression Approach for Estimating Intraurban Spatial Variability of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration by Integrating Multisource Datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Poor air quality has been a major urban environmental issue in large high-density cities all over the world, and particularly in Asia, where the multiscale complex of pollution dispersal creates a high-level spatial variability of exposure level. Investigating such multiscale complexity and fine-scale spatial variability is challenging. In this study, we aim to tackle the challenge by focusing on PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m,) which is one of the most concerning air pollutants. We use the widely adopted land use regression (LUR) modeling technique as the fundamental method to integrate air quality data, satellite data, meteorological data, and spatial data from multiple sources. Unlike most LUR and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)-PM2.5 studies, the modeling process was conducted independently at city and neighborhood scales. Correspondingly, predictor variables at the two scales were treated separately. At the city scale, the model developed in the present study obtains better prediction performance in the AOD-PM2.5 relationship when compared with previous studies (R2 over bar from 0.72 to 0.80). At the neighborhood scale, point-based building morphological indices and road network centrality metrics were found to be fit-for-purpose indicators of PM2.5 spatial estimation. The resultant PM2.5 map was produced by combining the models from the two scales, which offers a geospatial estimation of small-scale intraurban variability.

TI  - Investigating the Intra-Annual Dynamics of Kunlun Glacier in the West Kunlun Mountains, China, From Ascending and Descending Sentinel-1 SAR Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring glacier dynamics is an effective approach for quantifying the response of the glaciers in cold arid mountainous areas to climate change. However, the quantification of short-term flow dynamics of the mountain glaciers in cold-dry climates has rarely been reported. This article investigated the intra-annual flow dynamics in terms of velocity and ice thickness changes on the Kunlun glacier, a mountain glacier in the cold-dry west Kunlun mountains, using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. We applied the improved pixel-offset-tracking small-baseline-subset method (PO-SBAS) on ascending and descending Sentinel-1A SAR images acquired in 2017 and 2018 to estimate the three-dimensional (i.e., north-south, west-east, and vertical) velocity time series of the glacier. The vertical velocities were further decomposed into the surface-parallel-flow (SPF) and the nonsurface-parallel-flow (nSPF) components, which link glacier motion along glacier surface slope and internal ice deformation, respectively, to glacier thickness changes. Our findings show that the eastern branch of the glacier moved faster than the western branch. We inferred that a loss of ice thickness due to a previous surge on the western branch should be responsible for its slower flow. The nSPF rates are higher than the SPF rates in both branches, indicating that internal ice deformation primarily controls the changes in ice thickness. We also observed an apparent summer acceleration in the nSPF rates, which is likely caused by changes in subglacial hydrological conditions. This article highlights the potential uses of the improved PO-SBAS method of quantifying the flow dynamics of the glaciers in cold-dry mountain regions.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval Based on Neural Network Model Using Polarized Scanning Atmospheric Corrector (PSAC) Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the successors of the Huanjing Jianzai-1 (HJ-1) series satellites in the Chinese Environmental Protection and Disaster Monitoring Satellite Constellation, the first two Huanjing Jianzai-2 (HJ-2) A/B satellites have been successfully launched on September 27, 2020. The polarized scanning atmospheric corrector (PSAC) sensors, onboard the HJ-2 A/B satellites, are served as the synchronously atmospheric correction instrument requiring a high-speed and accurate aerosol optical depth (AOD) algorithm. For this purpose, we proposed a neural network-based AOD retrieval model (named the AODNet) that takes full advantage of the multispectral measurements of PSAC for AOD retrieval at a high speed. The training of AODNet is conducted by the simulated observation data (currently applicable for the China region) from the forward calculation using the radiative transfer model. In this way, the land surface reflectance (LSR) is no need for our well-trained model. It is expected to be one of the effective ways to solve the ill-pose problem in the decoupling of the atmosphere and surface information in AOD retrieval. Either the Sun-sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET) AOD or the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD was used to validate the AODNet AOD. The correlation coefficient is higher than 0.85, and more than 60% of the AODNet AOD can fall into the expected error envelope of +/-(0.05+20%). The cross-comparison shows that the AODNet has better accuracy than MODIS dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) algorithm. The air pollution episode is well characterized by the AODNet AOD using PSAC data.

AB  - Phased-Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-3 (PALSAR-3) onboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite-4 (ALOS-4) is a spaceborne L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system, capable of high resolution and wide swath observation. ALOS-4 utilizes digital beamforming (DBF) and multiple transmit channel (MTC) techniques to overcome swath width and azimuth resolution trade-off relationship. In addition, ALOS-4 signal data requires signal processing, such as azimuth multi-beamforming and sub-band phase correction, before conventional SAR image processing can be implemented. In this paper, newly developed signal processing algorithm for ALOS-4 and results of the validation of the algorithm using flight model data will be discussed.

T2  - Uttar Pradesh Journal of Zoology
M3  - Article
AB  - Undesirable conversion of land from natural to human-induced landscape has been increasing in this century because of many interrelated factors thereby increasing the frequency and intensity of flooding. Thus, this study aimed at examining land use/cover dynamics and effects of flooding on socio-economic conditions of households in Dawo District for the past three decades. Data collection techniques employed in this study were questionnaire, key informant interviews, group discussions and personal observation. Sample sizes of 310 households were contacted for questionnaire survey using systematic sampling techniques while purposive sampling technique was applied for identifying participants of group discussions and interviews. Landsat imageries of 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2020 were utilized for studying land cover dynamics and the classification was done by using supervised maximum likelihood classifier algorithm. The results of the study demonstrated that in the past three decades (1991 - 2020), vegetation and grass land have been severely diminished aggravating the severity of flooding on livelihoods of the local communities. Thus, the results obtained from the image reveal that settlement and cultivation land of the study area have been reduced by 202.15 and 640.22 ha respectively. The collapse of grass and vegetation have been documented mainly because of absence of integrated land use planning in the country. The results of the study also show that standing crop, livestock production, grazing land, housing conditions, sources of drinking water and school attendance have been adversely affected by flooding events leading to the disturbance of livelihoods of the households. Therefore, the study recommended the development of integrated land use planning and locally applied flood controlling measures.

AB  - This article presents a method to map the extent of forest plantation in an area located in the Sao Paulo State (Brazil). The proposed method applies the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) datasets to derive annually vegetation, soil and shade fraction images for local analysis. We used 30 m annual mosaics of TM images during the 1985 to 1995 time period. These fraction images have the advantage to reduce the volume of data to be analyzed highlighting the target characteristics. Then, we generated only one mosaic for each fraction images for TM dataset computing de maximum value through this period, facilitating the classification of areas occupied by forest plantation. The proposed method allowed to classify two forest plantation classes: Eucalypt and Pine. In addition, it allowed to monitor the phenological stages of Eucalypt according to its growth cycle. The results are very important for planning and management by the commercial companies and can contribute to develop an automatic method to map forest plantation areas in a regional and global scales.

AB  - Human Computer Biosphere Interaction (HCBI) is a relatively new academic discipline that acts as a critical juncture between the conservation biology and the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT). HCBI domain exploits the capabilities of the repertoire of available technological tools to remotely sense data from difficult geographical terrains in a secure and cost-effective manner. In this perspective paper, we highlight some of the bio-acoustic technologies that we have been using for our research in Fukushima prefecture, Japan. Learning from our experience in Fukushima, we provide our preliminary viewpoint on the possibility of incorporating HCBI research in Manang, Nepal. Our impressions are largely based on the site visit to Manang and informal interaction with locals and conservation specialists. The preliminary feasibility study will prove useful in future as we plan a full-fledged ICT based animal conservation study to assess how the application of ICT tools for wildlife monitoring can contribute to the economic empowerment of locals in Manang who depend on subsistence farming. In summary, this paper provides a preliminary overview of the potentiality of technology transfer from Japan to the remote hilly areas in Nepal for wildlife conservation by employing ICT tools and participatory sensing approach.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The information on land use and land cover (LULC) plays a critical role in understanding the interactions between human activities and the natural environment. The changes in LULC have a significant impact on the ecological integrity of forests, biodiversity, and natural resources, which in turn trigger global environmental change. Forest fragmentation is an important conservation challenge that includes interdependent forest loss components and spatial shift patterns. Over the years, Northeast India has experienced major changes in LULC and forest fragmentation. There are limited information and data regarding the change in LULC patterns and causes of forest fragmentation. The present study was carried out with an attempt to analyze the change in LULC and forest fragmentation using satellite data of three different time series: 1991, 2005, and 2020 for Ukhrul district, Manipur, Northeast India. Different LULC classes were classified using the supervised method, viz., maximum likelihood algorithm in ERDAS Imagine 2014 and generated thematic maps in ArcGIS 10.4 software. Considering the classified forest class, fragmentation in the forest area was grouped into different categories of fragmentation using the Landscape Fragmentation Tool (LFT v 2.0). The distribution of the perforated category has tremendously increased in 2020 from 1991. The outcome of the present study will help to understand the inherent forest vulnerability and to adopt sustainable management strategies for forest and agriculture ecosystems in the hill landscape.

TI  - Satellite Image Target Super-Resolution With Adversarial Shape Discriminator
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial progress in generative modeling has facilitated the development of perceptual-driven methods for image super-resolution (SR), which shows superior visual quality as rated by human observers. However, we discover that most existing methods are biased to synthesize fake details or enhanced textures and fail to learn representations of object shape. They are often misguided to recover the shape of small objects and focus on generating less meaningful high-frequency components. This is problematic when super-resolving satellite imagery since it contains many relatively small and clustered objects in a broad area. In this letter, we propose a new perceptual-driven SR method that has a stronger preference toward shape information. We integrate the scale-space filtering with the discriminator to attenuate high-frequency components in its decision space. It effectively encourages our discriminator to concentrate on structural shape information in differentiating real and fake images. We also devise a cross-scale aggregation network for the generator architecture. Experiments on WorldView data set demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to recent perceptual-driven methods.

AB  - Shin Dong-yeop’s poem is characterized by a theme consciousness clearly marked by ideology orientation and a reproduction strategy in which unique historical perception functions as a methodological basis. The ideal of an operetta-like spacetime composition reflecting the organic worldview and a buffer zone through romanticized nature are key features revealed in Shin Dong-yeop’s poetry. This paper defines the core dynamics of Shin Dong-yeop as political romanticism and focuses on closely tracking the unique representation modality that appeared in Shin Dong-yeop’s poetry. In Shin Dong-yeop’s poem, nature and humans form an organic relationship, and in nature, humans form their own essence as auto-formation. The stage where the poetic consciousness is realized also goes beyond the time and space in the individual starters, showing trans-temporal, trans-spatial and trans-human characteristics. It is the logic of political romanticity that builds a temporal and spatial order on top of the actual experience and reality that is stepping against justification or abstraction. Shin Dong-yeop defines poetry in the sense of encompassing poetic drama, operetta, and long poem. Poetry is adopted as the best tool to realize true human liberation. In conclusion, Shin Dong-yeop’s poetic ideal turns out to be the logic of the revolution through political romanticity. It would be said that the theme of the dynamics of the revolution while using a representation strategy based on concrete reality is a key factor in Shin Dong-yeop’s poetry. The question poeticized by Shin Dong-yeop leaves the possibility that it can be re-approved as a topic of civilization history beyond literary history.

AB  - This thesis studies the modern enlightenment consciousness that appeared in the Chinese poem of Sofa Oh Hyo-won, a female poet who lived in Japanese colonial era. He is a female poet who was born as a woman at the end of the Joseon Dynasty and lived a strange life with a strange fate, leaving 474 poems. Most of his poems express Japanese colonial era's feminine daily life with affection, so if you look at the trajectory of life along his poems, Japanese colonial era is vividly depicted and revealed.His poems reveal an enlightenment consciousness and advanced worldview to emphasize the need for modern women's education and establish a women's school by enlightening the Confucian feudal society of the Southern Journey to Korea. In particular, he looked back at Japanese colonial era Japan and was able to see the perception of women's education and modern civilization in poems. In addition, he moved to China, looked at the process of modernization of China, and returned after recognizing the East Asian modern era during the transition period through exchanges with Chinese celebrities. His poems written at this time have a small amount of poetry, but some poems reveal the characteristics of resistance literature, which implies nationalist literary tendencies and patriotic fighting spirit during the Japanese colonial period.The consciousness of modern enlightenment that appears in his poems contains the awakening of the ego toward our people. The theme consciousness of his poems reveals anti-feudal, ethnic, and popular movement tendencies, and contains a spirit of desperate patriotic enlightenment aimed at excitement and education. It was only at this time that I could see the buds of true national literature and realism literature. Oh Hyo-won's Chinese poem is the Unique style of Joseon Women's History.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper offers a new interpretation of shijiao paintings 石交圖 by Ni Yuanlu 倪元璐 (1594-1644), a literati artist of the late Ming (1368-1644). The term shijiao 石交 was used from the Tang (618-906) period allusively for firm, stone-like, friendships between learned men. In keeping with this artistic convention, Ni’s album “Ni Hongbao Paintings of Shijiao,” now in the Princeton University Art Museum, is understood to represent the friendship between Ni and his brother Ni Xianru or between Ni and his close friends. My research has focused on the social life of another shijiao painting, which is lost but was recorded by its collectors. They invariably saw the painting as expressing friendship between man and stone. This idea comes from East Asian worldview, in which man and the myriad objects derive from a common source and more importantly affect each other. This interpretation might be dismissed as literati rhetoric, such as personification or prosopopoeia, but evidently, stones work as an agency for Ni and collectors in the sense that they enhanced their mental power through assimilation with stones, while painting or appreciating them. Such premodern correlative thoughts resonates with posthumanist approaches to erase the human/nonhuman divide.

AB  - This paper analyzes the function of maps and cartography in Yoon Dong-Ju’s poems in constructing an alternative world in which a modern, scientific, and realistic cartography loses its significance and utility by being substituted with a rather primitive, allegorical, and poetic map-making. Geography, cartography, and imperialism are inherently linked with one another, and maps have been significant in shaping our worldview by influencing us emotionally and intellectually in the epistemological process of understanding of the world. Our worldview is shaped not only by scientific representations of the world, but also by cartographic representations which are abstract, allegorical, or fable-like. The first part of this paper is a discussion of the importance of maps and map-making in understanding the world during the Japanese colonial rule. The second part is a reading of two of Yoon’s poems, “Sonyon”(The Boy) and “Nunonun Chido”(The Snowing Map) epecially in intertextual relationship with Jong Ji-Yong’s “Chido”(Map) and Kim Dong Hwan’s Kukkyong ui Pam (A Night at the Border). I then conclude by suggesting that we read Yoon’s poem as an alternative cartographic space that resists being in harmony with the colonial episteme and the imperialistic worldview commanded by a realistic and scientific map of the modern world.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to reveal the meaning of the myth that <Kingdom> tried to embody through the analysis of the meaning of the zombie narrative in the drama <Kingdom>.In the drama <Kingdom>, the myth that emphasizes the cause of “the king who became a zombie is also a king” and the myth that “the king who became a zombie is no longer a king” collides head-on. If the senders of these two myths are Jo Hak-joo and Crown Prince Lee Chang, the receivers of these conflicting myths are the viewers who will see this drama.Also, the myths that oppose just as importantly as the conflict between the cause and the actual myth are the vested interests myth and the outsider myth. One of the main reasons why the drama <Kingdom> was able to gain popularity was that zombies with popular sensibility intervened in the conflict between vested and outsider myths, making viewers feel intense catharsis.Zombies in the drama turn them into zombies without discriminating against both the full authority and the outsider. And this indiscriminate worldview without distinction between good and evil in <Kingdom> is realized again through the myth of regeneration through water.In conclusion, the drama <Kingdom> allows viewers to empathize with the metaphor of zombies, thereby participating in the process of transformation of the myth that is constantly expanding and reproducing. Through this, the most idealized myth of the public is combined with a specific genre such as zombie, and succeeds in creating a synergistic popularity.

TI  - Noohumanism as a New Worldview Paradigm of the 21st century
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discloses the prerequisites of the Noohumanism, which incorporates the noospheric-environmental as well as the humanistic components. Studied is the role of the principle of harmony as a basic cornerstone element of the Noohumanism. The metaprinciple, being projected through each level of the "human-society-nature" system, generates the axiological array of the noohumanism and plays the regulatory role informing the not:humanistic senses and values.The aim hereof is to provide a rationale for the author's development of the worldview potential of the noohumanism as the homommous worldview concept based on the synthesis of the noospheric-environmental and humanistic worldview matrices. The noohumanistic worldview focused on the harmonization of the socio-naturril systems shall befarmed applying adequate approach, in this particular case, the noohumanistic approach, which plays the methodological role within the scope of the handled problem.The noohumanistic approach, as elaborated by the author, is the complex research method that helps to argue and approves the conceptual bases lying tinder the formation of the noohumanistic worldview and to slniclurize the framework of the determinant noohumanistic categories and concepts. The noohumanistic approach incorporates: (a) the mixed-level analysis and the subset of approaches (axiological, interrlisciplinary, regional, psycho-didactic, musicological et al.), exposing the philosophical-anthropological, culturological, psychological pedagogical and other requisites that predetermine the sociocultural, worldview-wise and moral significance of the noohumanism; (b) the noohumanistic ideas tracing their origins back to the philosophic, naturalistic, interdisciplinary areas of knowledge. The noohumanistic approach reflects the relevancy of the introduced worldview system as a social demand of the present.The scientific finding that resulted from the noohumanistic approach is the developed theoretical-methodological and methodical framework of the noohumanistic worldview within the scope of the philosophy of education to provide blueprint principles for the incipient noohumanistic pedagogy - one of the most prospective areas of contemporary education.The practical implication hereof is that the study materials may be put into scholarly circulation and used in developing the strategies of the educational modernization, the youth policy and within the teaching and learning activities.

AB  - The world is under continuous threat of deadly virus Covid-19 and its rapidly evolving and mutating variants. Several efforts are being made by researchers and scientists worldwide to model and predict the behavior of spreading pattern of Covid-19 virus. In this paper, relationship between weather conditions and Covid19 spread rate is modelled with the help of data acquired by satellite using MODIS. To perform all the experiments, three data sets are used: one is taken from NASA related to MODIS and weather satellite images, second data set is of Kaggle related to latest Covid-19 case reports and third data set used is related to weather. Further, Covid-19 data set is also analyzed and modeled using look up learning 2D model. From the experimental results, it is observed that the various weather parameters obtained from satellite can be used to model the impact and spread of Covid- 19. The data set once prepared is fed as input to early warning system for Covid-19. It is concluded that the designed system can be an efficient technique for issuing precautionary alert in the society.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF THE CLIMATIC FACTORS ON THE MASS FLOWERING DATES OF <i>BULBOCODIUM VERSICOLOR</i> (MELANTHIACEAE) AT THE SOUTH-EASTERN BORDER OF ITS RANGE
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Under conditions of climate change, phenological studies of vegetation are of particular importance. Most of the current research are carried out in Protected Areas (PAs), network of phenological stations, agricultural lands, nurseries, and botanical gardens. Studies based on remote sensing data do not take into account the species diversity of the vegetation cover. This study is aimed to determine regularities of the timing of Bulbocodium versicolor mass flowering at the southeast border of its range. The studied B. versicolor population is located in the vicinity of the city Volgograd, which makes it available for research. At the same time, the B. versicolor population is under constant anthropogenic pressure. Understanding the phenological features of this species and regularities of the timing of mass flowering (the period of highest vulnerability) will allow us to organise the protection of the B. versicolor population during this period. The study is based on data about the beginning of mass flowering dates, obtained during surveys of 2007-2020 with a possible error of 2-7 days, as well as an archive of weather data of the Volgograd weather station. The average start date of mass flowering is 24 March +/- 12 days. The range between the earliest and latest dates exceeds a month. We have found a statistically significant correlation between the start date of B. versicolor mass flowering and the date of snow cover destruction, as well as dates of stable transition of the maximum air temperature over 0 degrees C, and the average daily temperature, over 0 degrees C and over 3 degrees C. Over the period 2007-2020, no statistically significant trends were found for either dates of B. versicolor mass flowering or dates of main meteorological phenomena. Almost every year, after the start of B. versicolor mass flowering, frosts occur on the soil and in the air, and snowfalls take place regularly. This may be one of the factors which cause a lower seed regeneration in this B. versicolor population compared to the ones located northward, since the temperature drop during the flowering period contributes to the depressive state of the B. versicolor population.

TI  - An Area-Based Projection Algorithm for SAR Radiometric Terrain Correction and Geocoding
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes a projection algorithm between radar and map coordinates based on the representation of radar samples as area elements (AEs) rather than point elements. Each AE on the map grid (geographic grid) is associated with a number of radar grid samples that intersect completely or partially the AE. The association enables the geocoding (i.e., the map projection of radar imagery) with adaptive multilooking, accurately accounting for all radar samples contributing to the geocoded elements according to topography and radar geometry. By using averaging rather than interpolation, the proposed projection does not suffer from interpolation overfitting. The area-based geocoding also enables the generation of the geocoded polarimetric covariance matrix (GCOV) and geocoded synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferograms with adaptive multilooking. Analogously, the slant-range projection of geocoded data is improved by projecting geographic grid pixels onto the radar grid according to their corresponding location based on the radar geometry without leaving gaps. This approach is used to reduce the computation time of previously published radiometric terrain correction (RTC) algorithms, performing 3.6-6.5 times faster over multilooked data and up to 26.3 times faster over single-look data. We demonstrate the strengths of the proposed area projection (AP) algorithm for RTC and geocoding using Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR), Sentinel-1B, and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data, and evaluate the results in the context of the upcoming NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission.

TI  - MODERNITY AND MODERNIZATION: INSTITUTIONS, PRACTICES AND IMAGES IN WESTERN SIBERIA (1934-1939)

M3  - Article
AB  - The study is devoted to the problem of applicability of the theory of modernization to the realities of the interwar USSR. The goal is to reveal and analyze the possibility and admissibility of using the terms "modernity" and modernization to the history of Soviet Western Siberia in the 1930s. The realities and ideological images of the agrarian-industrial region in the period between the 17th and 18th congresses of the CPSU (b) have been studied. An important role in the study is played by the analysis of the key concepts of Sovietologists who analyzed the problems of the Soviet version of modernization.The source base of the article is represented by office-work and egodocuments, journalistic and informational materials of periodicals, as well as elements of visual symbolism of Soviet painting, cinema, architectural and urban spaces. The analysis of mass sources is carried out by the methods of content analysis, discourse analysis and intent analysis based on the systemic and civilizational approaches. In addition, the study is based on the theory of constructing images of reality (simulacra). The elements of these images and their socio-worldview functions are analyzed.The definitions of modernization as a systemic historical process and modernity as an ideological and ideological construct about the "modernity of the Soviet system" were given. Further, the indicators of modernization in Western Siberia, its dynamics, taking into account the mass political campaigns of 1934-1939, and the main logistic and organizational contradictions were studied. It was found that effective modernization was a complex process, during which a number of difficulties arose related to the characteristics of the region, personnel, organizational and socio-economic problems. The inconsistency of research assessments of the course and results of Soviet modernization was noted.Modernity is considered as an ideological construct that is difficult for contemporaries to perceive which is a simulacrum of the modernity of the USSR and the advanced system. An analysis of the Soviet official periodicals showed the active formation of a simulacrum of modernity (modern present and promising future), but complex social realities did not contribute to strengthening the confidence of Soviet people that their society was advanced. Therefore, real modernization was often carried out by mobilization.Conclusions of the article are about the complex nature of modernization and the difficulties in the formation of a modern worldview in the USSR in connection with the excessive mobilization and statist practices of the party state. The author proves the controversial nature of the application of the theory of modernization to the study of Soviet realities and makes an assumption about the need for further development of the direction of social history of the USSR.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article continues the cycle of the author's works analyzing the objectivity of theology, its position within the scientific space and beyond. The analysis is given from the point of view of the philosophy of science as a philosophical discipline, which, in addition to the general section, has a specification of areas, branches and groups of specialties adopted in the modern science of science and scientometrics. The content of theology is described taking into account the work on improving the range of scientific specialties, which is now being carried out in Russia. First, the author proposes a method and parameters for evaluating the scientific work of a theologian, taking into account the worldview, competence and religious and confessional affiliation. This approach takes into account the peculiarities of the intellectual work of the theologian and describes the parameters that identify the results of this work. Secondly, the article deals with the religious-confessional and scientific aspects of theology as a branch of knowledge (a group of specialties), which is part of the family of social and human sciences. Thus, the author again draws attention to the intellectual and value-worldview resource of theology in modern life and the need to comprehend it, including within the framework of the philosophy of science.

AB  - Marine eddies observed in radar, optical and radiometric panoramas of the sea surface play an important role in the processes of ocean local and global mixing, suspended and organic matter redistribution, propagation of pollutant waters, biological processes et al. Meanwhile, in-situ investigations of the statistical characteristics of generating vortices in the water areas are difficult to conduct. The widespread method of marine eddies investigation is based on the remote sensing data. However, the relation between the characteristics of spiral structures and the marine eddies which lead to their manifestation is poorly studied. In order to investigate this relation, we apply the well-known MCC-method. Investigation of the horizontal fields related to the manifestation of spiral structures revealed new peculiarities which can be described analytically. The analytical model describes the velocity field composed of a marine eddy and a homogeneous current, the results are confirmed by the velocity fields obtained using satellite data, the new features of upper ocean currents associated with marine eddies are discussed. The described approach allows to retrieve inner structure of the genuine velocity field related to marine eddy.

AB  - Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator has been gradually deployed on edge Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for satellite remote sensing. However, the considerable complexity of software/hardware co-design inhibits the development of data processing applications on edge FPGAs. Moreover, the performance of edge FPGAs is restricted due to limited bandwidth and excessive software/hardware communication overhead in satellite remote sensing. To reduce codesign complexity, we propose a software/hardware data mapping framework for the deployment efficiency of the remote sensing data accelerator, called Fast-Pipe. Especially the software design of Fast-Pipe takes into account the interaction requirements of accelerator deployment and the poll and copy latency of data transfers. The data transfer driver is implemented in the user space to reduce latency with a new scheduling method and an interrupt policy for sending and receiving data. Meanwhile, an associated hardware structure is designed with Direct Memory Access (DMA) to implement data scheduling and mapping. With Fast-Pipe, the data in the software buffer is mapped into multiplexed data streams. Experimental results show that FastPipe speed up 46.38x in small data transfer, and average 2x higher in large data transfer than previous work with stable data transfer speed.

TI  - Anthropological dimensions of war in the works of Natalia Kobrynska
T2  - BALKANISTIC FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - In the article, Nataliia Kobrynska's anti-military prose is analyzed in the context of an anthropological approach, which makes it possible to shed light on the "human and war" issue in a wide anthropological range. In particular, aspects of col-lective and individual emotions of war, gender issues, Christian anthropology, trauma of loss, motive of escape, national memory and archetypes, psychology of murder, chil-dren's perception of war are considered. This involves the biographical context of the writer herself, who witnessed and fell victim to the war, personally experiencing all its horrors and describing them in her works.The artistic description of war is dominated by N. Kobrynska's expressionist worldview, depictions of the phenomena of mental and physical pain, borderline states of existence, ontologization of death, cordocentrism, motives of the end of the world, phantasmagoric visions of mutilation, deconstruction of the human body. The writer demonstrates the war-induced transformations in both public and individual conscious-ness that the new frontline experience has brought to an individual. It is particularly evident in the psychology of her characters, as the author notes the deformation of hu-man values, when, on the one hand, a person adapts to war, experiences emotional atrophy, becomes inert to murder, and on the other hand, the same person gains new experience - the struggle for new vital meanings, mercy towards one's neighbor, exalted prayerfulness, ritual veneration of heroes, waiting for relatives to return from war. The anthropological dimensions of the phenomenon of war are dominated by the humanistic guidelines of the writer.

TI  - The Arctic Chronotope in the Short Novels by Z. Davydov "Beruny" and K. Badigin "The Way to Grumant"
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article defines the significant components of the Arctic chronotope in the adventures of the Mezen "Robinsons." The empirical basis of the research was the historical short novel (povest') by Zinovy Davydov "Beruny" (1933) and the short novel (povest') by Konstantin Badigin "The Way to Grumant" (1953). A comparative analysis of these works was carried out. The choice of texts is explained by the relatively little amount of research done on them and the specifics of the story being told, which centers around people of heroic professions - seafarers and whalers. The plot of the short novels of Z. Davydov and K. Badigin is based on a real event of the 18th century - the adventures of Russian sailors on a deserted island in the Arctic, described by P. L. Le Roy in 1766. Various aspects of the Arctic are presented by Z. Davydov and K. Badigin (the territory of eternal cold, the land of death, the entrance to the otherworld, the place of forced stay of the Pomors, the zone of extreme human experience, the apophatic image where death borders on life), acting as a real-geographical and actually artistic chronotope. The Arctic chronotope includes toposes and loci that determine the individual destinies of the Mezen. The article characterizes the behavior of the heroes in the liminal conditions of the Arctic chronotope. The harmony of the heroes' consciousness with the rhythms of the objective world determines the possibility of survival of the "grumlans" on the island. A comparative analysis of the worldview of the hero of European literature (Robinson Crusoe by D. Defoe) and the heroes of Russian literature is carried out. The article considers the "hunting" and "survival" plot situations, which are the most representative for the behavior of the characters, and allows describing the unique features of the national and cultural identification of Russian "Robinsons" and comprehending the picture of the world depicted by the writers. It captures their special attitude to life and death, mythological worldview, adherence to the immutable laws of the Pomeranian fishing rite, the relationship of whalers with each other and the space in which they live.

TI  - Algorithm for Additional Correction of Remote Sensing Reflectance in the Presence of Absorbing Aerosol: Case Study
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The main goal of this work is to develop an algorithm for additional correction of Level 2 remote sensing reflectance ocean color satellite data, taking into account the presence of absorbing aerosol over the Black Sea, where a large number of dust transfers from the Sahara are observed annually.Methods and Results. The research method is based on the comparison of satellite data about remote sensing reflectance from MODIS-Aqua/Terra scanner and in situ measurements from AErosol ROboties NETwork Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) stations. The Python mathematical package was used for the data processing: analysis and visualization of satellite images were made in SeaDAS. As a basis for an additional correction algorithm, theoretical calculations were provided to take into account aerosol stratification in the radiative transfer equation, it is shown that for absorbing aerosol the atmospheric correction error is proportional to lambda(-4). The analytical conclusions were confirmed during the validation of the satellite and the in situ measurements using principal component analysis (PCA). The new algorithm is based on the constancy of the color index value, characteristic of the selected region. For the Black Sea, the average value of color index at 412 and 443 nm (CI(412/443)) is approximately equal to 0.80 +/- 0.08, a small standard deviation indicates that the sample is slightly variable and considered as the reference value.Conclusions. The model values of the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) had a better agreement with the in situ values than the satellite Rrs(lambda) at Level 2. In the case of the dust aerosol presence, the developed model increases the coefficient of determination between the satellite and the in situ values of Rrs(lambda) by more than twice at 412 nm, the difference is also noticeable at 443 and 488 nm. The color indices calculated from the model values of Rrs(lambda), which are necessary for calculating chlorophyll alpha, are also in better agreement with the AERONET data (an increase in correlation by 20 %).

TI  - The Hemingway's Six-Word Story Effect: A Psycholinguistic Verification
T2  - PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. An empirical verification of the Hemingway's "sad hypothesis" and study of some individual characteristics of a discourse formation in a process of short texts understanding.Methods and procedure of research. The study was based on the principle of a standardized interview, which was carried out on a random sample (103 respondents) using the questionnaire. The subjects interpreted two proverbs and the short story by Hemingway ("For sale: baby shoes, never worn"). In each case, it was proposed to choose one of the six ready-made interpretations or to create an original one. Proverb explications were classified by experts as "normative" or "deviating", and interpretations of the story were evaluated into "sad" or "pragmatic" ones. Also, a "normativity index" was calculated for each respondent, reflecting the number of normative renditions of proverbs. The Psychogeometric test was used, and such socio-demographic characteristics were recorded as: gender, age, having children.Results. This study refutes the "sad hypothesis" regarding Hemingway's six-word story affect. The prevalence of pragmatic type interpretation over sentimental one is statistically significant. The type of interpretation turned out to be not directly related to any of the considered socio-demographic characteristics. It was found that the sad interpretation of the story reliably corresponds to a high normativity of the proverbs explications. Conversely, respondents with deviating interpretations of proverbs were significantly more likely to interpret Hemingway's story in a pragmatic way. Differential psychological features, which were distinguished using the Psychogeometric test, turned out to be an insignificant predictor of the six-word story interpretations.Conclusions. The analysis of the research results made it possible to argue the thesis that the differences in the formation of individual discourses are directly related to a worldview and indirectly determined by other factors in turn influencing the outlook. The interaction of the worldview with discursive practice that arises in the process of short texts understanding is carried out according to differential scenarios. These scenarios are conditioned by such individual characteristics as discursive conformity and discursive lability, which, in turn, correspond with high and low normativity, respectively. Above features are cognitive in nature. Their ontological localization coincides with the I-language (Chomsky).

TI  - Spatiotemporal pattern and long-term trend of global surface urban heat islands characterized by dynamic urban-extent method and MODIS data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the global surface urban heat island (SUHI) for 1711 cities during 2003-2019 was quantified by the dynamic urban-extent (DUE) scheme with the land surface temperature datasets from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Terra and Aqua through the Google Earth Engine platform. The global pattern and regional contrasts of SUHI intensity (SUHII), and the interannual changing rate of SUHII (dSUHII) were revealed at the annual, summer, and winter scales. Further, the associated driving factors for long-term SUHII were explored from a temporal perspective. The main findings are as follows: (1) Globally, the global mean SUHII over 2003-2019 for annual daytime (1.32 degrees C) and annual nighttime (1.09 degrees C) by DUE are generally higher than that by previous simplified urban-extent (SUE) scheme. Accordingly, the summer daytime and nighttime SUHIIs are 1.98 degrees C, 1.05 degrees C, while the winter daytime and nighttime SUHIIs are 0.76 degrees C, and 1.10 degrees C. (2) The annual, summer, and winter dSUHIIs are 0.11 degrees C/decade, 0.27 degrees C/decade, and -0.06 degrees C/decade, respectively, at daytime, and 0.07 degrees C/decade, 0.09 degrees C/decade, and 0.10 degrees C/decade, respectively, at nighttime. (3) The global SUHII and dSUHII demonstrates evident regional contrast. The warm temperate and snow zones show distinct seasonal variations from summer to winter for daytime SUHII. Specifically, the negative daytime SUHII is detected for the arid zone, which exhibits the highest day-night variation and shows decreasing trend. (4) The global SUHII and dSUHII indicate distinct latitudinal variations, and an additional flip-flop (daytime SUHII < nighttime SUHII) region is detected between 10 degrees S and 20 degrees S. (5) The long-term daytime SUHII are negatively regulated by the urban-rural difference on evaporative cooling of vegetation; while at nighttime, it is negatively affected by the urban-rural difference on surface thermophysical properties. It implies the urban greening and surface properties should be specifically concerned to increase the evaporation cooling and reduce the heat retention in SUHII mitigation.

AB  - In contexts where debate and deliberation is the norm, participants are regularly presented with new information that conflicts with their original beliefs. When required to update their beliefs (belief alignment), they may choose arguments that align with their worldview (confirmation bias). We test this and competing hypotheses in a constraint-based modeling approach to predict the winning arguments in multi-party interactions in the Reddit ChangeMyView dataset. We impose structural constraints that reflect competing hypotheses on a hierarchical generative Variational Auto-encoder. Our findings suggest that when arguments are further from the initial belief state of the target, they are more likely to succeed.

AB  - Image-to-image translation between different imaging modalities in Earth observation has become a widely utilized application area of deep learning. However, most of the translation is performed on real-valued data, to some extent neglecting the opportunities of complex-valued SAR data for interferometric methods. In this work, we propose a multi-task deep learning approach for simulating complex-valued InSAR data based on splitting the overall task into multi-modal image-to-image translation sub-tasks. Instead of synthesizing complex-valued SAR data directly, magnitudes, phase values and coherence magnitudes are simulated in parallel and combined to full complex-valued information afterward. With experiments on a Sentinel-1 interferogram, conditioned by DEM and land cover data, we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

AB  - Object recognition in synthetic aperture radar images is a well studied topic that has gained a significant amount of attention within the last decades. Modern approaches are based on machine learning, i.e. deep learning, and often show excellent performance. What is so far missing in the literature is a study dedicated to the generalization capabilities of object recognition approaches, i.e. how well a given system can be transferred to new and previously unseen data. In this paper, the proposed recognition model is trained and tested on a unique dataset of 25 high-resolution TerraSAR-X images (X-band), acquired over four different airports in Staring Spotlight mode. We show how classification performance changes for different application scenarios which require different training and evaluation setups.

AB  - The use of SAR satellite images will be very helpful in flood monitoring as the acquisition of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is possible day-night in all weather conditions and are very sensitive to water bodies and the changes in their behaviour. The usage of SAR (like Sentinal-1) images is an added advantage in handling the rescue operations and damage assessments based on images acquired before flood, flood at peak, and after flood effects. This paper discusses flood mapping and results in two different case studies. This is covered in phase-1 with RGB composite images of the cities of Gorakhpur and Ayodhya and phase-2 to analyse the flood situation using an accuracy assessment of Basti city based on the supervised classification method on SAR data. In this paper, random forest classification (RF) technique has been used to identify the flood prone areas by using Sentinel-1 satellite images and interpreted the changes detected for rescue operations. Sentinel-1 images are classified as Crisis image and Archive image, and further analysed to identify the flood prone areas (water bodies due to flood), permanent water bodies, urban (Built-up area), and vegetation.

TI  - Multi-Modal Fusion Transformer for Visual Question Answering in Remote Sensing
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - With the new generation of satellite technologies, the archives of remote sensing (RS) images are growing very fast. To make the intrinsic information of each RS image easily accessible, visual question answering (VQA) has been introduced in RS. VQA allows a user to formulate a free-form question concerning the content of RS images to extract generic information. It has been shown that the fusion of the input modalities (i.e., image and text) is crucial for the performance of VQA systems. Most of the current fusion approaches use modality-specific representations in their fusion modules instead of joint representation learning. However, to discover the underlying relation between both the image and question modality, the model is required to learn the joint representation instead of simply combining (e.g., concatenating, adding, or multiplying) the modality-specific representations. We propose a multi-modal transformer-based architecture to overcome this issue. Our proposed architecture consists of three main modules: i) the feature extraction module for extracting the modality-specific features; ii) the fusion module, which leverages a user-defined number of multi-modal transformer layers of the Visua1BERT model (VB); and iii) the classification module to obtain the answer. In contrast to recently proposed transformer-based models in RS VQA, the presented architecture (called VBFusion) is not limited to specific questions, e.g., questions concerning pre-defined objects. Experimental results obtained on the RSVQAxBEN and RSVQA-LR datasets (which are made up of RGB bands of Sentinel-2 images) demonstrate the effectiveness of VBFusion for VQA tasks in RS. To analyze the importance of using other spectral bands for the description of the complex content of RS images in the framework of VQA, we extend the RSVQAxBEN dataset to include all the spectral bands of Sentinel-2 images with 10m and 20m spatial resolution. Experimental results show the importance of utilizing these bands to characterize the land-use land-cover classes present in the images in the framework of VQA. The code of the proposed method is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/multimodal-fusion-transformer-for-vqa-in-rs.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the basic perspective of understanding the 『Daodezhenjing(道德經)』 of Yulgok, who was one of the representative thinkers of the Korean Neo-Confucianism in the 16th century and was active with a high status. To this end, I analyzed his unique work,   『Suneon(醇言)』.Yulgok tried to understand 　『Daodezhenjing』   through active exploration with an open academic posture, dispelling public concerns that they were heresy writings. The result is a work called   『Suneon』, and it has established itself as the first annotation of 『Daodezhenjing』   in the history of Confucianism in Korea.Yulgok mentions the main body of the province at the beginning of the   『Suneon』   and understood that the ‘do’ referred to in the   『Daodezhenjing』   was ‘Cheondo(天道)’, and that it was the source of all things. Therefore, it was emphasized that the harmony of ‘Cheondo’ Island means that humans and all things occur. Yulgok approached the problem of 'do', a key concept of   『Daodezhenjing』  , based on his Neo-Confucian worldview.Yulgok mentioned the discipline of ‘Self-Cultivating(修己)’ as his personality cultivation for the execution of ‘Do’ in   『Suneon』  , and showed the practice of ‘People-Governing(治人)’ who governs objects based on this ‘Self-Cultivating’.Yulgok's   『Daodezhenjing』   and understanding were not focused on simply comparing and contrasting the ideas of the province and studying abroad, but rather on seeking the possibility of harmony between the two ideas. Yulgok's   『Suneon』   suggest that the fundamental principles of Confucianism and Taoism can form a consensus and achieve a basic foundation by reexamining the world of   『Daodezhenjing』   based on his open academic attitude, and it can be said to have high ideological and historical significance.

AB  - This study aims to reveal that human nature suggested by Jeong Yak-yong is moral desire and explore implications for moral education.Jeong Yak-yong believes that Li(principle) exists only as an attribute belonging to phenomenal reality. Therefore he regards the origin of creation as Ki(generative force). The meaning that all beings in the universe share Ki and that Ki is the source of creation indicates that Jeong Yak-yong has a dynamic worldview. Likewise, the human nature being always in motion toward good or evil is defined as a dynamic state. This dynamic state is manifested in three aspects: moral desire, immoral desire, and unmoral desire. Among them, moral desire is presented in the form of human nature. The moral desire of Jeong Yak-yong has implications for the importance of positive feedback, the importance of introspection in the interaction of human relationships, and the importance of practice in moral education.

TI  - DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF EDUCATION AND HUMANIZATION OF RELATIONSHIPS IN THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT: SOME ASPECTS OF RELATIONSHIP AND MUTUAL INFLUENCE
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The modern educational space is permeated with elements of digitalization. Innovation has always been a chal-lenge for the education system, a traditionally conservative cluster of socio-cultural activity. The peculiarity of the digital transformation of modern education is the totality of this pro-cess, covering educational and methodological, organization-al, and scientific components. Under such conditions, the formation of contradictions in education between scientific and technological and humanities-science dimensions is ob-vious. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to identify cur-rent educational strategies with a clear prediction of trends in the relationship between digitalization and humanization. Two models for the further development of the educational space are proposed -confrontation and interaction at the lev-el: of human-technology. In this context, it is methodological-ly acceptable to use two scientific-philosophical methodolo-gies: dialectics and synergetic. Consequently, modern educa-tion is at a kind of bifurcation point since the coexistence of innovative technologies with traditional humanistic principles is no longer possible in the existing worldview paradigm. It is only a matter of time before a new system of the reciprocal influence of digital technologies on humanistic principles emerges.

TI  - Learning-Based Tracking of Crop Biophysical Variables and Key Dates Estimation From Fusion of SAR and Optical Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring crop development is of crucial importance to ensure sustainable management practices while promoting efficient land use. The ability of satellite remote sensing data to cover large areas offers a robust tool to aid this task. In this article, we propose a filtering framework, which uses Gaussian-process-based dynamic and observation models, an unscented Kalman filter, and the fusion of multitemporal SENTINEL-1 and SENTINEL-2 data to monitor crop biophysical variables. This method complements state-of-the-art filtering frameworks given its ability to learn models and uncertainties from data and to exploit the imagery temporal dimension. This enables the method to be transferable to other crop types, biophysical variables, and locations. We test the methodology to track asparagus below-ground carbohydrates and the season crop age and to forecast crop key dates. The amount of carbohydrates stored below ground in the plant's root system is highly associated with the yield of asparagus and the ability to establish a healthy canopy. Validation with ground truth showed that the use of more than one SENTINEL-1 orbit and SENTINEL-2 data provided the best tracking performances and a reliable way for handling missing data from a sensor. Under this configuration, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.802 Brix degrees (surrogate for carbohydrates). Similarly, it can retrieve crop age and forecast harvest date, with the MAE of six days. Remotely tracking below-ground carbohydrates may contribute toward reducing the destructive sampling required for its measurement in the field.

AB  - We use repeat geodetic imaging of two major ice stream systems in Antarctica (Rutford and Evans Ice Streams) to explore the impact of large ocean tides under the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf on the dynamics of the ice shelf/ice stream system. We rely on dense time series of radar image acquisitions from multiple vantage points to construct the full 3D surface displacement time history over time scales of months to years. Our observations come from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation. For Evans Ice Stream, we also use observations from Sentinel 1ab. These time series allow us to evaluate rheological models of ice stream margins and to identify regions of ephemeral sub-shelf grounding. Understanding the sensitivity of such ephemeral pinning points to future thinning of the ice shelf can play an important role in forecasts of the rate of sea level rise over coming decades.

TI  - STUDENTS OF THE RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN BORDER REGIONS ON THE PROBLEMS OF GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS IN THE CONDITIONS OF RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN EUROPE AND ASIA
T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercivilizational interaction, the main arena of which today is the Eurasian continent, is one of the fundamental problems of social science. Of particular interest are the border zones where it is directly carried out. The article examines the Russian-Kazakh border area - a space of centuries-old cultural dialogue of various civilizations, which is insufficiently studied today, this primarily relates to the social aspect. The demand for knowledge about the Russian- Kazakh border area is becoming especially relevant due to the growing importance of Asia for Russia. The author considers the border between countries not so much as a state-legal institution with material infrastructure necessary to ensure national security and interaction with neighboring states, but rather the consciousness and activity of people who ensure performance of these functions. The development of interstate relations imposes a special responsibility to fulfill the tasks of the border area on young people, as the most active and promising part of the population. The results of a comparative study of the regional consciousness of graduates of universities of the two countries are presented, similarities and differences of perceptions, perceptions, assessments, orientations and attitudes are revealed, which confirms the close relationship and closeness of the worldview of students in border regions of Russia and Kazakhstan.

TI  - VERBALIZATION OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC-RELATED CONCEPTS: NEOLOGISM POTENTIAL OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE
T2  - FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionTimes of crisis seem to stimulate the word formation potential of languages as shown in past research e.g. Trummerfrau, Kristallnacht, Anschluss, hamstern in World War II. The present study, based on language change during the Covid-19 pandemic, contributes to previous studies in this domain, whereby the behavior of mankind in times of crisis is proven to be universal over the centuries. The neologisms (completely new words, new meanings of already existing words) analysed in this paper, are terms for person/group reference reflecting a specific behaviour brought on during the COVID-19 crisis. Most of these neologisms, primarily consisting of a wider range of compounds, may pass the test of usage and be included permanently into the German lexicon. Other types of neologisms may only be used occasionally. Also, it might be worth mentioning that the inclusion of certain excerpts in the German lexicon has been verified by Duden online.The concept of 'behaviour' is based on the sociological understanding of 'behaviour', which is understood as a reaction of individuals towards internal and external changes. Thus, 'behaviour' should be interpreted in this concrete case as a reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. All excerpts analysed in the present study decipher and interpret outwardly manifested, specific behaviour of individuals or groups exhibited as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is interesting to note that, some of the examples enable the production of double meanings - more precisely, two interpretations of one and the same naming unit, e.g. Wellenbrecher (see below) are possible. We can freely say that the pandemic-related neologisms portray a truly German sociolinguistic 'potpourri'.The general potential of the German language to form neologisms and the specific "delight in joining words to create compounds"The German language is famous for its high potential of building new compounds, also designated as the "delight in joining words to create compounds" ("Kompositionsfreudigkeit", Schlucker 1), which enriches both the conventional word stock, as well as the occasional, i.e. lexical units found in novels, text words. The enrichment of the lexicon, according to Motsch, cannot be explained by the usual means, rather it would be necessary to take into consideration pragmatic and psycholinguistic aspects (21, 25). According to this author, the pragmatic aspects to be considered should be: the enlargement of the lexicon because of the necessity of new designations, syntactic change of the category and stylistic devices. Regarding the production and reception of analogy-based neologisms, however, the author states that these are significantly influenced by three factors: quantity, frequency and transparency of patterns of word formation (23). In the present study, all of the above aspects were taken into consideration during the analysis of the COVID-19 corpus.The corona-related potential of forming neologisms based on terms for person/group referenceAccording to the IDS, approximately 2000 corona-neologisms have been documented in the German lexicon during, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the following section, the corona-related terms for person/group reference will be classified in word formation types or patterns.center dot Corona-related neologisms, type Coronasunder(4)Denoting nomina agentis, neologisms of this type can optionally represent a completely new formation (Neubildung) or constitute just a new meaning of an already existing word (Neubedeutung).Completely new corona-related word formations are mainly activated on the basis of already existing nomina agentis mainly with the suffix -er (less common: -ler, -el) in the German lexicon, notably encouraged by their quantity, frequency and semantic transparency. Taking into account pragmatic principles (the principle of a reasonable word, the principle of interpretability of word formations and the principle of economy of word formations, Motsch 25ff.), they primarily rely on a lexicalized or occasional model that helps the user recognize the new formation, e.g. Coronasunder/Covidsunder ("corona-sinner") in analogy to the already existing Verkehrssunder (traffic offender), Impf(vor)drangler according to the lexicalized Drangler ( tailgater) denoting 'persons activating queue jumping skills to grab the vaccination before their turn'. Further examples are: Impfgegner, Mundschutzgegener etc. in analogy to famous existing Gegner-formations ( opponent), e.g. Demokratiegegner, EU-Gegner, Putin-Gegner. In the following neologisms, a completely new, corona-related meaning is constituted: Querdenker, Spazierganger/Coronaspazierganger/Montagsspazierganger. These formations can have double-meanings: a primarily neutral one and a secondary corona-related one, e.g. Querdenker: 1. 'maverick, contrarian, lateral thinker', 2. 'person that considers the corona measures too excessive/harsh, conspiracist, follower of the political movement 'lateral thinkers''. Special cases outline formations like Wellenbrecher that represent homonym units with two corona-related readings in addition to its original meaning breakwater: 1. 'person who helps to mitigate the corona pandemic', 2. 'package of measures that should avoid a second corona wave'. A double reference can also be found in Pandemietreiber, Pandemieverstarker: 1. 'a person that spreads the pandemic', 2. ' institutions (hotels, restaurants, bars, cafes) that represent breeding ground for the spread of the pandemic)'.center dot Corona-related neologisms, type SuperspreaderThis type of neologisms examines corona-related real and pseudo English borrowings/loanwords into German, e.g. Superspreader, Sexbuddy, Shoppingtourist. German calques of English formations Superubertrager, Superverbreiter, Superverteiler and German-English hybrid formations, e.g. Impfsupporter, Schnellshopper, Shutdowner.center dot Corona-related neologisms, type NullpatientExcerpts belonging to this type of formations have characteristically a numeral as a first constituent. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is of great importance to detect the first person that is infected with the virus. The Covid-IDS schedules Erstpatient and Nullpatient ("first patient") are synonyms denoting generally 'the first patient infected with a virus'. The same pattern is used in order to designate the person receiving the first or second vaccination using the corona-related formation Erstimpfling (only evidenced in DWDS, not in Covid-IDS, meaning 'a person who received the first vaccination'), followed by: Zweitimpfling/Zweitimpfler ('person who received the second vaccination' Covid-IDS). However, receiving the third vaccination, the so called booster, did not generate a neologism, i.e. *Drittimpfling ('person who has just been vaccinated for the third time').center dot Corona-related neologisms, type TandemfamilieThe lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to innovative social concepts that are transferred in neologisms like Tandemfamilie ("tandem family", 'an enlarged model of childcare in which participants of two or more households share obligations') and Tandemkind ("tandem child", 'a minor person getting support from a volunteer to aid in social integration and education'). Also, a corona specific neologism is Spazierpartner ('partner for walking") denoting 'a person that you meet periodically in order to take a short walk with'.center dot Corona-related neologisms, type Alltagsheld This particular type denotes terms for persons who were either heroically-valorized, or ironically-derogated during the pandemic. Namely, certain individuals and professional groups, e.g. doctors and nursing staff, exhibited remarkable professionalism and dedication during the corona pandemic. They were verbalized, depicted as heros of the pandemic: Alltagsheld ("everyday hero") referring to doctors and nursing stuff during the pandemic, Einkausheld, Einkaufshelfer ("shopping hero/helper") denoting an 'altruistic person that goes shopping for those that are in real need'. On the other hand, an ironic-derogatory connotation is intended by the corona-neologism Seuchensheriff ("sheriff of a plagues/pestilence"), referring to 'politicians that propagate overly strict restrictions during the pandemic and behave like controllers or sheriffs.center dot Corona-related neologisms, type KlopapierhamsterThe metaphoric way of referring to persons by using animal names is a well-known mechanism in word-formation (Simoska 2013b). The metaphoric imputation of a similarity relation between source and target concept (Schuster 6) is realized in new formations like Klopapierhamster ("hamster of toilet paper", denoting a 'person that hoards toilet paper during the pandemic') and Schlafschaf ("sleeping sheep", denoting a 'person that trusts blindly all the information in the media during the COVID- 19 crisis'). According to the hamster-metaphor, the natural behaviour of hamsters, hoarding food in their cheeks, is transferred to the specific behaviour of people in times of crisis, i.e. war, disease, to panic-buy products (e.g. toilet paper, referring in this case to the German people) because of the fear of material deprivation. The sheep-metaphor alludes from the position of the so called "lateral thinkers" (Querdenker) to the victim status - benevolence and blindness of those who trusted the official news coverage. Klopapierhamster and Schlafschaf actually represent swear terms in order to devalue and stultify the behaviour of people acting prototypically like animals during the corona pandemic.center dot Corona-related neologisms, NacktnaseThis type of corona-related neologisms represents the exocentric word formation pattern of German, denoting expressive person designations. It is a common pattern in word formation for pejorative terms referring to individuals having conspicuous features regarding their appearance, such as: scars/blemishes (Simoska 2013b: 190) as a result of which, according to the pars-pro-toto principle, they are metonymically reduced (Dickkopf, Langbein, Rothaut). Exocentric compounds consisting of an adjective (A) and a noun (N), as Simoska points out, notoriously do not refer to the reference class of the second constituent, but to a third entity (222f.). In most of the cases it is a body part (Nase/nose, Nacktnase) or a clothing (Hut/hat, Aluhut) of a person. The relation between the literal meaning of the A+N-compound (source concept) and the target concept is based on contiguity (Schuster 6). Formations like Nacktnase ("naked nose", 'a person that wears the mask only over their mouth'), denoting a body part as a second constituent, are built in analogy to already existing exocentric compounds that refer to persons, e.g. Langnase. Moreover, exocentric word formations like Aluhut (tin foil hat, synonym to Aluhutburger, built in analogy to Wutburger, Weltburger), whose second constituent refers to items of clothing (Rotkappchen/Little Red Riding Hood) are, however created differently. They can potentially belong to two reference classes allowing therefore two meanings: literal, e.g. 'a hat made out of tin foil', and an exocentric-metonymic one, e.g. 'a person that wears a tin foil hat in the belief that it shields the brain from threats, actually a person with an absurd worldview, a corona conspirator'.center dot Corona-related neologisms, type WirrologePartly due to the extremely controversial positions taken during the coverage of the profession, the designation virologist has been caricatured during the COVID-19 pandemic. Namely, by exploring the play on words ("Sprachspielereien" (Zifonun 1)) for the pejoratisation of personal designations, the Covid-IDS, lists the following three devaluing forms: Viroluge ("...Virolugen wie Drosten..." (Covid-IDS)), Virolugner and Wirrologe (< wirr 'durcheinader, verruckt'/'confused, woozy') that would be in English: "viro-lie", "viro-liar", "woozyologist". By the same token, Virenversteher ("virus understander") and Pandemie-Erklarer ("pandemic explainer"), coined as terms for virology and epidemiology experts can only be interpreted as ironic and sarcastic. A particularly ingenious word blending is represented by the expressive-pejorative neologism Covidiot, that is amalgamated from COVID+idiot, meaning 'a person that behaves like an idiot during the pandemic'. The IDS Dictionary of neologisms also lists the full form: Covididiot with the same interpretation: '(pejorative for) a person conducting themselves inappropriately during the COVID-19 pandemic' (Covid-IDS).ConclusionThe verbalized behavioural concepts of persons and groups as a reaction to the COVID-19 crisis reflect impressively and document the highly developed potential of blending new words and compounds in the German language. Although this kind of linguistic potential may be universal in all languages, specifically in German, the newly created neologisms denoted for individuals or groups, derive from selected types of patterns of word formation, such as: compounds with nomina agentis, exocentric compounds, borrowings/calques/hybrid formations, word plays and stylistic devices - metaphor, metonymy. The stylistic variants of the word formations reflect both the creativity, but also the critical stance taken by the people belonging to the German society. It may be safe to say that many of the examples analysed in this paper will probably become obsolete, perhaps only a few, such as Klopapierhamster, Alltagsheld will succeed in entering the German lexicon - just as the famous Trummerfrau in World War II that has been inscribed into the Eternal Mind of the Germans.

AB  - Plastics in the riverine environment are of major concern due to their potential pathways into the wildlife and more generally the ocean. Dams are capable of trapping marine plastics within the riverine environment. This entrapment changes the surface roughness of the area with the marine debris. Radar satellites are sensitive to surface roughness and can therefore detect these changes. This research investigates areas in Serbia and Boznia & Herzegovina using ESA Sentinel-1 polarimetric SAR data. This study shows the feasibility of detecting large accumulations of plastic near dams, with detectors capable of achieving 75-85% positive detection ratings with a 0.1% false alarm rate. Additionally, we find the use of single VV polarization is inadequate for this task and PolSAR data are needed.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on High-Power Diode Laser Technology XX at SPIE LASE Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - High-power broad-area InGaAs-AlGaAs strained quantum well (QW) lasers are indispensable components for space satellite communications systems. However, their degradation mode (catastrophic and sudden degradation) due to catastrophic optical damage is a major concern for space applications. Furthermore, these lasers predominantly degrade by a new failure mode due to catastrophic optical bulk damage (COBD). Also, InAs-GaAs quantum dot (QD) lasers have recently received much attention as an alternative to QW lasers especially for space applications, but their degradation mechanism is not well understood. For the present study, we investigated high-power broad-area lasers with two different active regions: 9xx nm strained InGaAs-AlGaAs QW and similar to 1 mu m InAs-GaAs QD active regions. Both lasers had a window formed in backside n-metals. We performed accelerated life-tests, failure mode analyses, and physics of failure investigations using destructive and non-destructive techniques. First, we employed electroluminescence (EL) and time-resolved electroluminescence (TR-EL) techniques to study precursor signatures of failures including the formation of a hot spot through self-focusing of filaments and thermal lensing as well as the formation and propagation of dark line defects (DLDs) in degraded lasers during aging. Second, we employed high-resolution TEM techniques to study extended defects. Finally, we report our understanding on degradation processes in high-power broad-area QW and QD lasers.

TI  - Vegetation Index and Mangrove Forest Utilization through Ecotourism Development in Dodola and Guraping of North Maluku Province
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the vegetation index and mangrove forest utilization through ecotourism development in Guraping and Dodola Island of North Maluku Province. This research uses a remote sensing approach through Landsat 8 Operational Land Imagery (OLI) from 2013 and 2021, calculated based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) algorithms. This study indicates that ecotourism development can preserve the mangrove forest and generate economic and social benefits for the local community. Otherwise, the vegetation index in mangrove areas from 2013 to 2021 needs to be considered seriously as the primary data to optimize the management of tourism destinations. In the case of Dodola Island, the increased number of vegetation in 2017 experienced significant changes and threatened the sustainability of mangrove ecotourism. Thus, the mangrove monitoring needs to be optimized to anticipate the unsustainability of mangroves, which determines the sustainability of tourism in North Maluku Province. This study offers an idea to involve the local community in conserving the mangrove area through a controlled and sustainable rehabilitation program instead of economic activity purposes. The findings indicate that the existing condition of the Guraping mangrove forest in 2021 is classified as moderate compared with mangrove ecotourism in Dodola Island with sparse criteria based on the Decree of the Minister of State for the Environment in 2004. This research suggests adopting the community-based ecotourism mangrove development through collaborative advantages of all tourism stakeholders.

AB  - Availability of limited training remote sensing datasets is one of the problems in deep learning, as deep architectures require a large number of training samples for proper training. In this paper, we present a technique for data augmentation based on a spectral indexed generative adversarial network to train deep convolutional neural networks. This technique uses the spectral characteristic of multispectral (MS) images to support data augmentation in order to generate realistic training samples with respect to each land-use and land-cover class. The impact of multispectral remote sensing data generated through the spectral indexed GAN are evaluated through classification experiments. Experimental results obtained on the classification of the Sentinel-2 Eurosatallband datasets show that data augmentation through spectral indexed GAN enhances the main accuracy metrics.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art methods in the domain of classification of remote sensing (RS) data. However, traditional CNN models suffer from huge computational costs in learning land-use and land-cover features, particularly in large-scale RS problems. To address this issue, we propose a reliable mono- and dual-regulated contractive-expansive-contractive (MRCEC/DRCEC) CNN for scene based multispectral (MS) image classification. The proposed technique increases the accuracy of learning and minimizes the loss in the feature maps by incorporating the CEC approach in the classification. Extensive experiments conducted on the Sentinel-2 EuroSATallbands dataset pointed out that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models such as EfficientNet-B0, RESNet-50, and EfficientNet-B7.

TI  - Analysing the Changes in Water Quality of River Ganga Passing Through Urban Cities with Remote Sensing and GIS Support
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - River Ganga in India has tremendous self-purification capacity due to its dynamic, turbulent and meandering characteristics. In addition due to the presence of anti-bacterial agents such as Bacteriophages virus killing bacteria and its medicinal properties, the refinement capacity increases. In the present work, water quality samples of river Ganga at Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Patna and Bhagalpur were collected and analysed for the years 2017-2019 to assess the change in water quality of the river Ganga in terms of total suspended solids (TSS) and turbidity through remote sensing data and ground observations. The change in spectral reflectance of water along the river in the visible region has been analysed using the Landsat-8 multispectral remote sensing data and water quality samples have been collected from all the sites on the date of pass of Landsat-8 satellite. The results obtained shows that the satellite based remote sensing approach can be effectively used to make qualitative and quantitative estimates of total suspended solids and turbidity using nonlinear equations with high accuracy, even in the absence of field observations.

TI  - A Simple Data Preprocessing and Postprocessing Techniques for SVM Classifier of Remote Sensing Multispectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Present scenario of the remote sensing domain deals with how to utilize the data for different purposes like classification, target detection, disaster management, change detection, flood monitoring, deforestation, etc. Now due to improvements in the sensor technology very high spatial and spectral resolutions data are available. Over a decade, various new advanced research papers have been projected in the literature for spatial and spectral classification of such high-resolution remote sensing images. Thematic information investigation of the earth's surface image is possible by the classification technique and the most frequently used method for this purpose is multispectral classification using a supervised learning process. In the supervised learning process, the specialist challenges to discover exact sites in the remotely sensed data that represent homogeneous examples of the known land cover type. The most recommended method for the classification of remote sensing (RS) images is the support vector machine (SVM) because of its high accuracy but any classifier depends on good quality training samples. The collection of authentic training samples of different classes is a critical issue when the whole classification result is important. This article presents a preprocessing technique based on local statistics for generation-correction of training samples with quadrant division. A simple filter-based postprocessing technique is proposed for the improvement of classification accuracy. We study rigorously how the proposed preprocessing technique has affected the result of classification accuracy for different kernels SVM classifiers. Also, we have presented the comparison results between the proposed method and other different classifiers in the literature.

AB  - This paper focuses on remote sensing of Radar Polarimetry to determine the snow geophysical parameters particularly snow dielectric constant and snow density in the North Sikkim region of India. The analysis utilizes the dual-polarimetric C-band of Sentinel-1A (VH&VV) synthetic aperture radar data, field observation, and other ancillary information for the retrieval of snowpack dielectric and snow density. Physical Optics Model (POM) for surface scattering-based inversion model has been employed and the C2 matrix components of both VH and VV polarization and incidence angle are given as input to develop the algorithm. The algorithm gives the snow dielectric constant which can further be related to snow density using Looyenga's semi-empirical formula. The field value of snow density in the study zone has been compared to the algorithm-estimated snow density and the root means the squared error is observed to be 0.1973.

AB  - Himalayas play a significant role in terms of climate influence, the origin of rivers, hydropower generation, tourism, and forest wealth. The monitoring of the rugged terrain Himalayas via remote sensing is one of the efficient solutions to meet future requirements. In remote sensing, the sensors can be categorized as optical and microwave. The optical-based sensor provides multispectral or hyperspectral information at a very fine spatial resolution but is limited to daytime images without any penetration through the clouds. Whereas, the microwave works more effectively due to day/night image acquisition and cloud penetration capabilities. Therefore, the image fusion of multi-sensors (optical and microwave) datasets is important to extract crucial information about the Earth surface, especially over the Himalayas. However, the main aim of the article is to retrieve the different landcover types using various classifiers i.e., Linear Spectral Mixing (LSM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the fused dataset. The dataset has been acquired over a part of Indian Himalayan terrain i.e., Uttarakhand State, India using microwave-based ISRO' s Scatterometer Satellite (SCATSAT-1) and optical-based NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The results show the effectiveness of the RFC classifier in the mapping of land surface features as compared to other classification algorithms i.e., LSM and SVM. This study not only highlights the potential of the RFC classifier in the extraction of information but also, shows the significance of fusion of optical and microwave datasets in the extraction of important Earth surface features.

TI  - GEOSPATIAL APPROACH FOR URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Growing population and change in gentrification patterns of urban areas affect the environment quality, especially in the developing nations. Most cities are thereby, facing serious environmental sustainability challenges. A resilient urban planning is required to solve these environmental problems, which in turn need information that is not available in the desired scales, hence, making it difficult to comprehend. In this study, an approach is proposed to comprehend the environmental quality of a city at community level. Landsat 8 images are used to compute the biophysical indicators, namely, land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI) in ArcGIS software. These indicators are then integrated with the indicators from the government census data to compute the community level index for urban environmental quality (UEQI). The results depicted that the highest value of our developed index occurred in the places where there is more of greenery and less built-up area. Based on the obtained UEQI values, different areas of the city are divided into five categories. The index values suggest that urban greening significantly contribute to enhance the urban environmental quality. Also, it highlights the critical zones where intervention should be made by the planners and policymakers for the sustainability of the city.

TI  - Impact of Forest Fires on Air Quality in Wolgan Valley, New South Wales, Australia-A Mapping and Monitoring Study Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are an important natural resource and are instrumental in sustaining environmental sustainability. Burning biomass in forests results in greenhouse gas emissions, many of which are long-lived. Precise and consistent broad-scale monitoring of fire intensity is a valuable tool for analyzing climate and ecological changes related to fire. Remote sensing and geographic information systems provide an opportunity to improve current practice's accuracy and performance. Spectral indices techniques such as normalized burn ratio (NBR) have been used to identify burned areas utilizing satellite data, which aid in distinguishing burnt areas using their standard spectral responses. For this research, we created a split-panel web-based Google Earth Engine app for the geo-visualization of the region severely affected by forest fire using Sentinel 2 weekly composites. Then, we classified the burn severity in areas affected by forest fires in Wolgan Valley, New South Wales, Australia, and the surrounding area through Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). The result revealed that the region's burnt area increased to 6731 sq. km in December. We also assessed the impact of long-term rainfall and land surface temperature (LST) trends over the study region to justify such incidents. We further estimated the effect of such incidents on air quality by analyzing the changes in the column number density of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. The result showed a significant increase of about 272% for Carbon monoxide and 45% for nitrogen oxides. We conclude that, despite fieldwork constraints, the usage of different NBR and web-based application platforms may be highly useful for forest management to consider the propagation of fire regimes.

TI  - Image Fusion of Ku-Band-Based SCATSAT-1 and MODIS Data for Cloud-Free Change Detection Over Western Himalayas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image-based fusion is a state-of-the-art process to extract vital information by combining the two or more images acquired from different satellite sensors. Recently launched (September 26, 2016) Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO) Ku-band (13.5 GHz)-based Scatterometer Satellite (SCATSAT-1) as an active microwave sensor can offer the day-night, all-weather monitoring services, which are not possible with the optical-based visible and infrared remote sensing satellites. Therefore, the fusion of optical and microwave data offers the cloud-free detection of Earth surface transitions and helps in emergency response to natural hazards, security, and defense. The objectives of the proposed framework are: 1) nearest neighbor-based fusion (NNF) of ISRO's SCATSAT-1 and National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical data; 2) generation of thematic maps using artificial neural network (ANN)-based classification of the fused data; 3) detection of spatiotemporal variations via postclassification comparison (PCC)-based change detection; 4) cross-referencing with well-defined fusion methods, i.e., Gram-Schmidt (GS), Brovey transformation (BT), and Ehlers; and 5) impact analysis of clouds on the input dataset and fusion methods. This study has been conducted over the Western Himalayas to estimate the snow cover changes under cloudy conditions with two datasets, i.e., winter and monsoon. The experimental outcomes confirm the efficacy of the proposed framework in the effective removal of clouds, generation of classified maps, and change maps. The present study includes an exhaustive list of applicative situations for cloud-free monitoring using freely and daily-based SCATSAT-1 and MODIS datasets.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Metastasis of the lymph node is one of the most significant prognostic factors for breast cancer (BC). Aim: To predict positivity of the lymph node in BC patients with help of USG and USG-guided FNAC and thus to prevent unnecessary morbidity. Methods: 50 patients of incisional/true cut biopsy-proven BC patients were included. All were subjected to mammography, USG and FNAC of the lump breast. USG-guided FNAC of the axillary lymph node was done in 25 of these patients. These findings were assessed by histological examination following dissection of the axillary lymph node. Results: Axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis was present in 42 patients on histopathology; 21 patients suspicious of malignancy on preoperative USG were confirmed by HPE. Out of 88 confirmed lymph nodes evaluated on ultrasonography, 4 were benign, 18 were indeterminate and 66 were suspicious. The most promising features were tumour length/depth ratio of <1.5 in 81. absent fatty hilum in 73% and hypoechoic cortex in 74%. Assessment of axilla with USG had a sensitivity of 50%, a specificity of 100%, a PPV of 100%, an NPV of 27.59% and a diagnostic accuracy of 58%. Preoperative USG-guided FNAC had a sensitivity of 91.67%, a specificity of 100%, a PPV of 100%, an NPV of 33.33% and a diagnostic accuracy of 92%. Conclusion: USG can detect non-palpable axillary lymph nodes and FNAC can increase the sensitivity and specificity of this technique, which makes this procedure very promising in detecting axillary metastases in BC patients.

AB  - The intensity and frequency with which recent drought events are occurring has made management of food and water a challenge. The situation in Indian subcontinent is no difference. The presented study takes inspiration from such problems to propose a remote sensing based multivariate advance drought response index (ADRI). The proposed multivariate index takes into consideration long term conditions of precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), brightness temperature and soil moisture in a linear way for 8-day drought assessment over drought affected Marathwada region, Maharashtra, India. A value of 33 corresponding to ADRI was found to be normal condition over two decades which corresponds to normal vegetation condition index (VCI) value of 51.1 and 54.2. The last 7 years shows a consistent pattern in the change of regional ADRI values which suggests the years in which agricultural assistance is needed over the region. Drought over the region is found to shift from central to eastern and northern regions in the last 5 years. Temporal analysis for the duration suggests up to 5 percent of the area of Marathwada has been facing severe drought conditions over the last decade while up to 70 percent of the area is experience below normal conditions with varying intensities of water stress. The districts of Latur, Parbhani, Hingoli and Nanded which are downstream river Godavari have been affected the most due to large percentage of land being under agriculture.

AB  - A yield prediction map is an important element in precision agriculture study for site-specific management. In this situation, NDVI based crop vegetation parameter described a better relationship with crop yield prediction. NDVI values were acquired from optical Sentinel 2B images during a specific phenological time in 2019 and 2020. Fifty agricultural plots are occupied in an area of 300ha for both rice (Kharif) and potato (Rabi) crops, in Tarakeswar Block, Hooghly district, West Bengal, India. The ordinary kriging technique was used to produce NDVI prediction maps using Arc GIS 10.7 software. For validation of NDVI and conforming crop yield, both the crops were verified through geostatistical techniques with the lowest RMSE values. The positive coefficient of correlation between NDVI and crop yield was found as r(2)=0.406 for NDVI_rice and r(2)=0.692 for NDVI_potato, respectively. Further, at semivariograms analysis the lowest nugget-to-sill ratio found 2.51% for rice yield and 1.52% for potato yield, respectively, described the strong spatial autocorrelation. In the other hand, the highest nugget-to-sill ratio found 11.41% for NDVI_rice and 25.52% for NDVI_potato, respectively, representing moderate to strong spatial dependence. The outcome of this research proposed that NDVI is a good predictor of crop yield withinfield management zones for sustainable agricultural planning.

T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article reflects the actual problem of modern literary criticism: the study of the anti-fairy tale as a carnivalized genre of seriously funny literature on the example of the analysis of the works "Ivan da Maria" by Vysotsky and "Fairy Tales with an Untold Ending" by Rozhdestvensky. It is revealed that the cycle of fairy tale songs from the movie "Ivan da Marya" is a continuation of the tradition of carnival folklore with its specific carnivalized worldview associated with the syncretism of poetic genera, music and dance. A number of songs are considered as a nativity scene in verse, revealing the main content of the anti-tale. The characters of the work bring a festive atmosphere of freedom and fun, a carnival vision of the underworld takes place, a folklore theater with mummery and puppet interludes unfolds. Vernacular metaphors, folk prejudices, sayings bring joy to the style of the anti-fairy tale "Ivan da Marya", where laughter becomes the main "hero" of the work. The study claims that the karanavalized genre of anti-fairy tales has absorbed the poetics of folklore genres - lubok, raek, satirical scenes with puppet acting, etc. "A Fairy Tale with an Untold Ending" by Rozhdestvensky continues the traditions of the folk genre of lub.k with its speech design of the plot in funny pictures. The raeshny verse of the Christmas anti-tale is formed on the basis of folk genres characterized by cheerful relativity: tall tales, horror stories. The article makes sense that the "Fairy Tale with an Untold Ending" is full of comic situations that help to "fix" the anti-records of an athlete, the "anti-patriotism" of a musician, to ridicule the "anti-mind" of a retired general.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a model-based approach to information extraction and despeckling is presented using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. An autobinomial model (ABM) is used as a prior and Nakagami model for a likelihood probability density function (pdf). ABM parameter estimation using the evidence maximization makes this method very computationally demanding and unuseful for practical applications. This letter proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for parameter estimation of ABM. A nine-layer CNN was used, consisting of convolutional, pooling, dropout, fully connected, and regression layers. The MAP estimation and CNN interactions were fused to obtain the best texture parameters with the highest evidence. Experimental results showed that the ABM using evidence maximization is 55 times slower than the ABM with CNN. Texture parameters are estimated better with the proposed technique because the estimated evidence obtained with the proposed method is much higher compared with the previous method. The improved parameter estimates subsequently used for MAP despeckling purposes provided favorable results.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peat fires differ from other wildfires in their duration, carbon losses, emissions of greenhouse gases and highly hazardous products of combustion and other environmental impacts. Moreover, it is difficult to identify peat fires using ground-based methods and to distinguish peat fires from forest fires and other wildfires by remote sensing. Using the example of catastrophic fires in July-August 2010 in the Moscow region (the center of European Russia), in the present study, we consider the results of peat-fire detection using Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) hotspots, peat maps, and analysis of land cover pre- and post-fire according to Landsat-5 TM data. A comparison of specific (for detecting fires) and non-specific vegetation indices showed the difference index Delta NDMI (pre- and post-fire normalized difference moisture Index) to be the most effective for detecting burns in peatlands according to Landsat-5 TM data. In combination with classification (both unsupervised and supervised), this index offered 95% accuracy (by ground verification) in identifying burnt areas in peatlands. At the same time, most peatland fires were not detected by Terra/Aqua MODIS data. A comparison of peatland and other wildfires showed the clearest differences between them in terms of duration and the maximum value of the fire radiation power index. The present results may help in identifying peat (underground) fires and their burnt areas, as well as accounting for carbon losses and greenhouse gas emissions.

He supported slavery, denounced abolitionists,advocated the re-opening of the African slave trade, was explicitly racist in his reasoning. Hechampioned the South in the American Civil War. Mitchel himself seems not to have seen anycontradiction in defending freedom for the Irish nation and standing for slavery in America.Nowadays supporters of the "Black Lives Matter" movement view Mitchel, first of all, as a humanrights violator

TI  - EVOLUTION OF STYLISTIC NORMS IN XX CENTURY LITERARY AND ART DISCOURSE
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased attention to evolutionary changes in literary language results from active attempts to fit the national language and culture into the world's cultural diversity. Ukrainian literary language is not only a synchronic and diachronic type of system, which demonstrates the constant development of art, intellect, and mentality, but in a broader sense, it is the basis for the formation of national consciousness. This article aims to establish the conceptual and temporal evolution of stylistic norms in the writings of Ukrainian authors of the XX century. The research methodology is based on an integrated approach: the comparative method and literary works analysis - to analyze the literary works by Ukrainian authors of the XX century; to determine the parameters and dynamics of changes in the stylistic artistic norm. The hypothesis is that the language norm is a cognitive reference point in the formation and functioning of the stylistic norm. According to the study results, it has been established that the dynamism of the stylistic artistic norm is caused by the ability of the literature as an art form to respond promptly to the development of speech consciousness and artistic concepts, author's thinking, and reader's visions. The dynamism of the stylistic artistic norm is rooted in the ability of the poetic word to constantly evolve in parallel with the evolution of authors' and readers' consciousness. In the future, we should investigate evolutionary changes in the stylistic system of the Ukrainian literary language, dictated by worldview and artistic shifts in the linguistic consciousness and philosophy of the artistic method of authors and their audiences.

TI  - Change Detection for Monostatic Pursuit SAR GMTI-Theories and Experimental Results
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monostatic pursuit refers to the operating mode formed by two monostatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems that follow an identical orbit with a separation in a time of several seconds. The detected changes between SAR scenes with several seconds of time difference are most likely the changes caused by ground moving targets. Hence, this operating mode opens an opportunity to detect ground moving targets by SAR change detection methods. This article investigates this possibility to detect ground moving targets using change detection and to combine change detection and ground moving target indication (GMTI) for GMTI. In this combination, a GMTI method will help to classify the detected changes obtained with a change detection method. Some GMTI results are provided in the article based on the measurements in the monostatic pursuit mode with deployed targets, conducted by TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X in Sweden in early 2015.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 12th IEEE International Scientific Technical Conference on Dependable Systems, Services and Technologies (DESSERT) - Dependable and Trustworthy AI, IoE, Big Data Analytics for a Safe and Secure World
CL  - Athens, GREECE
AB  - The past several decades has seen considerable land cover and land use change ( LCLUC) in Ukraine. These changes are a result from unprecedented environmental and climate disturbances as well as highly sensitive political and economic disruption, most recently the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The impacts of these disturbances must be properly monitored and documented so that land resources can be managed effectively and sustainably. Here, we report our ongoing activities to identify, map, and characterize LCLUC occurred in Ukraine within the past 20 years. Using satellite data, we demonstrate highly characteristic human-environment relationships to identify LCLUC hotspots of regional, national, and global importance. Furthermore, we examine occupation of territories that include protected areas (Emerald network) and demonstrate impacts of policy abandonment leading to degradation of 25% of forest cover, a reversal of 20 years of sustainable development progress in the region. Lastly, we illustrate impacts of the ongoing war to sunflower production, a resource for which Ukraine is a top world producer and exporter.

TI  - Japanese Philosophers Nishi Amane and Nishida Kitaro: between East and West
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article suggests a brief analysis of the views of the two Japanese Thinkers Nishi Amane and Nishida Kitaro. The considerable impact of Western philosophical theories on these two scientists' views is also emphasized here. The outstanding Nishi Amane's role in the field of creating new concepts in use even today conveying the meanings of Western Culture in Japan had been stressed. Doing so, Nishi used Chinese characters - and it was his true novelty. Actually Nishi's system was aimed at the modernization of Neo-Confucian metaphysics by drawing on the experience of Western Positivism and, partly, Utilitarism. Nishida Kitaro appeared to be the most famous Japanese philosopher in the West. His works show the tendency to combine the basic installations of the national (Buddhist-Confucianism) worldview tradition and some European philosophical traits. The both thinkers demonstrated the two-vector nature of Japanese aesthetics in intercultural discourse. They constantly used to attract the ideas of Western thinkers, subjecting them to creative reinterpretation in the process of contructing their own philosophical theories.

TI  - Satellite Tracking Data Reveals High-Use Areas for Immature Bald Eagles from Kentucky
T2  - AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Immature raptors often travel long distances and move nomadically from the time they leave their natal area to the time they are recruited into the breeding population. Emphasis on identifying the nesting and winter habitat of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) has overshadowed the need to understand the habitat and spatial use of young eagles prior to reaching maturity. We used satellite telemetry to track the movements of immature Bald Eagles hatched in western Kentucky during 2010-2016. We analyzed movement data to identify high-use areas for eagles in their first and second years during warm and cool periods. Five out of seven eagles migrated north to the Great Lakes region during their first year. Using Brownian Bridge Movement Modelling, we identified 47 noncontiguous high-use areas during the warm period and 67 during the cool period. Public lands comprised 17% of warm period high-use areas and 43% of cool period high-use areas. High-use areas were located in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas and Tennessee, and were often near federally-owned dams, rivers with sandbars, or areas with abundant waterfowl. Our small sample of tracked eagles correctly identified known Bald Eagle concentration areas within the study area; thus, we infer that previously unrecognized high-use areas identified by this study are likely to be concentration areas important to the larger population. We further suggest remote sensing data, even in limited datasets, as an efficient way to identify Bald Eagle concentration areas.

TI  - THE CONCEPTUAL WORLDVIEW IN THE WORKS OF UKRAINIAN WRITERS: RENAISSANCE CREATIVITY
T2  - FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the peculiar features of the conceptual worldview of Ukrainian writers active during the Renaissance (in the late 15(th)-16(th) centuries). Its ultimate goal resides in analyzing the most common interpretations of the concepts of history, state, freedom, ruler, and war by authors working on the territory of Ukraine during the Renaissance period and defining the conceptual ideas represented by these concepts. The relevance of this research is explained by the fact that the Renaissance authors appeal to concepts that are significant for any epoch. The specifics of the interpretation of history and its representation in the artistic perceptions of the authors of this period are based on an authentic tradition, the trends of the European Renaissance, and the revival of ancient heritage. In general, the study is grounded in the semantic-cognitive analysis of the works of Renaissance representatives working in what was then the territory of Ukraine ( Adam Chagrovsky, Mikolaj Hussowski, Martin Pashkovsky, Sebastian Klonowic, Szymon Pekala, Maciej Stryjkowski, and Stanislaw Orikhovsky). The conceptual fields of each concept selected for analysis were developed in accordance with the individuality of the notions by which Renaissance authors described them. In sum, this paper argues that the worldview of Ukrainian Renaissance writers is characterized by the awareness of the sociopolitical and cultural-literary need to write about history and its role, and to place in the context of world processes. No less critical here is their understanding of the mission of personality in history and the analysis of the activities of historical figures and the reality of that time. Thus, the work of Renaissance authors is predominantly characterized by an expressive anthropocentric, humanistic, and patriotic direction. The practical significance of this research lies in the possibility of applying the semantic-cognitive approach to the analysis of leading concepts in Renaissance creativity.

TI  - Wide-Area Analysis-Ready Radar Backscatter Composites
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The benefits of composite products are well known to users of data from optical sensors: cloud-cleared composite reflectance or index products are commonly used as an analysis-ready data (ARD) layer. No analogous composite products are currently in widespread use that is based on spaceborne radar satellite backscatter signals. Here, we present a methodology to produce wide-area ARD composite backscatter images. They build on the existing heritage of geometrically and radiometrically terrain corrected level 1 products. By combining backscatter measurements of a single region seen from multiple satellite tracks (incl. ascending and descending), they are able to provide wide-area coverage with low latency. The analysis-ready composite backscatter maps provide flattened backscatter estimates that are geometrically and radiometrically corrected for slope effects. A mask layer annotating the local quality of the composite resolution is introduced. Multiple tracks are combined by weighting each observation by its local resolution, generating seamless wide-area backscatter maps suitable for applications ranging from wet snow monitoring to land cover classification or short-term change detection.

TI  - Consciousness, Culture and Civilization 'Stem Cell' (in Commemoration of V.A. Lektorsky's 90th Anniversary)
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - It is culture and society that make it possible for human consciousness to emerge and develop, yet it is human consciousness that gives an impulse to culture and society and sets their guidelines. This inevitable self-reference makes it impossible to define straight cause-and-effect dependence between consciousness, culture and society. Traditionally, the dialectics of individual and collective consciousness was supposed to solve the puzzle. In its stead, it is proposed to understand all the three as the unfolding of the same 'stem cell', i.e., the 'what-and-such' svyaznost' (connectivity and linkage) that displays itself at every level of consciousness: perception, speech and thought. The 'what-and-such' svyaznost' cannot be further reduced, because the 'what' looses its 'whatness' without its 'such', and its 'such' dissolves when not linked to its 'what', and at the same time the 'what' and 'such' stay always distinct and unmerged. The technology of setting the 'what-and-such' linkage varies, accounting for the basic variability of human reason. There is a pressing need to scrutinize the archive of non-European big cultures in order to disclose new, hitherto unknown types of reason. This task had been carried out to a large extent in regard to the substance reason (European big culture) and process reason (Arab-Muslim big culture), where fundamental specificity of worldview, language usage and society are set by the specific type of rationality. The perspective of studying the South-Asian and Far-Eastern types of reason is outlined. The detailed definition of the 'what-and-such' as the principle of consciousness, culture and society is proposed.

TI  - Foundations, problems and perspectivesof the modern conceptions of semantic correctness
T2  - FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The notion of semantic correctness (meaningfulness, or sensefulness) of propositions iswidespread in logico-philosophical and linguistic works, as well as in experimental cog-nitive science. Nevertheless, its content is not clear. Many discussions connected to itsuse serve as evidence for its obscurity. In this investigation, I articulate and solve someinterrelated problems which should be analyzed to make this notion more intelligible.Firstly, I pose a question whether semantic correctness is a normative or a descriptivecharacteristic. In other words: does it refer to a certain ideal of language usage ascribed tothe abstract rational agent but not necessarily observed or even recognized by real agents(the normative option), or to some attitude of real language users towards linguistic ex-pressions (the descriptive option)? I show that the notion of semantic correctnessemerged in theoretical contexts as normative due to its role within certain conceptions ofscientific rationality. However, one can say that it also contains a descriptive aspect, but itis needed to state distinctively what this aspect is. Particularly, there is a question: can thecompatibility of ontological categories in the worldview of a language user (call it onto-logical correctness) be taken as a criterion of semantic correctness for natural languages'I show that this is inadmissible: ontological categorial mistakes should not be seen as se-mantic deviations because in this case it would be impossible to delimit senseless sen-tences from contradictive and simply false sentences in natural languages. Finally, I pro-pose a novel view of the content of the meaningful/senseless dichotomy. It occupies-aspecial place among semantic distinctions being related to structural laws of knowledgeincrementation and discourse deployment. From this perspective, I outline an integral ap-proach to the conditions of meaningfulness/senselessness of propositions consideringanumber of factors. In particular, I analyze the conditions of senselessness for contradic-tions and tautologies.

TI  - Imperial Frontier in the World Outlook of the Decembrists. A. A. Bestuzhev-Marlinsky: a Romantic Historiosophy and Expansion into the Caucasus
T2  - ZHURNAL FRONTIRNYKH ISSLEDOVANII-JOURNAL OF FRONTIER STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The historiography of Russian expansion into the Caucasus is very extensive and continues to be replenished with new research, since this topic will hardly ever be exhausted and interest in it is unlikely to dwindle. The same can be said about the Decembrist uprising and the subsequent fate of those rebels who were sent into exile to various parts of the Russian Empire. The frontier theory makes it possible to link these two topics both by taking a fresh look at some of the most well-known subjects in Russian history and opening up new lines of research in traditional frontier studies. The purpose of this study was to conduct a historical and philosophical analysis of the literary heritage of the Decembrist A. A. Bestuzhev-Marlinsky in order to reconstruct his worldview through the lense of frontierism. A. A. Bestuzhev-Marlinsky's literary pieces, philosophical theses, military notes and personal letters were analyzed in connection with his existential experience of the Caucasian War and historical events to which he bore witness. Conclusions are drawn, regarding various aspects of his worldviews, some of which remained unshakable, whereas others were transformed under the influence of the frontier. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this article may be of interest to the historians who study both Russian development of the Caucasus and Russian social thought of the 19th century.

AB  - Next generation LEO/GEO atmospheric sounding instruments should be capable of providing near-continuous high spatial resolution atmospheric temperature and humidity soundings on both global and regional scales. Global measurements are important for producing extended range forecasts of synoptic scale weather patterns and providing the boundary conditions for regional mesoscale models designed to provide warnings of localized intense storms. Experimental forecast system results indicate that the temperature and moisture measurements should be with high-spatial (2 to 8-km) and temporal (30 to 120 min) resolution to resolve the thermodynamic (i.e., atmospheric stability) and dynamic (i.e., horizontal, and vertical motions) processes responsible for global environmental conditions and localized severe weather. This paper provides a synopsis of expected improvements in global Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) weather forecasts initialized using vertical atmospheric profiles retrieved from a combination of currently operational polar and geostationary satellite data, which simulate the sounding capabilities of next generation satellite sounding systems.

TI  - REALISTIC WRITING AND SOCIALIST-REALISTIC CANON: ARTISTIC EXPERIENCE OF VERA PANOVA
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The creative activity of V. Panova of the first post-war years, which are traditionally considered as the period of late socialist realism, became the material of analysis in this article. Focusing on the novel "Kruzhilikha", thematically corresponding to the most orthodox genre of socialist realism - occupational novel - allows showing how the confrontation between canon and individual writing style unfolds within one text. In general, the whole novel is permeated by the idea of collective strength, the unity of labor impulse, and the atmosphere of normality and rightness - the feat is accomplished by good people. But in the novel - and it is already a peculiarity of Panova's worldview and style of writing - we feel the pursuit of "the truth of the fact", the truth of the essential, but not of the appropriate. Hence comes the description of total insecurity of Soviet Union's day-to-day life and discomfort of the hard work. The communal life, incredible congestion, lack of privacy and feeling tired of "living before other persons' eyes" are depicted in detail. In an occupational novel, the author is interested not only in the events of industrial activity, but also in the soul of the individual, who is actually living under extreme circumstances, but taking them as a norm. The author of the article concludes that the generation of those, whom it is customary to call (with a contradictory connotation) "Soviet classics", actively participated in creating the culture of the sixties. The creative activity and the literary work of Panova are in line with the epoch of "The Thaw" with its idea of "socialism with a human face" and categorical denial of moralization and didacticism of the authoritarian style

TI  - Greek Content in the Work of Hryhorii Skovoroda: Intertextual Dimensions or Artistic Bilingualism of the Author?
T2  - KYIV-MOHYLA HUMANITIES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to raise a question on reasons for the availability of Greek content in the work of the great Ukrainian thinker Hryhorii Skovoroda and on the functions of bi-/ multilingualism of his texts. The relevance of the study is based on the contradiction between the objective need to reveal the phenomenon of artistic bilingualism and the features of his polycode text caused by verbal and cogitative activity of his creative bilingual personality. The author of the article concludes that the emergence of texts of bi-/polylingual personalities is preceded by a change in their worldview and the formation of a new culture and language space. Thus, the implementation of the linguistic and worldview approaches of Hryhorii Skovoroda is based on the old Ukrainian literary and written tradition of the late 16th-18th centuries, guarded within the walls of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Exploring the artistic models of the writer's world, the researcher focuses on the defi nition of intertextual connections, in particular on the fact of intertextuality. In the article the phenomenon of bilingualism is discussed contextually and correlates with the problem of intercultural contacts and influences.

TI  - napari/napari: 0.4.13
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - napari 0.4.13 We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.4.13! napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy). This is a major release with many new features, so don't hesitate to raise any issues at https://github.com/napari/napari/issues! Thank you to the 27 authors and 30 reviewers who contributed to this release! This release contains a new "spherical shading" mode for points (#3430), which allows napari to be used for molecular visualizations, among other use cases. This is currently only available via the API using the keyword argument shading='spherical'. 3D interactivity is further improved with a new 3D click-and-drag API (#3205) and box selection of points in 3D (#3840). This is the first release supporting npe2, the second iteration of napari plugin engine, which will soon enable more powerful actions from plugins. New plugin authors should start using npe2, while existing authors can migrate their plugins using our migration guide.

TI  - CATCHMENT-LEVEL ESTIMATION OF SNOW DEPTH USING SENTINEL-1 AND GROUND SENSOR VALIDATION IN THE UPPER INDUS BASIN

AB  - Previous studies on the cryosphere of the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) have mostly focused on glaciology and have either used remote sensing tools or sparsely deployed ground station networks at the regional or basin scales. This work is instead focused on catchment-level seasonal snowpack monitoring in the little-studied foothills of UIB, using a combination of remote sensing and in-situ measurements. To estimate the snow depth at the catchment level, we have processed Sentinel-1A (C-Band) data and validated our estimates by an indigenously developed ground-based monitoring station. We used differential interferometry for the inversion of spatial snow depth from November 2018 to May 2019. The results indicate a spatial maximum of 350 cm snow depth within the catchment, and a temporal maximum of 216 cm at the validation point. The relative error (RE) with respect to the ground station was estimated to be 90% and an RSME of 3.0 cm. The good performance of TOPS data with spatial-temporal baselines and inexpensive in-situ validation offers significant potential in future applications of snowpack monitoring and water resources management studies in the Upper Indus Basin of Pakistan.

TI  - Automatic Large-Scale Precise Mapping and Monitoring of Agricultural Fields at Country Level With Sentinel-2 SITS
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Availability of multitemporal (MT) images, such as the sentinel-2 (S2) ones, offers accurate spatial, spectral and temporal information to effectively monitor vegetation, more specifically agriculture. Agricultural practices can benefit from temporally dense satellite image time series (SITS) for accurate understanding of the phenological evolution and behavior of crops. Developing techniques that deal with high spatial correlation and high temporal resolution requires a shift in the processing paradigm and poses new challenges in terms of data processing and methodology. This article presents an automatic approach to large-scale precise mapping of small agricultural fields based on the analysis of S2-SITS at Country level. The approach deals with a flexible and automatic processing chain for massive data and was tested at Country level. The large-scale application requires to consider: the management of big amount of data with particular attention to download and pre-processing of S2-SITS; and MT fine characterization of crop fields accounting for the strong variability in size and phenological behaviors when mapping at large scale. Both challenges are addressed in an automatic way by exploiting and/or updating state-of-the-art methodologies. Promising results have been obtained and validated over 2017 and 2018 agrarian years for Italy.

TI  - A TILING-BASED STRATEGY FOR LARGE-SCALE MULTISENSOR OPTICAL-SAR IMAGE REGISTRATION

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
AB  - The automatic registration of image pairs composed of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a highly challenging task because of the inherently different physical, statistical, and textural properties of the input data. Information-theoretic measures capable of comparing local intensity distributions are often used for multisensor optical-SAR registration. Moreover, the growing availability of such heterogeneous data from current space missions require multisensor registration methods able to run on large-scale datasets with acceptable computation times. In this paper, a novel method is proposed combining information-theoretic area-based registration with a sequential image tiling strategy. Experiments with optical-SAR data collected by a variety of sensors (Sentinel, Landsat, ERS, etc.) suggest both qualitatively and quantitatively the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in achieving accurate registration with low computational cost.

AB  - Remotely sensed data and Artificial Intelligence provide an avenue to Standard Evaporation (ETo) classification. Hence, we developed a methodology for classifying ETo using Self-Organizing Maps on data from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model obtained from March to October, 2020, at 3 km resolution over Ecuador. This is a preliminary effort to provide a visual comparison of ETo classified maps under different scenarios: a 'shallow' learning that takes only data from one time slice at 12:00 noon for one and three months; a 'deeper' learning that considers hourly slices for three months; raw and pre-processed WRF variables; and different numbers of classified classes. The results of these exercises show overall stable mountainous classification, while the Amazonia and Western regions appear more volatile. Moreover, the 'deeper' learning produces a more stable ETo classification in all regions with a decreased migration of classes over time, as presented at http://www.yachay.openfabtech.org/somETo/description.php

AB  - The death rates are decreasing, and the population is growing on a daily basis, owing mostly to the advances of science and technology. This is increasing land exploitation for expansion, which is degrading the eminence of land every day and distorting the environment and foliage. Human activities on land usage ultimately have an influence on the environment spatially and temporarily. The leading role for land use/land cover (LULC) modification aimed at fulfilling the demand for expanding population by stepping up cultivation of edibles and void natural LC, such as the woodlands, as colonization and trade activities. The NDVI, a consequence perception method, is used to provide detailed content in perceiving and observing LULC effects. This paper provides information on changes to land cover in Vijayawada a city in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, in 2000, 2010 and 2020 using Landsat 8 images, and OLI and TIRS images. ArcGIS v10.4 is used to process satellite images and Land Cover changes are identified using NDVI. Versatile bands of Landsat images are used to produce the information of vegetation, water bodies, bare soil, and urban by calculating NDVI. The results revealed that dense vegetation decreased by around 28%, whereas vegetation, built-up and water expanded respectively by 10%, 23% and 1%, and increased kappa coefficient and overall accuracy (OA).

AB  - The Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), concentration is a widely used indicator of air quality. The estimation of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations has been approximated by numerous models and machine learning (ML) approaches, utilizing satellite-derived datasets in their most recent advancements. However, past ML applications have used primarily tree-based algorithms, while neural network based methods are under-explored. In the current study we present a model via the Attentive Interpretable Learning neural network (TabNet), incorporating Sentinel-5P datasets and meteorological observations to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations across Thailand. The proposed model achieves statistically reliable performances surpassing other tree-based leading ML models. Carbon Monoxide exhibits the highest significance on the model indicating agricultural burnings as the main emission source in Thailand. The proposed approach demonstrates the capacity of deep learning for PM2.5 estimations and expands its potential to improve the accuracy in air quality quantification.

TI  - MLFF-GAN: A Multilevel Feature Fusion With GAN for Spatiotemporal Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limitation of technology and budget, it is often difficult for sensors of a single remote sensing satellite to have both high-temporal and high-spatial (HTHS) resolution at the same time. In this article, we proposed a new multilevel feature fusion with generative adversarial network (MLFF-GAN) for generating fusion HTHS images. The MLFF-GAN mainly uses U-net-like architecture, and its generator is composed of three stages: feature extraction, feature fusion, and image reconstruction. In the feature extraction and reconstruction stage, the generator employs the encoding and decoding structure to extract three groups of multilevel features (MLFs), which can cope with the huge difference of resolution between high-resolution images and low-resolution images. In the feature fusion stage, adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) block is designed to learn the global distribution relationship between multitemporal images, and an attention module (AM) is used to learn the local information weights for the change of small areas. The proposed MLFF-GAN was tested on two Landsat and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. Some state-of-the-art algorithms are comprehensively compared with MLFF-GAN. We also carried on the ablation experiment to test the effectiveness of different submodules in the MLFF-GAN. The experiment results and ablation analysis show the better performances of the proposed method when compared with other methods. The code is available at https://github.com/songbingze/MLFF-GAN.

TI  - Downscaling ESA CCI Soil Moisture Based on Soil and Vegetation Component Temperatures Derived From MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) soil moisture could provide long-time microwave-retrieved soil moisture data but is limited to regional applications due to the low resolution (25 km). A new method of downscaling ESA CCI soil moisture to 1 km is presented in this study. First, the soil and vegetation component temperatures (SVCT) were estimated using MODIS land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Following this, the relationship between ESA CCI soil moisture and 1-km SVCT was constructed based on the negative linear relationship between the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and soil moisture. The dry and wet lines used to estimate TVDI need not to be obtained in the method. The coefficients were obtained directly from 25-km ESA CCI soil moisture and 1-km SVCT by the upscaling algorithm of soil moisture. The method was applied to the Naqu area on the Tibetan Plateau. Downscaled soil moisture was validated with ground measurements collected at five sites within the soil moisture/temperature monitoring network on the central Tibetan Plateau from May to October 2014. The results show that the trend of the time series of the downscaled soil moisture is similar to the ground measurements during this period, and the root-mean-square error is 0.0568 m(3)/m(3). The method is suitable for the condition with an NDVI higher than 0.4. The key points of the approach are to obtain SVCT and the relationship between soil moisture and SVCT.

AB  - Real-time surveillance of vessel in ocean was previously enforced by AIS sensors, while the importance of weather independent monitoring apparatus, SAR, is currently being implemented. For practical application of SAR image based vessel monitoring however, correction of azimuth shift caused by the velocity of moving target was necessary. This study presented azimuth shift compensation on vessels detected from Cosmo-SkyMed SAR images using machine learning based object detector. Conventional azimuth velocity measurement using Doppler frequency estimation was implemented and transformed into azimuth shift. AIS information corresponding to SAR images was preprocessed in order to be employed as a reference. From three CosmoSkyMed SAR images, azimuth velocity estimation derived the average offset of 1.65 m/s, while azimuth shift measurement derived that of 70.69 m with respect to AIS information. Ensuing application of this study includes moving target indication especially in ground regions.

TI  - Restoration of Authentic Position of Unidentified Vessels in SAR Imagery: A Deep Learning Based Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhancement of vessel detection performance in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images generated academic advancements related to amelioration of the algorithmic accuracy and training data procurement. For practical implementation of vessel detection algorithm to maritime surveillance, however, presentation of authentic position of vessels was essential. Accordingly, this article aimed to propose an algorithm, which demonstrated realistic and azimuth shift-corrected position of vessel, especially out of conventional vessel monitoring apparatus: automated identification system (AIS) and vessel-pass (VPASS) information. Two different analyses regarding the vessel detection output utilization were, therefore, presented. Primary analysis demonstrated a vessel identification algorithm, comparing the vessel detection output with elaborately preprocessed AIS and VPASS information, which indicated the discrete position and velocity of vessel. The other presented a position restoration algorithm via i) velocity estimator complementing the conventional fractional Fourier transform velocity estimation analysis, while investigating the effect of range acceleration in deriving the azimuth velocity and ii) measuring the vessel orientation angle from Radon transform. Both algorithms were implemented to the vessel detection output in Cosmo-SkyMed SAR images, depicting an enhanced accuracy compared to the conventional algorithm both in velocity estimation and azimuth shift estimation; velocity offset reduced from 1.64 m/s to 1.29 m/s and average azimuth shift offset reduced from 70.75 m to 62.39 m. The presented algorithms would be decisive in terms of practicality if robustly attached to convolutional neural network-based vessel detection algorithms demonstrating ideal detection performances.

AB  - Utilizing weather independent SAR images along with machine learning based object detector is effective in robust vessel monitoring. While conventional SAR images often applied amplitude data from Single Look Complex, exploitation of polarimetric parameters acquired from multiple polarimetric SAR images was yet to be implemented to vessel detection utilizing machine learning. Hence, this study used four polarimetric parameters (H, p1, DoP, DPRVI) retrieved from eigen-decomposition and two backscattering coefficients (γ0, VV, γ0, VH) from radiometric calibration; six bands in total were respectively exploited from 52 Sentinel-1 SAR images, accompanied by vessel training data extracted from AIS information which corresponds to acquisition time span of the SAR image. Evaluating different cases of combination, the use of polarimetric indexes along with amplitude values derived enhanced vessel detection performances than that of utilizing amplitude values exclusively.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is considered to be suitable for near real-time inundation monitoring. The distinctly different intensity between water and land makes it adequate for waterbody detection, but the intrinsic speckle noise and variable intensity of SAR images decrease the accuracy of waterbody detection. In this study, we suggest two modules, named ‘morphology module’ and ‘edge- enhanced module’, which are the combinations of pooling layers and convolutional layers, improving the accuracy of waterbody detection. The morphology module is composed of min-pooling layers and max-pooling layers, which shows the effect of morphological transformation. The edge-enhanced module is composed of convolution layers, which has the fixed weights of the traditional edge detection algorithm. After comparing the accuracy of various versions of each module for U-Net, we found that the optimal combination is the case that the morphology module of min-pooling and successive layers of min-pooling and max-pooling, and the edge-enhanced module of Scharr filter were the inputs of conv9. This morphologic and edge-enhanced U-Net improved the F1-score by 9.81% than the original U-Net. Qualitative inspection showed that our model has capability of detecting small-sized waterbody and detailed edge of water, which are the distinct advancement of the model presented in this research, compared to the original U-Net.

AB  - In order to estimate tree biomass, allometric equations take tree parameters such as tree height, wood density, circumference of trunk, and crown diameter as input parameters. Given that most of these quantities are challenging to be extracted from remote sensing data, we evaluate the option to approximate biomass by tree height only. We study our approach by evaluating linear regression, random forest, and Gaussian process regressor models when applied to the 2016 Jucker dataset. Results indicate that linear models fail to properly capture the relationship between biomass and tree height, but the Gaussian process regressor outperms the other two candidate models.

TI  - Land-cover Classification and Change Assessment for Shijiazhuang City, North China, during 1987-2020 Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-accuracy and high-resolution land-cover datasets are crucial for city planning and sustainable development. In recent decades, Shijiazhuang City has experienced significant land use/cover changes resulting from economic development, population growth, and urban expansion. However, few studies have been reported on land-cover datasets over Shijiazhuang City, which has a complex topography and a heterogeneous landscape. In this study, single- and multi-temporal Landsat images over Shijiazhuang City were classified by random forest, support vector machine, and classification and regression tree classifiers based on 382 field survey samples; their accuracies were assessed through a comparison with two other land-cover datasets (GlobeLand30-2020 and GLC FCS30-2020). Land-cover dynamics from 1988 to 2020 and greening trends from 2000 to 2020 were determined. The results show that the classification of multi-temporal images with spectral and phenological characteristics using random forest classifiers achieved the highest overall accuracy of 86.4% in comparison with 69.6 and 47.5% for GlobeLand30-2020 and GLC_FCS30-2020, respectively. From 1988 to 2020, the impervious surfaces and deciduous broad-leaved forest regions in the study area expanded, while irrigated cropland and shrubland areas decreased gradually. From 2000 to 2020, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of natural vegetation types in urban and mountainous areas significantly increased (p < 0.05), while the greenness of the entire study area and irrigated cropland regions exhibited no significant changes. In this paper, we provide useful information for research into city land-cover classification and assessment, along with ecological environment protection and planning.

AB  - The dependence of azimuth cutoff wavelength (lambda(c)) on significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed (U) at C-band VV, HH, VH, and HV polarizations is analyzed based on the collocations between the quad-polarization Gaofen-3 SAR wave mode images and the ERA5 wind and wave reanalysis. Then the influence of pixel spacing on the dependence is discussed. The results show the co-polarized (VV and HH) lambda(c) has an evident positive dependence with SWH (with U), while for the cross-polarization (VH and HV), it is relatively weaker. In addition, the cross-polarized lambda(c) is more related to U than to SWH. Moreover, the size of pixel spacing affects the estimated value of lambda(c). The dependence of lambda(c) on SWH and U shows a decreasing trend with pixel spacing increasing in all four polarizations. But this trend is more significant for co-polarization, especially for VV.

AB  - Global outgoing longwave radiation variation is examined for a 6-year (2014-2019) period using reanalysis and FengYun 3B/3C OLR products: the interpolated OLR analyses and the visible and infrared radiometer OLR on FengYun 3 series satellite platforms. Tropical Pacific and Nino key regions are essential range for monitoring El Nino events, which are chosen to investigate the spatial-temporal correlation, seasonal evolution and statistical difference with a variety source of OLR anomalies. Results indicate that monthly OLR anomalies can monitor the Nino variation. OLR anomalies are associated with enhanced amplitude in the EP El Nino, while OLR anomalies exhibit stronger intensity than the CP El Nino index. For FengYun 3B/3C the monthly satellite products have a root mean squared error of 10.94 W/m(2) and 12.73 W/m(2) as compared for the interpolated OLR products.

TI  - SI-STSAR-7: A Large SAR Images Dataset with Spatial and Temporal Information for Classification of Winter Sea Ice in Hudson Bay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellites have been broadly applied to sea ice monitoring. The substantial increase in satellite imagery provides a large amount of data support for deep learning methods in the sea ice classification field. However, there is a lack of public remote sensing datasets to facilitate sea ice classification with spatial and temporal information and to benchmark the deep learning methods. In this paper, we provide a labeled large sea ice dataset derived from time-series sentinel-1 SAR images, dubbed SI-STSAR-7, and a validated dataset construction method for sea ice classification research. The SI-STSAR-7 dataset includes seven different sea ice types corresponding to different sea ice development stages in Hudson Bay during winter, and its samples are time sequences of SAR image patches in order to embody the differences of backscattering intensity and textures between different sea ice types, as well as the change of sea ice with time. We construct the dataset by first performing noise reduction and mitigation of incidence angle dependence on SAR images, and then producing data samples and labeling them based on our proposed sample-producing principles and the weekly regional ice charts provided by Canadian Ice Service. Three baseline classification methods are developed on SI-STSAR-7 to establish benchmarks, which are evaluated with accuracy and kappa coefficient. The sample-producing principles are verified through experiments. Based on the experimental results, sea ice classification can be implemented well on SI-STSAR-7.

AB  - Multisource remote sensing data provide the abundant and complementary information for land cover classification. In this paper, we propose a deep hashing-based feature extraction and fusion framework for joint classification of hyperspectral and LiDAR data. Firstly, HSIs and LiDAR data are fed into a two-stream network to extract deep features after data preprocessing. Then, we adopt hashing technique to constrain single-source and cross-source similarities, i.e., samples with same classes should have small feature distance and samples with different classes should have large feature distance. Furthermore, a feature-level fusion strategy is exploited to fuse the two kind of multisource information. Finally, we design an object function to consider the similarity information between sample pairs and semantic information of each sample, which can deliver the discriminative features for classification. The experiments on Houston data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over some competitive approaches.

TI  - PSTNet: Progressive Sampling Transformer Network for Remote Sensing Image Change Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing change detection (CD) is to use multitemporal remote sensing data to extract change information by using a variety of image processing and pattern recognition methods, and quantitatively analyze and determine the characteristics and processes of surface changes. In recent research on CD, how to more accurately segment objects and how to extract and effectively link spatiotemporal information are important parts. To achieve this, we propose a progressive sampling (PS) transformer network for remote sensing image CD, which continuously extracts and optimizes feature information in an iterative manner, so that pixels can establish better connections in the spatial domain to model the context. Our intuition is that, through this iterative sampling method, the parts of interest in the image can be gradually extracted. This allows subsequent processing to be more focused on useful areas, which in turn reduces interference from uninteresting parts, and the information after PS will be generalize into several tokens containing rich semantic information. Using the excellent modeling ability of the transformer, the optimized tokens are mapped back to the original image features to achieve the purpose of segmenting accurate difference images. We conducted extensive experiments on three CD datasets, LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, and WHU-CD, and achieved evaluation scores of 90.73/84.11, 80.10/68.93, and 91.67/85.15 on F1-score and IoU metrics, respectively. Notably, the convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone of our network uses only a simplified ResNet model, without using structurally complex frameworks, such as FPN and Unet, but our model uses PS module and transformer to achieve better performance than the recent advanced CD models.

TI  - SCT2G: Model for Fast Satellite Activity Recognition in SDA
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of space technology, the space domain environment has become increasingly complex and variable, which has created more challenges for space domain awareness. By classifying the problems faced by SDA, the overall idea of solving these problems by detecting points of variation is clarified. In this paper, a change-point detection method is constructed for space target data streams based on the T2G model, and the method's effectiveness and performance are verified by simulating satellite data streams. This proves that the method proposed in this paper can quickly and effectively detect the change points of a civilian space target. Furthermore, we include a preliminary analysis of space target behaviour by analysing the calculated anomaly score. After verifying the method, we demonstrate its applications in several important fields (such as regular LEO satellites, LEO satellites with frequent orbit manoeuvres, and GEO satellites), which not only verifies the proposed method's effectiveness but also yields much more space information. This can provide valuable evidence, recommendations and references for subsequent space situation analysis and space mission planning.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Spatiotemporal Fusion via a Generative Adversarial Network With One Prior Image Pair
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) is an effective solution to promote the application of remote sensing images, given that the tradeoff between the temporal resolution and the spatial resolution is ubiquitous in the production of remote sensing images. However, cloud coverage makes it difficult to obtain dense cloud-free Landsat-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image pairs on the timeline, which limits the application of existing STF methods. Considering the lack of prior image pairs and the huge spatial resolution gap between Landsat and MODIS images, this article presents a novel remote sensing image STF method based on a generative adversarial network to handle one Landsat-MODIS prior image pair case (OPGAN), which contains a generator and a discriminator simultaneously trained in a min-max game. OPGAN is built based on the STF observation model that learns the base information from the prior Landsat image and then captures temporal change (TC) information from a difference image constructed from MODIS images collected at times 1 and 2 and sensor difference information from the difference image between Landsat and MODIS images at time 1. They are combined together to reconstruct the Landsat image at time 2 at both high spatial and high temporal resolution. Moreover, a change loss is proposed to further improve the accuracy of TC prediction. Extensive experiments on the STF dataset illustrate that the proposed OPGAN method can obtain more accurate prediction of spatial information and TCs in the case of insufficient prior information.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo is a significant factor for Earth energy budget, climate change and environmental change. As tremendous regional and global changes happened over ocean, more details for the ocean monitoring need to be provided. However, there were still no high-spatial resolution TOA albedo products over ocean. In this study, all-sky TOA albedo estimation over ocean was proposed based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Instead of building angular dependent models, direct retrieval models between TOA reflectance and TOA albedo was developed based on extensive radiative transfer simulations under clear sky and cloudy sky, covering thousands of ocean and atmosphere types. Three-Component Ocean Water Albedo model was involved to take account for the ocean surface anisotropy at different wind speed, wind direction and chlorophyll conditions while Modtran was utilized to simulate different atmospheric conditions. Our results showed good agreement with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System based on a global comparison on August, 4, 2011, with RMSE = 0.055 under cloudy sky and RMSE = 0.015 under clear sky. MODIS-based products provide more spatial details due to higher spatial resolution, which will be a good data source for regional environmental and climatic research.

TI  - Assessing the Ecosystem Health of Coastal Wetland Vegetation (<i>Suaeda salsa</i>) Using the Pressure State Response Model, a Case of the Liao River Estuary in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Suaeda salsa (S. salsa) is an important ecological barrier and tourism resource in coastal wetland resources, and assessing changes in its health is beneficial for protecting the ecological health of wetlands and increasing finances. The aim was to explore improvements in the degradation of S. salsa communities in the Liao River Estuary National Nature Reserve since a wetland restoration project was carried out in Panjin, Liaoning Province, China, in 2015. In this study, landscape changes in the reserve were assessed based on Sentinel-2 images classification results from 2016 to 2019. A pressure-state-response framework was constructed to assess the annual degradation of S. salsa communities within the wetlands. The assessment results show that the area of S. salsa communities and water bodies decreased annually from 2016 to 2019, and the increased degradation indicators indicate a state of continued degradation. The area of types such as aquaculture ponds and Phragmites australis communities did not change much, while the estuarine mudflats increased year by year. The causes of S. salsa community degradation include anthropogenic impacts from abandoned aquaculture ponds and sluice control systems but also natural impacts from changes in the tidal amplitude and soil properties of the mudflats. The results also indicate that the living conditions of S. salsa in the Liao River estuary wetlands are poor and that anthropogenic disturbance is necessary to restore the original vegetation abundance.

AB  - Ships in remote sensing images are usually arranged in arbitrary direction, small in size, and densely arranged. As a result, existing object detection algorithms cannot detect ships quickly and accurately. In order to solve the above problems, a lightweight object detection network for fast detection of ships is proposed. The network is composed of backbone network, four-scale fusion network and rotation branch. First, a lightweight network unit S-LeanNet is designed and used to build a low-computing and accurate backbone network. Then, a four-scale feature fusion module is designed to generate a four-scale feature pyramid, which contains more features such as ship shape and texture, and at the same time is conducive to the detection of small ships. Finally, a novel rotation branch module is designed, using balance L1 loss function and R-NMS for post-processing, to realize the precise positioning and regression of the rotating bounding box in one step. Experimental results show that the detection precision of our method in the DOTA remote sensing data set is compared with the latest SCRDet detection method, the precision is increased by 1.1%, and the operating speed is increased by 8 times, which can meet the fast detection requirements of ships.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - URSI Regional Conference on Radio Science (USRI-RCRS)
CL  - Indore, INDIA
AB  - The Indian subcontinent is a large geographical system which experiences diverse natural and anthropogenic processes influencing the regional air quality, atmospheric chemistry and climate. However, ground-based observations are often sparse and limited to a few chemical species and the models have larger uncertainties in simulating aforementioned processes for Indian conditions. In this regard, we combined the potentials of remote sensing data and modeling to study the long-term variations in natural emissions and surface ozone. While the mean ozone levels are higher over the northern India, the long-term trend is seen to be more pronounced (similar to 0.4 ppbv y(-1)) over the central-east regions in the vicinity of higher biogenic emissions of isoprene. In addition, tropospheric column ozone shows increasing trends over the northern Indian Ocean and surrounding larger regions including Southeast Asia. We find widespread enhancement in ozone across South Asia and stronger biogenic emissions over peninsular India during the warmest year (2016) as compared to the climatological mean distributions. Our study suggests the need to conduct comprehensive in-situ observations of biogenic volatile organic compounds for formulation of effective policies to mitigate the impacts of global warming on the air quality over South Asia.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the ecological awareness of Indians through the speeches of the Indian chiefs. Indians who had long been the masters of the North American continent were ignored and expelled from the whites. However, the Indians’ sense of respect for nature is prevalent throughout the speeches of the chief, who represents the Indians. This makes us realize that environmental awareness of Indians is desirable as environmental problems are emerging as a serious issue today. The Indians recognize that humans are only a fraction of the various species that make up an ecosystem, including animals and plants, so it is undesirable for humans to rule over other members of the ecosystem. The basis of the common perception of nature revealed in the speeches is the organic worldview, which is the ecological awareness that humans are some of the members of the earth who inhabit the earth together with other living things and non-living things.

The motifs presented in these spiritual stories are classified into the following types: <Temple Origin Type>, <People Relief Type>, <Dystocia Relief Type>, <Disease Cure Type>, <Pure water Type>, and <Apotropaic Type>. A common characteristic of spiritual stories is that the types and aspects of various humanistic motifs centered on the sacredness of Kobo Daishi are developed. In addition, the spiritual characteristics of each temples and the specific places related to them have been preserved and inherited, and thus the perseverance of faith can be noted in Japan's representative investigative pilgrimage where Henro visits Kobo Daishi. Henro's depiction of temples is considered the result of reflecting on the monolithic religious worldview of the sacred place of Kobo Daishi.

Methods: This study performed a cross-sectional analysis of secondary national data from the Korea Patient Safety Reporting and Learning System. A total of 5,316 LTCH datasets from 2018 to 2020 were analyzed using multi-nominal logistic regression with the help of the SPSS 26.0 program. Results: Adverse events were significantly associated with age, location of the incidents, night-duty hours, incident type, and small hospital size. Further, sentinel events were significantly associated with female gender, age, incident type (meal and suicide/self-harm), and small hospital size. Conclusion: The results underline the need for developing standardized patient safety guidelines that consider LTCH characteristics and holding periodic education programs for healthcare workers in LTCHs so that they can gain adequate knowledge and practical skills for ensuring patient safety. In addition, they highlight the need for measures to improve institutional support and processes so that any weaknesses can be resolved to optimize patient safety.

AB  - In the early Joseon, discourse on ancestral rites were active. It contains the reform by Jujagarai (朱子家禮) and the resistance of conventional rituals to it. Joseon which used the Neo-Confucian worldview as a political ideology was the first to promote Confucianization of everyday rituals while excluding conventional  rituals. This article attempted to reveal its nature and meaning by paying attention to conventional  rituals that resisted Jujagarai. While a conventional  rituals considered it important to serve the deceased and interact with the deceased, but Jujagarai differ from each other in that they aimed to organize paternal relatives through common ancestors.This article discussed the meaning of the ritual Gobihapseol [考妣合設] and a ritual to remember the birthday of the deceased[生辰祭]. Through Mukje-ilgi (默齋日記) and Byeongja-ilgi (丙子日記), I looked at the feelings of rituals of people in reality. Compared to Jujagarai it was revealed that their rituals were less normative, and the way they remembered the deceased was specific and emotional.

AB  - NOAA CoastWatch hosts nearly 2 petabytes of satellite oceanographic data on disk. These freely available data products cover two decades and are primarily stored as standalone NetCDF datasets. Global mapped datasets are processed daily and added to a long chain of previously processed data resulting in a valuable time series of oceanographic data such as sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, sea level anomaly, and sea surface winds. Three decades of experience have taught us that users access data in a myriad of ways. Some download entire collections of global datasets. Others prefer programmatic access using software tools to pull data matching their 'on premise' data while others prefer to locate higher level data to integrate into their own processing pipelines. The "NOAA CoastWatch Data Portal" was developed to address the challenges of accommodating our users' requests. The portal facilitates access to data by providing multiple data-centric services: anonymous FTP/HTTPS service, THREDDS Data Server, and ERDDAP all accessible from a single online map viewer.The NOAA CoastWatch Data Portal map viewer (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw_html/cwViewer.html) serves as the front door to our global data stores by providing visualization, links to product information, and access to datasets in part (i.e., subsets) or whole.In a typical map service, a single dataset is rendered to an image format such as PNG/JPEG for various zoom levels where the number of tiles rendered is 2 boolean AND(2*zoom level) or a cumulative similar to 87,000 images for 8 levels of zoom. The result is a snappy display of data, where the scale and color scheme is determined by the provider allowing little to no user customization. Generating tiles for a multi-decadal dataset results in hundreds of millions of tiles that may or may not be viewed. By contrast, in CoastWatch map tiles are dynamically generated directly from the source NetCDF datafiles using a Web Mapping Service. The result is a slightly slower display but allows user customization and access to pixel-level data. Users can select palettes, data scaling ranges and download the actual data viewed through the map viewer. The map viewer provides simplified access to our backend services.Data selection is performed through a user-controlled calendar and product checkboxes. A change to the date of interest results in a parallel change of that date across multiple products of interest, allowing a user to visualize multiple datasets on a selected date. Products can be promoted to an 'active layer' where the data for a selected date is then made persistent so it can be compared to another date. This is useful to identify changes over time. The map viewer has many additional features for data exploration and inter/intra comparison of data products.Data delivery (e.g., the downloading of files to a user) is handled by file services hosted through FTP/HTTPS, THREDDS, and ERDDAP services. FTP and HTTPS allow direct bulk download of entire datafiles or collections. THREDDS and ERDDAP host value-added data services such as OpenDAP allowing users to access partial or reformatted data. Many users access data programmatically using the OpenDAP protocol which facilitates machine-to-machine interoperability. Similarly, services such as ERDDAP's GRIDDAP allows data subset and reformatting into a variety of formats including JSON, GeoTIFF, CSV, MatLab, etc. Both THREDDS and ERDDAP virtually aggregate data allowing queries to return values for a single pixel over time or download of a NetCDF dataset containing multiple time-levels of spatial data.The CoastWatch Data Portal map viewer will undergo an update over the next year incorporating changes in the underlying JavaScript mapping API. As systems and data move into cloud environments, CoastWatch users may have new expectations from our services. CoastWatch will be called upon to solve new challenges in data distribution. Cloud solutions provide us the opportunity to explore new data and information distribution models.

AB  - This research was carried out to identify the extent and depth of flooded areas using Sentinel-1 SAR, the Digital Elevation Model generated with LiDAR and Random Forest machine learning. Training and cross-validation was performed on a set of backscatter value samples obtained from Sentinel-1. The results indicate that out of five combinations, the Random Forest algorithm had the best performance when using the four combinations (RF + Polarization VH+VV + MDE) with F1m = 0.977, AUC = 0.998 and Kappa = 0.955. SAR images have potential advantages that allow rapid and efficient diagnosis of the extent of flooding caused by excess rainfall in many regions around world.

TI  - An Ubiquitous 2.6 GHz Radio Propagation Model for Wireless Networks Using Self-Supervised Learning From Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of any Mobile Wireless Network (MWN) is dependent on the appropriate level of radio coverage, with Path Loss (PL) models being a valuable resource for its evaluation. Recently, advancements in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied to radio propagation to produce new data-driven PL models. Notoriously, these advancements have also allowed the inclusion of non-classical inputs, such as satellite images. However, data-driven PL models are often developed under the assumption that training and test data distributions are similar, which is a weak assumption in real-world scenarios. Thus, generalization (i.e., the model's ability to perform on different data distributions) is a crucial aspect of data-driven PL models in the context of Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). This paper proposes a new data-driven PL model, the Ubiquitous Satellite Aided Radio Propagation (USARP) model, developed to enhance the geographical generalization capabilities of empirical PL models, by using satellite images. The USARP model considers self-supervised learning to extract general data representations of the radio environment from satellite images, improving the PL prediction Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the 3(rd) Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) PL model in the order of 9 dB, and for a data distribution distinct from the training data. Moreover, it was demonstrated the potential of the USARP model in terms of geographical and radio environment generalization. Although the generalization capabilities of ML regression algorithms are limited, the chosen USARP architecture and the use of regularization techniques had a positive impact on its geographical generalization performance.

TI  - CONCEPTS OF MAN AND WOMAN (NOT ONLY) IN PLATO AND ARISTOTLE PROBLEMS OF EQUALITY AND DIFFERENCES OF BOTH SEXES
T2  - STUDIA NEOARISTOTELICA-A JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL SCHOLASTICISM
M3  - Article
AB  - We deal with the concept of man and woman, as well as with the problem of their equality, in the two great ancient thinkers Plato and Aristotle. The discussion of Plato leads to the conclusion that there is no substantial difference between man and woman. We find Plato's view close or similar to today's widely held doctrine of "unisexism". Aristotle on the other hand believes that there are important differences between man and woman and we find in his texts two approaches to the problem. In his first view the sex difference is due to the lesser perfection of woman, according to the second view both sexes are equally perfect, nevertheless each in its own way. Both conceptions have their supporters in contemporary thought (so-called theories of "polarism" and "compatibilism"). From a systematic point of view we suggest that Aristotle's second approach should be further developed as it is most in accord with our Christian worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - Engineers Without Borders (EWB) is an organization present in many countries. It represents, in its origin, one of the main manifestations of a specific type of engaged engineering (EE), Humanitarian Engineering (HE), which is mainly concerned with alleviating the effects of environmental disasters and wars on the affected people. In this paper, starting from a study that conjugated literature review, interviews, and bibliometric analysis of congress papers: 1) it is presented and historically contextualized the EWB Brazil case; and 2) the organization is critically analyzed according to five aspects: intervention methodology; vision of social impact; vision of technology and engineering; worldview; and the role of volunteering in the organization. As its central finding, the paper points out that EVVB Brazil remains strongly influenced by HE's principles and ideals, even though it does not make explicit the HE perspective and develop other types of EE.

M3  - research-article
AB  - In der Debatte um Umweltethik wird die Frage nach einer Theorie inner Werte in der Natur kritisch diskutiert. Wahrend der Mensch gangigen Vorstellungen zufolge uber eine absolute innere Wurde verfugt, insofern er als Person zur freien moralischen Handlung fahig ist, ist die Natur im Sinner der modernen Wissenschaften als ‘entzauberter’ Bereich reiner Faktizitat ohne Werte zu verstehen. Der Aufsatz stellt die These auf, dass das moderne wissenschaftliche Weltbild auf einer anti-aristotelischen Revolution basiert, demzufolge Naturkausalitat als a-teleologisch verstanden werden muss. Hegels Naturphilosophie fuhrt jedoch in interessanter Weise wieder einen objektiven Zweckbegriff in die Debatte um die Naturphilosophie ein. Der vorliegende Aufsatz argumentiert dafur, dass Hegels natur-ontologischer Entwurf durchaus mit dem modernen wissenschaftlichen anti-aristotelischen Naturbegriff in Einklang gebracht werden kann, und dass er zugleich Deutungsmoglichkeiten der Natur eroffnet, die uber einen wertfreien Naturalismus hinausgehen und sich daher als attraktiv fur die moderne umweltethische Debatte erweisen kann.
AB  - In environmental ethics, the question of intrinsic values ​​in nature is often critically discussed  While humans are supposed to have an absolute inner dignity insofar as we are capable of free moral actions , nature in the sense of modern science is to be understood as a 'disenchanted' realm of pure factuality without values. This essay puts forward the thesis that the modern scientific worldview is based on an anti-Aristotelian revolution, according to which natural causality must be understood as a-teleological. In an interesting way, however, Hegel's natural philosophy reintroduces an objective concept of purpose into the debate about natural philosophy. It is argued that Hegel's philosophy of nature can be reconciled with the modern, scientific, anti-Aristotelian concept of nature, and that at the same time it opens up possibilities for interpreting nature that go beyond the view of nature of value-free naturalism. Hegel's conception of nature could therefore  be attractive for current modern environmental ethical debate

AB  - Interoperability of data from different sources is the main purpose of this study. The survey covers the waters of the Black Sea in Bulgaria. Our country has a maritime border of 378 km, of strategic importance and is close to military conflicts (e.g. Ukraine). The use of different satellite and in situ data in hybrid models makes it possible to obtain much more information from one point or area of interest. Different satellite data have been used, which are collated with registers of open and spatial data from the Bulgarian Open Data Portal. Much of the ground information is extremely rich in detailed information on the chemical, environmental and climate status of the specific point or area of interest. The survey uses Copernicus data, Landsat, the Open Data Portal, the Black Sea Basin Directorate and Innovative Techniques and Methods for Reducing Marine Litter in the Black Sea Coastal Areas - (BSB552 RedMarLitter and etc. These interoperable data will be useful for coastal protection and security, environmental monitoring and adequate decision-making in the administration, business and various other groups of data users. The methodology aims to support work on Digital Twins of the Earth. Information from so many sources will at one point lead to a much more effective and efficient management of territories in the event of environmental disasters (e.g. plastic and oil pollution), various military conflicts and their consequences, as well as annual monitoring of tourist areas and many others.

TI  - Models of the universe in the Ob-Ugric picture of the world: to the question of the initial structurality of space
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: many issues of the traditional worldview of the Ob-Ugric peoples are well studied, while others, for example, historical types of worldview. ideas about various deities and spirits, their functions and hierarchy, local features of the spread of ancestor worship among the Khanty and Mansi peoples, the peculiarity of the Bear Holiday require new materials, additional understanding, as well as new hypotheses. The question of the initial model of the universe also belongs to such discussed topics. The article provides additional arguments in favor of the primonlial nature of the horizontal model of the world, materials on the local dominants of the vector of spatial constructions of various ethnographic groups of the Khanty and Mansi peoples.Objective: to analyze the existing points of view on the structural models of the universe and their origin; to reveal the factors that influenced the structurality of the picture of the world.Research materials: published ethnographic materials, linguistic research data, and oral reports of informants.Results and novelty of the research: three scientific approaches to determination of the origin of the vector of structural spatial constructions of the Ob Ugrians (horizontal, vertical and mixed model of the universe) are analyzed. For the first time, local research findings were combined into the most unified system revealing the idea of the original models of spatial constructions in integrity.The involvement of archaeological materials made it possible to determine the time of addition of these models: horizontal - the Upper Paleolithic period, vertical and mixed - the time of transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. For the first time, the idea of involving linguistics data, in particular the grammatical category of time, for the argumentation of the vector of spatial constructions is proposed.The authors come to the conclusion that various structural models of the universe of the Ob Ugrians were formed in different historical epochs; their formation was influenced by two worldview systems: the Southern, characteristic for the Turkic-speaking peoples of Southern Siberia and associated with the culture of nomadic pastoralists, and the Northern autochthonous system. The nature of cross-cultural contacts and their own ethnic history manifested itself in the fact that the horizontal model of the universe is more typical for the Northern groups of the Ob Ugrians, while the vertical model is more typical for the Eastern ones. The formation of the vertical model was influenced by shamanism and subsequently by Christianization and the complication of the social stratification of society.

AB  - Rapid urbanization in developing countries is leading to urban sprawl along the fringes of the cities. The land use of the regions surrounding the Chennai metropolitan area is changing drastically. It is vital to monitor and quantify the land-use change and the urban expansion process to achieve cities with proper planning, efficiency and sustainability. This paper aims to determine the land-use change in the study area for the years 1998, 2009 and 2019 using remote sensing data. Shannon's entropy was utilized to assess the nature of urban growth happening in the study area. The study region was divided into 50 zones of concentric circles drawn from the central business district point. The rate of urbanization in each zone shows gradual increasing trend from 2009 to 2019, moving outwards with a maximum value of 36.9% in the last zone. Whereas from 1998 to 2009, the rate of urbanization increases rapidly to attain a maximum value of 85.6% in the 31st zone and thereafter the value got decreased. Relative Shannon's entropy asserted that the city displayed a dispersed development from a distance of 12, 14 and 18 km from the city centre for the years 1998, 2009 and 2019, respectively.

AB  - This paper discusses the improved correlations between unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing and proximal sensor data. Better and increased correlation between remote sensing and proximal sensor data is necessary for the remote sensing data to be useful for precision agriculture. Portable ground control points (GCPs) were used for absolute positioning and will serve as an absolute georeference for the UAV data. RTK GNSS receiver and base station were used for centimeter level accuracy of ground truth data. This paper shows the results obtained from hyperspectral sensors that uses a high-performance GNSS/INS and multispectral sensor equipped with an RTK GNSS that is connected to an RTK GNSS mobile station for increased accuracy. The remote sensing data is used to calculate various vegetation indices including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Green NDVI, and modified soil adjusted vegetation indices (SAVI). The indices are compared with the data obtained from proven proximal sensors that include Handheld Spectroradiometer and Chlorophyll Meter.

AB  - In recent years, the data science and remote sensing communities have started to align due to user-friendly programming tools, access to high-end consumer computing power, and the availability of free satellite data. In particular, publicly available data from the European Space Agency's "Sentinel" and American Earth observation satellite" landsat" missions have been used in various remote sensing applications.Google Earth Engine (GEE) is such a tool that publicly allow the use of these available datasets, there is a large amount of available data in GEE, which are being used for computing and analysing purpose. In this article, we compare the classification performance of four supervised machine learning algorithms: Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random forests (RF), Gradient tree boosting (GTB), Support vector machines (SVM). The study area is located at 30.3165 degrees N, 78.0322 degrees E near the Himalayan foothills, with four land-use land-cover (LULC) classes. The satellite imagery used for the classification were multi-temporal scenes from Sentinel-2 and LANDSAT-8 covering spring, summer, autumn, and winter conditions. Here we collected a total of 2084 sample points in which 536, 506, 505, 540 points belong to urban, water, forest and agriculture points respectively. which were divided into training (70%) and evaluation (30%) subsets. Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix, for accuracy measurement we use confusion and Cohen's kappa calculation method.We have calculated CART (Accuracy 93.52% and Kappa coefficient 91.36%), Random Forest (Accuracy 95.86% and Kappa coefficient 94.48%),Gradient Tree Boost (Accuracy 95.33% and Kappa coefficient 93.37%),Support Vector Machine (Accuracy 73.54% and Kappa coefficient 76.28%) for Landsat 8 data sets and CART (Accuracy 89.24% and Kappa coefficient 85.64%), Random Forest (Accuracy 91.45% and Kappa coefficient 88.59%),Gradient Tree Boost (Accuracy 87.71% and Kappa coefficient 83.58%),Support Vector Machine (Accuracy 84.96% and Kappa coefficient 79.99%) for Sentinel2 data sets. Further analysis for accuracy and machine learning algorithm are discussed in result section.

AB  - We investigated the use of multisensory satellite data to determine long-term changes in surface chlorophyll concentrations using a 19-year (1998-2016) time series of chlorophyll data in the Danish Kattegat region of the Baltic Sea. Merged satellite estimates (SeaWiFS-MODIS/Aqua-MERIS-VIIRS) were compared with in situ ship based time series from four monitoring stations situated with increasing distance from land and nutrient sources. In situ and satellite derived estimates showed similar trend in chlorophyll with several fold higher values closer to land. Satellites aligned very well with in situ estimates in the open water stations but showed significant differences in magnitude and inter-annual variability, in particular in shallow coastal waters. Some systematic deviation was observed with satellite underestimating the growing season average for the earlier periods (1998-2002) and overestimating for the later period (2012-2016) compared to in situ estimates. Comparing growing season chlorophyll means over the 19 year period showed increasing magnitude and variability in nearshore and shallower areas, most pronounced for the satellite derived chlorophyll. Satellites overestimated chlorophyll in nearshore areas 2-4 fold, despite excluding shallow nearshore areas with possible benthic interferences from the analyses. This bias needs further validation and requires correction to improve the overall applicability of satellites for long-term monitoring of chlorophyll in the Kattegat region. From analysis of normalized data, we developed a simple correction model, which reduced deviations considerably between methods, underlying the importance of in situ data for application of satellite observations. While significant deviations were observed from in situ data, satellites are clearly advantageous in the much higher temporal and high spatial coverage they provide. Multisensory satellites can, however, not be used currently as a standalone technique for long-term assessment of chlorophyll. They require validation with in situ measurements, which provide essential data for calibration, validation and correction of satellite based estimates. A complementary use of multisensory satellite and in situ measurements therefore remains essential to assess trends in the ecological status of optically complex waters such as the Kattegat region of the Baltic Sea.

TI  - Role of methylene blue in detecting the sentinel lymph node in colorectal cancer: <i>In vivo</i> vs. <i>ex vivo</i> technique
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of sentinel lymph nodes is a valuable oncological method, which aims at mapping lymphatic drainage and has the advantage of correctly staging the disease and assessing prognosis. Lymph node invasion is an important prognostic feature. In colorectal cancer, lymphadenectomy is not influenced by the positive or negative status of the sentinel lymph node. The identification of lymph nodes with possible invasion by staining the primary tumor with methylene blue can lead to improved staging and management. In other words, the consequent administration of neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy) to the appropriate patients may result in lower recurrence rates. Thus, the aim of the present study was to use methylene blue to identify the sentinel node/nodes in colorectal cancer and to determine whether the dye-capturing nodes were invaded by the tumor. This is a non-randomized prospective study, in which 26 patients with colon cancer with surgical indication were enrolled. Two types of methods were utilized: in vivo (16 patients) and ex vivo (10 patients). The identification rate was 75% for the in vivo technique and 60% for the ex vivo technique, resulting in a 69.26% overall identification rate. Of 18 patients with sentinel lymph nodes identified using dye, routine histological examination detected metastases in 6 (33.33%) of these patients. In conclusion, further research should be conducted into how the clinical application of sentinel node detection can be employed in colorectal cancer.

AB  - On September 2, 2015, a RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Narrow image was acquired of the Juan de Fuca Strait and the Strait of Georgia, British Colombia, Canada as part of routine ocean-pollution surveillance. The vessel, Coastal Intrigue, and a linear, slick-like feature trailing the stern of the vessel were detected. The source of the CIF was attributed to three possible mechanisms, namely a plankton bloom, turbulent wake, or some type of discharge from the Coastal Intrigue. At the time of the RADARSAT-2 acquisition, there were no reported plankton blooms in the Juan de Fuca Strait or the Strait of Georgia, so a plankton bloom was eliminated as a mechanism. A turbulent wake was also eliminated because turbulent wakes are seldom detected in the area where the Coastal Intrigue was travelling and the vessel Eva, which was travelling on essentially a parallel course as the Coastal Intrigue, did not produce a SAR-detected wake. Therefore, the most likely source-mechanism for the CIF was discharge (either oil or similar) from the Coastal Intrigue. The analysis of the RADARSAT-2 image acquired on September 2, 2015, AIS data, and wind data supports the conclusion that the CIF was from the Coastal Intrigue. There was, however, not enough information available to definitively identify the CIF substance other than the statement that the most likely source was either bilge oil or some other type of substance.

AB  - This paper addresses the classification of CORINE classes. Three land use classes (arable land, pastures, and natural grassland) report similar spectral responses which make it challenging to separate. Therefore, we adopted a multitemporal and multispectral approach using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in combination with the NDVI vegetation index, Haralick's textural measures, and topographic information. The workflow identifies a methodology for combining various groups of input data (optical, NDVI, textural, topographic) and explores the suitable use of the Random Forest classifier for the task. The classification was carried out in three different European locations. The results present a strong separation of arable land (F1 score over 96%) from the other two classes. Pastures and natural grassland classes achieved F1 in the range of 76% to almost 85% in both cases. In conclusion, we discuss the suitability of the CORINE database for such classification problems.

T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDRapid development of technologies increases the possibili-ty of technological enhancements of human beings, e.g., in their cognitive skills or physical fitness. Attitudes towards such enhancements may result in their social acceptance or rejection.PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDUREOne hundred and thirty-nine young Polish adults partici-pated in the study. Participants completed the designed Technological Enhancements Questionnaire (TEQ) and questionnaires to measure values, the scientistic world-view, and the accepted versions of humanism.RESULTSThe study showed a one-dimensional TEQ structure and its satisfactory reliability. Attitudes towards technological enhancements correlated positively with achievement, self-direction in thought, power over resources, the scien-tistic worldview, and the evolutionary version of human-ism. They also correlated negatively with tradition and the liberal version of humanism.CONCLUSIONSThe TEQ questionnaire is a short, reliable tool to measure attitudes towards technological enhancements. This pre-liminary study provided some significant results, but fu-ture work to validate the questionnaire is needed.

M3  - Data study
AB  - Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems and provide a range of goods and services on local to global scales and have become key sites of agricultural development in sub-Saharan Africa. This is the case for East African countries such as Rwanda, where agricultural expansion into wetlands and agricultural intensification are crucial elements of the government's strategy to increase food production and decrease dependence from global food markets. However, spatially explicit information of the location and status of wetlands for informed decision making is lacking or not up to date. In the related research article, we therefore develop a framework comprising the following spatial layers: Delineation, Surface Water Occurrence (SWO), Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) classification and Wetland Use Intensity (WUI). These layers are based on satellite imagery from the European Copernicus Programme and cover the whole of Rwanda. The Delineation is derived from a static Potential Wetlands layer and Sentinel-2 imagery using object-based image analysis (OBIA). The SWO is a per-pixel count of the times a location was detected as flooded using Sentinel-1 imagery. For the LULC classification, an object-based decision tree classifier is applied to Sentinel-2 imagery in Combination with the Delineation layer and the SWO. The WUI layer is based on the Absolute Mean Spectral Dynamics indicator depicting pixel-wise changes in reflectance values in Sentinel-2 bands relevant for wetland vegetation and hydrological dynamics. All layers refer to the year 2017, except for the SWO layer, which covers surface water dynamics from 2014 to 2017. The layers can be used individually or in combination and thus adapted to the different information needs for sustainable wetland management.This dataset contains the Potential Wetlands map based on topographic indices, the Wetland Delineation derived from it, the Surface Water Occurrence layer, the Land Use/Land Cover map, and the Wetland Use Intensity layer. For appropriate map display we provide QGIS layerstyle files associated with these layers.This research was conducted within the project Copernicus-based Detection and Monitoring of tropical Wetlands (DeMo-Wetlands), which was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (grant no. 50EE1537).

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A tower-based global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) experiment is set up in an Arctic wetland environment for investigating the possibility of monitoring wetland inundation and freeze/thaw (FT) dynamics which are additionally impacted by snow on the ground. Effects of inundation, snow cover, and soil FT state on observed GNSS-R signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are analyzed for horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarizations. A simple classification approach is suggested to detect the inundated, frozen, or thawed soil state. A simple forward reflectivity model is formulated to evaluate the influence of snow cover, overlying frozen, or thawed soil, on the reflected GNSS signals. Reflectivity time series are simulated in H- and V-polarizations using in situ observations of the Arctic wetland site. The simulations are used to verify the tower-based observations, which show a significant impact of wet snow on reflectivity during melting conditions in spring. The observed SNR is strongly correlated with the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient. Generally, soil states detected by GNSS-R are in high agreement with ground truth soil states, especially for inundated and frozen soils. Wet snow conditions, however, complicate the correct timing estimation of soil thawing by inducing reflectivities of a similar order as thawing soil. It is recommended that GNSS-R land application models and retrieval algorithms consider snow cover effects to reduce false classification, especially in FT detection. Overall, the outcome of this study is relevant to the upcoming ESA HydroGNSS mission.

TI  - To the construction of the theory and practice of the psychology of immortality: A reflexive-existential approach
T2  - VOPROSY PSIKHOLOGII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes implicit and explicit concepts of human immortality: theosophical, biogenetic, socio-cultural, informational, digital, android. The analysis of axiological and methodological limitations of these concepts leads the author to the conclusion that a psychological concept of immortality is necessary. The possibility of constructing such a concept is based on the achievements of the reflexive psychology of creativity. Answering the question of whether creativity can be the key to immortality, the author describes four existential strategies of a person's life march. The first strategy - "life-giving" - is inherent, as a rule, in the initial stage of human life, when with the help of social and, first of all, educational institutions, the child learns the experience of previous generations of people. The second strategy, which is, in fact, the opposite of the first, is connected with "life exhaustion", when a person, realizing his needs, only spends the physical and mental resources he has accumulated earlier. The third strategy of the life march - "life reproduction" - is the sum of alternately alternating cycles of the first and second strategies. And only the fourth strategy "life creation" - allows a person to overcome the routine and monotony of everyday life, as well as to break the "vicious circle" of the first three strategies. Reflexive and creative efforts of a person, spiritualizing him, compacting, and filling his life with a unique co-existence and existential meaning, make it possible for him to live his own life psychologically endless. This strategy, according to the author of the article, is a possible solution to the problem of human immortality. At the same time, psychology, in the bosom of which the grounds for such a decision have matured, turns from a descriptive-scientific science into a worldview - cultural-paradigm science that sets new horizons of human existence and new opportunities for educational and managerial practices.

T2  - VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study is devoted to the traditional hygiene of the Selkups, one of the small peoples of the North. Selkup hygiene traditions are viewed from two perspectives: through the prism of mythological representations and in the light of their conditioning by the natural environment and historical moment. As a result of the study, it was found that in the traditional worldview of the Selkups, all the excretions and "growths" from the human body, such as feces, sweat, urine, saliva, nails, hair, etc., which, together with the person's attitude to them, form the sphere of household hygiene, were interpreted as the soul / the life principle through which the idea of the cycle of life in the Universe is realized. The mythological interpretation of excreta and "growths" as elements responsible for human vitality is directly reflected in Selkup hygiene traditions. Selkups did not demonstrate hostility to feces and urine on the floor of the dwelling, to sweat that never washed off the body and never washed off clothes, and to saliva on plates wiped by it, but they were afraid of breaking even one of the rules for cutting nails. The formation of hygiene skills, as well as their mythological interpretation, occurred under the influence of the natural environment in which the ancestors of the Selkups lived. The Selkup adaptation to the harsh natural conditions of the North was the maximum possible and did not let the Selkups down for many centuries. Its assessment fell from "relevant" to "unsanitary" when epidemic diseases came to the Selkups along with the Russian colonization, and traditional hygiene could not resist them.

AB  - This study evaluates the ability of S-band SAR data to characterize the biophysical parameters of Mango orchards. The observations from the correlation matrix of NovaSAR-1 parameters and the biophysical parameters indicate that height had the strongest correlation with VV (-0.40) in comparison to the other biophysical parameters. Based on the testing of models, MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) yielded the best RMSE (0.47m) and MAE (0.68m) in the estimation of height with the parameter's Co-pol index and HH backscatter. In the case of DBH, RFR (Random Forest Regression) gave the highest RMSE (0.23m) and MAE (0.05m) with HH and co-pol index. A comparison between the VV backscatter using S-band and C-band data (obtained from Sentinel-1) was also carried out for the mango orchard with S-band data having a higher dynamic range than C-band data.

AB  - We describe the advancement of the classical anomaly detection paradigm to a task-relevant change detection problem. Modern machine learning methods support the development of more sophisticated multi-temporal satellite image analysis. Here, we look at the problem of detecting and distinguishing anthropogenic change from natural change over broad regions around the globe. These tasks are well-suited for machine learning algorithms, however, the creation of large scale annotated satellite imagery datasets with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution is expensive. In this paper, we explore utilizing spatiotemporal self-supervised learning which leverages the natural chronology of the data collection to train generalizable feature extractors for various downstream tasks. This approach is shown to boost downstream performance (+10% F1 score, precision, recall), and reduce training time by 80% for the broad area search problem using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery.

AB  - The AFIT Sensor and Scene Emulation Tool (ASSET) is a physics-based model used to generate synthetic data sets of wide field-of-view (WFOV) electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensors with realistic radiometric properties, noise characteristics, and sensor artifacts. This effort evaluates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNS) trained on samples of real space-based hyperspectral data paired with panchromatic imagery as a method of generating synthetic hyperspectral reflectance data from wide-band imagery inputs to improve the radiometric accuracy of ASSET. Further, the effort demonstrates how these updates will improve ASSET's radiometric accuracy through comparisons to NASA's moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). In order to place the development of synthetic hyperspectral reflectance data in context, the scene generation process implemented in ASSET is also presented in detail.

TI  - AI4SeaIce: Toward Solving Ambiguous SAR Textures in Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Sea Ice Concentration Charting
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatically producing Arctic sea ice charts from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is challenging for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) due to ambiguous backscattering signatures. The number of pixels viewed by the CNN model in the input image used to generate an output pixel, or the receptive field, is important to detect large features or physical objects such as sea ice and correctly classify them. In addition, a noise phenomenon is present in the Sentinel-1 ESA Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) v2.9 SAR data, particularly in subswath transitions, visible as long vertical lines and grained particles resembling small sea ice floes. To overcome these two challenges, we suggest adjusting the receptive field of the popular U-Net CNN architecture used for semantic segmentation. It is achieved by symmetrically adding additional blocks of convolutional, pooling and upsampling layers in the encoder and decoder of the U-Net, constituting an increase in the number of levels. This shows great improvements in the performance and in the homogeneity of predictions. Second, training models on SAR data noise-corrected with an enhanced technique has demonstrated a significant increase in model performance and enabled better predictions in uncertain regions. An eight-level U-Net trained on the alternative noise-corrected SAR data is presented to be capable of correctly predicting many ambiguous SAR signatures and increased the performance by 8.44% points compared with the regular U-Net trained on the ordinary ESA IPF v2.9 noise-corrected SAR data. This is the first installment of this multi-series installment of articles related to AI applied to sea ice (in short AI4SeaIce).

TI  - Optimizing Detection of Lymphatic Invasion in Primary Cutaneous Melanoma With the Use of D2-40 and a Paired Melanocytic Marker
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dual immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with D2-40 and S100 improves detection of lymphatic invasion (LI) in primary cutaneous melanoma. However, limited data exist evaluating this technique using other melanocytic markers, and thus, the optimal marker for detection of LI is unestablished. To address this knowledge gap, a case-control study was performed comparing melanoma specimens from 22 patients with known lymphatic spread (LS) with a control group of 11 patients without LS. Specimens underwent dual IHC staining with D2-40 and MART-1, SOX-10, and S100 to evaluate for LI. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to estimate each stain's accuracy for detection of LI. The LS group was more likely to be >= 65 years (P = 0.04), have a tumor thickness of >= 1 mm (P < 0.01), and have ulcerated tumors (P = 0.02). Detection of LI with D2-40/MART-1 significantly correlated with LS (P = 0.03), and the D2-40/MART-1 stain was most accurate for LI based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under the curve [AUC] 0.705) in comparison with D2-40/SOX-10 (AUC 0.575) and D2-40/S100 (AUC 0.633). These findings suggest that MART-1 may be the optimal melanocytic marker to combine with D2-40 for detection of LI in melanoma. Further studies are needed to determine the utility of routinely performing these stains for histopathologic analysis of melanoma.

TI  - Comparative analysis of main clinical features in melanoma patients with and without sentinel lymph nose biopsy
T2  - ONCOLOGY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is fundamental in the treatment and prognosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma. This study aims to identify differences in baseline clinical characteristics and survival of patients with melanoma with and without a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) performed.Material and methods. In 2018, a retrospective study of 151 patients with malignant melanoma (MM) was conducted. The patients were hospitalized at the Second Clinic of University Hospital - Pleven, from 2012 to 2017. The patients were divided into two groups: Group A included 58 (38.4%) patients with SLNB performed; Group B included 93 (61.6%) patients who did not undergo SLNB. A double-detection method was used while performing SLNB.Results. The incidence of achromatic malignant melanoma is significantly higher in patients without SLNB (12 or 12.9%) than in patients with SLNB (2 or 3.4%) -chi(2) = 3.796, df = 1, p = 0.051. Of all 151 patients in the study, 46 died, representing 30.5% of patients with melanoma. The mortality rate was higher in the patients without SLNB (32.3% vs. 27.6% in Group A). However, the differences in the two groups are not statistically significant.Conclusions. Patients with achromatic melanoma have significantly fewer sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies performed because of a late diagnosis. Most of our patients are diagnosed at a later stage when lymphatic metastases are already present, which leads to a significant increase in lymph node dissections performed. There is no significant difference in mortality and survival in the SLNB and non-SLNB groups.

TI  - Evaluation and Correlation of Sentinel-2 NDVI and NDMI in Kyiv (2017-2021)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the last 20 years researchers have tried to create new approaches of managing urban ecosystem by using remote sensing methods. The authors estimated the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and moisture index (NDMI) indices of Kyiv and propose an approach which can be used for estimation vegetation of other cities. The aim of the study was to assess the indicators of NDVI and NDMI in Kyiv for the last 5 years. The authors consider the NDVI index as an important ecostabilizing component of the urban ecosystem, as well as an indicator of the well-being citizens in a modern city. The study used space images of the Sentinel-2 satellite system with resolution of 10x10 m and 10x20 m. The images were decrypted using the Sentinel Hub platform which updates the data-base daily. The paper presents the results of correlation analysis using Statistica-6.0 software and demonstrate the close relationship (r = 0.73, r(2) = 0.55) between NDVI and NDMI. Thus, the statistical results of the study confirm a strong correlation between photosynthetic activity of plants and indicators of their water content by satellite imagery which allows using modern satellite technologies to assess the functional state of the urban vegetation. The changes in the length of active vegetative growth period were identified by NDVI and NDMI. The results of the research expand the directions of the methods of monitoring the condition of the urban vegetation cover in the aspect of applied landscape research.

AB  - Continental-scale land cover information is essential to furthering our understanding of the terrestrial environment, atmosphere and climate change. Several global land cover products have been released in recent years but they typically do not include Antarctica. The lack of land cover data in Antarctica is concerning because mountain glaciers and icecaps there have been losing mass at a rate well above the global average, leading to expansion of proglacial regions. Proglacial regions comprise transient land cover types with high rates of geomorphological activity that delivers sediment into the Southern Ocean and supports its rich biodiversity. With Antarctic mountain glaciers and icecaps projected to lose more mass in the coming decades, and with permafrost projected to degrade too, it is timely to establish a baseline land cover dataset for Antarctica with which future classifications can be compared. Here, we present the code used to classify Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images in six proglacial regions of Antarctica at 30 m resolution, with an overall accuracy of 77.0 % for proglacial land classes. We conducted this classification using an unsupervised K-means clustering approach, which circumvented the need for training data and was highly effective at picking up key land classes, such as vegetation, water, and different sedimentary surfaces.

TI  - Data Mining on the Crawl Frontier: Metaphor in Cybernetic Capitalism
T2  - LAW TEXT CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay explores how the intangible operations of networked computing-machines are frequently described through tangible metaphors. After looking at their origins in military bureaucracies, this analysis steps through the material operations of Google's famous search-engine, noting the various metaphors that are used to make sense of it, and the way they frequently draw on colonial and extractive imagery. I give an account of the company's rise to power, emphasising how their immense profits became possible because of their control of intellectual property rights, as well as over the 'terms and conditions'. Across this critical analysis, I show how these metaphors embody the dominant worldview of cybernetic capitalism and demonstrate how they serve as ways to cope with the extreme abstractions increasingly enmesh us.

AB  - The paper proposes a multi-criteria and data driven fusion approach whose semantics can be explained in terms of attitude towards decisions. It is exemplified to assess environmental status from remote sensing images in order to identify hot spot of critical situations and anomalies induced by wildfires, floods, desertification, erosion etc. by fusing multiple factors defined by experts knowledge. The fusion function is an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator, whose behaviour is here characterized by degrees of pessimism and democracy. The paper proposes to explain the semantics of the fusion function learnt from few ground truth data available, i.e., the OWA operator, by computing its degrees of pessimism/optimism and democracy/monarchy, which are defined as semantic interpretations of both orness and dispersions respectively. Pessimism indicates if the fused map is more prone to commission (overestimation) or omission (underestimation) errors, while democracy indicates how many factors contribute to the generation of the map. The approach is exemplified to map the flooded areas from remote sensing by considering different models based on distinct spectral indexes and domain experts.

AB  - The Albula Region in the canton Grisons in Switzerland is prone to a large number of landslides. In order to spatially estimate the surface deformation of these phenomena, we performed a multi-temporal interferometric analysis on point (i.e., persistent scatterers) phases by jointly exploiting ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 ScanSAR and StripMap data acquired along the same orbit. Our results indicate a widespread presence of large-scale rock slope instabilities with linear LOS displacement rates in the range of a few cm/year. In comparison with a PSI Sentinel-1 analysis, valid information is retrieved with L-Band also over forests, where only very limited information is available at C-Band. Over built-up regions and for alpine areas above the tree line, the density of points is higher from Sentinel-1 than from ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 because of the moderate resolution of the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 ScanSAR data.

AB  - The definition of a methodology for estimating suitable areas for new renewable sources needs to identify possible indexes that describe the fields. One interesting index is the Evapotranspiration (ET). This is usually determined from hydrological models, which however do not provide a real-time estimation. So, new different procedures have been tested to compute it, for example, the use of Satellite images. The Sen-ET project allows using the Copernicus data to compute daily evapotranspiration. An improvement in the automatization of methodology is presented within this work. The model is tested in two different Italian regions with different climates and geographical conditions, considering also different months to study the results in different seasons over the same area. Results are then compared with those obtained in the same areas and period with two hydrological models (BIGBANG and GlobWat). The different outputs are analysed according to their spatial resolutions and respect to agricultural land cover classes. The comparison between Sen-ET evapotranspiration maps and hydrological model results has shown, in the analysed areas, relevant differences and suggests interesting future insights for continuous monitoring of land subject to water stress.

AB  - Deep learning methods exhibit outstanding performance in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image interpretation tasks. However, these are black box models that limit the comprehension of their predictions. Therefore, to meet this challenge, we have utilized explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for the SAR image classification task. Specifically, we trained state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks for each polarization format on OpenSARUrban dataset and then investigate eight explanation methods to analyze the predictions of the CNN classifiers of SAR images. These XAI methods are also evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively which shows that Occlusion achieves the most reliable interpretation performance in terms of MaxSensitivity but with a low-resolution explanation heatmap. The explanation results provide some insights into the internal mechanism of black-box decisions for SAR image classification.

TI  - Mapping forest disturbance and recovery for ecological security improvement on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: A case study from Three Parallel Rivers Region
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is also necessary to enhance ecological security shelter in the Three Parallel Rivers Region (TPRR) with the Nu-Salween, Lancang-Mekong and Jinsha Rivers which is the key area of biodiversity hotspot on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Mapping spatio-temporal patterns of forest disturbance and recovery is prerequisites for planning effective policies by policy-makers to maintain local sustainable development. Multi-source remote sensing data is useful for long-term spatial analysis of forest disturbance and recovery. We used LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE), sample migration and random forest classification methods to classify forest types and to detect forest changes (disturbance and recovery) from 1990 to 2020 in the TPRR. Results showed that: (1) total area of forest disturbance was 2107.0 km(2), accounting for 8.0% of the forest area in 1990. Since 2000, except in 2006 and 2010, the area of forest recovery was always higher than the area of forest disturbance; (2) proportion of forest disturbance in Honglaxueshan national nature reserve (HLXS NNR), Baimaxueshan national nature reserve (BMXS NNR), Laojunshan scenic spots (LJS SS), Yunlongtianchi national nature reserve (YLTC NNR), Yunling provincial nature reserve (YL PNR) and outside of protected areas (OPA) was 3.0%, 6.1%, 5.5%, 10%, 15.6% and 8.3%, respectively. Percentage of forest recovery was 6.2% in the whole study area, and 6.7% outside of protected areas. Proportion of forest recovery was 1.7%, 2.3%, 3.3%, 12.4% and 10.0% in HLXS NNR, BMXS NNR, LJS SS, YL PNR and YLTC NNR, respectively; (3) duration of forest disturbance was mainly concentrated in 1-3 years with a total area of 1632.9 km(2), accounted for 77.5% of total area of forest disturbance. Duration of forest recovery was less volatile which was mainly concentrated in 2-13 years, with an area of 957.2 km(2), accounted for 58.8% of total area of forest recovery; (4) recovery area of pine forest was the largest, with an area of 850.2 km(2), accounted for 52.2% of the total forest recovery area in the study area. Based on mapping forest distribution and recovery, this research can support the decision-making of local governments on ecological conservation and is of benefit to ecological security improvement in the TPRR.

TI  - Attention-Based and Staged Iterative Networks for Pansharpening of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The pansharpening method combines complementary features from panchromatic (PAN) images and multispectral (MS) images to provide high-resolution MS images. Therefore, how to extract the features completely and reconstruct the image with high quality is the key link to obtain the ideal fusion image. We propose an attention-based and staged iterative network (ASIN) framework, which considers each subnetwork of the iterative network as a multistage process of pansharpening and carries out feature extraction and image reconstruction in each stage. Using the advantages of an iterative network for cross-stage depth features for the hierarchical extraction of refined features of MS images and PAN images for image reconstruction, we use the large kernel attention (LKA) module and the cascaded asymmetric coupling representation module to build the framework for feature extraction and the attention fusion module (AFM) to fuse the features of PAN and MS in the image reconstruction stage. LKA has channel and spatial adaptability, as well as strong long-range dependency establishment capability, which makes the feature extraction more complete. Asymmetric coupled representation module (ACRM) outputs refined spectral and spatial features by learning the hybrid correlation of MS and PAN images. AFM effectively utilizes the spectral and spatial features of the input, enabling the network to reduce information loss and retain important information. On the QuickBird (QB), WorldView-2 (WV2), and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) datasets, the superior performance of our method over the contrasting methods is demonstrated by quantitative comparison and qualitative analysis.

AB  - Solar irradiance is a crucial parameter that impacts the accuracy of photovoltaic (PV) generation prediction. However, due to the equipment deployment limitations and malfunction factors, accurate irradiance data with sufficient historical accumulation and wide spatial distribution are usually unavailable. Therefore, satellite remote sensing shows its unique significance as an additional stable irradiance observation source. This paper develops a feature importance analysis-based solar irradiance mapping model to calculate ground solar irradiance only using satellite data. In this paper, the K-means method is employed to classify the weather condition. The correlation of all channels data of FY4 satellite with the solar radiation of PV site is analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient under different sky conditions. The XGBoost feature important algorithm is applied to analyze the importance of different channel features, which optimizes and determines the input of the mapping model. The gradient boost regression model (GBR) is chosen as the mapping model to calculate solar irradiance with the combination channels satellite data obtained according to feature important analysis. The simulation results show that the proposed model performs best compared with other regression methods.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 37th International Conference on Pharmacoepidemiology and Therapeutic Risk Management
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration increasingly uses administrative databases to conduct surveillance of medications used during pregnancy. To assess adverse fetal effects, administrative records must be linked between the mother and infant. The Sentinel Initiative's Mother-Infant Linkage Table provides a large cohort of linked deliveries from national, regional, and public insurance claims in the United States for the US Food and Drug Administration to conduct surveillance.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe baseline health conditions and prescription medication use during pregnancy in cohorts of women with a live-birth delivery linked and not linked to an infant.STUDY DESIGN: Live-birth deliveries in women aged 10 to 54 years with at least 391 days of medical and drug coverage before delivery were identified in the Sentinel Mother-Infant Linkage Table from 2000 to 2019. Two cohorts were created for analysis: deliveries linked to infant records (linked deliveries, n=2,320,805) and deliveries unable to be linked to an infant (not-linked deliveries, n=504,785). Baseline health conditions, pregnancy history, healthcare utilization, and pregnancy conditions were defined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, diagnosis and procedure codes. Medication exposure was identified in a 90-day prepregnancy period and in each trimester.RESULTS: Few notable differences were observed between the linked and not-linked deliveries except for maternal age and preterm birth; the not-linked cohort was 3.4 years younger on average and more likely to have a preterm delivery. At baseline among the linked deliveries, the most common conditions were depression and anxiety (5.2% each), acquired hypothyroidism (5.0%), pain conditions (3.9%), and asthma (2.8%). Among linked deliveries, 6.9% had evidence of gestational diabetes mellitus, 3.9% had gestational hypertension, and 4.5% had preeclampsia or eclampsia. The most commonly used medications during pregnancy in the linked deliveries were antibacterials (41.6%) and antiemetics (21.5%); similar medication use patterns were observed in the not-linked cohort. Age trends were observed for some medication groups; anti-infectives, pain medications, and antiemetics were more common in younger mothers, whereas endocrine medications were more common in older mothers.CONCLUSION: Similarities between the linked and not-linked cohorts suggested that the ability to link mother and infant records is not influenced by maternal health status. In the linked cohort, the prevalence of specific pregnancy complications and medication use were similar to previously reported national estimates. Some baseline comorbidities, such as obesity and smoking, may be underestimated in the Sentinel Mother-Infant Linkage.

TI  - Neighborhood dynamics of urban expansion based on morphological spatial pattern analysis and geospatial techniques: a case study of the Colombo metropolitan area, Sri Lanka
T2  - ASIAN GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined neighborhood dynamics of urban expansion based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and geospatial techniques in the Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMA) of Sri Lanka from 1992 to 2014. Traditionally, urban expansion has been detected using absolute land use/cover (LULC) terms and landscape patterns (i.e. urban and non-urban). However, non-traditional characterization of urban expansion with neighborhood rules provides a better understanding of urban transformation which is essential to urban planners and managers. This study therefore used MSPA of Landsat images (1992, 2001 and 2014) to classify and detect the expansion of urban land uses based on neighborhood rules. Urban expansion intensity and topologies (infill, extension, and leapfrog) were also employed for further analysis. The results show that the CMA experienced rapid urban expansion, recording a 288% increase in the total urban footprint from 1992 to 2014. The annual urban expansion intensity was higher during the 2000s (1.45%) than during the 1990s (0.95%). Urban expansion topological analysis revealed that leapfrog was the most dominant pattern throughout the study's temporal extent. An outward infill expansion from the city center was observed, while urban extension exhibited a ribbon-type development along the main transport corridors and coastal belts. The patterns and intensity of urban expansion in the CMA are directly linked to the economic, demographics, and political changes in Sri Lanka. Overall, the study provides an improved understanding of urban expansion in the CMA and offers directions that could be considered in future urban planning initiatives.

TI  - Deep Learning Model for Enhanced Crop Identification From Landsat 8 Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning is a powerful state-of-the-art technique for image processing, including remote sensing images. This paper describes a multilevel deep learning based crop type identification system that targets land cover and crop type classification from multi-temporal multisource satellite imagery. The proposed crop type identification is based on unsupervised neural network that is used for optical imagery segmentation and missing data restoration due to clouds and shadows, and an ensemble of supervised neural networks. The main part of this multilayer deep network with self-organizing maps and atmospheric correction is an ensemble of CNNs. The proposed system is applied for crop identification using Landsat-8 time-series and implemented with different sized vector data, parcel boundary. Aided with self-organizing maps and atmospheric correction for pre-processing doing both pixel-based and parcel-based analysis, this proposed crop type identification system allowed the authors to achieve the overall classification accuracy of nearly 95% for three different time periods.

AB  - High-resolution aerial photographs of Arctic region are a great source for different sea ice feature recognition, which are crucial to validate, tune, and improve climate models. Melt ponds on the surface of melting Arctic sea ice are of particular interest as they are sensitive and valuable indicators and are proxy to the processes in the Arctic climate system. Manual analysis of this remote sensing data is extremely difficult and time-consuming due to the complex shapes and unpredictable boundaries of the melt ponds, and that leads to the necessity for automatizing the processes. In this study, we propose a robust and efficient automatic method for melt pond region segmentation and boundary extraction from high-resolution aerial photographs. The proposed algorithm is based on a swin transformer U-Net in which we introduce novel cross-channel attention mechanisms into the decoder design. The framework operates with optical data and allows for classifying imagery into four classes, i.e., sea ice/snow, open water, melt pond, and submerged ice. We use aerial photographs collected during the Healy-Oden Trans Arctic Expedition over Arctic sea ice in the summer season of 2005 as test data. The experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for precise automatic extraction of melt pond geometry, and it can also be extended for other optical data sources that involve melt ponds. The approach has a promising potential to be used to analyze melt ponds' corresponding changes between years.

AB  - Global warming affects forests and their ecology. Diversity in the forest is a buffer that reduces the damage due to global warming. Mixed forests are ecologically more valuable as versatile habitats and are effective in preventing landslides. In Korea, most forests were created by simple afforestation with trees of evergreen species. Typically, evergreen trees are shallow-rooted, and deciduous trees are deep-rooted. Mixed forest tree roots grip the soil effectively, which reduces the occurrence of landslides. Therefore, improving the distribution of tree types is essential to reduce damage due to global warming. For this improvement, the investigation of tree types of the forest is needed. However, determining the tree type distribution of forests that are spread over wide areas is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This study suggests effective methods for determining the distribution of tree types in a forest that is spread across a relatively wide area. Using normalized difference vegetation index and RGB images from unmanned aerial vehicles, each evergreen and deciduous tree, and grassland area can be distinguished. The distinguished image determines the distribution of tree type. This method is effective compared to directly determining the tree type distribution in the forest by the use of manpower. The data from these methods could be applied to plan a mixed forest or to prepare for future damage due to global warming.

TI  - The Concept MOTHER OF GOD in the Ukrainian and Polish Linguistic Worldviews

M3  - Article
AB  - This article brings a comparative analysis of the concept MOTHER OF GOD (Bohorodytsia/Bogurodzica) as represented in the Ukrainian and Polish linguistic worldviews. Basing on the data of different types of dictionaries of the Ukrainian and Polish languages, folklore texts and artistic discourse, the study identifies the means of its verbalisation in Ukrainian and Polish and their similar and distinctive features. The results of lexicographic analysis indicate that the definitions of this concept in the two languages are the closest in content in the categories Bozha Matir and Matka Boza 'the name of Christ's Mother in Christian faith'. In modern explanatory dictionaries of the Ukrainian language the lexeme Bohorodytsia 'Mother of God' is primary, neutral, while the dictionaries of the Polish language list a combination of lexemes Matka Boza in this function.In Ukrainian and Polish ethnocultures Bohorodytsia / Matka Boza means 'caring, loving mother, mother of all people, defender of the disadvantaged'. The analysis of Ukrainian and Polish artistic discourse revealed the metaphorical use of lexical units Bohorodytsia/Bogurodzica for denoting the concept MOTHER OF GOD, reflecting the ethnocultural specifics of the individual characteristics of the writers' worldview.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - Bioluminescence (BL) imaging is a powerful non-invasive imaging modality widely used in a broad range of biological disciplines for many types of measurements. The applications of BL imaging in biomedicine are diverse, including tracking bacterial progression, research on gene expression patterns, monitoring tumor cell growth/regression or treatment responses, determining the location and proliferation of stem cells, and so on. It is particularly valuable when studying tissues at depths of 1 to 2cm in mouse models during preclinical research. Here we describe the protocols for the therapeutic evaluation of a lymphatic drug delivery system (LDDS) using an in vivo BL imaging system (IVIS) for the treatment of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The LDDS is a method that directly injects anticancer drugs into sentinel LNs (SLNs) and delivers them to their downstream LNs. In the protocol, we show that metastases in the proper axillary LN (PALN) are induced by the injection of luciferase-expressing tumor cells into the subiliac LN (SiLN) of MXH10/Mo-lpr/lpr (MXH10/Mo/lpr) mice. 5-FU is injected using the LDDS into the accessory axillary LN (AALN) to treat tumor cells in the PALN after the tumor cell growth is confirmed in the PALN. The tumor growth and therapeutic effects are evaluated by IVIS. This method can be used to evaluate tumor growth and efficacy of anticancer drugs/particles, radiotherapy, surgery, and/or a combination of these methods in various experimental procedures in the oncology field.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study documents the atmospheric conditions and the development of a tornadic supercell in the Czech Republic, which occurred on the early evening on 24 June 2021. I used the data from the ERA5-reanalysis, vertical atmospheric sounding, synoptic map, and a Sentinel-2 satellite image to determinate the tornado route. As a result of the analysis, it can be concluded that the development of this tornadic supercell was caused by high CAPE values, amounting to around 5,000 J.kg(-1) , 0-6 km AGL wind shear 30 m.s(-1), storm-relative helicity with values of 150 m(2).s(-2) and a wavy atmospheric front. The tornado occurred around 19:30 local time (1730 UTC) in the town Hruk and moved north-east, reaching the town Hodonin. Based on satellite image derived from Sentinel-2, the widest point of the tornado reached 70 meters; it traveled a distance of about 20 kilometers and had a force of EF3/T5 on the Fujita/TORRO scale. As a result of this event, 6 people lost their lives, 200 people were seriously injured, and hundreds of buildings and cars were destroyed. Further studies on strong thunderstorm incidents in Europe are necessary for their better understanding and prediction.

TI  - Verbalisation of the Concept <i>(sic)</i> 'love' in Modern Ukrainian Songs
T2  - STUDIA Z FILOLOGII POLSKIEJ I SLOWIANSKIEJ
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to the verbalisation of the concept (sic) `love' in modern Ukrainian songs. The study pinpoints specific means of its linguistic expression (lexemes, phrases, descriptive constructions, English words), determines its main characteristics, and identifies the influence of attendant archaic beliefs and convictions on the poetics of modern Ukrainian songs. The aim of the study is to analyse the semantics and means of verbalising the concept "love", to establish its key features, and to determine the specifics of the use of nuclear lexemes and peripheral language units to describe it. The actual material of the study were the lyrics of Ukrainian songs from the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. They were analysed using the following methods: non-participant observation, descriptive method, contextual analysis, statistical analysis.In modern Ukrainian songs, the nouns (sic), (sic) `love' and the verbs (sic), (sic) `to love', as well as the English lexeme love, are used very rarely, both in the lyrics and in the titles. Their authors prefer metaphorical descriptive constructions in order to avoid banality and obscure the main sem.: ` deep heartfelt affection for a person of the opposite sex'. At the same time, most of these constructions are complex. In " female" songs, the authors appeal to (1) mythological or archaic views, comparing a woman to magical beings endowed with extraordinary powers; (2) internal misogyny. "Male" songs, in turn, mostly tend to heroise the characters they feature.

TI  - Estimation of Spouted Hot Mudflow Current Using Continuity Equation and DInSAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several techniques have been proposed to observe long-term land surface deformation using phase information of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), for example, interferometric SAR (InSAR), differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR), permanent scatterer interferometric SAR (PS-InSAR), and small baseline subset (SBAS) using images of JERS-1, ALOS-1/2, ENVISAT, ERS-1/2, RADARSAT-1/2, TerraSAR-X, SENTINEL-1A/B, and so on. These methods have also been employed to investigate land deformation and the impact caused by the hot mudflow accident at the study area of regency of Sidoarjo, East Java province, Indonesia, where this disaster happened on May 29, 2006, and has been flowing until now. But these methods only derived the land surface deformation and did not figure geological situation in the Earth, especially the current of geological material outflow. Therefore, this research proposed the continuity equation of the law of conservation of material to estimate the current of material outflow to investigate the impact of the land surface disaster in the study area. The information of vertical deformation or subsidence is derived by the consecutive DInSAR using multispaceborne SAR and substituted into the proposed equation to estimate the volume and current of hot mud outflow. The differential global positioning system (GPS) data collected since 2006 were employed to validate the analysis result of land surface deformation, and the root means square (rms) error is 0.46 m. The result obtained the current at the center of the study area at the beginning of the mudflow period was 6800 m(3)/day and decreased from 2018 until now that matched well with the local reports. The proposed equation could also be applied for observation of land deformation, volcano, fault activity, underground water, and so on, using remote sensing technologies.

AB  - Since frequent severe droughts are lengthening the dry season in the Amazon Rainforest, it is important to detect wildfires promptly and forecast possible spread for effective suppression response. Current wildfire detection models are not versatile enough for the low-technology conditions of South American hot spots. This deep learning study first trains a Fully Convolutional Neural Network on Landsat 8 images of Ecuador and the Galapagos, using Green and Short-wave Infrared bands to predict pixel-level binary fire masks. This model achieves a 0.962 validation F2 score and a 0.932 F2 score on test data from Guyana and Suriname. Afterward, image segmentation is conducted on the Cirrus band using K-Means Clustering to simplify continuous pixel values into three discrete classes representing differing degrees of cirrus cloud contamination. Three additional Convolutional Neural Networks are trained to conduct a sensitivity analysis measuring the effect of simplified features on model accuracy and train time. The Experimental model trained on the segmented cirrus images provides a statistically significant decrease in train time compared to the Control model trained on raw cirrus images, without compromising binary accuracy. This proof of concept reveals that feature engineering can improve the performance of wildfire detection models by lowering computational expense.

TI  - Similarity Weight Learning: A New Spatial and Temporal Satellite Image Fusion Framework
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion is a topical framework for solving the mutual restricted problem between the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite images. We pioneer an approach to replace similarity measurement steps in spatiotemporal fusion algorithms with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), building a bridge between weight function-based models and the learning-based models. Specifically, we propose a nonlocal form that separates the relational computation part from the value representation part, and construct the CNN-based similarity weight learning block for learning normalized weights. The block can be inserted into spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) to replace the manually designed weight calculation rules common in weight function-based methods, or into the CNN model StfNet to better utilize neighboring high-resolution images. The trained model outputs a high-resolution prediction from each base date image pair. The final result is a combination of the two predictions. In this regard, we propose the standard deviation-based weights to combine two prediction results. Four experiments are performed on Landsat-Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image pairs to determine the following: 1) the performance of the model at the target training date; 2) the generalization of the model in the target training time period; and 3) the generalization of the model at different dates and different geographical locations, each considering the different cases of giving one and two pairs of known images. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the similarity weight learning block and standard deviation-based weights. Among them, STARFM with the similarity weight learning block exhibits strong generalization, which testifies to the practical value of our model.

TI  - On the Use of Ocean Surface Doppler Velocity for Oceanic Front Extraction From Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic front extraction from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is of great significance to the study of marine ecosystems. At present, the methods for oceanic front extraction are usually based on SAR intensity images, which treat oceanic fronts as edge-like features in the SAR images. However, affected by radar parameters and sea state, sometimes, oceanic front signatures may not be clearly visible in the SAR intensity images. Therefore, existing methods are limited. In order to solve this problem, a method combining intensity and Doppler information for oceanic front extraction is proposed. Using Chinese Gaofen-3 single-look complex (SLC) data, three cases where oceanic front signatures are clearly visible, partially visible, and extremely weak in the SAR intensity images are investigated, which demonstrate how the Doppler velocity gradient across a front can be leveraged to enhance the extraction of oceanic fronts from SAR data. The results show that the Doppler data, as supplementary information, not only can complement the oceanic fronts extracted from SAR intensity images, but also can be used as a reference for the oceanic fronts extracted from SAR intensity images.

AB  - The capacity of L-band microwave radiometers to observe salinity over coastal waters and produce satisfactory salinity fields remains limited, because of contamination from radio frequency interference (RFI). The objective of this study was to explore the potential of MODIS to derive sea surface salinity (SSS) for the coastal waters in the Bohai Sea. This study developed two linear regression algorithms for the retrieval of summer and winter SSS of coastal waters using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) products, together with in situ SSS measurements from the Bohai Sea. Evaluation using independent in situ measurements showed that the root mean square error and R-2 between the in situ SSS measurements and predicted SSS in summer were 0.20 psu and 0.76, and were 0.40 psu and 0.64 in winter, respectively.

TI  - A Band Divide-and-Conquer Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The nonoverlapped spectrum range between low spatial resolution (LR) hyperspectral (HS) and high spatial resolution (HR) multispectral (MS) images has been a fundamental but challenging problem for MS/HS fusion. The spectrum of HS data is generally 400x2013;2500 nm, and the spectrum of MS data is generally 400x2013;900 nm; how to obtain the high-fidelity HR HS fused image within the whole spectrum of 400x2013;2500 nm? In this article, we proposed a band divide-and-conquer framework (BDCF) to solve the problem, by comprehensively considering spectral fidelity, spatial enhancement, and computational efficiency. First, the spectral bands of HS were divided into overlapped and nonoverlapped bands according to the spectral response between HS and MS. Then, a novel improved component substitution (CS)-based method by combing neural network was proposed to fuse the overlapped bands of LR HS. Then, a mapping-based method with the neural network was presented to construct the complicated nonlinear relationship between overlapped and nonoverlapped bands of the original LR HS data. The trained network was mapped to the fused overlapped HR HS bands to estimate the nonoverlapped HR HS bands. Experimental results on two simulated data sets and two realistic data sets of Gaofen (GF)-5 LR HS, GF-1 MS, and Sentinel-2A MS show that the proposed BDCF has superior performance in both high spectral fidelity and sharp spatial details, and it obtained competitive fusion behaviors compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, BDCF has relatively higher computational efficiency than optimal solution-based methods and deep learning-based fusion methods.

The proposed network employs building footprints from GIS data and exploits the location relationship between a building's footprint and its bounding box, enabling fast computation. Experimental results over Rotterdam show that the proposed network can reduce the computation cost significantly while keeping the height accuracy of individual buildings compared to a Faster R-CNN based method.

TI  - CG-Net: Conditional GIS-Aware Network for Individual Building Segmentation in VHR SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object retrieval and reconstruction from very-high-resolution (VHR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are of great importance for urban SAR applications, yet highly challenging due to the complexity of SAR data. This article addresses the issue of individual building segmentation from a single VHR SAR image in large-scale urban areas. To achieve this, we introduce building footprints from geographic information system (GIS) data as a complementary information and propose a novel conditional GIS-aware network (CG-Net). The proposed model learns multilevel visual features and employs building footprints to normalize the features for predicting building masks in the SAR image. We validate our method using a high-resolution spotlight TerraSAR-X image collected over Berlin. Experimental results show that the proposed CG-Net effectively brings improvements with variant backbones. We further compare two representations of building footprints, namely, complete building footprints and sensor-visible footprint segments, for our task, and conclude that the use of the former leads to better segmentation results. Moreover, we investigate the impact of inaccurate GIS data on our CG-Net, and this study shows that CG-Net is robust against positioning errors in the GIS data. In addition, we propose an approach of ground truth generation of buildings from an accurate digital elevation model (DEM), which can be used to generate large-scale SAR image data sets. The segmentation results can be applied to reconstruct 3-D building models at level-of-detail (LoD) 1, which is demonstrated in our experiments.

AB  - Many remarkable works have been proposed to deal with distortions problems in image fusion to date. However, the spectral distortion and the spatial distortion cannot always be well addressed at the same time. To deal with this, we propose an Adaptive Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) to efficiently embed an Adaptive Detail Injection (ADI) module at different scales. Feature-domain injection gains are proposed in the ADI module to adaptively modulate spatial information and guide a refined detail injection. Furthermore, we propose a texture loss function to further guide our model to learn detail perception in each band. Experiments on QuickBird and GaoFen-1 datasets show that our method achieves superior performance and produces visually pleasing fusion images. Our code is available at https://github.com/yisun98/AFPN.

AB  - Two linear regression algorithms were developed for the retrieval of summer and winter sea surface salinity (SSS) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) products, together with in situ SSS measurements from the Bohai Sea. The proposed models were applied to MODIS monthly 4km Rrs data to study SSS variations of the Bohai Sea during 2003-2018. The coastal waters in Laizhou Bay, Bohai Bay, and Liaodong Bay were found to be fresher than in the Qinhuangdao sea area, Central Bohai Sea, and Bohai Strait. The SSS values in winter in the Bohai Sea were >31.00 psu and <31.50 psu as a whole. There is a rising trend of SSS in the coastal areas of the Bohai Sea, especially in the Liao River estuary, northern Weihe River estuary, northeast Luan River estuary and in the north part of ancient yellow river course.

TI  - Decameter Cropland LAI/FPAR Estimation From Sentinel-2 Imagery Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) products at regional and global scales have already been extensively and routinely generated from medium-resolution sensors. However, there is a lack of high-resolution LAI/FPAR product, which is especially essential for crop growth and drought monitoring of cropland in patches. This article proposes a processing framework for the derivation of decameter cropland LAI and FPAR in the Northern China plain from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data with a random forest (RF) algorithm by exploiting the capabilities of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The training database is generated from the spatially aggregated Sentinel-2 surface reflectance and the corresponding Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI/FPAR product over homogeneous cropland, and the training samples are strictly filtered for the best quality. RF is then trained over the processed Sentinel-2 surface reflectance and the filtered MODIS LAI/FPAR under two input groups-one group is for Sentinel-2 spectral bands of 10-m resolution only, and the other group supplements the Sentinel-2 red-edge (RE) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of 20-m resolution. Extensive comparisons and validation are carried out, and they demonstrate that the new method can generate spatial and temporal consistent LAI/FPAR with MODIS at high spatial resolution. The retrieval accuracy is slightly better for 20-m input groups than that for 10-m input groups, confirming the value of RE and/or SWIR in cropland LAI/FPAR estimate. This article also demonstrates that GEE is a suitable high-performance processing tool for high-resolution biophysical variables estimation.

AB  - Mining cities are an essential part of China's urban agglomerations, and as mining cities continue to develop, ecological and environmental pollution has become a primary problem. In the present study, the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieval of major mining urban agglomerations in China from the Gaofen-1 satellite data. Then a new hybrid model based on CTM (chemical transport model) Transport Model 5 (TM5) and GTWR (Geographic Time-Weighted Regression model) is proposed for PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentration estimation. According to the different transformation stages and urban structure of mining cities, the temporal and spatial analysis of particulate matter characteristics is carried out in mining urban agglomerations. The estimated result for PM2.5 is verified at ground stations with R-2 of 0.956 and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 10.377 mu g/m(3). Moreover, the estimated result for PM10 is verified at ground stations with R-2 of 0.926 and RMSE of 16.669 mu g/m(3). The results indicate that PM2.5 and PM10 have distinct spatial and temporal distribution patterns as Chinese mining cities are undergoing different types of transformation processes.

AB  - With the repetition of mucilage event, which is triggered by many different anthropogenic, climatic and microbiological factors, in the Marmara Sea in 2021, the importance of water quality in the seas has come to the fore again. To present the spatial distribution of the mucilage, a feasibility study has been carried out with point-based water quality measurements and remote sensing data. In-situ measurements are collected routinely within the scope of the Integrated Marine Pollution Monitoring Program (DEN-IZ) which was conducted in cooperation with the Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey - Marmara Research Center (TUBITAK-MAM). In this preliminary study, 16 in-situ measurements, 5 of which were taken from water containing mucilage, on 29 April 2021 in the Gulf of Gemlik were used. Then, univariate regression analyzes were performed in two different scenarios (i.e. 5 mucilage points and all in-situ points) with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and in-situ water quality measurements for 2 different parameters (i.e. chlorophyll-a - Chl-a) and turbidity). According to R-2 and accuracy assessment measures (f- and t- statistics etc.), the most suitable models were determined for two scenarios and two parameters. Finally, the performances of the selected models were tested with 2 different in-situ measurements and satellite images (dated 22 and 27 April) taken from dates close to the data set used; and it was concluded that the models created with 16 points were successful for both Chl-a and turbidity estimation for this preliminary study.

M3  - Article
AB  - The author considers the layer of the 17th - early 18th centuries Mongolian place names presented in the written monument Dayicing ulus-un mongyul-un mayad qauli (True Records of the Mongols of the Qing Empire), published in the old-written Mongolian language in six volumes in Hohhot (China) in 2013. The considered monument of written culture contains a colossal amount of information of various kinds and touches upon a wide range of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, political, social, and religious aspects of the life of the Mongols. The study of such works is valuable in that they represent ancient material reflecting the history, peculiarities of language and literary thought, and the mindset of the peoples of the past. The semantic study of the Mongolian place names attested in the studied document indicates that a developed system of geographic terms which has come down to our days, has already been present in the 17th - early 18th centuries. It was largely motivated by the physical and geographical characteristics of the area. A particular feature of the toponymy of that period is the absence of memorial names that appeared in Mongolia in the first half of the 20th century and reflect the trends of new views on public life. In terms of structure, these toponyms are notable for almost complete absence of verb stems, including iterative and Present-Past participle forms that serve as attributes in the modern Mongolian toponymy. Analyzing the ways of rendering Mongolian complex toponyms in Chinese, the author notes that the use of transcription shows the established character of the toponym, while the use of Manchu geographical terms testifies to its optional character. The system of place names the work contains, holds significant cultural meanings and associations that are characteristic of the national worldview.

AB  - Ocean salinity affects ocean circulation on a global scale and low salinity water around coastal areas often has an impact on aquaculture and fisheries. Microwave satellite sensors (e.g., Soil Moisture Active Passive [SMAP]) have provided sea surface salinity (SSS) based on the dielectric characteristics of water associated with SSS and sea surface temperature (SST). In this study, a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)-based model for generating high resolution SSS from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data was proposed, having machine learning-based improved SMAP SSS by Jang et al. (2022) as reference data (SMAP SSS (Jang)). Three schemes with different input variables were tested, and scheme 3 with all variables including Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution SST yielded the best performance (coefficient of determination = 0.60, root mean square error = 0.91 psu). The proposed LGBM-based GOCI SSS had a similar spatiotemporal pattern with SMAP SSS (Jang), with much higher spatial resolution even in coastal areas, where SMAP SSS (Jang) was not available. In addition, when tested for the great flood occurred in Southern China in August 2020, GOCI SSS well simulated the spatial and temporal change of Changjiang Diluted Water. This research provided a potential that optical satellite data can be used to generate high resolution SSS associated with the improved microwave-based SSS especially in coastal areas.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the process of changing the ethical perception of 'hate' in Kang Shin-jae's novel. Therefore, the negative issue of "disgust," which is consumed as a means of "human hatred," is interpreted as a new possibility to discuss more positively and productively. In Korean novels, discussions related to 'hate' tend to be limited to 'love', so they were not used as the main central emotion in analyzing novels.In various works after the Korean War, the perception of hatred of female characters is depicted as being exclusively criticized for the existing system and ethics. Nevertheless, it was not possible to actively approach it due to concerns that it would reduce the main writer's consciousness that penetrates the artist's worldview. This is also the reason why existing research has not fully used the term 'hate'.As such, 'hate' is a concept that lies in a subcategory in the history of Korean literature, and there is an aspect that has not been analyzed closely. However, the 'hate' of female characters in the novel requires more attention because it implies the possibility of expansion into a new ideal as both self-hatred and an awareness of the imperfect world immediately after the war.By analyzing the ethical perception of female characters in Kang Shin-jae's novel, this study attempted to confirm that hate emotions are a form of exclusive use to counter oppressive and violent reality. Kang Shin-jae's novel depicted various aspects of women's lives as a way to restore the impoverished reality around the 50s, but the novel of the 60s became popular as a full-fledged popular novel, focusing on the changed desire for a new era and socio-cultural background. Accordingly, based on the previous researchers of Kang Shin-jae's novels accumulated in the 50s, the research scope of Kang Shin-jae's novels in the 60s was expanded by analyzing them. While accepting previous researchers who interpreted the period of the 60s as the "love" of young men and women consistently flowing in Kang Shin-jae's novels, they tried to reveal the cause, power, substance, and meaning of "hate" as a means for this.

CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - An accurate onboard irradiance measurement on drones is a requirement direct reflectance transformation of aerial images and remote sensing data without use of on-ground reference targets. One of the major error sources in onboard irradiance measurement is the effect of sensor tilt to the observed irradiances. In this paper/presentation, we will present an intercomparison of two methods: the FGI AIRS method and the Koppl method. Both methods require an irradiance sensor with good cosine response and IMU system providing accurate tilt angle for each irradiance measurement. Additionally to this, the AIRS method requires special hardware with multiple tilted irradiance sensors, which effectively allow interpolation of a virtual horizontal sensor. The Koppl method requires the irradiance sensor to be a spectral sensor, which allows the direct and diffuse fractions of irradiance spectrum to be deducted from shape of the measured spectrum using the spectral unmixing between direct and diffuse spectrum shapes. We present a field experiment where the AIRS sensor was flown in a typical mapping pattern flight and evaluate the tilt correction methods during it. During a fully sunny period of the flight, the standard deviations of the irradiances was +/- 6.4% for the uncorrected tilted irradiances, +/- 1.8% for the AIRS method, and +/- 2.0% for the Koppl method. The data shows that an accurate irradiance measurement onboard a drone is feasible using a well-calibrated irradiance sensor system and both methods are capable to produce quite similar results.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the successful implementation of the in-season yield estimation model in Thailand's sugarcane industry. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a crucial parameter of the model that can be used to identify the growth capability of the sugarcane in each contract farm of the factory, as explained. This paper also identifies the state problem of using satellite data in the context of ASEAN agriculture regimes that need high-resolution satellite imagery for most small farms in this region. The processing workload may increase the cost of technology implementation, which is vital for actual performance. The fewer input parameters while giving higher interpretation ability is the way to use the satellite data technology for this region successfully.

TI  - Habitat suitability of Indo-Pacific sailfish <i>Istiophorus platypterus</i> (Shaw, 1792) in the Arabian Sea
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Istiophorus platypterus (Shaw, 1792) is the most common billfish species in the Arabian Sea and contributes more than 50% of the total billfish landings in India. The abundance of I. platypterus was more off Maharashtra and Gujarat in the northern Arabian Sea and in Lakshadweep islands with higher catches during March, April and December. The aim of the study was to predict the suitable habitat of occurrence and potential fishing ground of I. platypterus by correlating the spatial catch rates with environmental parameters along the Arabian Sea. Generalised Additive Modelling (GAM) showed significant relationship between the catch and the predictor variables [sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height anomaly (SSHa), current speed (CS) and chlorophyll (Chl)]. SSS from 32 to 36 ppt had a positive effect on the expected abundance. Similarly, SST showed a positive effect from 25 to 28??C and thereafter had a negative effect on catch rate. The highest catch values associated with the SSHa was 0.4 m and partial effect of SSHa on catch was negative below 0.4 m. Current speed higher than 0.4 m s(-1) showed negative effects on catch rate and lower Chl-a values which ranged between 0.04-2.14 mg m-3 in the study area showed a positive effect. All explanatory variables (SST, SSHa, CS, Chl) except SSS were found to be highly significant covariates (p<0.01, p<0.01, p<0.001 and p<0.05 respectively) and 38.2% of variance was explained by the model with these variables. The paper discusses the fishery and trend of billfish landings along the Indian coast in relation to various remotely sensed data and defines the optimum habitat suitability for I. platypterus.

T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the ideological attitudes of Russians regarding the priority vector of the Russian society development against the background of SMO in Ukraine. Based on the data of an all- Russian representative study conducted by the Institute of Sociology of FCTAS RAS in March 2022, it is shown that there are two significantly different points of view in Russian society on this score. The majority are Russians who are convinced of the non-necessity of implementing an original, different from the Western model, vector of development of the Russian Federation, the minority are supporters of rapprochement with Western countries and orientation to their example in the future. Each of these groups has its own core and its conditional periphery. These two groups differ significantly not only in terms of the socio- demographic characteristics of their members and their values profile, but also in the context of the perception of the decision to launch a SMO in Ukraine, as well as the vision of the key actors of these events. At the same time, these groups are not complete antipodes indicating a potential for reconciliation of existing ideological differences. In particular, they are in solidarity on the need to share responsibility for the conflict in Ukraine between different countries, are not ready for restrictions that can significantly worsen their socio-economic situation, do not demonstrate readiness for public expression of discontent. It is also shown that the final civilizational choice will be determined by the opinion of the majority, which is still forming its identity according to the model of contrasting itself with the "significant other". This is the "cornerstone" at this stage, the situation around which will determine the further vector of formation and rooting of Russians' civilizational identity.

AB  - In seventeenth-century French Catholic sermons, God's jealousy is shown as the intense and exclusive love that binds the Creator and the Man he created in his image. It is represented as a relational energy more than an emotional state. The sermons also offer a powerful reflection on the relationship between jealousy and image (the image of the other, and above all, the image of oneself), and suggest a worldview that connects love, violence, authority, and unity.

M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of the process of correction of convicts in institutions of the penitentiary system of the Russian Federation is ultimately refracted through the psychological prism of the worldview of employees of this system. Therefore, it is so important that the psychological orientation of the staff is focused on the same thing, as well as the general vector of development of the penitentiary system. Among the features of the psychological orientation of the personality is its system of relations to something or someone, the specifics of the assessment of surrounding phenomena. In this regard, theoretically and practically significant is the scientific consideration of the issue of the attitude of practical employees and employees of correctional institutions of the penitentiary system to the problem of correction of convicts. The article presents the results of studying the attitude of correctional officers to the problem of punishments and to the terms of their adequacy to the crime committed, as well as to the organization of influence on convicts to long-term imprisonment. During the analysis of the data obtained empirically, it was found that the length of service of employees practically does not affect their ideas about the organization of correctional impact on those sentenced to a long term of imprisonment. The assumption that there is a connection between the representations of employees of the penitentiary system about the problems of the organization and the process of correction with the length of service has not been confirmed. As an explanation of the revealed result, the following can be proposed. Firstly, there is probably a strong continuity in perceptions, views, ideas, assessments - from employees with long service experience to less experienced employees. Secondly, it can be assumed that the established system of professional selection allows people who are close to each other in their worldview to pass through, and therefore their system of representations and assessments is basically similar.

TI  - IDENTIFICATION OF ORAL HYGIENE LIVEL IN HEARING-IMPAIRED COLLEGE STUDENTS IN PENZA REGION (RUSSIA)
T2  - ARCHIV EUROMEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - THE AIM OF THE STUDY is to compare the level of oral hygiene practices among students with hearing disabilities and well-hearing university students.MATERIALS AND METHODS. The level of hygienic knowledge was studied using the sociological research method (questionnaire) among students with hearing disabilities at Penza Medical College, specialty "Orthopedic Dentistry" and their peers - students of Dentistry Department at the Penza State University. 60 students took part in the study. The average age of the subjects was 19.5 +/- 0.85 years.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. The results of the study indicate a weak motivation to preserve dental health, insufficient awareness of the means and methods of oral hygiene among hearing-impaired students compared with their peers. In the university students all the survey indicators were 1.5-2 times higher than in the hearing-impaired college students. This indicates an insufficient specialized education and awareness as a consequence of hearing limitations.CONCLUSION. It is necessary to strengthen dental education in students with hearing impairments, taking into account the specifics of communication and the worldview of this population. This can be achieved through educational videos and options for free preventive dental services.

TI  - Prosthetic Revelations: Sticking the Teachings to the Body in a Japanese New Religion
T2  - JAPAN REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The Japanese new religion, Mahikari, is known primarily for its practical technique of manual purification, okiyome. However, this article instead focuses on the program of practices that is regarded as being equally important in terms of its purificatory and salvific effects: that of engaging with revelatory teachings, a form of engagement that is often articulated in terms of the expression "sticking the teachings to the body" (oshie o mi ni tsukeru). I consider this particular idiom of attachment and the ways in which it is actualized in devotional practices, and I contend that this notion of somatic yet spiritual "sticking" acts as a conceptual corrective to overly internalizing models of religiosity. In conclusion, I suggest that while Helen Hardacre once proposed that "cosmology" was analytically restricting, and argued instead in favor of "worldview," the issue with regards to the role of embodied practice in Mahikari calls for a reconsideration of these analytical terms. Accordingly, the article ends by suggesting a turn away from "worldview," back towards the category of the cosmological.

TI  - A Transfer Learning Technique for Inland Chlorophyll-a Concentration Estimation Using Sentinel-3 Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration, which serves as a phytoplankton substitute in inland waters, is one of the leading indicators for water quality. Generally, water samples are analyzed in professional laboratories, and Chla concentrations are measured regularly for the purpose of water quality monitoring. However, limited spatial water sampling and the labor-intensive nature of data collection make global and long-term monitoring difficult. The developments of remote-sensing optical sensors and technologies make the long-term monitoring of Chla concentrations for an entire water body more achievable. Many studies based on machine learning techniques, such as regression and artificial neural network (ANN) methods, have recently been proposed for Chla concentration estimation using optical satellite images. The methods based on machine learning can achieve accurate estimation. However, overfitting problems may arise because the in situ Chla dataset is generally insufficient to train a complicated machine learning model, which makes trained models inapplicable. In this study, an ANN model containing three convolutional and two fully connected layers with 4953 unknown parameters is designed. A transfer learning method, consisting of model pretraining, main-training, and fine-tuning stages, is proposed to ease the problem of insufficient in situ samples. In the model pretraining stage, the ANN model is pretrained and initialized using samples derived from an existing Chla concentration model. The pretrained ANN model is then fine-tuned using the proposed transfer learning technique with in situ samples collected in five different campaigns carried out during early 2019 from Laguna Lake, the Philippines. Before the transfer learning, data augmentation and rebalancing methods are conducted to enrich the variability and to near-uniformly distribute the in situ samples in Chla concentration space, respectively. To estimate the alleviation of model overfitting, the trained ANN model, using an in situ dataset from Laguna Lake, was tested using an in situ dataset from Lake Victoria, Uganda, obtained in 2019, which has a similar trophic state as Laguna Lake. The experimental results from Sentinel-3 imagery indicated that the overfitting problem was significantly alleviated and the trained ANN model outperformed related models in terms of the root-mean-squared error of the estimated Chla concentrations.

TI  - A Sentinel-2 Multiyear, Multicountry Benchmark Dataset for Crop Classification and Segmentation With Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we introduce Sen4AgriNet, a Sentinel-2-based time series multicountry benchmark dataset, tailored for agricultural monitoring applications with machine and deep learning. Sen4AgriNet dataset is annotated from farmer declarations collected via the land parcel identification system (LPIS) for harmonizing country-wide labels. These declarations have only recently been made available as open data, allowing for the first time the labeling of satellite imagery from ground truth data. We proceed to propose and standardize a new crop type taxonomy across Europe that addresses common agriculture policy (CAP) needs, based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicative crop classification scheme. Sen4AgriNet is the only multicountry, multiyear dataset that includes all spectral information. It is constructed to cover the period 2016-2020 for Catalonia and France, while it can be extended to include additional countries. Currently, it contains 42.5 million parcels, which makes it significantly larger than other available archives. We extract two subdatasets to highlight its value for diverse deep learning applications-the object aggregated dataset (OAD) and the patches assembled dataset (PAD). OAD capitalizes zonal statistics of each parcel, thus creating a powerful label-to-features instance for classification algorithms. On the other hand, PAD structure generalizes the classification problem to parcel extraction and semantic segmentation and labeling. The PAD and OAD are examined under three different scenarios to showcase and model the effects of spatial and temporal variability across different years and different countries.(1)

AB  - Savannahs cover 50% of the African continent and 20% of the global land surface. African savannahs are increasingly threatened by over-exploitation, deforestation, woody thickening and encroachment and, consequently, land degradation. In South Africa, savannah degradation is acute and accelerating, threatening the ecosystem services provided to some of the country's most vulnerable populations. Here, we devise a methodology for the accurate mapping and monitoring of the fraction of the woody component of savannah vegetation and apply it to the South African Northwest Province. Our approach involves the use of aerial photography for training and validation; the entire dry-season Landsat archive over the last three decades, and deep learning segmentation and classification techniques. Our results are able to identify areas of significant woody densification and encroachment, as well as areas with declining trends.

TI  - Official information on sulfur dioxide emissions and its assessment using satellite remote sensing data br
T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY-LAW-VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to assess the openness, availability and reliability of official in-formation on sulfur dioxide emissions from 31 of the largest point anthropogenic sources located in Russia. For the assessment, a comparison was made of the amounts of emissions according to official reporting and remote sensing data. The set of reported data was formed using information from websites of Federal State Statistic Service and of Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources, as well as those contained in state reports on the ecological situation and on environmental protection or in public non-financial statements of large com-panies. Remote sensing dataset was downloaded from NASA Global Sulfur Dioxide Monitor-ing project website. Data comparison was carried out using statistical analysis methods. It is found that remote sensing data can be considered a standard of information openness and availability, while reported data is incomplete and requires significant efforts to collect. For the emissions up to 50 000 tons per year, the differences between the reported and remote sensing data can be explained solely by the uncertainty of satellite measures. With a larger amount, however, the remote sensing values are in general larger than reported ones, which may indicate imperfect systems of emission control from stationary sources, the presence of many unaccounted sources, or deliberate distortion of environmental information. Emission catalogues from satellite data can become an alternative and supplement to official reporting, as well as be used for control and surveillance activities and bringing to legal responsibility. Topical issues are publishing official environmental information in a form of open data, the development of mechanisms for public non-financial reporting of large companies, the study of the links between information transparency and reliability of the information, as well as the peculiarities of the formation of official reporting about environmental impact.

TI  - THE UKRAINIAN ISSUE IN POST-WAR POLAND AS A SPECIAL INDICATOR OF UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLEX SOCIO-POLITICAL CHALLENGES OF TODAY
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work is to show that a set of issues that summarizes the term "Ukrainian Issue in Poland" can be a tool for understanding the universal problems of today. The article refers to the ways of understanding history, recepted in such a delineated level of emotionality that it changes over time. From the XLVth century history became the basis of national legitimacy in modern states. Despite the changes that took place in the world over the past two centuries, the matrix of thinking of the Polish society is based on the national idea. This also applies to the Polish historical thinking. This factor plays a key role for the Ukrainians, citizens of Poland, who are mainly descendants of migrants from the Vistula campaign. And although there is an opinion in this community about their digerence from the Polish majority, in their approaches to the past, the Ukrainians in Poland are similar to the majority. The article is based on hermeneutic methodology. The scientific novelty consists in an attempt to universalize the experience of the diaspora. The article ends in several practical conclusions. The Conclusions. The universalization of the experience of the Ukrainians in post-war Poland can replace unpromising accentuation. That is, writing it into the common code. We need to understand the other person's emotions for this to happen. Empathy is needed for the second person. It takes work to measure the criteria by which we evaluate the world. At the same time, we also need a mature consciousness of possible manipulations to which we may be subjected. Universal in the experience of the Ukrainians in post-war Poland is loss, patience, fear, nostalgia, chance, but also stubbornness, sacrifice, or on the other hand curiosity, insignificance, naivety. Universal destinies of the Ukrainian partisans, underground fighters, prisoners, peasants and burghers, women, activists, priests, poets, engineers. A universal story about the road: from place to place, from time to time. A universal story of change. There is something to replace 1947, to stop fearfully thinking that we may indeed be "the last Ukrainians in Poland".

TI  - V. F. Odoevsky's "Russian Nights": Two Novels?
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article raises the question of two editions of V. F. Odoevsky's novel "Russian Nights." In the 1860s, the writer wanted to republish it and made a number of amendments and additions to the novel. Odoevsky did not complete this work, and for the first time after the 1844 edition "Russian Nights" were published only in 1913. The publisher S. A. Tsvetkov was guided by the principle of following the "last will of the author" and included Odoevsky's later changes in the text of the novel. This principle has become defining for the publishers of "Russian Nights" in the Literary Monuments series. This version of the novel is still being republished. At one time P. N. Sakulin sharply criticized this approach and pointed out the differences between Odoevsky worldview in the 1830s and 1860s. This difference is clearly reflected in the amendments proposed by the author. This article supplements and expands the argument of the researcher. The 1844 Preface to the Works and the draft of the Preface from the 1860s are compared, and later notes and insertions are analyzed in the context of the novel. The study shows that in the later years of his life Odoevsky departs from his earlier mysticism and romantic style. Later changes give "Russian Nights" a tendentiousness, destroy the unity of the author's position. They should not be included in the main text of the novel. The standardization of the author's spelling and punctuation, which is characteristic of Soviet re-editions of the classics, also violates the poetic space of the novel. It is important to note that the writer created the novel precisely as an aesthetic creation, and the slightest nuances of the author's score are vital to it. When republishing "Russian Nights," it is advisable to be guided by the "historical principle" ("editio princeps").

AB  - The focus of this paper is to report results of comparison of unfiltered shortwave radiances measured by CERES scanners while implementing a strategy, referred to as "matched sites targeting", in which CERES instruments scan at nadir along their respective collocated ground-tracks. This strategy is enabled by similarities in the Suomi-NPP (FM5)/NOAA20 (FM6) and Aqua (FM3) satellite orbits, and a special scan profile available for the CERES scanners. Comparison of collected data in this strategy is done at a footprint level between the instruments (FM5 and FM3 or FM6 and FM3) for specific scene types, determined by their "almost" coincidental ground-tracks. A far more stringent test of the measurement consistency is achieved as averages of 330 collocated nadir samples are compared. Results of the unfiltered shortwave radiance comparison with the focus on clear-sky cases over ocean or snow are based on ES8 or ERBE-like data product using Edition2 for FM5, Edition1 for FM6 and Edition4 for FM3; cloud coverage is verified using MODIS data for FM3 and VIIRS data for FM5/FM6, which are available in SSF products.

M3  - Article
AB  - The research investigates the possibility of applying Sentinel-2, PlanetScope satellite imageries, and LiDAR data for automation of land cover mapping and 3D vegetation characteristics in post-agricultural areas, mainly in the aspect of detection and monitoring of the secondary forest succession. The study was performed for the tested area in the Biskupice district (South of Poland), as an example of an uncontrolled forest succession process occurring on post-agricultural lands. The areas of interest were parcels where agricultural use has been abandoned and forest succession has progressed. This paper indicates the possibility of automating the process of monitoring wooded and shrubby areas developing in post-agricultural areas with the help of modern geodata and geoinformation methods. It was verified whether the processing of Sentinel-2, PlanetScope imageries allows for reliable land cover classification as an identification forest succession area. The airborne laser scanning (ALS) data were used for deriving detailed information about the forest succession process. Using the ALS point clouds vegetation parameters i.e., height and canopy cover were determined and presented as raster maps, histograms, or profiles. In the presented study Sentinel-2, PlanetScope imageries, and ALS data processing showed a significant differentiation of the spatial structure of vegetation. These differences are visible in the surface size (2D) and the vertical vegetation structure (3D).

AB  - In the 1960s and 1970s, the field of Daejeon regional literature with contradictory phases of both a stagnation and a leap forward. It is problematic that full-fledged literary media activity has entered a lull, but the potential of established writers and the progress of new writers is a clear achievement. Duk-Young Lee, as a central factor based in the region, tried to revitalize the literary field.Full-scale research on Duk-young Lee's literature has not been conducted. This article aims to examine the overall trend and diversity of Lee, Duk-young's literature. In particular, the discussion was focused on the poetic shaping of local history. One of the characteristics that permeates the world during the first half of the stage up to the summit is the intellectual worldview that seeks to explore the nature of existence by focusing on the material of nature. For example, flowers are imprinted like fossils as beings that soar beyond the objects of nature, crossing the boundaries of war and art.In the second half of Duk-Young Lee's poetry, the world not only attempted a multi-faceted experimental creation in the field of lyricism, but also expanded his main genre into children's literature and prose. The language in which unique intellectual reflection permeates was consistent across genres. The careful tendency to discover the meaning and value of life from everyday life and nature has led to the result of not over-exploiting quantitative production. In particular, the aspect of poetic reproduction and aesthetic achievement based on unique local history should be recorded as a unique achievement of Daejeon regional literature.Lee, Deok-Young is a special nodule in the history of Daejeon regional literature. For the first time as a poet, he appeared through a system called Annual Literary Contest, and his vigorous literary activity before and after his debut is an important achievement in the establishment field of Daejeon regional literature. He showed his literary competence by immersing himself in various genres, including poetry and Sijo, short stories, essays, and criticism.

AB  - Sentinel-2 satellites provide dense image time series exhibiting high spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions. These images are in particular of utter interest for Land-Cover (LC) mapping at large scales. LC maps can now be computed on a yearly basis at the scale of a country with efficient supervised classifiers, assuming suitable training data are available. However, the efficient exploitation of large amount of Sentinel-2 imagery still remain challenging on unexplored areas where state-of-the-art classifiers are prone to fail. This paper focuses on Land-Cover mapping over Cameroon for the purpose of updating the Very High Resolution national topographic geodatabase. The i(2) framework is adopted and tested for the specificity of the country. Here, experiments focus on generic vegetation classes (five) which enables providing robust focusing masks for higher resolution classifications. Two strategies are compared: (i) a LC map is calculated out of a year long time series and (ii) monthly LC maps are generated and merged into a single yearly map. Satisfactory accuracy scores are obtained (> 94% in Overall Accuracy), allowing to provide a first step towards finer-grained map retrieval.

AB  - Higher spatial and temporal resolution in Earth observation (EO) imagery is beneficial for many applications, including real-time hazard monitoring and agriculture. SI-traceable intercomparison between concurrent Earth imaging satellites can help harmonizing and improving spatial or temporal resolution of their data products. To that end, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) initiated the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) to provide automated surface and top-of-atmosphere TOA reflectance data from multiple participating ground sites to the worldwide user community. Here, we report results of the intercomparison between Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-20 (NOAA-20) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 2500 nm using RadCalNet as a common reference. The results of this study indicate that RadCalNet is a valuable tool for harmonization of EO imagery even in the case where the sensors have different temporal and spatial resolutions. Both OLI and VIIRS are calibrated to well-within their absolute radiometric calibration uncertainties and the two sensors agree with each other to better than 2% using RadCalNet sites as a common reference.

AB  - The intestinal tract is the body's largest mucosal surface and permanently exposed to microbial and environmental signals. Maintaining a healthy intestine requires the presence of sentinel grounds keeper cells, capable of controlling immunity and tissue homeostasis through specialized functions. Intestinal macrophages are such cells and important players in steady-state functions and during acute and chronic inflammation. Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory condition of the intestinal tract is proposed to be the consequence of an altered immune system through microbial and environmental stimulation. This hypothesis suggests an involvement of macrophages in the regulation of this pathology. Within this chapter, we will discuss intestinal macrophage development and highlight data suggesting their implication in chronic intestinal pathologies like Crohn's disease.

TI  - Lake ice phenology variations and influencing factors of Selin Co from 2000 to 2020

AB  - As a result of energy and material exchange at the lake-atmosphere interface, the variations of lake ice phenology are of great significance for indicating regional climate change and lake response process. Based on the boundary data of Selin Co, some multi-source remote sensing (RS) datasets including Terra MODIS and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI product, combined with meteorological records and lake data to analyze spatiotemporal variations of ice phenology of Selin Co and its relationship with climate factors and physical and chemical factors between 2000 and 2020 by applying both RS and GIS technology. The main research conclusions are as follows ; (1) Freeze-up start (FUS) and freeze-up end (FUE) of lake ice appears in late November-early December, and late December-early January, respectively. The duration of lake ice freeze-up is about a month. The time of break-up start (BUS) and breakup end (BUE) of lake ice appears in late March-early April, and late April, respectively. The duration of lake ice break-up is about half a month. (2) Data show that FUS dates of lake ice have been delayed at a rate of 11.3 d/10 a from 2000 to 2020. FUD (freeze-up duration) time of lake ice showed an increasingly shortening trend. Ice cover duration had been shortened at a rate of 13.5 d/10 a. (3) Selin Co can be characterized by opposite spatial patterns in both freeze-up and break-up processes. Lake ice freezes from the northern and eastern lakeshore and gradually expands to the center of lake. Instead, lake ice break-up begins in the center of the lake. 4) Ice phenology of Selin Co is influenced by climate and physico-chemical factors of the lake itself. The average temperature of winter half-year (between November and the following April) plays a dominant role in ice phenology variations of Selin Co. Wind speed and precipitation both also some influences on the formation and melting of lake ice cover and also cannot be neglected. In the recent 20 years, with the expansion of Selin Co area, the increase of turbidity and the decrease of water clarity, the freezing dates of lake ice were gradually delayed. Under the background of global warming, the area expansion of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, including Selin Co, has accelerated. The results of this study can provide a reference for understanding the climate indicator significance of lake ice phenology information and the feedback process of lakes under the changing environment.
