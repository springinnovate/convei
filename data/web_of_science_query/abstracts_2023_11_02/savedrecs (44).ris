TI  - European mining and the social license to operate
T2  - EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Social License to Operate (SLO) has become an established part of the natural resource development lexicon in North and South America as well as Australia. In Europe, the concept of the SLO in relation to mining is still in early maturation and acceptance possibly due to the very different worldview that exists in Europe. The European 'condition' can be characterized by a greater degree of trust in governance bodies and the role they play in prioritizing the best interests of the citizens they serve. The 'Scalar SLO Model' is inspired by Thomson and Boutilier's original conception and developed during the H2020 MIREU project to describe the SLO in Europe; however, its logic can be applied to any other jurisdiction globally. What distinguishes the Scalar SLO Model from other contributions to the literature is two-fold. First, the division between the Community and Societal drivers of the SLO reinforces the notion that the nature of the SLO within the Community dimension can manifest itself differently than within the broader Societal dimension where values may not be the same. The second distinguishing contribution introduces the attributes of loss of the SLO as represented by conflictual relationships in both dimensions.

TI  - Impact of land use/land cover changes on groundwater resources in Al Ain region of the United Arab Emirates using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation causes land degradation problems, including an increased pressure on natural resources and management of water resources. This study aims to investigate the impact of the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) changes on groundwater table in the region of Al Ain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), from 2006 to 2016. The Landsat images, Landsat ETM for 2006 and Landsat 8 for 2016, were acquired from the earth explorer site. A semi-supervised hybrid classification method was used for image classification and post-classification techniques for LULC change detection. The study area was categorised into six major LULC classes. These are agriculture/farms/oasis, gardens/playgrounds, urban areas, sandy areas, lake and mixed urban/ sandy areas. Accuracy assessment of LULC were evaluated using confusion matrix and ground truthing. The obtained land use and land cover maps were also correlated with spatial groundwater table maps prepared with groundwater data. It was found that agriculture/farms/oasis and urban areas expanded from 42,560 ha to 45,950 ha (7.38%) and from 8150 ha to 9105 ha (10.49%) from 2006 to 2016, respectively. The corresponding water demand was increased by 9.56% and 22.22%, respectively. Natural sandy area was found to decrease by 8.10%. As groundwater is major source of water for agriculture in this region, the spatial maps also revealead average declining rate of groundwater depth 40.44% with expansion of urban and agricultural areas over the last 10 years. The outcomes of the study would help concerning authorities for a sustainable management of its land and groundwater resources.

TI  - Crop Yield Estimation at Gram Panchayat Scale by Integrating Field, Weather and Satellite Data with Crop Simulation Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced technologies can improve the operational implementation of the Indian national crop insurance scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), particularly in terms of accuracy and timeliness of the crop yield estimates that are used to determine yield losses at the Gram Panchayat (GP) level. In this study, conducted as a pilot test for PMFBY during the kharif season of 2018, technologies based on the Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS) were tested and implemented for estimating GP-level crop yields of bajra (pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum) in Firozabad District of Uttar Pradesh and rice (Oryza sativa) in Kendujhar District of Odisha. A combination of Synthetic Aperture Radar and optical data was used to map crop extent. Daily 2-km grids of input weather conditions were generated using a machine learning algorithm that incorporated station observations, satellite data, and reanalysis model outputs. Required crop biophysical estimates of leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were derived using daily cloud-screened MODIS 250-m data from the Terra and Aqua satellites and a modified MOD15 LAI/FPAR backup algorithm. A light-use-efficiency (LUE) model adapted from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) algorithm (MOD17-GPP/NPP) was then used to spatially estimate crop yields. Crop extent maps, daily climate and gap-filled FPAR and the LUE model were used to estimate above-ground biomass, which was accumulated over the growing season and converted to crop yields using a crop-specific harvest index. The estimated yields at 250 m were aggregated within each GP and compared with crop yield data from crop cutting experiments (CCEs) conducted in 142 GPs for rice and 42 GPs for bajra. Crop extent mapping was 96% accurate in rice and 80% in bajra when validated with field surveys. A comparison of modeled yields with CCE yields showed a promising performance by the model in both crops (rice: r = 0.80, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 411 kg/ha, mean absolute error (MAE) = 359 kg/ha, percent error (PE) = 7, Observed mean = 1500 kg/ha; Bajra: r = 0.84, RMSE = 309 kg/ha, MAE = 262 kg/ha, PE = -12.8, Observed mean = 1859 kg/ha). Although the approach showed promising results for both crops, further progress is needed to ensure consistent and reliable results. Some of the needed improvements include incorporating a dynamic crop calendar, improved maximum LUE estimates, and harvest index values that represent crop varietals grown in India. Routinely conducted CCEs in different crops and seasons around the country could provide a valuable resource for improving these parameters and, ultimately, crop yield estimates.

TI  - Field Analysis of Biological Factors Associated With Sites at High and Low to Moderate Risk for Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus Winter Activity in Florida
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is the most pathogenic arbovirus endemic to the United States. Studies have demonstrated Florida's role as a regional reservoir for the virus and its ability to support year-round transmission. Previous research has developed risk index models for mapping locations most at risk for EEEV transmission. We compared vector abundance, vector feeding behavior, potential host species, and fauna presence at high versus low-moderate risk sites during the winter and spring. Predicted high-risk sites had a significantly greater abundance of mosquitoes overall, including Culiseta melanura (Coquillett) (Diptera: Culicidae), the primary enzootic vector of EEEV. Twenty host species were identified from Cs. melanura bloodmeals, with the majority taken from avian species. Culiseta melanura largely fed upon the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis (Passeriformes: Cardinalidae)), which accounted for 20-24.4% of the bloodmeals obtained from this species in years 1 and 2, respectively. One EEEV-positive mosquito pool (Cs. melanura) and nine EEEV seropositive sentinel chickens were confirmed during winter-spring collections from high-risk sites; no seropositive chickens nor mosquito pools were found at the low-moderate risk sites. These results suggest that high-risk sites for EEEV activity are characterized by habitats that support populations of Cs. melanura and which may also provide ample opportunities to feed upon Northern Cardinals. The overall low level of mosquito populations during the winter also suggests that control of Cs. melanura populations in winter at high-risk sites may prove effective in reducing EEEV transmission during the peak summer season.

TI  - Dynamics of currents and biological scattering layers around Senghor Seamount, a shallow seamount inside a tropical Northeast Atlantic eddy corridor
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biophysical interactions of the mesopelagic fauna and hydrodynamic features were investigated at a shallow, tall seamount in the tropical Northeast Atlantic based on data from three inter-disciplinary surveys collected between 2009 and 2015. Senghor Seamount is located close to the equator in a unique but underexplored oceanographic setting, where classical seamount effects are expected to be small. Shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and remote sensing data revealed flow phenomena strongly varying over different temporal and spatial scales. The quasi-steady, longer period flow at the seamount was largely unchanged by flow-topography interaction with the exception of a persistent and recurring shadow zone of weaker currents downstream of the summit. Senghor Seamount is exposed to energetic mesoscale eddy activity in surrounding waters with potentially large physical and biological implications. At higher frequencies, tidal currents interacting with the seamount generated large-amplitude internal waves propagating horizontally and vertically away from the summit. Analysis of acoustic backscatter data and micronekton biomass displayed prominent near-surface night time and deep (>400 m) day time scattering layers associated with the diurnal vertical migration of the mesopelagic fauna. An intense and previously unreported aggregation of acoustic scatterers was detected in the depth range 150-300 m inside a radius of 3 km along the upper slopes of the seamount summit. ADCP measurements over a full semi-diurnal tidal cycle suggest that biophysical interactions were present in near-seafloor waters around the upper seamount as evidenced by plankton distributions that were modified by topographic blocking during descent and aggregation in waters characterised by internal waves and enhanced tidally-driven energy dissipation.

TI  - Reliability assessment of water quality index based on guidelines of national sanitation foundation in natural streams: integration of remote sensing and data-driven models
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers, as one of the freshwater resources, are generally put in the state of jeopardy in terms of quantity and quality due to the development in industry, agriculture, and urbanization. Management of water quality is inextricably bound up with a reliable prediction of the Water Quality Index (WQI) for various purposes. In this way, an accurate estimation of WQI is one of the most challenging issues in the water quality studies of surface water resources. There is a board range of traditional methodologies for the WQI evaluation. Due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional models, Data-Driven Models (DDMs) have been frequently employed to assess the WQI for natural streams. In the present research, WQI values and their typical classifications were obtained by guidelines of the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF). Hence, four well-known DDMs such as Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR), M5 Model Tree (MT), Gene-Expression Programming (GEP), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) are employed to predict WQI in Karun River. In this way, 12 Water Quality Parameters (i.e., Dissolved Oxygen, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Electrical Conductivity, Nitrate, Nitrite, Phosphate, Turbidity, pH, Calcium, Magnesium, and Sodium) were accumulated from nine hydrometry stations and additionally missing values of water temperature were extracted from images analysis of Landsat-7 ETM+. Furthermore, the Gamma Test (GT), Forward Selection (FS), Polynomial Chaotic Expression (PCE), and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) were used to reduce the volume of DDMs-feeding-input variables. Results of DDMs demonstrated that FS-M5 MT had the best performance for the estimation of WQI classification. WQI values for Karun River were assessed in the reliability-based probabilistic framework to consider the effect of any uncertainty and randomness in the input parameters. To this end, the Monte-Carlo scenario sampling technique was conducted to evaluate the limit state function from the DDMs-based-WQI formulation. Based on the qualitative description of the WQI, it was observed that the WQI of Karun River is classified into "Relatively Bad" quality. Moreover, based on the reliability analysis, there is only a 19% chance exists for a specimen from Karun River to have a better quality index.

TI  - The detection of anti-<i>Trichinella</i> antibodies in free-ranging Nebrodi Regional Park black pigs from Sicily, Italy, suggests the circulation of <i>Trichinella britovi</i> in the island
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Zoonotic nematodes of the genus Trichinella are known to occur in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. For example, Trichinella spiralis was reported in pigs and humans at the turn of the Second World War in Sicily and Trichinella britovi in pigs, red foxes and dogs from Corsica and Sardinia since 2004. Following the discovery of T. britovi in Corsica and Sardinia, a question arose as to whether this species was also present in Sicily which is located only 3.14 km from continental Italy. To address this query, we investigated the presence of anti-Trichinella antibodies in the serum of Nebrodi black pigs, a breed that is bred in the wild in the Nebrodi Regional Park, a protected area of the island rich in flora and fauna. Blood samples were collected from 112 Nebrodi black pigs from five farms. Sera were tested by ELISA and ELISA positive sera were confirmed by Western blot (Wb) using excretory/secretory antigens. Eighteen (16.1%) serum samples belonging to 17 fattening pigs and 1 boar tested positive by Wb. Positive sera tested by Wb using crude worm extract antigens (CWE), displayed a banding pattern similar to the CWE-Wb pattern of T. spiralis and T. britovi reference pig sera but different to that of T. pseudospiralis reference pig sera. No larvae were detected in muscles of serologically positive pigs by artificial digestion. The presence of anti-Trichinella antibodies in the absence of larvae in the muscles, suggests that the pigs were infected with T. britovi and not T. spiralis whose larvae survive in the muscles for at least two years. These results suggest that T. britovi is circulating in Nebrodi Regional Park in Sicily. ELISA testing may constitute a suitable tool for large-scale screening of Trichinella spp. infection in free-ranging pigs, when ELISA-positive sera are confirmed by Wb. Free-ranging animals can act as sentinels for the presence of zoonotic nematodes of the genus Trichinella in wildlife.

TI  - The potential role of an alien tree species in supporting forest restoration: Lessons from Shiretoko National Park, Japan
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring forests has recently received considerable attention in the context of sequestering carbon and supporting biodiversity. Although considering alien species as a tool for natural forest restoration still remains controversial, harnessing alien species when they are already present in an ecosystem might result in overall benefits for nature and society. In this study we evaluated whether the presence of an alien tree species supports or hinders the establishment of naturally regenerating forests in Shiretoko National Park, Japan. In particular, we focused on Larix kaempferi, which is widely present yet non-native to the region, and examined how this alien species affects two factors influencing the success of restoration: wind disturbance and deer herbivory. We examined the following effects of L. kaempferi plantations on natural regeneration: (1) the windbreak function for protecting native tree growth and (2) the nursery function to promote the regeneration of native tree saplings and seedlings under high herbivory pressure. We assessed tree height and regeneration, using large-scale remotely sensed data and terrestrial inventory data in five major vegetation types. We found that L. kaempferi plantations can protect native species from predominant winds. Additionally, L. kaempferi canopy cover promoted abundance and species richness in understory saplings and seedlings compared to other vegetation types such as primary and secondary forests, even under excessive browsing pressure. No regenerating L. kaempferi individuals were observed during the field census, suggesting the species is likely not invasive in our study system. The positive relationship between alien tree species and the regeneration of native tree assemblages emphasizes that existing alien species have the potential to act as nurse plants. Our findings imply that the presence of alien species can contribute to natural forest restoration by improving the local environmental conditions for native species in the short-term. Given the multiple ecological and social needs in our changing world, careful consideration is required to evaluate the long-term consequences of alien species. Especially in ecosystems in which alien species have already established, using their positive functions rather than swiftly eradicating them from the landscape might be beneficial for long-term restoration goals. We conclude that managers need to be aware of the context-dependency of alien species to make restoration more effective.

TI  - Particulate matter variability in Kathmandu based on in-situ measurements, remote sensing, and reanalysis data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Kathmandu has one of the highest particulate matter air pollution levels in the world. However, few direct measurement data are available for long-term analyses, limiting policy interventions and public health advisories. Remote sensing-based data sets provide an alternative approach to address this issue. In this paper, we present an approach to analyze and understand the diurnal, seasonal, annual, and multi-annual variability of pollution levels based on in situ measurements of particulate matter (PM2.5), remote sensing data based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), and aerosol mass concentration retrievals, as well as AOD and PM2.5 data from Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data sets. The analysis of the direct measurements revealed distinct annual patterns, characterized by winter maxima and summer minima. With the exception of the summer monsoon season, public health guidelines are frequently exceeded significantly throughout the year, particularly in winter. The analysis furthermore pointed toward distinct daily patterns with primary maxima in the mornings, secondary maxima in the late evenings, and minima in the afternoons. The annual pattern of AOD derived from the MODIS data is markedly different from that. Due to the coarse spatial resolution and the fact that MODIS AOD is a column integrated property, it does not reflect the small scale phenomenon of the Kathmandu urban pollution pattern but instead shows a maximum in the spring. The same pattern was observed with the CAMS and MERRA-2 reanalysis AOD data, even though MERRA-2 captures pollution levels during the summer monsoon season very well. The CAMS reanalysis PM2.5 data are generally well-aligned with the near-surface measurement data, even though they overestimate the daily and monthly maxima and do not capture the morning maxima in the diurnal course. Nevertheless, CAMS PM2.5 data can be adjusted via linear regression to reasonably mirror the measurements. It shows that PM2.5 concentrations in Kathmandu have increased significantly in the past decades (almost 2 mu g/m3 annually), mainly after the monsoon season from September to February. Our results indicate that around 85% of all winter days in Kathmandu are categorized as "unhealthy" according to the Air Quality Index (AQI).

TI  - Race talk: How racial worldview impacts discussions in interracial relationships
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a mixed-method approach, this study investigates how individuals believe race impacts their interracial relationship. Two-hundred and three individuals representing diverse racial-gender compositions of relationships responded to a series of measures to assess their Racial Worldview-a collective of notions about racial/ethnic identity, intergroup relations, and recognition of racist hegemony-before indicating the ways in which race or racial issues affect their romantic partnership. Results revealed four distinct types of Racial Worldview through K-means cluster and four broad themes of influences on relationship communication and functioning. Cross-tabs analyses indicated that Racial Worldview and participants perceptions of the impact of race were related with statistically significant differences between those who acknowledge racism and valued group differences reaching different conclusions than those who do not. The results add to existing research by drawing attention to the heterogeneity of thought and understanding within interracial relationships. The promise of using Racial Worldview in future research is discussed.

TI  - Surface Circulation and Vertical Structure of Upper Ocean Variability Around Fernando de Noronha Archipelago and Rocas Atoll During Spring 2015 and Fall 2017
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Using current, hydrographic and satellite observations collected off Northeast Brazil around the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago and Rocas Atoll during two oceanographic cruises (spring 2015 and fall 2017), we investigated the general oceanic circulation and its modifications induced by the islands. In spring 2015, the area was characterized by lower SST (26.6 degrees C) and deep mixed-layer (similar to 90 m). At this depth, a strong current shear was observed between the central branch of the eastward flowing near-surface South Equatorial Current and the westward flowing South Equatorial Undercurrent. In contrast, in fall 2017, SST was higher (similar to 28.8 degrees C) and the mixed-layer shallower (similar to 50 m). The shear between the central South Equatorial Current and the South Equatorial Undercurrent was weaker during this period. Interestingly, no oxygen-rich water from the south (retroflection of the North Brazil undercurrent) was observed in the region in fall 2017. In contrast, we revealed the presence of an oxygen-rich water entrained by the South Equatorial Undercurrent reaching Rocas Atoll in spring 2015. Beside these global patterns, island wake effects were noted. The presence of islands, in particular Fernando de Noronha, strongly perturbs central South Equatorial Current and South Equatorial Undercurrent features, with an upstream core splitting and a reorganization of single current core structures downstream of the islands. Near islands, flow disturbances impact the thermohaline structure and biogeochemistry, with a negative anomaly in temperature (-1.3 degrees C) and salinity (-0.15) between 200 and 400 m depth in the southeast side of Fernando Noronha (station 5), where the fluorescence peak (>1.0 mg m(-3)) was shallower than at other stations located around Fernando de Noronha, reinforcing the influence of flow-topography. Satellite maps of sea-surface temperature and chlorophyll-a confirmed the presence of several submesoscale features in the study region. Altimetry data suggested the presence of a cyclonic mesoscale eddy around Rocas Atoll in spring 2015. A cyclonic vortex (radius of 28 km) was actually observed in subsurface (150-350 m depth) southeast of Rocas Atoll. This vortex was associated with topographically induced South Equatorial Undercurrent flow separation. These features are likely key processes providing an enrichment from the subsurface to the euphotic layer near islands, supplying local productivity.

TI  - LCZ Generator: A Web Application to Create Local Climate Zone Maps
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since their introduction in 2012, Local Climate Zones (LCZs) emerged as a new standard for characterizing urban landscapes, providing a holistic classification approach that takes into account micro-scale land-cover and associated physical properties. In 2015, as part of the community-based World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project, a protocol was developed that enables the mapping of cities into LCZs, using freely available data and software packages, yet performed on local computing facilities. The LCZ Generator described here further simplifies this process, providing an online platform that maps a city of interest into LCZs, solely expecting a valid training area file and some metadata as input. The web application (available at ) integrates the state-of-the-art of LCZ mapping, and simultaneously provides an automated accuracy assessment, training data derivatives, and a novel approach to identify suspicious training areas. As this contribution explains all front- and back-end procedures, databases, and underlying datasets in detail, it serves as the primary "User Guide" for this web application. We anticipate this development will significantly ease the workflow of researchers and practitioners interested in using the LCZ framework for a variety of urban-induced human and environmental impacts. In addition, this development will ease the accessibility and dissemination of maps and their metadata.

TI  - Virological COVID-19 surveillance in Bavaria, Germany suggests no SARS-CoV-2 spread prior to the first German case in January 2020
T2  - INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bavarian Influenza Sentinel (BIS) monitors the annual influenza season by combining virological and epidemiological data. The 2019/2020 influenza season overlapped with the beginning COVID-19 pandemic thus allowing to investigate whether there was an unnoticed spread of SARS-CoV-2 among outpatients with acute respiratory infections in the community prior to the first COVID-19 cluster in Bavaria. Therefore, we retrospectively analysed oropharyngeal swabs obtained in BIS between calendar week (CW) 39 in 2019 and CW 14 in 2020 for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. 610 of all 1376 BIS swabs-contained sufficient material to test for SARS-CoV-2, among them 260 oropharyngeal swabs which were collected prior to the first notified German COVID-19 case in CW 04/2020. In none of these swabs SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected suggesting no SARS-CoV-2 spread prior to late January 2020 in Bavaria.

TI  - Discrimination of maize crop in a mixed <i>Kharif</i> crop scenario with synergism of multiparametric SAR and optical data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of coarse cereals envisaged maize to be discriminated from co-existing Kharif crops using multiplatform, multiparametric SAR and Optical data in various polarization combination from Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 in synergism with Sentinel-2, under machine learning algorithms viz. support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) and knowledge-based Decision Tree (DT). SVM over-estimates the area of maize whereas RF and DT performed similarly (60-75%) but DT being closest to field conditions (68-78%). A 4 date Sentinel-1 under DT classified Soybean to 62% accuracy and Cotton to 76% on a regional scale in Maharashtra. Inclusion of 1-date optical image improved sugarcane accuracy. The similar-structured crops, such as Maize and Pearl Millet were discriminated with their unique phenological response in crop-calendar using quad-pol RADARSAT-2. With inclusion of crop responsive model-based polarimetric decomposition (Yamaguchi Volume and Double-Bounce) and Eigen-based parameters (Entropy and Alpha-Angle), maize classification accuracy elevated to 84%.

TI  - The contribution of aerosols chemical components to aerosol optical depth: The method and the case in Dunhuang
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the aerosol chemical components and aerosol optical depth (AOD) observation in Dunhuang, China, the Non-Negative Least Squares method has been innovatively applied to calculate the monthly averaged watersoluble aerosol density and obtain corresponding aerosol particles, and to further calculate AOD by upgrading the relevant parameters in Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC). The obtained water-soluble aerosol density ranges from 1.87 to 2.12 g/cm3. The density of water-soluble aerosols is higher in winter half-year which are mainly affected by the local dust particles and polluted aerosols caused by domestic heating. The upgraded OPAC precisely simulated seasonal AOD, except in DJF(December-January-February) which has more mineral and soot (EC, Elemental Carbon). Dividing single water-soluble aerosol into the sulfate portion and other watersoluble portions can improve the accuracy of particle number of aerosols in OPAC. The AOD results in upgraded OPAC are between 0.26 and 0.44 at 500 nm. The annual average absolute error is 0.109, which is higher in DJF and MAM (March-April-May) when more dust events occur. The annual-average multi-band AOD results show good range (0.18-0.40) and consistency (y = 0.43x + 0.17) as well. Sulfate, nitrate and soot(EC) which belonging to anthropogenic aerosols accounted for more than 60% of the contribution on AOD, and showed a clear bimodal structure with the peak at March and November. The contribution on AOD of sulfate and nitrate in March exceeded the value in November by 5%, but no significant difference in EC and mineral. The upgraded OPAC results did not show significant deviations from the observed AOD in MAM, JJA (June-July-August) and SON (September-October-November), or even in the annual results. Natural source aerosol has a certain seasonal periodicity and is difficult to control. Therefore, controlling the emissions of sulfate, nitrate and soot (EC) belonging to anthropogenic aerosols can effectively reduce AOD and improve the visibility in Dunhuang.

TI  - The complexities of practices: a reality check <i>Exploring the learning possibilities in a plural practice module of chaplaincy and religious leadership in 2020 while practicing social distancing</i>
T2  - STUDIA THEOLOGICA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents reflections over an internship module in the master programme "Leadership, Ethics and Counselling" at the Faculty of Theology, University of Oslo in the spring of 2020. This newly established master (2019) is equipping groups of students with different religions and worldviews for chaplaincy and leadership. The religiously and culturally plural learning environment that the master is aiming for doesn't just foster understanding of cross-religious and cross-cultural situations and contexts. It also has ambitions of shaping and altering the learning perspectives in professional chaplaincy training towards acknowledging the importance of co-formation, not just formation, in order to emphasize the meaning of relationships in learning processes and not merely the enhancement of individual knowledge and skill acquirement. This article will reflect on the learning situation of an internship module during the spring of 2020 in the master programme mentioned above, when social - or rather physical - distancing suddenly was the rule among the population due to the covid-19 pandemic. How does one teach and learn the skills necessary for generic chaplaincy, existential care and religiously-/worldview-based leadership while being confined to home? The article draws on practice theory and empirical research from other contexts in order to derive learning outcomes for this particular internship module and establishes crucial questions around internship within academic theology in the Nordic context. The main questions are: What is the educational gain from the pluralily referred to above, and what happens to internship training when the spatial circumstances for professional practice are changed into mandatory physical distancing? The article claims that working on these two questions relates to overarching questions around the place of practice in Nordic academic theology. An implicit question is whether it is possible to view practice as something happening only in a confined space.

TI  - Decolonizing Indigenous health: Generating a productive dialogue to eliminate Rheumatic Heart Disease in Australia
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In common with colonized Indigenous people worldwide, many Australian Aboriginal people experience inequitable health outcomes. While the commitment and advocacy of researchers and health practitioners has resulted in many notable improvements in policy and practice, systemic and structural impediments continue to restrain widespread gains in addressing Indigenous health injustices. We take Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD), a potent marker of extreme health inequity, as a case study, and critically examine RHD practitioners' perspectives regarding the factors that need to be addressed to improve RHD prevention and care. This study is an important explanatory component of a broader study to inform new clinical practices, and health system strategies and policies to reduce RHD. A decolonising, critical medical anthropology (CMA) analysis of findings from 22 RHD practitioner in-depth interviews conducted in May 2016 revealed both practitioners' perceptions of health system shortcomings and a sense of hopelessness and powerlessness to transform existing health system inequities, the negative impacts of which were subsequently confirmed in a separate study of RHD patients' lived realities. We reveal how biomedical dominance, normalized deficit discourses and systemic racism influence the current policy and practice landscape, narrowing the intercultural space for productive dialogue and reinforcing the conditions that cause disease. To counter biomedical approaches that contribute to existing health inequities in health care, we recommend localized, strength-based, community-led research projects focused on actions that use critical decolonizing social science approaches to achieve system change. We demonstrate the importance of integrating biological and social sciences approaches in research, education/training, and practice to: 1) be guided by Indigenous strengths, knowledges and worldview, and 2) adopt a critical reflexive stance to examine systems, structures and practices. Such an approach facilitates productive cross-cultural dialogue and social transformation; providing direction and hope to practitioners, enhancing their knowledge, skills and capacity and improving Aboriginal health outcomes.

TI  - Local emission and long-range transport impacts on the CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations at a tropical rural site
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Local emission and long-range transport impacts on the observed concentrations (dry air mole fractions) of CO, CO2, and CH4 have been investigated using three years (April 2016 to April 2019) of surface measurements at a tropical rural site, Gadanki (13.5 degrees N, 79.2 degrees E) in Southern peninsular India. Gadanki represents the poor coverage area of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) measurements in India and has both local emission and long-range transport influences on its air masses. All the three gases have shown strong seasonality and diurnal variations. Trend analysis showed a significant decreasing trend in CO (14.3 +/- 0.2 ppbv/year) and increasing trends in CO2 (2.5 +/- 1.2 ppmv/year) and CH4 (11.1 +/- 0.03 ppbv/year). CO2 and CH4 trends are marginally higher than the global trends (2.2 +/- 0.004 ppmv/year and 7.0 +/- 0.001 ppbv/year, respectively) for the same period highlighting the sustained local emission impact on the observed concentrations. Among the three species, CO has been the most local emission impacted species with local emission contribution (to the total observed concentration) varying between 4 and 25% during different seasons with a median value always lying above 10% irrespective of the season. In the case of CO2 and CH4, the local emission contribution found to vary in the range of 0.8-7% and 0.15-3%, respectively. Long-range transport impact dominance over the local emission is observed in CO2 and CH4 during all the seasons. Analysis using MODIS fire count data, Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) and FLEXPART have reconfirmed the combined effect of local and long-range transport impacts on the observed concentrations. Comparison of the IASI MetOp and AIRS satellite data products with surface measurements showed the significant bias and poor representation of the seasonality demonstrating the limitations on the sensitivity of satellite trace gas measurements within the boundary layer.

TI  - Landscape transformation after irrigation development in and around a semi-arid wetland ecosystem
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study are to determine the spatial and temporal land use/cover changes in a semi-arid agricultural basin (Develi Basin) after the implementation of an irrigation project and to understand how these changes affected the wetlands (Sultan Marshes) located in the basin. The changes were determined using multitemporal Landsat Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager imagery taken in 1987, 1998, 2007, and 2013. The images were classified into six information classes (grasslands/shrublands, croplands, permanent wetlands, water bodies, barren, and urban/built-up) using a hybrid classification method. Post-classification change detection was applied to determine the changes between different years. Overall, the accuracy of the classified images ranged from 85 to 94%. Grasslands/shrublands covered the largest area in the basin (63% in 2013), followed by croplands (32% in 2013). The area covered by water bodies, permanent wetlands, barren, and urban/built-up was 5% (in 2013). From 1987 to 2013, croplands expanded by 56%, while grasslands/shrublands declined by 15%. The areas occupied by water bodies decreased by 88% and permanent wetlands decreased by 4%. Urban/built-up areas expanded by 140%. The hydrologic regime of the Sultan Marshes wetland changed, which resulted in declines in water volumes by 85% and in water inflows by 55% from 2000 to 2015. Climatic variations during the 1987-2013 period were low and there was no apparent trend in precipitation and air temperature, which ruled out climatic conditions as one of the drivers of wetland changes. Economic and institutional factors supported the expansion of irrigated agriculture and animal husbandry in the basin and accelerated the expansion of croplands and conversion to industrial and fodder crops and orchards from traditional non-irrigated crops. Expansion of croplands and irrigated agriculture were the major drivers of the changes in the Sultan Marshes.

TI  - Evaluation of the effect of geographical parameters on the formation of the land surface temperature by applying OLS and GWR, A case study Shiraz City, Iran
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining the land surface temperature (LST) and its mechanism is very significant for urban planning.The purpose of this study is to determine the factors affecting the surface temperature of urban areas of Shiraz. The OLS and GWR were used o determine the effective factors. Also, satellite data of Landsat 8 for summer 2019 were used to obtain the surface temperature of Shiraz. To this end, the Landsat 8 satellite images of Shiraz urban districts during Summer 2019, were prepared. First, the LST and vegetation was extracted from the images. Before performing the regression model between the LST as the dependent variable and geographical variables such as slope, slope gradient, elevation, distance to rivers, direct and indirect solar radiation, sunshine duration, and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) as independent variables, the component analysis method was employed to eliminate collinearity and dependence relations among independent variables and reducing variables. Four significant components that had eigenvalues above one and about 86.75% of the variance of the initial variables were selected, which included the significance of (direct, indirect, general) solar radiation, the direction of slope, distance to rivers, vegetation, and slope gradient, respectively. In the next step, the regression analysis was performed between the components and the LST via the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The results showed that GWR has better performance in showing the spatial distribution of LSTs in Shiraz. Shiraz UHIs correspond to the airport and the dirt and barren districts around the city, which are often non-residential.

TI  - Juggling with representations: On the information transfer between imagery, point clouds, and meshes for multi-modal semantics
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic semantic segmentation of the huge amount of acquired remote sensing data has become an important task in the last decade. Images and Point Clouds (PCs) are fundamental data representations, particularly in urban mapping applications. Textured 3D meshes integrate both data representations geometrically by wiring the PC and texturing the surface elements with available imagery. We present a mesh-centered holistic geometry-driven methodology that explicitly integrates entities of imagery, PC and mesh. Due to its integrative character, we choose the mesh as the core representation that also helps to solve the visibility problem for points in imagery. Utilizing the proposed multi-modal fusion as the backbone and considering the established entity relationships, we enable the sharing of information across the modalities imagery, PC and mesh in a twofold manner: (i) feature transfer and (ii) label transfer. By these means, we achieve to enrich feature vectors to multi-modal feature vectors for each representation. Concurrently, we achieve to label all representations consistently while reducing the manual label effort to a single representation. Consequently, we facilitate to train machine learning algorithms and to semantically segment any of these data representations - both in a multi-modal and single-modal sense. The paper presents the association mechanism and the subsequent information transfer, which we believe are cornerstones for multi-modal scene analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the preconditions and limitations of the presented approach in detail. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on the ISPRS 3D semantic labeling contest (Vaihingen 3D) and a proprietary data set (Hessigheim 3D).

TI  - Predicting basin water quality using source-sink landscape distribution metrics in the Danjiangkou Reservoir of China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover changes due to human development are a concern for water-resource managers as they increase the spread of non-point source pollution to rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, impacting the quality of freshwater resources. Danjiangkou Reservoir is the largest inter-regional water transfer project in China and provides water services to cities along the middle route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project and Beijing. Hence, watershed management decisions that may affect the water quality of the reservoir are particularly important. This study investigated the land use and land cover of a typical agricultural basin near the Danjiangkou Reservoir. The basin was divided into 13 sub-basins and the water quality was sampled six times during 2018 to determine the water quality index (WQI) for each sub-basin. The land use type and digital elevation model of each sub-basin were derived from remote-sensing data and then used to determine source-sink landscape distribution metrics; including the flow accumulation index (FAI), location-weighted landscape contrast index (LWLI), and landscape capacity distribution index (LCDI). Correlation and regression analysis were then used to compare these indices with the WQI. The WQI had a significant negative correlation with both the LWLI and LCDI, and a weak correlation with the FAI. Results indicated that the land use classification, proportion of source and sink landscape types, landscape flow path length, and landscape nutrient inputs were the main explanatory factors for river water quality in the basin. The biggest challenge in the research process is to obtain the parameters of landscape pattern index and its tedious calculation formula. The most successful part of the study is that it takes into account the flow path, roughness coefficient of land, nutrient input and other factors, more truly simulates the rainfall runoff process under natural conditions, and obtains better regression results between each evaluation index and water quality index. These findings show that remote-sensing data can be used in lieu of direct sampling to evaluate basin-water quality. Furthermore, these data can be used to predict the impact of future land use changes on water quality and facilitate more effective watershed management.

TI  - Coupling water and carbon processes to estimate field-scale maize evapotranspiration with Sentinel-2 data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential part of agricultural water consumption, and robust monitoring of remote sensing (RS)-based ET at the field scale improves agricultural water management against water shortages. In this study, we propose a high-resolution optical RS-driven daily ET estimation framework coupling water vaporization and carbon assimilation based on Sentinel-2 satellite data. To determine if the proposed framework is accurate compared with flux observations, three tower sites are chosen (Guantao and Huailai from the Haihe Basin; Daman from the Heihe Basin), with a total of four years of observations adopted for model validation. The correlation coefficient R ranges from 0.870 to 0.912, and the RMSE ranges from 0.89 to 1.21 mm/day. Sensitivity analyses indicate that ET is most sensitive to air temperature, followed by ambient CO2 concentration and absorbed shortwave radiation, which provides indications into potential future farming strategies to confront global climate change. Finally, we discuss the scale effects on the proposed model at the field scale. Results from three sites show that for a larger area of interest (AOI) the impact of scales increases. This research provides insights into ET calculations across several spatial scales and application potential in precision agricultural water management.

TI  - Contralateral Regional Recurrence in Lateralized or Paramedian Early-Stage Oral Cancer Undergoing Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy-Comparison to a Historic Elective Neck Dissection Cohort
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Nowadays, two strategies are available for the management of the clinically negative neck in early-stage (cT1-2N0) oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC): elective neck dissection (END) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). SLNB stages both the ipsilateral and the contralateral neck in early-stage OSCC patients, whereas the contralateral neck is generally not addressed by END in early-stage OSCC not involving the midline. This study compares both incidence and hazard of contralateral regional recurrences (CRR) in those patients who underwent END or SLNB.Materials and Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study, including 816 lateralized or paramedian early-stage OSCC patients, staged by either unilateral or bilateral END (n = 365) or SLNB (n = 451).Results: The overall rate of occult contralateral nodal metastasis was 3.7% (30/816); the incidence of CRR was 2.5% (20/816). Patients who underwent END developed CRR during follow-up more often than those who underwent SLNB (3.8 vs. 1.3%; p = 0.018). Moreover, END patients had a higher hazard for developing CRR than SLNB patients (HR = 2.585; p = 0.030). In addition, tumor depth of invasion was predictive for developing CRR (HR = 1.922; p = 0.009). Five-year disease-specific survival in patients with CRR was poor (42%) compared to patients in whom occult contralateral nodal metastases were detected by SLNB or bilateral END (88%), although not statistically different (p = 0.066).Conclusion: Our data suggest that SLNB allows for better control of the contralateral clinically negative neck in patients with lateralized or paramedian early-stage OSCC, compared to END as performed in a clinical setting. The prognosis of those in whom occult contralateral nodal metastases are detected at an earlier stage may be favorable compared to those who eventually develop CRR, which highlights the importance of adequate staging of the contralateral clinically negative neck.

TI  - InSAR constraints on the active deformation of salt diapirs in the Kalut basin, Central Iran
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, salt diapirs have been widely used for gas storing, hazardous waste disposal, mining, and petroleum production. The rate and pattern of active movement in salt structures are crucial to be obtained before planning these industrial utilizations. The central basin of the Iranian plateau represents well-exposed and -preserved diapirs that can be considered as an analog for other salt basins around the world where the exposures are not as good. Integration of the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique with remotesensing structural mapping permits us to study the active surficial deformation of eight salt diapirs in the Kalut basin in central Iran. We classify the Kalut diapiric structures into salt walls, massifs, stocks, and welds. We then use 75 Single Look Complex (SLC) IW scenes acquired on the ascending collected from November 2014 to November 2018 and 62 SLC images on descending geometries collected from October 2014 to January 2018, both covering the same period. The Sentinel-1 images are processed by the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approaches to define vertical and horizontal displacement maps revealing that the Kalut basin is one of the mostactive present-day diapiric systems in the world, its eight salt diapirs are rising, and none of them subsides. Maximum calculated rates of growth reach 8 mm/yr in vertical and similar to 2 mm/yr in horizontal directions, suggesting that in general vertical displacements play a significant role in the deformation of this salt-controlled basin. Salt stocks are uniformly rising in their crestal domain (up to 8 mm/yr) with lateral spreading along their flanks (1-2 mm/yr). The larger salt walls are more active and rising faster (8 mm/yr) than smaller ones (3 mm/yr), while welded areas are inactive. These rising salt diapirs are flanked by seasonal depocenters accumulating up to 10 mm/yr of fluvial, evaporitic, and aeolian deposits.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - A critical shortage of 'big' agronomic data is placing an unnecessary constraint on the conduct of public agronomic research, imparting barriers to model development and testing. Here, we address this problem by providing a large non-relational database of agronomic trials, linked to intensive management and observational data, run under a unified experimental framework. The National Variety Trials (NVTs) represent a decade-long experimental trial network, conducted across thousands of Australian field sites using highly standardised randomised controlled designs. The NVTs contain over a million machine-measured phenotypic observations, aggregated from density-controlled populations containing hundreds of millions of plants and thousands of released plant varieties. These data are linked to hundreds of thousands of metadata observations including standardised soil tests, fertiliser and pesticide input data, crop rotation data, prior farm management practices, and in-field sensors. Finally, these data are linked to a suite of ground and remote sensing observations, arranged into interpolated daily- and ten-day aggregated time series, to capture the substantial diversity in vegetation and environmental patterns across the continent-spanning NVT network.

TI  - Modeling the urban heat island at a winter event in Trees Lagoas, Brazil
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island is one of the most investigated environmental problems at the local climate scale. It is a thermal anomaly resulting from the difference in temperature between urban areas and the surrounding rural areas that add heat to the atmosphere and lead to thermal discomfort for part of the population. This study aims to identify and analyze the urban heat island in the city of Trees Lagoas, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, and represent it by multicriterial modeling considering air temperature and surface characteristics as parameters. For this purpose, air temperature was recorded using mobile transects and images from the Landsat 8 satellite for an unsupervised automatic classification of the visible and near infrared bands, in addition to NDVI, which was grouped into classes. Statistical relations were determined between the intensity of the urban heat island in places where temperatures were recorded and urban parameters, such as vegetation, buildings, and exposed soil. The resulting model for a winter event identifies a heat island of strong magnitude associated with densely built areas and exposed soil. We verified through descriptive statistics that the generated model approached the reality with a 95% confidence.

TI  - Landslide geometry and activity in Villa de la Independencia (Bolivia) revealed by InSAR and seismic noise measurements
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables detailed investigation of surface landslide movements, but it cannot provide information about subsurface structures. In this work, InSAR measurements were integrated with seismic noise in situ measurements to analyse both the surface and subsurface characteristics of a complex slow-moving landslide exhibiting multiple failure surfaces. The landslide body involves a town of around 6000 inhabitants, Villa de la Independencia (Bolivia), where extensive damages to buildings have been observed. To investigate the spatial-temporal characteristics of the landslide motion, Sentinel-1 displacement time series from October 2014 to December 2019 were produced. A new geometric inversion method is proposed to determine the best-fit sliding direction and inclination of the landslide. Our results indicate that the landslide is featured by a compound movement where three different blocks slide. This is further evidenced by seismic noise measurements which identified that the different dynamic characteristics of the three sub-blocks were possibly due to the different properties of shallow and deep slip surfaces. Determination of the slip surface depths allows for estimating the overall landslide volume (9.18 center dot 10(7) m(3)). Furthermore, Sentinel-1 time series show that the landslide movements manifest substantial accelerations in early 2018 and 2019, coinciding with increased precipitations in the late rainy season which are identified as the most likely triggers of the observed accelerations. This study showcases the potential of integrating InSAR and seismic noise techniques to understand the landslide mechanism from ground to subsurface.

TI  - Predicting subsurface thermohaline structure from remote sensing data based on long short-term memory neural networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing can detect and predict subsurface temperature and salinity structure within the ocean over large scales. In the era of big ocean data, making full use of multisource satellite observations to accurately detect and predict global subsurface thermohaline structure and advance our understanding of the ocean interior processes is extremely challenging. This study proposed a new deep learning-based method-bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks-for predicting global ocean subsurface temperature and salinity anomalies in combination with surface remote sensing observations (sea-surface temperature anomaly, sea-surface height anomaly, sea-surface salinity anomaly, and the northward and eastward components of seasurface wind anomaly), longitude and latitude information (LON and LAT), and subsurface Argo gridded data. Because of the temporal dependency and periodicity of ocean dynamic parameters, the Bi-LSTM is good at time-series feature learning by considering the significant temporal feature of the ocean variability and can well improve the robustness and generalization ability of the prediction model. For December 2015 as an example, our average prediction results in an overall determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.691/0.392 and a normalized root mean square error of 0.039 degrees C/0.051 PSU for subsurface temperature anomaly (STA)/subsurface salinity anomaly (SSA) prediction. This study sets up different cases based on different sea-surface feature combinations to predict the subsurface thermohaline structure and analyze the role of longitude and latitude information on Bi-LSTM prediction. The results show that in the prediction of STA, the contribution of LON + LAT to the model gradually increases with depth, whereas in the prediction of SSA, LON + LAT maintains a relatively significant contribution to the model at different depths. Meanwhile, in the STA and SSA prediction, the LAT plays a more significant role than LON. We also applied the model to bi-directional prediction for different months of 2010 and 2015 to prove the applicability and robustness of the model. This study suggests that Bi-LSTM is more advantageous in time-series modeling for predicting subsurface and deep ocean temperature and salinity structures, fully takes into account the timing dependence of global ocean data, and outperforms the classic random forest approach in predicting subsurface thermohaline structure from remote sensing data.

TI  - Analysis of thermal anomalies at Copahue Volcano between October 2011 and the December 2012 eruption with MODIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Copahue volcano is an active stratovolcano located in the Southwest of the Agrio-Caviahue depression in the Province of Neuque ' n at the border between Argentina and Chile, and the most recent eruptive activity involved five cycles between 1992 and 2016. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is an instrument onboard the satellites Terra and Aqua that provides, on average, four images per day and has channels centered at 4 mu m and 12 mu m that are useful for detecting volcano temperature anomalies. In this work, we evaluated the normalized temperature index (NTI) as implemented by MODVOLC and the radiance recorded by MODIS at 4 mu m as measures of precursory volcanic activity between October 2011 and January 2013, with a special focus on the December 2012 eruption. We evaluated the thermal anomalies identified by MODVOLC based on a global threshold of -0.8 and observed that they were namely syn- or post-eruptive and mostly correlated with the presence of incandescence material related to Strombolian activity. The global nighttime threshold was adapted to the local context of Copahue and we observed that a threshold of -0.875 is a more suitable value for the examined period. An analysis of time series of the NTI and of the radiance at 4 mu m based on 116 MODIS images, resulted in that the adapted threshold allowed the detection of anomalies undetected by the global value. The anomalies were in either case unrelated to precursory activity but correlated with surface expressions of activity such as the emission of volcanic ash, volcano degassing, and the ejection of ballistic and incandescent material. The knowledge on the chronology of activity prior to and during the eruption could be improved, as regards the thermal behavior of the volcano in relation also to geochemical, deformation, and seismic signals. The replication of this kind of analysis in other periods of activity at Copahue and other volcanoes, the evaluation of other algorithms and the incorporation of data acquired by other satellite instruments are necessary to improve our knowledge on the temperature behavior of volcanoes before and during periods of unrest. This would ultimately contribute towards the improvement of volcano monitoring capabilities in volcanic areas.

TI  - A Step-by-Step Guide to Initialize and Calibrate Landscape Models: A Case Study in the Mediterranean Mountains
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of spatially interactive forest landscape models has increased in recent years. These models are valuable tools to assess our knowledge about the functioning and provisioning of ecosystems as well as essential allies when predicting future changes. However, developing the necessary inputs and preparing them for research studies require substantial initial investments in terms of time. Although model initialization and calibration often take the largest amount of modelers' efforts, such processes are rarely reported thoroughly in application studies. Our study documents the process of calibrating and setting up an ecophysiologically based forest landscape model (LANDIS-II with PnET-Succession) in a biogeographical region where such a model has never been applied to date (southwestern Mediterranean mountains in Europe). We describe the methodological process necessary to produce the required spatial inputs expressing initial vegetation and site conditions. We test model behaviour on single-cell simulations and calibrate species parameters using local biomass estimations and literature information. Finally, we test how different initialization data-with and without shrub communities-influence the simulation of forest dynamics by applying the calibrated model at landscape level. Combination of plot-level data with vegetation maps allowed us to generate a detailed map of initial tree and shrub communities. Single-cell simulations revealed that the model was able to reproduce realistic biomass estimates and competitive effects for different forest types included in the landscape, as well as plausible monthly growth patterns of species growing in Mediterranean mountains. Our results highlight the importance of considering shrub communities in forest landscape models, as they influence the temporal dynamics of tree species. Besides, our results show that, in the absence of natural disturbances, harvesting or climate change, landscape-level simulations projected a general increase of biomass of several species over the next decades but with distinct spatio-temporal patterns due to competitive effects and landscape heterogeneity. Providing a step-by-step workflow to initialize and calibrate a forest landscape model, our study encourages new users to use such tools in forestry and climate change applications. Thus, we advocate for documenting initialization processes in a transparent and reproducible manner in forest landscape modelling.

TI  - Evolution of Urban Spatial Clusters in China: A Graph-Based Method Using Nighttime Light Data
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban spatial cluster (USC) describes one or more geographic agglomerations and the linkages among cities. USCs are conventionally delineated based on predefined administrative boundaries of cities, without considering the dynamic and evolving nature of the spatial extent of USCs. This study uses Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light (NTL) satellite images to quantitatively detect and characterize the evolution of USCs. We propose a dynamic minimum spanning tree (DMST) and a subgraph partitioning method to identify the evolving USCs over time, which considers both the spatial proximity of urban built-up areas and their affiliations with USCs at the previous snapshot. China is selected as a case study for its rapid urbanization process and the cluster-based economic development strategy. Four DMSTs are generated for China using the urban built-up areas extracted from DMSP/OLS NTL satellite images collected in 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012. Each DMST is partitioned into various subtrees and the urban built-up areas connected by the same subtree are identified as a potential USC. By inspecting the evolution of USCs over time, three different types of USCs are obtained, including newly emerging, single-core, and multicore clusters. Using the rank-size distribution, we find that large-sized USCs have greater development than medium- and small-sized USCs. A clear directionality and heterogeneity are observed in the expansions of the ten largest USCs. Our study provides further insight for the understanding of urban system and its spatial structures, and assists policymakers in their planning practices at national and regional scales.

TI  - Using Generalized Regression Neural Network to Retrieve Bare Surface Soil Moisture From Radarsat-2 Backscatter Observations, Regardless of Roughness Effect
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The combined influence of surface soil moisture and roughness on radar backscatters has been limiting SAR's application in soil moisture retrieval. In the past research, multi-temporal analysis and artificial neural network (ANN) inversion of physically based forward models were regarded as promising methods to decouple that combined influence. However, the former does not consider soil roughness change over a relatively longer period and the latter makes it hard to thoroughly eliminate the effect of soil roughness. This study proposes to use generalized regression neural network (GRNN) to derive bare surface soil moisture (BSSM) from radar backscatter observations regardless of the effect of soil roughness (GRNN inversion of backscatter observations). This method not only can derive BSSM from radar backscatters, provided soil roughness is unknown in any long period, but also can train models based on small-size sample data so as to reduce the manual error of training data created by simulation of physically based models. The comparison of validations between BSSM-backscatter models and BSSM-roughness-backscatter models both analyzed by GRNN shows that the incorporation of soil roughness cannot raise the prediction accuracy of models and, instead, even reduce it, indicating that the combined influence is thoroughly decoupled when being analyzed by GRNN. Moreover, BSSM-backscatter models by GRNN are recommended due to their good prediction, even compared to those related models in past publications.

TI  - Deforestation rate and causes in Upper Manyame Sub-Catchment, Zimbabwe: Implications on achieving national climate change mitigation targets
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - The signing of the Paris Agreement at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) 21 repositioned the global agenda toward sustainable forest management to address the threats of global warming. However, deforestation rates in many parts of the world continue to accelerate. The study evaluates the rate and causes of deforestation in Upper Manyame Sub-Catchment (UMSC) due to land use land cover (LULC) changes between 1990 and 2020. Landsat imagery analysis augmented by household questionnaire survey and key stakeholder interviews were used to assess the rate and cause of deforestation in UMSC. Over the 30 years, the sub-catchment lost 9.4% of its vegetation area due to land use changes. Vegetation loss was mainly due to urban expansion of Harare and its dormitory towns and the extensive peri-urban agriculture mainly tobacco harvesting. Using the Markov Chain Cellular Automata model, the study estimated that in 2030 the catchment will lose approximately 3.3% of the current vegetation land cover area. This means a further reduction of the vegetation area from 20.1% to 16.8% in 2030. There is need for harmonisation of infrastructure development in Harare and the peri-urban farming activities with policies that conserve forests such as the use of charcoal and eucalyptus plantations for curing tobacco instead of indigenous trees. This is critical if Zimbabwe is to meet its climate change mitigation targets in the Nationally Determined Contribution that promotes the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).

TI  - Top-of-permafrost ground ice indicated by remotely sensed late-season subsidence
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground ice is foundational to the integrity of Arctic ecosystems and infrastructure. However, we lack finescale ground ice maps across almost the entire Arctic, chiefly because there is no established method for mapping ice-rich permafrost from space. Here, we assess whether remotely sensed late-season subsidence can be used to identify ice-rich permafrost. The idea is that, towards the end of an exceptionally warm summer, the thaw front can penetrate materials that were previously perennially frozen, triggering increased subsidence if they are ice rich. Focusing on northwestern Alaska, we test the idea by comparing the Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) late-season subsidence observations to permafrost cores and an independently derived ground ice classification. We find that the late-season subsidence in an exceptionally warm summer was 4-8 cm (5th-95th percentiles) in the ice-rich areas, while it was low in ice-poor areas (-1 to 2 cm; 5th-95th percentiles). The distributions of the late-season subsidence overlapped by 2 %, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity for identifying top-of-permafrost excess ground ice. The strengths of late-season subsidence include the ease of automation and its applicability to areas that lack conspicuous manifestations of ground ice, as often occurs on hillslopes. One limitation is that it is not sensitive to excess ground ice below the thaw front and thus the total ice content. Late-season subsidence can enhance the automated mapping of permafrost ground ice, complementing existing (predominantly non-automated) approaches based on largely indirect associations with vegetation and periglacial landforms. Thanks to its suitability for mapping ice-rich permafrost, satellite-observed late-season subsidence can make a vital contribution to anticipating terrain instability in the Arctic and sustainably stewarding its ecosystems.

TI  - Characteristics of topographic submesoscale eddies off the Crimea coast from high-resolution satellite optical measurements
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term arrays of satellite optical measurements of Landsat-5,7,8 and Sentinel-2 were used to describe the characteristics of submesoscale eddy (SE) dynamics in different parts of the Crimean coast: their geometric and kinematic characteristics, the main sites and mechanisms of formation, and impact on the redistribution of suspended matter. The dynamic characteristics of SE were computed on the base of the 4D variational assimilation method from the pair of consecutive Landsat-8/Sentinel-2 images. The orbital velocity of submesoscale cyclonic eddies (SCE) with a diameter of 1 km reaches 0.15 m/s, indicating the cyclostrophic balance with a high Rossby number (RO) exceeding 2. Submesoscale cyclones were detected much more frequently than the usually larger submesoscale anticyclones. High-resolution satellite imagery gives a possibility to observe complex submesoscale dynamic processes, such as the generation of chains of SCE, large cyclones behind the capes consisting of densely packed arrays of SCEs, topographic submesoscale anticyclones with a number of attached SCEs, mushroom-like current structures, and frontal SE. Despite the diversity of the processes considered, several basic mechanisms of formation of submesoscale eddies can be identified on the basis of satellite data: (1) Separation of the boundary current, often wind-driven, behind the capes; (2) barotropic instability due to the horizontal shear on the coastal periphery of mesoscale anticyclones or alongshore currents; (3) formation of the mushroom-like structure due to the interaction of offshore currents with deep waters near the capes or due to offshore winds; and (4) frontal instabilities on the coastal upwelling. The results of the analysis were used to create a scheme of the spatial variability of submesoscale processes near the Crimean coast and compare it to the results of the high-resolution modeling. The model was able to describe the main areas of SE formation, which was located near the major capes. It provides additional data about SE generation near the rocky capes of the South Crimea, where satellite data was limited by the absence of optical tracers.

TI  - Detection and modeling of soil salinity variations in arid lands using remote sensing data
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a ubiquitous global problem. The literature supports the integration of remote sensing (RS) techniques and field measurements as effective methods for developing soil salinity prediction models. The objectives of this study were to (i) estimate the level of soil salinity in Abu Dhabi using spectral indices and field measurements and (ii) develop a model for detecting and mapping soil salinity variations in the study area using RS data. We integrated Landsat 8 data with the electrical conductivity measurements of soil samples taken from the study area. Statistical analysis of the integrated data showed that the normalized difference vegetation index and bare soil index showed moderate correlations among the examined indices. The relation between these two indices can contribute to the development of successful soil salinity prediction models. Results show that 31% of the soil in the study area is moderately saline and 46% of the soil is highly saline. The results support that geoinformatic techniques using RS data and technologies constitute an effective tool for detecting soil salinity by modeling and mapping the spatial distribution of saline soils. Furthermore, we observed a low correlation between soil salinity and the nighttime land surface temperature.

TI  - Rock Unit Discriminations Using Image Processing Technique of Ablah Area, Arabian shield, Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ablah area is a basin among the deformed and weakly metamorphosed, post-amalgamation volcanosedimentary sequence in the Arabian shield, Saudi Arabia. It is a promising area for some economic deposits. This study aims to construct a detailed geological map and rock unit discrimination of the area, using digital image processing techniques. The satellite digital data comprise Landsat-7 and SPOT-5 are used for regional, reconnaissance, and detailed geological mapping. The high spatial resolution (HR) digital data of SPOT-5 were processed to create a detailed lithologic and structure maps of the study area (1:10,000). The outcomes of the work reflect that the mineralization in the Ablah area (e.g., gold, copper, and associated minerals) are mainly associated with the altered metasediments and metavolcanics. The alteration zones in the Ablah area are aligned in a way controlled by structural lineaments trending NNW-SSE, WNW-ESE, NE-SW, and N-S.

TI  - "Careful With Your 'We'": Worldview Minority Faculty at Sectarian Institutions
T2  - JOURNAL OF DIVERSITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States' higher education landscape includes over 600 colleges and universities affiliated with a Christian denomination. Many of these institutions employ faculty whose worldview identities depart from the Christian ethos of the campus. The present study draws on case study data to examine how worldview minority faculty members make sense of the climate for religious and spiritual diversity at church-affiliated colleges and universities. Findings illuminate how worldview minority faculty members navigate tensions between their identities and church-affiliated institutional contexts. We use the concepts of worldview climate and identity taxation to explore the ways in which these faculty distinctively support worldview minority students in both official and unofficial capacities, and the important role these faculty play in advocating for nondominant perspectives on campus.

TI  - Modeling of the Urban Heat Island on local climatic zones of a city using Sentinel 3 images: Urban determining factors
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how the components of cities interfere in the Urban Heat Island (UHI) has become a main great challenge for societies seeking to improve the quality of life through the implementation of urban planning criteria. In this research, the city of Granada (Spain) was divided into four local climatic zones (LCZ) according to the Corine Land Cover inventory, to study the land surface temperature (LST) and daytime and nighttime UHI using Sentinel 3 imaging. For each LCZ, urban factors were quantified by means of the Data Panel statistical analysis method, and multivariate relationships that statistically influence the UHI were determined. The results indicate an urban cooling island during the morning with a medium temperature of -0.6 K, the effect being greater in the low-density LCZ than in the high-density LCZ. At night, an UHI with an average temperature of 0.7 K is produced, this effect being greater in compact LCZs than in open ones. Two common factors significantly influence the day and night UHI: Fraction vegetation cover and solar radiation. In addition, for the day UHI, altitude and population density stand out as significant. For the night UHI, wind, impervious surface fraction factor and sky view factor additionally stand out.

TI  - Wetter environment and increased grazing reduced the area burned in northern Eurasia from 2002 to 2016
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern Eurasia is currently highly sensitive to climate change. Fires in this region can have significant impacts on regional air quality, radiative forcing and black carbon deposition in the Arctic which can accelerate ice melting. Using a MODIS -derived burned area dataset, we report that the total annual area burned in this region declined by 53 % during the 15-year period from 2002 to 2016. Grassland fires dominated this trend, accounting for 93 % of the decline in the total area burned. Grassland fires in Kazakhstan contributed 47 % of the total area burned and 84 % of the decline. A wetter climate and increased grazing are the principle driving forces for the decline. Our findings (1) highlight the importance of the complex interactions of climate-vegetation- land use in affecting fire activity and (2) reveal how the resulting impacts on fire activity in a relatively small region such as Kazakhstan can dominate the trends in burned areas across a much larger landscape of northern Eurasia.

TI  - Globalisation, Black Swans, and financialisation as social constructions: A Discursive Institutional Analysis of Banamex, Citibank, and Scotiabank in Argentina
T2  - GLOBAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite over twenty years of political resistance, globalisation endures, both as a discourse and political project. While many works have established how discourses of globalisation serve to constrain and/or guide macroeconomic policy, the dynamic nexus that exists between microeconomic decision-making processes vis-a-vis macroeconomic conditions is a less explored matter. Epistemologically, this paper offers a means of gaining analytical purchase over the logics, motivations, and thought processes of international bankers - and the financial press, which chronicle their actions. This is accomplished via a rigorous discursive-content analysis that gauges how said agents understood globalisation, the role of finance, the state, and even how market sentiment was factored into their ontological worldview. Ultimately, the goal is to establish an historical and spatiotemporally heterogeneous analysis on if, how, and what ideas of globalisation and neoliberalism influenced/rationalized the financialization of Argentine banks during the 1990s and how these evolved en route to Argentina's 2001 collapse.

TI  - GLOBE Observer and the GO on a Trail Data Challenge: A Citizen Science Approach to Generating a Global Land Cover Land Use Reference Dataset
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and land use are highly visible indicators of climate change and human disruption to natural processes. While land cover is frequently monitored over a large area using satellite data, ground-based reference data is valuable as a comparison point. The NASA-funded GLOBE Observer (GO) program provides volunteer-collected land cover photos tagged with location, date and time, and, in some cases, land cover type. When making a full land cover observation, volunteers take six photos of the site, one facing north, south, east, and west (N-S-E-W), respectively, one pointing straight up to capture canopy and sky, and one pointing down to document ground cover. Together, the photos document a 100-meter square of land. Volunteers may then optionally tag each N-S-E-W photo with the land cover types present. Volunteers collect the data through a smartphone app, also called GLOBE Observer, resulting in consistent data. While land cover data collected through GLOBE Observer is ongoing, this paper presents the results of a data challenge held between June 1 and October 15, 2019. Called "GO on a Trail," the challenge resulted in more than 3,300 land cover data points from around the world with concentrated data collection in the United States and Australia. GLOBE Observer collections can serve as reference data, complementing satellite imagery for the improvement and verification of broad land cover maps. Continued collection using this protocol will build a database documenting climate-related land cover and land use change into the future.

TI  - Significant characteristics of aerosol optical depth and cloud cover fraction over the South West region of India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research study is focused on to investigate the seasonal, temporal and spatial variations of aerosol optical depths (AODs) over various major cities in South-West region of India and further to understand the impact of aerosols on cloud microphysics. AOD at 550 nm derived from the MODIS sensors have been analyzed in the present study for the ten-year period of 2003-2012. The retrieved satellite data have been used to study the temporal heterogeneity in columnar aerosol characteristics over the eight different places of South West (SW) region of India with a resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees grids in magnitude. On yearly basis, high annual mean AOD values (> 0.5) were found at Mumbai (similar to 0.53 +/- 0.13), Ahmedabad (similar to 0.58 +/- 0.18) and Kolkata (similar to 0.74 +/- 0.064) whereas low annual average AOD values (< 0.2) were found at Bengaluru (similar to 0.10 +/- 0.22). The percentage variation between highest and lowest average annual AOD value was found to be maximum over Ahmedabad (similar to 118%) and minimum over Bengaluru (similar to 22%) during the study period of 2003-2012. It was also found that the cloud cover fraction increases with AOD (550 nm) at all selected eight places of SW region of India for the whole period of 2003-2012. The maximum positive slope of the trend line for AOD and CF was found to be for Delhi (+ 0.47) and the minimum for Thiruvananthapuram (+ 0.182). It indicates that the significant increase in the correlation between AOD and CF was found to be larger for those regions which have more aerosol particles produced due to industrial and urban domestic activities, etc. A single paired double tailed distribution student's t-test has also been applied to the Terra AOD values and cloud parameters with a confidence level of 95%.

TI  - Metaplastic breast cancer with chondroid differentiation-case report and literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) comprises less than 1% of all breast cancers, and it is defined by a mixture of adenocarcinoma plus mesenchymal and epithelial components. It is more common in older and black female patients. It has a larger size and faster growth, and it is frequently node-negative and triple-negative when compared with invasive ductal carcinoma. The authors report the case of a 72-year-old female patient, presenting with a breast lump, whose biopsy revealed a probable MBC with chondroid differentiation. She underwent a breast conservative surgery (BCS) and axillary sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND). The pathological report was concordant with the biopsy, and the patient was proposed to chemoradiotherapy. Despite its rarity and more severe features at diagnosis, BCS plus SLND plus radiotherapy should be offered to these patients, associated with chemotherapy. Chondroid differentiation is the rarest of all histological subtypes.

TI  - Model-enforced post-process correction of satellite aerosol retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based aerosol retrievals provide a timely view of atmospheric aerosol properties, having a crucial role in the subsequent estimation of air quality indicators, atmospherically corrected satellite data products, and climate applications. However, current aerosol data products based on satellite data often have relatively large biases compared to accurate ground-based measurements and distinct uncertainty levels associated with them. These biases and uncertainties are often caused by oversimplified assumptions and approximations used in the retrieval algorithms due to unknown surface reflectance or fixed aerosol models. Moreover, the retrieval algorithms do not usually take advantage of all the possible observational data collected by the satellite instruments and may, for example, leave some spectral bands unused. The improvement and the re-processing of the past and current operational satellite data retrieval algorithms would become tedious and computationally expensive. To overcome this burden, we have developed a model-enforced post-process correction approach to correct the existing operational satellite aerosol data products. Our approach combines the existing satellite aerosol retrievals and a post-processing step carried out with a machine-learning-based correction model for the approximation error in the retrieval. The developed approach allows for the utilization of auxiliary data sources, such as meteorological information, or additional observations such as spectral bands unused by the original retrieval algorithm. The post-process correction model can learn to correct for the biases and uncertainties in the original retrieval algorithms. As the correction is carried out as a post-processing step, it allows for computationally efficient re-processing of existing satellite aerosol datasets without fully re-processing the much larger original radiance data. We demonstrate with over-land aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) data from the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of the Aqua satellite that our approach can significantly improve the accuracy of the satellite aerosol data products and reduce the associated uncertainties. For instance, in our evaluation, the number of AOD samples within the MODIS Dark Target expected error envelope increased from 63 % to 85 % when the post-process correction was applied. In addition to method description and accuracy results, we also give recommendations for validating machine-learning-based satellite data products.

TI  - Detection of signals linked to climate change, land-cover change and climate oscillators in Tropical Montane Cloud Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) form biodiverse communities that are characterized by frequent occurrence of low-level clouds from which they capture a substantial proportion of their precipitation - here referred to as occult precipitation. TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5 degrees S to 23.5 degrees N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures - the 'lifting cloud-base hypothesis'. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier - informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products - to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 x 10(6) km(2) +/- 0.5 x 10(6) km(2)). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the 'lifting cloud-base hypothesis' in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in similar to 20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 degrees C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the 'lifting cloud hypothesis', imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia - mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.

TI  - Using a network of temperature lidars to identify temperature biases in the upper stratosphere in ECMWF reanalyses
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To advance our understanding of the stratosphere, high-quality observational datasets of the stratosphere are needed. It is commonplace that reanalysis datasets are used to conduct stratospheric studies. However, the accuracy of these reanalyses at these heights is hard to infer due to a lack of in situ measurements. Satellite measurements provide one source of temperature information. As some satellite information is already assimilated into reanalyses, the direct comparison of satellite temperatures to the reanalysis is not truly independent. Stratospheric lidars use Rayleigh scattering to measure density in the middle and upper atmosphere, allowing temperature profiles to be derived for altitudes from 30 km (where Mie scattering due to stratospheric aerosols becomes negligible) to 80-90 km (where the signal-to-noise ratio begins to drop rapidly). The Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) contains several lidars at different latitudes that have measured atmospheric temperatures since the 1970s, resulting in a long-running upper-stratospheric temperature dataset. These temperature datasets are useful for validating reanalysis datasets in the stratosphere, as they are not assimilated into reanalyses. Here, stratospheric temperature data from lidars in the Northern Hemisphere between 1990-2017 were compared with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalyses. To give confidence to any bias found, temperature data from NASA's EOS Microwave Limb Sounder were also compared to ERA-Interim and ERA5 at points over the lidar sites. In ERA-Interim a cold bias of -3 to -4 K between 10 and 1 hPa was found when compared to both measurement systems. Comparisons with ERA5 found a small bias of magnitude 1 K which varies between cold and warm bias with height between 10 and 1 hPa, indicating a good thermal representation of the middle atmosphere up to 1 hPa. A further comparison was undertaken looking at the temperature bias by year to see the effects of the assimilation of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) satellite data and the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate GPS Radio Occultation (COSMIC GPSRO) data on stratospheric temperatures within the aforementioned ERA analyses. It was found that ERA5 was sensitive to the introduction of COSMIC GPSRO in 2007 with the reduction of the cold bias above 1 hPa. In addition to this, the introduction of AMSU-A data caused variations in the temperature bias between 1-10 hPa between 1997-2008.

TI  - Using time series of MODIS land surface phenology to model temperature and photoperiod controls on spring greenup in North American deciduous forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of leaf emergence in temperate and boreal forests is changing, which has profound implications for a wide array of ecosystem processes and services. Spring phenology models, which have been widely used to predict the timing of leaf emergence, generally assume that a combination of photoperiod and thermal forcing control when leaves emerge. However, the exact nature and magnitude of how photoperiod and temperature individually and jointly control leaf emergence is the subject of ongoing debate. Here we use a continuous development model in combination with time series of land surface phenology measurements from MODIS to quantify the relative importance of photoperiod and thermal forcing in controlling the timing of canopy greenup in eastern temperate and boreal forests of North America. The model accurately predicts biogeographic and interannual variation in the timing of greenup across the study region (median RMSE = 4.6 days, median bias = 0.30 days). Results reveal strong biogeographic variation in the period prior to greenup when temperature and photoperiod influence greenup that covaries with the importance of photoperiod versus thermal controls. Photoperiod control on leaf emergence is dominant in warmer climates, but exerts only modest influence on the timing of leaf emergence in colder climates. Results from models estimated using ground-based observations of cloned lilac are consistent with those from remote sensing, which supports the realism of remote sensing-based models. Overall, results from this study suggest that apparent changes in the sensitivity of trees to temperature are modest and reflect a trade-off between decreased sensitivity to temperature and increased photoperiod control, and identify a transition in the relative importance of temperature versus photoperiod near the 10 degrees C isotherm in mean annual temperature. This suggests that the timing of leaf emergence will continue to move earlier as the climate warms, and that the magnitude of change will be more pronounced in colder regions with mean annual temperatures below 10 degrees C.

TI  - 'Creation out of nothing' - A problematic assumption: biblical, metaphysical and scientific perspectives
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Science, technology, commerce and consumerism have set humankind on a trajectory towards a catastrophe of inestimable proportions. To respond appropriately to this danger, theology must replace obsolete contextualisations of its message with currently relevant ones. 'Creation out of nothing' is a case in point. Will God create a new and perfect world 'out of nothing' after we have messed up the one we have? Probably not! In Part I, I show that 'creation out of nothing' is not a relevant issue in the biblical tradition. In Part II, I argue that the concept is based on the unsupported metaphysical postulate of 'divine perfection'. In Part III, I try to find an equivalent for the concept in science that theology could link up with. 'Creation' can be equated with a cosmic evolution proceeding in levels of emergence. But 'out of nothing' cannot be supported by science. Even at the most fundamental level, energy and the way it operates, are presupposed. At lower levels, the process is guided by causality and (embedded) contingency. Intentionality and agency only appear at the personal and social levels. Dealing with existential needs, faith (appropriately) intuits a personal transcendent Source and Destiny of reality, but (inappropriately) absolutizes the personal at the expense of the impersonal aspects of reality. The laws of nature are also of God; they are essential; they are valid. They leave sufficient space for novelty and agency, but God works as much through regularity as through contingency.Contribution: The dynamic nature of the biblical tradition demands constant re-contextualisations of its central message. 'Creation out of nothing' is part of the contextualisation of the message into the ancient Hellenistic worldview, which does not fit into the modern scientific worldview and must be replaced with a contemporarily more appropriate alternative.

TI  - Exploratory Study of the Clinical Value of Near-Infrared Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping With Indocyanine Green in Vulvar Cancer Patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to evaluate the clinical value of indocyanine green sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in patients with vulvar cancer. The conventional procedure of SLN mapping in vulvar cancer includes peritumoral injection of technetium-99m nanocolloid before surgery and intraoperative injection of a blue dye. However, these techniques harbor some limitations. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green has gained popularity in SLN mapping in different types of cancer.MethodsWe analyzed retrospectively vulvar cancer patients at our institution between 2013 and 2020 undergoing indocyanine green SLN mapping by applying video telescope operating microscope system technology.Results64 groins of 34 patients were analyzed. In 53 groins we used technetium-99m nanocolloid, in four patent blue, and in five both techniques, additionally to indocyanine green for SLN detection. In total, 120 SLNs were identified and removed. The SLN detection rate of indocyanine green was comparable to technetium-99m nanocolloid (p=.143) and higher than patent blue (p=.003). The best results were achieved using a combination of ICG and technetium-99m nanocolloid (detection rate of 96.9%). SLN detection rates of indocyanine green were significantly higher in patients with positive lymph nodes (p=.035) and lymphatic space invasion (p=.004) compared to technetium-99m nanocolloid.ConclusionIndocyanine green SLN mapping in vulvar cancer is feasible and safe, with reasonable detection rates. Due to its easy application and few side effects, it offers a sound alternative to the conventional SLN mapping techniques in vulvar cancer. In patients with lymph node metastasis, indocyanine green even outperformed technetium-99m nanocolloid in terms of detection rate.

TI  - Buddhist approach to corporate sustainability
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The win-win paradigm of corporate sustainability suggests that firms can transform sustainability issues into strategic opportunities, thereby creating shared values at the intersection of business and society. This study explores an alternate approach by delving into Buddhism and its meditative tradition. To deeply immerse myself into the monastic life of Buddhist monks and their meditation practice, I conducted a 5-year ethnographic fieldwork in 82 Buddhist temples across Asia. In the fieldwork process, I was even ordained as a Buddhist monk to internalize the practice. This level of immersion allowed me to investigate the nature of Buddhist meditative mindfulness and its role in reframing corporate sustainability. Drawing upon the findings and relevant literature, I suggest a Buddhist approach to corporate sustainability that offers a unique worldview on the interrelationships between economy, society, and environment. In conclusion, I compare the Buddhist approach to the win-win paradigm.

TI  - Monitoring and simulating the distribution of phytoplankton in constructed wetlands based on SPOT 6 images
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We integrated hyperspectral and field-measured chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data from the Kristalbad constructed wetland in the Netherlands. We developed a best-fit band ratio empirical algorithm to generate a distribution map of Chl-a concentration (C-chla) from SPOT 6 imagery. The C-chla retrieved from remote sensing was compared with a water quality model established for a wetland pond system. The retrieved satellite results were combined with a water quality model to simulate and predict the changes in phytoplankton levels. The regression model provides good retrievals for Chl-a. The imagery-derived C-chla performed well in calibrating the simulation results. For each pond, the modeled C-chla showed a range of values similar to the Chl-a data derived from SPOT 6 imagery (10-25 mg m(-3)). The imagery-derived and prediction model results could be used as the guiding analytical tools to provide information covering an entire study area and to inform policies.

TI  - Predictors of False Negative Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Clinically Localized Merkel Cell Carcinoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is routinely recommended for clinically localized Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC); however, predictors of false negative (FN) SLNB are undefined. Methods Patients from six centers undergoing wide excision and SLNB for stage I/II MCC (2005-2020) were identified and were classified as having either a true positive (TP), true negative (TN) or FN SLNB. Predictors of FN SLNB were identified and survival outcomes were estimated. Results Of 525 patients, 28 (5.4%), 329 (62.7%), and 168 (32%) were classified as FN, TN, and TP, respectively, giving an FN rate of 14.3% and negative predictive value of 92.2% for SLNB. Median follow-up for SLNB-negative patients was 27 months, and median time to nodal recurrence for FN patients was 7 months. Male sex (hazard ratio [HR] 3.15, p = 0.034) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (HR 2.22, p = 0.048) significantly correlated with FN, and increasing age trended toward significance (HR 1.04, p = 0.067). The 3-year regional nodal recurrence-free survival for males >75 years with LVI was 78.5% versus 97.4% for females <= 75 years without LVI (p = 0.009). Five-year disease-specific survival (90.9% TN vs. 51.3% FN, p < 0.001) and overall survival (69.9% TN vs. 48.1% FN, p = 0.035) were significantly worse for FN patients. Conclusion Failure to detect regional nodal microscopic disease by SLNB is associated with worse survival in clinically localized MCC. Males, patients >75 years, and those with LVI may be at increased risk for FN SLNB. Consideration of increased nodal surveillance following negative SLNB in these high-risk patients may aid in early identification of regional nodal recurrences.

TI  - Comparison of two intraoperative examination methods for the diagnosis of sentinel lymph node metastasis in clinically early stage endometrial cancer: A Turkish Gynecologic Oncology Group Study (TRSGO-SLN-003)
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study evaluated diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) frozen section examination and scrape cytology as a possible solution for management of SLN positive patients.Study design: Clinically early-stage endometrial cancer patients who underwent SLN algorithm and intraoperative SLN examination were analyzed. Findings were compared with final pathology results and diagnostic accuracy of frozen section and scrape cytology were evaluated.Results: Of the 208 eligible patients, 100 patients (48 %) had frozen section examination and 108 (52 %) had scrape cytology of the SLN. Intraoperative examination and final pathology were negative for metastasis in 187/208 (90 %) cases. The rest 21 cases had metastatic SLNs according to final pathology. 12 of 21 (57 %) metastases were classified as macrometastasis. Intraoperative examination of SLNs correctly identified 13 cases (true positive) and missed 8 cases (false negative). Five of 8 false negative cases had micrometastasis or isolated tumor cells. Considering identification of macrometastasis, sensitivity and negative predictive value were 85.71 % and 98.94 %, respectively, for the frozen section and 60.00 % and 98.15 %, respectively, for the scrape cytology.Conclusion: Frozen section examination of SLN has higher sensitivity in detecting macrometastasis compared to scrape cytology and it could help the surgeon in decision for further lymphadenectomy intraoperatively.

TI  - The role of crowdsourcing and social media in crisis mapping: a case study of a wildfire reaching Croatian City of Split
T2  - GEOENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As climate change continues, wildfire outbreaks are becoming more frequent and more difficult to control. In mid-July 2017, a forest fire spread from the forests to the city of Split in Croatia. This unpredictable spread nearly caused emergency systems to collapse. Fortunately, a major tragedy was avoided due to the composure of the responsible services and the help of citizens. Citizens helped to extinguish the fire and provided a large amount of disaster-related information on various social media platforms in a timely manner. In this paper, we addressed the problem of identifying useful Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and georeferenced social media crowdsourcing data to improve situational awareness during the forest fire in the city of Split. In addition, social media data were combined with other external data sources (e.g., Sentinel-2 satellite imagery) and authoritative data to establish geographic relationships between wildfire phenomena and social media messages. This article highlights the importance of using georeferenced social media data and provides a different perspective for disaster management by filling gaps in authoritative data. Analyses from the presented reconstruction of events from multiple sources impact a better understanding of these types of events, knowledge sharing, and insights into crowdsourcing processes that can be incorporated into disaster management.

TI  - The impact of building height on urban thermal environment in summer: A case study of Chinese megacities
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative relationship between the spatial variation of building's height and the associated land surface temperature (LST) change in six Chinese megacities is investigated in this paper. The six cities involved are Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Based on both remote sensing and building footprint data, we retrieved the LST using a single-channel (SC) algorithm and evaluate the heating/cooling effect caused by building-height difference via correlation analysis. The results show that the spatial distribution of high-rise buildings is mainly concentrated in the center business districts, riverside zones, and newly built-up areas of the six megacities. In the urban area, the number and the floor-area ratio of high to super high-rise buildings (>24m) account for over 5% and 4.74%, respectively. Being highly urbanized cities, most of urban areas in the six megacities are associated with high LST. Ninety-nine percent of the city areas of Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Tianjin are covered by the LST in the range of 30.2 similar to 67.8 degrees C, 34.8 similar to 50.4 degrees C, 25.3 similar to 48.3 degrees C, 29.9 similar to 47.2 degrees C, 27.4 similar to 43.4 degrees C, and 33.0 similar to 48.0 degrees C, respectively. Building's height and LST have a negative logarithmic correlation with the correlation coefficients ranging from -0.701 to -0.853. In the building's height within range of 0 similar to 66m, the LST will decrease significantly with the increase of building's height. This indicates that the increase of building's height will bring a significant cooling effect in this height range. When the building's height exceeds 66m, its effect on LST will be greatly weakened. This is due to the influence of building shadows, local wind disturbances, and the layout of buildings.

TI  - Subpixel Mapping Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Fusion Data for Land-Cover Classes
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Subpixel mapping (SPM) based on multisource remote sensing fusion data (MRSFD) for land-cover classes, called SPM-MRSFD, is proposed in this letter. First, the original hyperspectral image and the auxiliary panchromatic image are fused to produce the high spatial and spectral resolution fused image by pan-sharpening technology. Second, the fused image with spatial-spectral information and the auxiliary digital surface model (DSM) of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with elevation information are fused to obtain the MRSFD with spatial-spectral elevation information by feature fusion. Finally, the fractional images with the proportions of subpixels belonging to land-cover classes are derived by unmixing the MRSFD, and the classes labels are allocated to subpixels to obtain the final SPM result according to these proportions' information. The main contribution of this work is that multiple types of auxiliary information (i.e., spatial-spectral elevation information) from MRSFD is fully utilized and the accuracy of SPM result is improved. Experimental results show that SPM-MRSFD obtains more accurate mapping results than state-of-the-art SPM methods.

TI  - Generational Change in Religion and Religious Practice: A Review Essay
T2  - REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Numerous studies have been done of the religious affiliations, beliefs, and practices of the Millennial generation (North Americans born between 1980 and 1995). Many of these studies assume that their findings will be useful to denominations and congregations wishing to attract more young people. But at least one influential social theory would imply the opposite: that religious decline is inevitable as societies modernize and secularize. Purpose The current essay suggests a useful addition to the religious decline theory, the work of Karl Mannheim and his followers on the sociology of generations, and applies it to the major studies of generational change and continuity in religious practice among young adults in present-day North America. Methods In total, 35 academic books, 43 articles in refereed journals, and 22 denominational research reports are included in the analysis. Only works studying the religious beliefs, practices, and affiliations of the Millennial generation in the United States and Canada, and based on data collected through approved social science research methods are included. Results The essay first summarizes the findings of the studies, noting similarities and differences in religious decline across the various social locations of race, gender, and country. Next, it summarizes the causes that the various studies have postulated for this decline, relating them to Mannheim's argument that the "fresh encounter" with one's childhood religious worldview which occurs in young adulthood is a key determinant of whether a person accepts or rejects his/her childhood religious socialization. A final section evaluates the effectiveness of the suggestions that some of the studies make for stemming or reversing religious decline in young adulthood, in the light of Mannheim's theory. Conclusions and Implications A key determinant of religious affiliation, belief, and practice in adulthood is the fresh encounter that young adults have with the culture and worldview transmitted to them in childhood. The lifecycle stage of emerging adulthood poses a challenge to denominations and congregations since it is often the age group that is least connected with organized religion. The essay concludes with suggestions for further research.

TI  - Land use and land cover changes driven by expansion of eucalypt plantations in the Western Gurage Watersheds, Centeral-south Ethiopia
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is a common trend in all parts of the globe. The possible reasons might be economic, political, social or cultural motives. In Ethiopia, most of the rural and urban people are highly dependent on eucalypts for various purposes, particularly, for fuel wood and construction materials. In the study area, Western Gurage Watersheds of Omo-Gibe Basin, eucalypt plantations have become the emergent and dominant activity next to growing Enset. The specific objectives of this study were to assess the land use and land cover changes driven by eucalypt plantations over time and agro-ecological extent, and to identify socio-economic, demographic, and environmental factors that facilitated expansion of eucalypts plantation.Landsat images from 1987 (TM), 2001 (ETM) and 2017 (Landsat 8 OLI) were used for detecting LULC changes. Digital image processing operations, i.e. haze removal, geo-referencing, contrast enhancement and classification, were completed using ERDAS Imagine 2011 Software. During the period between 1987 and 2017, the area cover of LULC types, namely plantation forest, Enset-based agroforestry, cereal crop and built-up areas increased in the study watersheds at the expenses of natural forests and grassland. The total forest cover declined in the study period from 1987-2000 and, then, increased from 2001-2017 as a result of expansion of eucalypts in bare land, grazing land and cereal crop land use types. The drivers for the expansion of eucalypts in the watersheds are population growth, Wiesker and 'Arafah' celebrations, land degradation and conservation, road development, increased access to markets, and economic factors, such as the growing need for fuel wood, construction materials, and growing need for money. The divergent interest of stakeholders, skepticism and debate around eucalypts are presented; call for further scientific investigations and management options are recommended.

TI  - The 2003 Ms6.1 Minle Earthquake: An Earthquake in the Minle-Yongchang Reverse Fault-Related Fold Belt in the Hexi Corridor, NW China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Minle-Yongchang fault is an active reverse fault-related fold structural belt developed in the Hexi Corridor Basin on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. An earthquake of Ms6.1 occurred near the Minle-Yongchang fault zone in 2003. The deformation pattern of the Minle-Yongchang fault and its relationship with this strong earthquake, however, are still not well known. In this study, we used the methods of HYPOINVERSE absolute location and double-difference location with waveform cross-correlation technology to relocate the 2003 Minle earthquake sequence. In total, 383 earthquakes are precisely relocated. Based on the results of precise seismic relocation, using the method of determining fault planes by small earthquakes, the seismogenic fault is found to be a low-angle thrust with a strike of 311 degrees, a dip of NE, and a dip angle of 14 degrees. It does not rupture the surface, extends to 19-20 km depth, and is hidden beneath the Yonggu Anticline. We also employed the cut-and-paste (CAP) method with a broadband waveform to determine the focal mechanism of the mainshock in 2003: the strike is 311 degrees; the dip is 34 degrees; and the rake is 90 degrees. The fault plane parameters obtained in these two ways are roughly consistent. We also used a digital elevation model (DEM) derived from the SPOT 6 stereo image pair and high-precision differential Global Positioning System (GPS) to measure the displacement of terraces. Topographic profiles along the terraces across the Minle-Yongchang fault show that high alluvial terrain exhibits fold deformation. The vertical offsets of the T2 and T3 terraces along the Tongziba River are approximately 2.3 and 22 m, respectively. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating indicates that the ages of T2 and T3 are 11.3 and 106 ka, respectively. We calculated an average uplift rate of 0.21 +/- 0.05 mm/a by dividing the vertical offset by age. According to the spatial distribution of the relocated earthquake sequence and terrace deformation in the study area, the Ms6.1 Minle earthquake in 2003 was caused by the latest activity of a blind reverse fault-related fold in the Hexi Corridor Basin.

TI  - The Survival of Maya Blue in Sixteenth-Century Mexican Colonial Mural Paintings
T2  - STUDIES IN CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The famous Maya blue, a nanostructured hybrid organic-inorganic material, has been the subject of numerous studies since its discovery in 1931. These mainly focused on mural paintings, manuscripts, cultural artifacts from ancient Mesoamerica, and notable examples of syncretic art produced in early colonial times in New Spain as a result of the convergence of Mesoamerican and European traditions. This article reports on the identification of Maya blue in the wall painting programs of four mendicant monasteries founded in Southern and Central Mexico during the sixteenth century. It discusses the pictorial effects, painting mixtures, and artistic inventiveness of indigenous artists who expressed themselves through the quality of color and the meanings of materials by using Maya blue in Christian images. This article proposes that Maya blue reappeared in the palette of local artists in the second half of the sixteenth century, as a traditional technology that integrated the complex worldview of Mesoamerican cultures and their knowledge of its extraction, production, and use in the art of painting.

TI  - Targeted Axillary Dissection in Node-Positive Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Study and Cost Analysis
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionTargeted axillary dissection (TAD) is a novel technique in the field of surgical oncology. During TAD, patients with node-positive breast cancer who clinically responded to neoadjuvant chemotherapy undergo resection of a previously proven metastatic node together with sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND). We aimed to assess the success rates of seed insertion and seed retrieval in the Canadian setting, as well as hospital costs of the procedure.MethodsPatients converted to clinically node-negative status post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy underwent TAD. Before surgery, an iodine-125 radioactive seed was inserted in the previously proven metastatic node. The seed node was resected together with an SLND. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in all patients with residual metastases.ResultsRadioactive seeds were successfully inserted in 34/35 patients. In 34 patients, the targeted node was successfully resected with the radioactive probe during TAD. In one patient, the seed was retrieved inferiorly in the axilla during surgery. There was no adverse event. In total, 50% (17/34) of patients had no residual metastases and were able to avoid ALND. Eight out of 17 patients who underwent ALND did not have any residual disease in their specimen. The mean cost of TAD was 25% superior to the mean cost of ALND (p = 0.02). However, the mean total cost of the hospital stay for TAD was 20% superior to the mean cost of ALND (p = 0.11). The mean cost of TAD was 4,322 Can$ (Canadian dollars), similar to the mean cost of both ALND and SLND performed during the same procedure (4,479 Can$).ConclusionsTAD was successful in 97% of patients. Despite increased procedural costs, with a lesser impact on total hospital stay costs, TAD was beneficial in 50% of patients. These patients avoided the unnecessary morbidity associated with ALND.

TI  - GRACE reveals depletion of water storage in northwestern South America between ENSO extremes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamics of terrestrial water storage are determinant for many natural and social phenomena, with implications for water security and environmental sustainability. Here we use 2002-2017 data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) to study these dynamics in the Magdalena-Cauca river basin in northwestern South America. Through comparison with water balance-based estimates we assess the performance of multiple GRACE products in representing water storage dynamics in the basin, identifying the Mascon product from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as the best suited for further analysis. We then investigate the existence of long term trends and show that terrestrial water storage in general and groundwater storage in particular have been gradually depleting in the basin since around the end of 2010. GRACE data reveal that this trend is not uniform across the basin but exhibits a clear-cut pattern in which the water depletion rate is more pronounced in the lower parts of the basin than it is in the upper basin. We explore the mechanisms behind the identified temporal trends and spatial patterns and show that water storage depletion largely coincides with a period between the La Nina and El Nino extreme phases of ENSO. Likewise, the pronounced contrast between depletion rates in the lower and higher parts of the basin largely coincides with marked biophysical differences between these regions, including the presence of major wetland systems in the lowlands, and the highlands of the Andean mountains.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Coherence for Mapping Above-Ground Biomass in Semiarid Forest Areas
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The interferometric coherence of repeat-pass C-band synthetic aperture radar observations has shown potential for mapping forest above-ground biomass (AGB) when images were acquired with short temporal repeat intervals and under stable environmental conditions. Since 2014, Sentinel-1 collects repeated interferometric image pairs at global scale with repeat intervals of 6 or 12 days. For a semiarid forest site in California, we evaluated one year of Sentinel-1 6- and 12-day (60 and 59 images, respectively) repeat-pass coherence images with the objective of retrieving AGB. The retrieval was performed by inverting the semiempirical Interferometric Water Cloud Model. The retrieval based on individual coherence images was most accurate (similar to 50% relative root-mean-square difference with respect to a Lidar-derived map) when images were acquired in extended periods of dry conditions. The retrieval accuracy improved by approximately 15% units when combining multiple coherence images in the retrieval. Finally, the accuracy of the retrieval with multitemporal 6- or 12-day repeat-pass coherence images differed by only 2% units. The results of this study advocate consideration of Sentinel-1 repeat-pass coherence in AGB mapping efforts in semiarid forest areas.

TI  - An automatic classification algorithm for submerged aquatic vegetation in shallow lakes using Landsat imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is one of the main producers in inland lakes. Tracking the temporal and spatial changes in SAV is crucial for the identification of state changes in lacustrine ecosystems, such as changes in light, nutrients, and temperature. However, the available SAV classification algorithms based on remote sensing are highly dependent on field survey data and/or human interventions, prohibiting the extraction of large-scale and/or long-term patterns. Here, we developed an automatic SAV classification algorithm using Landsat imagery, where the thresholds of two key parameters (the floating algae index (FAI) and reflectance in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band) are automatically determined. The algorithm was applied to eight Landsat images of four Yangtze Plain lakes and obtained a mean producer accuracy of 82.9% when gauged against field-surveyed datasets. The algorithm was further employed to obtain long-term SAV areal data from Changdang Lake on the Yangtze Plain from 1984 to 2018, and the result was highly consistent with lake transparency data. Numerical simulations indicated that our developed algorithm is insensitive to the Chl-a concentration of the water column. Yet, it has a detection limit of similar to 0.35 m below the water surface, and such a limit changes with different fractions of vegetation coverage within a pixel. The automatic classification algorithm proposed in this study has the potential to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of SAV in other shallow lakes where SAV grows in lakes sharing similar hydrological characteristics as the lakes in the Yangtze Plain.

TI  - Diversity and Inclusion in Integral Education: A Teaching Perspective of Integral Psychology
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article offers reflections and proposes practices that embody principles of diversity and inclusion while embracing spirituality in higher education. This approach to integral education is informed by the philosophy of Sri Aurobindo and Haridas Chaudhuri, founders of the California Institute of Integral Studies. It blends Eastern philosophy with Western thought, towards holistic education and experiential learning. This integral frame values both spirituality and diversity in experiential learning, emphasizing the role of the teacher in the educational process. In this pedagogy, the professor facilitates learning and transformation through deep personal inquiry of multicultural identity, group dynamics, productive dialogue, inclusion of diverse perspectives in classroom lectures, and practices of yoga and meditation. Relational and embodied, the instructor explores cultural, social, and political positionalities that lead students to further learn from their cultural backgrounds and relational patterns, opening up the possibility for a spiritual experience in an educational setting. These classroom explorations lead to the improvement of interpersonal capacities, multicultural awareness, self-knowledge and authenticity, expansion of consciousness, and ultimately better citizenship. The self-actualized instructor embedded in a transpersonal worldview within a spiritual epistemology of teaching further develops the efficacy of their role by acknowledging the multicultural fabric of students' lives. This pedagogy may contribute to the evolution of consciousness.

TI  - An artificial intelligent framework for prediction of wildlife vehicle collision hotspots based on geographic information systems and multispectral imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collision - WVC is a phenomenon that arises from the fragmentation of ecosystems by roads, limiting the mobility of individuals and putting at risk the stability of populations by increasing mortality. Colombia is not unaware of the problem of the WVC, evidenced in different scientific publications that describe the WVC in the roads of the country. Although the rise of artificial intelligence has significant advances in the prediction of spatial phenomena in recent years, it has not yet been sufficiently explored by Road Ecology. For this reason, this research aimed to develop a methodology to predict the sites of accumulation of WVC in eastern Antioquia, Colombia, based on artificial intelligence algorithms, geographic information systems - GIS, and multispectral image processing. During the development of this research, it was identified that the features most related to the WVC in the study area are: Distance to Forest, Distance to Biological Corridor, Ground Resistance to Movement, Cost of Movement, the bands of the Landsat 8 satellite: 9, 10, 11 and the normalized burning index (NBRI). Different machine learning algorithms were compared (k-nearest neighbours, support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and artificial neural networks). SMOTE and ADASYN balancing techniques were applied. The results allowed to identify that the RF algorithm with ADASYN yielded the best performance when subjected to spatial-wise cross-validation (AUC-ROC 0.78 +/- 0.12), surpassing the results of current state-of-theart. Finally, the methodology was validated through a transfer learning experiment, training the RF-ADASYN algorithm with three zones of the eastern Antioquia region and validating on a different section (AUC-ROC = 0.87 +/- 0.09), retraining the initial model with 5% of data from the validation database.

TI  - Semi-automated method for the mapping of alluvial fans from DEM
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alluvial fans are among the principal geomorphological features that have an influence on the development of human societies, particularly in arid regions. In view of the salience of these triangular-shaped deposits to environmental management, an accurate mapping of alluvial fans within a specific region could prove significantly advantageous. This study proposes a method for semi-automated detection of alluvial fans based on the analysis of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The proposed method is a novel Symmetry Model DEM (SMDEM), which extracts alluvial fans the pseudo-basin concept. This method is capable of accurate detection of alluvial fans and all their segmentations (i.e. lobes), apex, and toe when they are delimited by boundary drainage (lateral and toe drainage channels). The method was tested analyzing different environmental scenarios and was evaluated by comparing the output of the model with satellite data. The alluvial fans analyzed with the SMDEM model are the Lannemezan (12,303 km(2)), Xinhe (5572 km(2)), and Naien (1668 km(2)) fans, which are among the largest in Europe, China, and Iran, respectively.

TI  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the utilization of emergency department services for the treatment of injuries
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the utilization of healthcare services; however, the impact on population-level emergency department (ED) utilization patterns for the treatment of acute injuries has not been fully characterized. Objective: This study examined the frequency of North Carolina (NC) EDs visits for selected injury mechanisms during the first eleven months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were obtained from the NC Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT), NC's legislatively mandated statewide syndromic surveillance system for the years 2019 and 2020. Frequencies of January - November 2020 NC ED visits were compared to frequencies of 2019 visits for selected injury mechanisms, classified according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) injury diagnosis and mechanism codes. Results: In 2020, the total number of injury-related visits declined by 19.5% (N = 651,158) as compared to 2019 (N = 809,095). Visits related to motor vehicle traffic crashes declined by a greater percentage (29%) and falls (19%) declined by a comparable percentage to total injury-related visits. Visits related to assault (15%) and self-harm (10%) declined by smaller percentages. Medication/drug overdose visits increased (10%), the only injury mechanism studied to increase during this period. Conclusion: Both ED avoidance and decreased exposures may have contributed to these declines, creating implications for injury morbidity and mortality. Injury outcomes exacerbated by the pandemic should be addressed by timely public health responses. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vulnerability assessment of water resources using GIS, remote sensing and SWAT model - a case study: the upper part of Dong Nai river basin, Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources vulnerability assessment provides the basis for the policymakers and the stakeholders regarding the state of the river basin to be focused for its better management. This research aims to assess the vulnerability index (VI) of the upper part of the Dong Nai (UPDN) river basin, which plays a crucial role for the socio-economic development of Ho Chi Minh City and 10 other provinces in the Southeast Vietnam, as well as its sub-basins. This study accounts from the year 1994 to 2030 (36 years) by using an integrated solution between the GIS, remote sensing (RS) and SWAT model in collaboration with guidelines prepared by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Peking University. Results from the land cover classification of Landsat images in the period of 1994-2020 revealed that the forest area decreased by 324,586 ha (approximately 29.4% of the basin area) and greatly influenced the VI. The UPDN basin's water vulnerability was a moderate level of which VI was 0.276, 0.303 and 0.310 in 1994, 2004 and 2014, respectively. By 2030, the projected VI value could expect to be 0.318 under the climate change scenarios of the representative concentration pathway (RCP4.5). At the sub-basins, Dak Nong and Dak R'Keh were two of the most vulnerable sub-basins of which VIs have could reach approximately 0.4 categorized as highly vulnerable areas. The results evidenced that the integrated techniques could be an efficient approach to provide useful information on the status of water resources to stakeholders in evaluating comprehensive options in terms of sustainable water resources management.

TI  - Risk factors and patterns of recurrence after sentinel lymph node biopsy for thin melanoma
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - While having a thin melanoma (defined as AJCC 8 T1 stage tumor <= 1.0 mm) with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) provides an excellent prognosis, some patients still develop recurrence and die. To determine risk factors for any recurrence (local/in-transit, nodal, distant) in thin melanoma patients with negative SLNB and assess survival outcomes. Retrospective review of thin melanomas with negative SLNB from 1999 to 2018 was performed. Two hundred and nine patients were identified. Clinicopathologic characteristics of the primary melanoma were collected. Patterns of recurrence for local/in-transit, nodal or distant recurrence and survival outcomes were analyzed. Eighteen patients (8.6%) developed recurrence: 3 (1.9%) local/in-transit, 4 (2.9%) regional/nodal, and 11 (5.3%) distant recurrence during a median follow-up time of 62 months. A multivariate Cox regression model showed that head and neck site (HR 3.52), ulceration (HR 10.8), and mitotic rate (HR 1.39) were significant risk factors for recurrence. Median time to first recurrence was 49 months. Patients with recurrence had a significantly worse 5 year overall survival than those without recurrence (82.2 vs 99.2%). A retrospective single center study and limited sample size. Did not factor in possible false negative SLNBs when calculating hazard ratios. For thin melanoma patients with negative SLNB, heightened surveillance is warranted for those with ulceration, primary tumor location on the head or neck, and elevated mitotic rate.

TI  - Arm Morbidity After Local Therapy for Young Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The impact of patient demographics and local therapy choice on arm morbidity in young breast cancer patients is understudied despite its importance given the long survivorship period. This study assessed patient-reported arm morbidity in the Young Women's Breast Cancer Study (YWS), a prospective cohort study. Methods From 2006 to 2016, 1302 women with breast cancer diagnosed at the age of 40 years or younger enrolled in the YWS. The participants regularly complete surveys. The response rates are higher than 86%. Using the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Checklist, this study examined the prevalence of patient-reported postoperative arm swelling and decreased range of motion (ROM) 1 year after diagnosis, stratified by local therapy strategy, in patients who had surgery for stages 1 to 3 disease. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for arm morbidity. Results Among 888 eligible participants (median age, 37 years), 14% reported arm swelling and 34% reported decreased ROM at 1 year. Arm swelling was reported by 23.6% of the patients who had axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and 24.6% of the patients who received ALND and post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT). In the multivariable analysis, the patients who reported being financially uncomfortable or who had ALND were at higher risk of arm swelling at 1 year. Being overweight, receiving ALND after sentinel lymph node biopsy, and receiving PMRT were associated with decreased ROM at 1 year. Conclusion High rates of self-reported arm morbidity in young breast cancer survivors were reported, particularly in patients receiving ALND and PMRT. Attention to the risks and benefits of differing local therapy strategies for ALND and PMRT patients is warranted.

TI  - Estimating global aerodynamic parameters in 1982-2017 using remote-sensing data and a turbulent transfer model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The bulk surface properties, including canopy height (h), zero-plane displacement height (d), roughness length (z0), and aerodynamic resistance (rb and rd), are crucial biophysical parameters that influence momentum, energy and mass exchanges at the land-atmosphere interface. The variabilities of these parameters are important for understanding possible impacts of the ecosystem on climate change, yet they have not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of large-scale, long-term observations. Here we provide global estimates of these bulk aerodynamic parameters, including d, z0, rb, and rd, for the period 1982-2017 based on remote-sensed leaf area index (LAI), h, and plant functional type dependent canopy morphological characteristics. The global h estimate is acquired from LAI using a semi-empirical relation in which the coefficients have been optimized based on the canopy height product from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). Two LAI products, Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) and Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS), are used to calculate canopy height and parameters separately. The products derived from the above two LAI datasets agree very well (spatial correlation coefficient, SCC = 0.99, relative root-mean-square-error, rRMSE = 8.28% for h, SCC = 0.99, rRMSE = 12.15% for d, and SCC = 0.98, rRMSE = 13.78% for z0). Verification of the products against in-situ canopy height records from the FLUXNET and eddy-covariance (EC)-based d and z0 estimates shows that the estimates can reproduce the annual means and seasonal variations of the bulk surface properties. We found significant positive trends in global h (0.04-0.05% year-1), d (0.07% year- 1) and z0 (0.07% year- 1) associated with the Earth greening, but they are different from the trend in LAI (0.14-0.25% year-1). The differences between the trends in LAI and the trends in derived parameters are also found in different latitudes. For instance, in the Northern Hemisphere Polar region, the GLASS LAI increases by 0.48% year- 1, leading to positive trends of 0.03% year- 1 in h, 0.18% in d, and 0.20% year- 1 in z0. The above results highlight the importance of comprehensively considering changes in LAI, canopy height, and aerodynamic parameters when evaluating the effects of ecosystem change on climate. This long-term dataset can be used in climate models to assess the response of bulk aerodynamic parameters to climate changes and the impact of vegetation dynamics on regional and global climate.

TI  - Ultrasound lymphatic imaging for the diagnosis of metastatic central lymph nodes in papillary thyroid cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Up to 40% of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients have lymph node metastasis, a condition that implies persistent, recurrent, or progressive disease. However, the American Joint Committee on Cancer Manual states that there is no reliable examination for adequate lymph node staging. Therefore, our aim is to develop a lymphatic imaging technique using ultrasonography to address this challenge. Methods We consecutively enrolled PTC patients who underwent ultrasound (US) lymphatic imaging via the peritumoral injection of contrast media. Identification of the sentinel lymph nodes and the targeted sentinel lymph nodes was separately based on the lymphatic drainage pathway and the enhancement patterns. Every identified targeted node was assigned a score, according to the features on conventional US and enhancement patterns, and was referred for ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Cytological and histopathologic results represented the statuses of the targeted lymph nodes and overall central lymph nodes, respectively, which were applied to evaluate the diagnostic performance of US lymphatic imaging. Results In total, 100 PTC patients were included. On the basis of the cytological results, the sensitivity (97.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 84.7-99.9%) of detecting positive targeted nodes by US lymphatic imaging significantly increased by 45.5% at a threshold of 4 or higher (p = 0.0001), without loss of specificity (p = 1.0000). The surgical results showed that the metastatic degree was positively correlated with an increase in the score (tau: 0.671, p < 0.001). Conclusion Ultrasound lymphatic imaging has a high diagnostic performance, and its corresponding scoring system facilitates grading of the nodal burden in the central compartment.

TI  - Surgery for Good Prognosis Breast Cancers
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review The introduction of mammographic screening programmes has resulted increasing numbers of women with small breast cancers with biologically favourable characteristics. Many of these cancers may represent overdiagnosis, with a resulting treatment burden for women and healthcare costs for providers. Here, current surgical approaches to the treatment of such tumours are reviewed, together with alternative approaches to their management. Recent Findings The surgical treatment of small, screen-detected breast cancers with biologically favourable characteristics has been extrapolated from the management of symptomatic breast cancers. There is no prospective randomised evidence for conventional open surgery compared with other approaches in this setting. A number of minimally invasive techniques, most notable vacuum-assisted excision, have been described for the management of these tumours, but at present, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to support their routine use. There are currently ongoing randomised trials evaluating risk-adapted surgical and minimally invasive approaches to the management of good prognosis disease. It is possible that the surgical treatment of good prognosis screen-detected breast cancers may be de-escalated. However, high-quality evidence from ongoing prospective randomised trials will be required in order to change clinical practice.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Classification for Crop-Type Mapping Using the Fusion of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery in a Semiarid Area
T2  - SCIENTIFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of cultivated crops and the types of different land covers is a relevant environmental and economic issue for agricultural lands management and crop yield prediction. In this context, this paper aims to use and evaluate the contribution of multisensors classification based on machine learning classifiers to crop-type identification in a semiarid area of Morocco. It is a very heterogeneous zone characterized by mixed crops (tree crops with annual crops, same crop with different phenological states during the same agricultural season, crop rotation, etc.). Therefore, such heterogeneity made the crop-type discrimination more complicated. To overcome these challenges, the present work is the first study in this area which used the fusion of high spatiotemporal resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images for land use and land cover mapping. Three machine learning classifier algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML), were applied to identify and map crop types in irrigated perimeter. In situ observations of the year 2018, for the R3 perimeter of Haouz plain in central Morocco, were used with satellite data of the same year to perform this work. The results showed that combined images acquired in C-band and the optical range improved clearly the crop-type classification performance (overall accuracy = 89%; Kappa = 0.85) compared to the classification results of optical or SAR data alone.

TI  - Estimating the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration within the Pra River Basin of Ghana
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important in water resource planning to accurately estimate the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration (ET) as an input parameter for hydrological studies. Although, conventional pan evaporation, lysimetric and eddy covariance techniques have been used, they only estimate point values. Hence, this study aimed at estimating the spatial distribution of ET within the Pra River Basin (a forest ecological zone) of Ghana, using cloud-free Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) satellite images employing the SEBAL methodology. The study further estimates the spatial distribution ET in relation to major climatic variables, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) types and energy balance components. The overall spatial distribution of ET had a mean value of 5.63 mm/day. Spatial distribution of ET (mm/ day) for water body (5.51-7.81) and uncultivated forest (5.10-7.71) were high, while moderately average values were observed for logged forest (4.80-7.51). Settlement and bare landscapes observed low rates ((2.05-5.10) mm/day). Spatially, ET was higher in the upper western, central and the eastern parts of the basin, but lower in the northern part and pockets of areas at the southern part of the basin where settlement/bare landscape and logged forest dominate. Areas with high temperature and high solar radiation experiences high ET, while low wind speed, low to average temperature and solar radiation areas experience low ET. Also, areas with both high net radiation and ground heat flux but low to average sensible heat flux experiences high ET and vice versa. Linear regression analysis showed good fit with slope of 0.76 and R-2 of 0.93 indicating that 93% of the variations in observed field measurement of ET fitted perfectly well with ET distributions generated by the SEBAL model.

TI  - Impact of climate warming on the surface water temperature of plateau lake
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is a vital indicator in evaluating the ecological environment and has a direct or indirect impact on regulating physical, chemical, and ecological processes of lakes. Changes in LSWT have a huge impact on the water quality, ecosystem function, and biome composition of the entire lake. In this study, we selected Dianchi Lake as the research area, the monthly average LSWT data collected at the monitoring station from 1998 to 2009 were used as the calibration dataset. The error analysis dataset is the average annual temperatures of the Dianchi Lake extracted from MODIS remote sensing images from 2001 to 2017. The daily average LSWT of Dianchi Lake was estimated by the air-water model and the historical changes from 1980 to 2017 of the LSWT were reproduced. The research draws a conclusion that the LSWT of Dianchi Lake has been greatly affected by air temperature over the past 37 years. LSWT and the annual average air temperature correlation coefficient were R > 0.9. Both the air temperature and LSWT assumed an increasing tendency. The annual average LSWT increased with the rate of 0.36 degrees C/decade, and the annual average warming rate of the air temperature was 0.47 degrees C/decade. The monthly average LSWT and air temperature showed a significant correlation at a confidence interval of alpha = 0.001. The LSWT of Dianchi Lake increased significantly in February, March, and December. The periodicity of the seasonal mean air temperature change was consistent with that of the LSWT in Dianchi Lake. The relative lag of the thermal response of the LSWT to climate warming was also observed. This study fills in the gaps in the long-term sequence data on the LSWT of Dianchi Lake and reveals the effect of climate warming on the LSWT of low-latitude plateau lakes.

TI  - Mesquite management in the Mezquital Valley: A sustainability assessment based on the view point of the Hnahnu indigenous community
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The indigenous community of El Alberto (Ixmiquilpan, Mexico), in the Mezquital Valley, has applied numerous uses of the mesquite (Prosopis laevigata) resources in their daily life for decades. Our objective was to understand the relationship between the rural community and this leguminous tree, to determine how sustainable their management is. For this purpose, we applied the Framework for the Evaluation of Management Systems using Indicators (MESMIS, Spanish acronym). Twenty-one indicators were identified, and a qualitative index was established to assign a sustainability value. The results identified fuelwood, fertility, forage and shade as the principal uses of mesquite nowadays. The local indigenous community does not promote the propagation of this leguminous tree but rather rely on its natural regeneration. However, the rate at which they cut down and exploit mesquite is higher than the natural regeneration rate, reflecting a low level of sustainable management. Strong equity was registered. First, there is a passive process associated with the construction of irrigation channels for agriculture, which resulted in the deforestation of the mesquite. Second, there is evidence of an active process where members of the community decide to migrate abandoning their indigenous world view, which, consequently, has impacted negatively on the mesquite resource. Change processes caused a shift in the community's worldview and led to cultural erosion. In conclusion, changes must be made to the community's current social ecological system to achieve sustainable management, such as building a strong feeling of community identity, evolution of the community's uses, customs, quality and lifestyle, and their collaboration with the scientific community.

TI  - A novel hybrid quantum-PSO and credal decision tree ensemble for tropical cyclone induced flash flood susceptibility mapping with geospatial data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash flood is considered as one of the most destructive natural hazards worldwide, especially in tropical countries, where tropical cyclones with torrential rains are recurrent problems yearly. Therefore, an accurate prediction of susceptible areas to flash floods is crucial for developing measures to prevent, avoid, and minimize damages associated with flash floods. The aim of this research is to propose a new state-of-the-art model based on hybridizing Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) and the Credal Decision Tree (CDT) ensemble, namely the QPSO-CDTreeEns model, for spatial prediction of the flash flood. The concept of the proposed model is to build a forest tree of the CDT established through the Random Subspace ensemble. Therein, QPSO is integrated to optimize the three parameters, the subspace size, number of trees, and the maximum depth of trees. A district suffered from a high frequency of flash floods in the north-western mountainous area of Vietnam was selected as a case study. In this regard, a geospatial database that includes a total of 1698 flash flood and inundation polygons derived from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images and ten input indicators were used to construct and to verify the proposed model. The result shows that the QPSO-CDT-Ens model performed well (Overall accuracy = 90.4, Kappa coefficient = 0.807) and outperformed the five machine learning algorithms in flash flood susceptibility mapping. Among the ten factors, the land-use/land-cover (LULC), the slope, the curvature, and the TWI are the most important indicators. We conclude that the proposed model is a promising tool for flash flood susceptibility mapping in the tropics and may assist decision-makers in sustainable land-use planning in the national disaster mitigation strategies.

TI  - RADARSAT Constellation Mission's Operational Polarimetric Modes: A User-Driven Radar Architecture
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Canada's Earth-observing RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is intended to serve operational users. The users' main objectives were to have routinely available high-quality quantitative information about their applications, with large area coverage potential. That two-part requirement was sufficient to establish an innovative synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimeter's end-to-end system profile, the hybrid compact polarimetric (HCP) architecture. HCP's essential and defining characteristic is circularly polarized transmission. This is sufficient to evaluate the backscatterer Stokes vector, but only half of the scattering matrix elements are measured. Hence image classification methodologies for linearly polarized full- (or quad-) pol (FP) radars that depend on knowledge of all four of the scattering matrix elements if applied to HCP-derived data lead to erroneous results. HCP-appropriate classifications are based on the Stokes vector. Related methods traditionally used for radar astronomy-for which circularly polarized transmission is the norm-are reviewed. Those known methods are extended, bringing to light fundamental characteristics of a polarimetric electromagnetic field. Analysis tools appropriate for HCP's polarimetric data are introduced. The resulting polarimetric portraits-defined as the Stokes vector of the backscattered field in response to balanced illumination of the scene-from FP and HCP polarimeters are shown to be equivalent.

TI  - Remote sensing-based water quality index estimation using data-driven approaches: a case study of the Kali River in Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study evaluates the water quality status of 6-km-long Kali River stretch that passes through the Aligarh district in Uttar Pradesh, India, by utilizing high-resolution IRS P6 LISS IV imagery. In situ river water samples collected at 40 random locations were analyzed for seven physicochemical and four heavy metal concentrations, and the water quality index (WQI) was computed for each sampling location. A set of 11 spectral reflectance band combinations were formulated to identify the most significant band combination that is related to the observed WQI at each sampling location. Three approaches, namely multiple linear regression (MLR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and gene expression programming (GEP), were employed to relate WQI as a function of most significant band combination. Comparative assessment among the three utilized approaches was performed via quantitative indicators such as R-2, RMSE and MAE. Results revealed that WQI estimates ranged between 203.7 and 262.33 and rated as "very poor" status. Results further indicated that GEP performed better than BPNN and MLR approaches and predicted WQI estimates with high R-2 values (i.e., 0.94 for calibration and 0.91 for validation data), low RMSE and MAE values (i.e., 2.49 and 2.16 for calibration and 4.45 and 3.53 for validation data). Moreover, both GEP and BPNN depicted superiority over MLR approach that yielded WQI with R-2 similar to 0.81 and 0.67 for calibration and validation data, respectively. WQI maps generated from the three approaches corroborate the existing pollution levels along the river stretch. In order to examine the significant differences among WQI estimates from the three approaches, one-way ANOVA test was performed, and the results in terms of F-statistic (F = 0.01) and p-value (p = 0.994 > 0.05) revealed WQI estimates as "not significant," reasoned to the small water sample size (i.e., N = 40). The study therefore recommends GEP as more rational and a better alternative for precise water quality monitoring of surface water bodies by producing simplified mathematical expressions.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid global economic expansion has resulted in a drastic increase of urbanization while impacting the Earth's entire ecology. This study evaluates the impact of historical land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) change signatures on seasonal variation of climatic variables using a cloud platform-Google Earth Engine. Due to rapid urbanization and the noticeable spatio-temporal difference in the climate, administrative units of Dakshina Kannada district are taken for demonstration. The LU/LC of the district extracted from high-resolution images of Landsat using random forest classification, land surface temperature (LST) extracted from the thermal band of Landsat images using the mono window algorithm, evapotranspiration (ET) data extracted from MOD16A2.006 and precipitation data from CHIPRS was used. The data was extracted for the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon period 2001-2019. The district has seen a 13.67% reduction in the forest area with 18.81% increase in the built-up areas. The LST and ET has seen a progressive drift in the past two decades, with an increase of 4.07 degrees C in median temperature in forest areas and a decline of 2.19 mm in median ET value, which necessitates monitoring forest encroachment. The higher variation in maximum LST in built-up land (0.36 degrees C) (near the industrial area) indicates that LU/LC change signature is the predominant driving factor and is associated with the physical characteristics of the built-up area. The ET exhibited a decreasing rate of 0.62 mm/year/sq.km of the built-up land. This study highlights the power of Google Earth Engine and free availability of satellite data in environmental protection, land-use management and sustainable development in the region.

TI  - NeMO-Net - Gamifying 3D Labeling of Multi-Modal Reference Datasets to Support Automated Marine Habitat Mapping
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA NeMO-Net, The Neural Multimodal Observation and Training Network for global coral reef assessment, is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that generates benthic habitat maps of coral reefs and other shallow marine ecosystems. To segment and classify imagery accurately, CNNs require curated training datasets of considerable volume and accuracy. Here, we present a citizen science approach to create these training datasets through a novel 3D classification game for mobile and desktop devices. Leveraging citizen science, the NeMO-Net video game generates high-resolution 3D benthic habitat labels at the subcentimeter to meter scales. The video game trains users to accurately identify benthic categories and semantically segment 3D scenes captured using NASA airborne fluid lensing, the first remote sensing technology capable of mitigating ocean wave distortions, as well as in situ 3D photogrammetry and 2D satellite remote sensing. An active learning framework is used in the game to allow users to rate and edit other user classifications, dynamically improving segmentation accuracy. Refined and aggregated data labels from the game are used to train NeMO-Net's supercomputer-based CNN to autonomously map shallow marine systems and augment satellite habitat mapping accuracy in these regions. We share the NeMO-Net game approach to user training and retention, outline the 3D labeling technique developed to accurately label complex coral reef imagery, and present preliminary results from over 70,000 user classifications. To overcome the inherent variability of citizen science, we analyze criteria and metrics for evaluating and filtering user data. Finally, we examine how future citizen science and machine learning approaches might benefit from label training in 3D space using an active learning framework. Within 7 months of launch, NeMO-Net has reached over 300 million people globally and directly engaged communities in coral reef mapping and conservation through ongoing scientific field campaigns, uninhibited by geography, language, or physical ability. As more user data are fed into NeMO-Net's CNN, it will produce the first shallow-marine habitat mapping products trained on 3D subcm-scale label data and merged with m-scale satellite data that could be applied globally when data sets are available.

TI  - A TRUE THREE-SCROLL CHAOTIC ATTRACTOR COINED
T2  - DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES B
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the method of compression and pull forming mechanism (CAP), the authors in a well-known paper proposed and analyzed the Lu-like system: (x) over dot = a(y - x) + dxz, (y) over dot = -xz + fy, (z) over dot = -ex(2) + xy + cz, which was thought to display an interesting three-scroll chaotic attractors (called as Pan-A attractor) when (a, d, f, e, c) = (40, 0.5, 20, 0.65, 5/6). Unfortunately, by further analysis and Matlab simulation, we show that the Pan-A attractor found is actually a stable torus. Accordingly, we find a new true three-scroll chaotic attractor coexisting with a single saddle-node (0, 0, 0) for the case with (a, d, f, e, c) = (168, 0.4, 100, 0.70, 11). Interestingly, the forming mechanism of singularly degenerate heteroclinic cycles of that system is bidirectional, rather than unilateral in the case of most other Lorenz-like systems. This further motivates us to revisit in detail its other complicated dynamical behaviors, i.e., the ultimate bound sets, the globally exponentially attractive sets, Hopf bifurcation, limit cycles coexisting attractors and so on. Numerical simulations not only are consistent with the results of theoretical analysis, but also illustrate that collapse of infinitely many singularly degenerate heteroclinic cycles and explosions of normally hyperbolic stable nodes or foci generate the aforementioned three-scroll attractor. In particular, four or two unstable limit cycles coexisting one chaotic attractor, the saddle E-0 and the stable E-+/- are located in two globally exponentially attractive sets. These results together indicate that this system deserves further exploration in chaos-based applications.

TI  - Leaf area index estimation of wheat crop using modified water cloud model from the time-series SAR and optical satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The time-series synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite data were used for the leaf area index (LAI) estimation of wheat crop using modified water cloud model (MWCM) in Varanasi district, India. In this study, MWCM was developed by including scale invariant vegetation fraction (f(veg)) in the old WCM for the estimation of LAI. The non-linear least square optimization technique was applied to determine the optimum model parameters for the retrieval of LAI which was further validated with the observed LAI. The estimated values of LAI by MWCM at VV polarization shows good correspondence (R-2 = 0.901 and RMSE = 0.456 m(2)/m(2)) with the observed LAI values than at VH polarization (R-2 = 0.742 and RMSE = 0.521 m(2)/m(2)).The MWCM shows great potential for the LAI estimation of wheat crop by incorporating optical data (i.e. Sentinel-2) in terms of f(veg) with SAR data (i.e. Sentinel-1A).

TI  - High-resolution spatially explicit land surface model calibration using field-scale satellite-based daily evapotranspiration product
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution simulation of water budgets across the agricultural landscape is critically important to a variety of applications, such as precision agriculture, water resources management, and environmental quality assessment. Model-data integration has been shown to be an effective approach to reduce model uncertainties and there is a growing opportunity to improve land surface modeling through spatially explicit calibration with satellite data in recent decades. Recently, a satellite-based daily 30-m resolution evapotranspiration (ET) product BESS-STAIR has been developed, achieving a high performance and well capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of ET across the U.S. Corn Belt. To explore the potential of high-resolution spatially explicit calibration for advancing land surface modeling at fine scales, we carried out calibration experiments for the Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) over cropland using this newly developed BESS-STAIR ET. We first used Sobol sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters for the Noah-MP's ET simulation. The most sensitive vegetation (minimum stomatal resistance) and soil parameters (saturated hydraulic conductivity, saturated matric potential, and a soil pore size distribution parameter) were calibrated using BESS-STAIR ET to improve model simulation of surface water balance. We conducted calibration experiments at 8 eddy covariance flux tower sites that grew maize and soybean across the U.S. Corn Belt, as well as a regional calibration study on the Spoon River watershed in Champaign, Illinois. When benchmarked with flux tower measurements, the BESS-STAIR ET-calibrated model (driven by flux tower forcing) on average reduced the RMSE of hourly ET from 61 W/m(2) to 47 W/m(2) for maize, and from 66 W/m(2) to 53 W/m(2) for soybean, and matched the performance of directly calibrating using flux tower measured ET. The regional study found that calibration using BESS-STAIR ET also improved the simulation of long-term regional water budgets and achieved better performance of ET than traditionally lumped calibration using streamflow. Further analysis revealed that the high-resolution calibration can resolve the spatial variations of ET to a certain extent, and the accuracy of the calibration can be largely attributed to the low bias and excellent long-term correlation of the BESS-STAIR ET data itself. Our study thus demonstrates the effectiveness of high-resolution model calibration and provides important implications in field-scale hydrological modeling and precision agricultural applications.

TI  - Sequential SPECT and NIR-II imaging of tumor and sentinel lymph node metastasis for diagnosis and image-guided surgery
T2  - BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficacious cancer treatment largely relies on accurate imaging diagnosis and imaging-guided surgery, which can be achieved by combining different mode imaging probes on one single nanoplatform. Herein, a novel radiolabeled NIR-II nanoprobe (I-125-MT NP) was developed to enable versatile single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence dual-modal imaging against breast cancer. I-125-MT was precipitated with an amphiphilic triblock copolymer (PEO-PPO-PEO) to form I-125-MT NPs. The I-125-MT NPs exhibited high labeling efficiency (98 +/- 2%) with a hydrodynamic diameter of 91.3 +/- 5.5 nm. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that I-125-MT NPs emitted intensive NIR-II fluorescence and SPECT signals, and possessed good biocompatibility. By using a breast tumor xenograft mouse model after intravenous injection of I-125-MT NPs, the SPECT imaging and NIR-II imaging showed clear images of tumor tissues at 8 h and 48 h postinjection, respectively, suggesting the feasibility of using I-125-MT NPs to detect tumors before surgery and visualize the dissection area during surgery. In addition, the SPECT scan of a lymph node mapping was performed at 1 h postinjection and NIR-II fluorescence imaging was carried out at 4 h postinjection. This further guarantees the accurate imaging of lymph nodes before and during surgery for lymphadenectomy. Overall I-125-MT NP is a promising, practical imaging probe for sequential imaging and precision cancer therapy.

TI  - Long-term results of fluorescence and indigo carmine blue dye-navigated sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy is widely applied for the management of clinically node-negative breast cancer, and a radioisotope with a blue dye are most often used as tracers. Fluorescence of indocyanine green could also potentially be used as tracer. This study aimed to demonstrate the long-term survival results of fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy. Patients and methods Patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent surgery as initial treatment were included in this study. Both fluorescence of indocyanine green and indigo carmine blue dye were used as tracers. Axillary lymph node dissection was omitted unless metastasis was pathologically proven in sentinel nodes. Breast cancer recurrence and death were recorded and prognostic factors were identified using disease-free survival and overall survival data. Results A total of 565 patients were analyzed. There were 14 (2.5%) patients whose sentinel nodes could not be identified, yielding an identification rate of 97.5%. Axillary dissection was performed in 90 patients. Forty-three recurrences including 6 ipsilateral axilla recurrence and 13 deaths were observed during the median 83 months of follow-up period. Seven-year disease-free and overall survival were 92.4% and 97.3%, respectively. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that pre-menopausal status and invasive lobular carcinoma were significant unfavorable prognostic factors of disease-free survival. Half of ipsilateral axilla recurrences occurred within 5 years after surgery and these recurrences were correlated with inappropriate adjuvant therapy. Conclusion Fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy demonstrated favorable prognostic results and could be alternative to the radioisotope for clinically node-negative breast cancer.

TI  - From ego to eco: re-orienting for processual ontology in the "Dao-Field"
T2  - CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The planet Earth has become increasingly susceptible to human-induced (anthropogenic) ecological disasters. The currently raging COVID-19 pandemic adds to the vast scale of destruction and suffering that humanity and the planet are experiencing. In this paper we explicate the meaning of 'human-induced' destruction in the terms of the damaging and hurting metaphysics (beyond the physical or material) that modern humanity has been entertaining in their conceptual and emotional minds and materially projecting onto the world. In turn, the damaging and hurting metaphysics is explicated in the terms of atomism that conceives all existents as self-existing and independent, necessarily engaged in competition against each other for survival. We propose to replace such metaphysics with one of the processual ontologies, such as that of Alfred North Whitehead, in which humans see themselves and each other as continuously interfusing and co-creatively re/e/merging relata of complete interdependence. This way, all of us, all the time, become "one with The Ten Thousand Things."-an expression in Chinese for the phenomenal world of thriving diversity and conviviality. We further explore self-cultivation of inner work that aids the shift from ego self to eco self, such as meditative and arts-based practices.

TI  - Estimating above-ground biomass of <i>Pinus densata</i> Mast. using best slope temporal segmentation and Landsat time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A time-series filtering algorithm named the best slope temporal segmentation filtering (BSTS) algorithm was developed to improve the estimation accuracy of above-ground biomass (AGB) of Pinus densata Mast. In this algorithm, the best slope was used to interrupt the time series. Following interruptions, linear regression was employed to simulate each segment of time series. By splicing the time-series fragments, a new reconstructed time series would be generated. The algorithm was used to reconstruct the annual synthetic Landsat surface reflectance images collection in Shangri-La from 1987 to 2019. Permanent sampling plots of Pinus densata Mast. in 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017 were collected. Then the multiple linear regression and random forests regression (RFR) were used to estimate the AGB of the Pinus densata Mast. The Landsat time series used before and after filtering were evaluated based on the quantitative analysis. The results with RFR showed that for modeling, the R-2 of the time series reconstructed by the BSTS is 0.913, which is higher than the data before reconstructed (R-2 = 0.869). The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the reconstructed time series (RMSE = 35.38 t/ha) is significantly lower than the data before reconstructed (RMSE = 43.43 t/ha). For validation, the average prediction accuracy (p) before filtering is 61.92%, and the relative rootmean-square error (rRMSE) is 48.52%; whereas the p after filtering is increased to 70.66%, and the rRMSE is reduced to 35.38%. In summary, the BSTS has improved the accuracy of remote sensing-based estimation of AGB of Pinus densata Mast., which provided a method for large area AGB mapping for Pinus densata Mast. in Shangri-La.

TI  - Black carbon emissions from flaring in Russia in the period 2012-2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gas flaring in the oil and gas industry has been identified as an important source of anthropogenic black carbon (BC) affecting the climate, particularly in the Arctic. Our study provides spatially-explicit estimates of BC emissions from flaring in Russia utilising state-of-the-art methodology for determining the emission factors. We utilised satellite time series of the flared gas volume from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) for the period 2012 to 2017, supplemented with information on the gas and oil field type. BC emissions at flaring locations were calculated based on field type-specific emission factors, taking into account different gas compositions in each field type. We estimate that the average annual BC emissions from flaring in Russia were 68.3 Gg/year, with the largest proportion stemming from oil fields (82%). We observed a decrease in the yearly emissions during the period 2012 to 2017 with regional differences in the trend. Our results highlight the importance of detailed information on gas composition and the stage of oil and gas separation of the flared gas to reduce uncertainties in the BC emission estimates.

TI  - <i>Dirofilaria immitis</i> infection in the Pelagie archipelago: The southernmost hyperendemic focus in Europe
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens are mosquito-borne filarioids of zoonotic concern, which primarily cause canine heartworm disease (HWD) and subcutaneous dirofilariosis, respectively. The geographical distribution of these nematodes is constantly changing, due to many factors such as the colonization by new invasive mosquito species, the increased movement of animals and the absence of chemoprophylactic strategies in non-endemic regions. Although HWD has always been considered endemic in northern Italy, an increase in the prevalence of this disease has been recorded in the last decades in central and southern regions. We describe the southernmost hyperendemic European focus of heartworm disease in the Pelagie archipelagos. From June to November 2020, 157 dogs and 46 cats were sampled in Linosa and Lampedusa islands for the detection of Dirofilaria immitis and Dirofilaria repens by modified Knott's, rapid antigen and molecular tests. Mosquitoes were collected using CDC light and BG sentinel-2 traps and aspirators, and tested for host blood meal and Dirofilaria spp. DNA. Out of 56 dogs in Linosa and 101 in Lampedusa, 33 (i.e. 58.9%) and 8 (i.e. 7.9%) were positive to D. immitis and D. repens, respectively. Three cats scored positive to D. immitis (i.e. 17.6%) in Linosa. Six mosquito species were identified, and the abdomen of a non-engorged Aedes albopictus was positive for D. immitis and human DNA. The results suggest that D. immitis infection could spread to new previously non-endemic territories in southern Europe, representing a real threat to animal and human health.

TI  - Disparate access to quality land and fertilizers explain Malawi?s gender yield gap
T2  - FOOD POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grain yields on land managed by women in developing countries are usually lower than those on male-managed fields This is usually attributed to unequal access to productive inputs, highlighting the systemically inegalitarian distribution of opportunities between men and women. This study examines the yield differences between male-, female- and jointly-managed maize fields in Malawi. We test the hypothesis that there is no yield gap after controlling for access to higher quality soils, fertilizer, and other inputs. Furthermore, we explicitly test for significant differences in the endowment of soil quality and the likelihood of employing soil improving management practices between male-, female- and jointly-managed fields. We employ field-level data on field managers, production, and input use, coupled with lab-assessed field-specific soil characteristics from 912 observations in Malawi?s Central and Southern regions that were collected during the 2018 harvest season. Unlike many previous studies, we measure yield using a combination of yield cuts, plant population density, mid-season chlorophyll measurements, and satellite data (versus using farmer-reported data). Soil quality endowments are measured using total carbon, an effectively fixed condition. Farming effects on soil quality are measured using labile carbon fractions. We find women are disproportionately likely to be farming with lower quality seeds and less fertilizer on lower quality soils, and there is no yield gap after controlling for these factors. Our results will be beneficial to policy makers in Malawi because they highlight potential interventions that can be both productivity-enhancing and advance the goal of gender equality.

TI  - Analyzing the dynamics of urbanization in Delhi National Capital Region in India using satellite image time-series analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding urban land-use changes and accurately quantifying urban land transitions is essential to global land-change research. The present study aimed to capture non-linear land transitions within urban areas using an automated change detection technique in a satellite image time series. Traditional land-use and cover maps used to map and monitor urban areas assume land change is a linear process and that urbanization is the last stage of land transition. In reality, however, most land transitions are non-linear. The present study focused on Delhi National Capital Territory, in India, and its adjacent major cities. A popular time-series analysis method was applied on MODIS NDVI time-series (2000-2017) data to detect change within the impervious surface area of the region. Overall validation and analysis of the results showed that the method was able to capture the direction and timing of the changes very well within all levels of urban density (except very high-density areas with more than 98% built-up density). The majority of urban areas in the region experienced interrupted, abrupt, and gradual greening. The results show different examples of non-linear land transitions detected from satellite images. Until recently, these land transitions could only be observed via long-term field surveys and/or local knowledge. The results reveal that the land-change trajectories can be different based on the level of built-up density, size of the urban area, physical proximity, and accessibility to relatively bigger urban areas. Knowledge gained from this study can be useful in better understanding the micro-climatic patterns and environmental quality within a city.

TI  - Impact of Completion Lymphadenectomy on Quality of Life for Head and Neck Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Recent randomized data suggest that completion lymph node dissection after a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) improves locoregional control but does not improve survival for melanoma patients. Locoregional recurrences of head and neck cutaneous melanoma (HNCM) may result in significant morbidity. A better understanding of morbidity is thus important to inform decisions about whether to pursue completion neck dissection (ND). Study Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Academic tertiary care hospital. Methods Clinical data were collected for patients with HNCM seen between 2016 and 2019 who were at least 1-year disease free. Each patient completed the Self-administered Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (SLANSS), Neck Dissection Impairment Index, and SF-36 (Short Form-36). Scores were compared by surgical treatment: wide local excision (WLE) only, SLNB, and ND. Univariate and multivariable regression was performed. Results Of 474 patients, 140 returned questionnaires (29.5% response rate; WLE, n = 49; SLNB, n = 76; ND, n = 15). No significant differences in SLANSS or Neck Dissection Impairment Index scores were found between the WLE and SLNB groups. SLANSS scores differed by 2 SD (P = .001) in the ND cohort, which had a 36% rate of neuropathy. Neck impairment was worse by 1 SD (P = .01) in the ND cohort. No differences were found in SF-36 domains. Conclusion Neuropathy and neck impairment are components of morbidity after ND. These risks must be balanced with potential morbidity of locoregional recurrence in HNCM.

AB  - Recent eruptions of Kilauea volcano, on the Island of Hawai'i, represent an ideal test location for studying volcanic plumes, due to its remote location and minimal anthropogenic pollution. Within this work we exploit the over 20-year data record from NASA EOS satellites to investigate the degree to which space-borne observations can detect shifts in known eruption dynamics at Kilauea. Through the combined analysis of remotely sensed plume heights, plumeparticle microphysical properties, lava flow thermal tracking and high resolution SO2 mapping, we provide interpretations of the satellite signals in a volcanic context and link them to ground-based eruption reports for validation. We establish common patterns of plume dispersion and particle evolution and identify when significant shifts in activity occur. We also determine where ambient conditions influence the output retrieved from the space-borne sensors. By comparing the inferences derived from remote-sensing with the extensive record of suborbital observations at Kilauea, we assess the strengths and limitations of the satellite-based volcanic assessment techniques. The work presented here highlights the capabilities of these techniques, allowing us to more confidently interpret volcanic activity observed from space globally, particularly in cases where ground observations are limited or entirely lacking.

TI  - A Compressive-Sensing Approach for Opportunistic Bistatic SAR Imaging Enhancement by Harnessing Sparse Multiaperture Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces a compressive sensing (CS)-based approach for increasing bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging quality in the context of a multiaperture acquisition. The analyzed data were recorded over an opportunistic bistatic setup including a stationary ground-based-receiver opportunistic C-band bistatic SAR differential interferometry (COBIS) and Sentinel-1 C-band transmitter. Since the terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) mode is operated, the receiver can record synchronization pulses and echoed signals from the scene during many apertures. Hence, it is possible to improve the azimuth resolution by exploiting the multiaperture data. The recorded data are not contiguous and a naive integration of the chopped azimuth phase history would generate undesired grating lobes. The proposed processing scheme exploits the natural sparsity characterizing the illuminated scene. For azimuth profiles recovery greedy, convex, and nonconvex CS solvers are analyzed. The sparsifying basis/dictionary is constructed using the synthetically generated azimuth chirp derived considering Sentinel-1 orbital parameters and COBIS position. The chirped-based CS performance is further put in contrast with a Fourier-based CS method and an autoregressive model for signal reconstruction in terms of scene extent limitations and phase restoration efficiency. Furthermore, the analysis of different receiver-looking scenarios conducted to the insertion in the processing chain of a direct and an inverse Keystone transform for range cell migration (RCM) correction to cope with squinted geometries. We provide an extensive set of simulated and real-world results that prove the proposed workflow is efficient both in improving the azimuth resolution and in mitigating the sidelobes.

TI  - UAV and High Resolution Satellite Mapping of Forage Lichen (<i>Cladonia</i> spp.) in a Rocky Canadian Shield Landscape
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.) are an important food source for woodland and barren ground caribou herds. In this study, we assessed Cladonia classification accuracy in a rocky, Canadian Shield landscape near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories using both Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensors and high-resolution satellite sensors. At the UAV scale, random forest classifications derived from a multispectral, visible-near infrared sensor (Micasense Altum) had an average 5% higher accuracy for mapping Cladonia (i.e., 95.5%) than when using a conventional color RGB camera (DJI Phantom 4 RTK). We aggregated Altum lichen classifications from three 5 ha study sites to train random forest regression models of fractional lichen cover using predictor features from WorldView-3 and Planet CubeSat satellite imagery. WorldView models at 6 m resolution had an average 6.8% RMSE (R (2) = 0.61) when tested at independent study sites and outperformed the 6 m Planet models, which had a 9.9% RMSE (R (2) = 0.34). These satellite results are comparable to previous lichen mapping studies focusing on woodlands, but the small cover of Cladonia in our study area (11.6% or 16.8% within the barren portions) results in a high relative RMSE (62.2%) expressed as a proportion of mean lichen cover.

TI  - Tracing suspended matter in Tiab estuary applying ANN and Remote sensing
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about deposition and sedimentation in estuaries is important since these environments are favorable domain for human activity. Variety of hydrodynamic parameters causes sedimentation/deposition in an estuary among them tidal current. It is therefore necessary to monitor these processes in estuaries and provide strategies to control the rate of sedimentation/deposition. Several methods are available to measure total suspended solids (TSS). Using combined methods of direct and indirect suspended sediment measurements in this research, we achieved a reliable method to study the suspended sediment status in an estuary located northern of the Persian Gulf, known as Tiab estuary. Field measurements were performed as two scheduled cruises one in October and one in November 2015. Current velocity and turbidity were recorded using RCM9 device and optical backscatter sensor. Water samples were collected using Niskin Bottle. Measurements were carried out both along the estuary and stationery. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in combination with Linearity method has been applied to reproduce sufficient SS data. The ANN feed-forward back-propagation provides reliable TSS values with the RMSE and correlation coefficient of 0.137 and 0.943, respectively. Results show that the estuary is flood dominated, thus in general the estuary is under constant sedimentation. Applicability of satellite imagery of Sentinel to trace TSS in this estuary is investigated and improved. The difference between the SST rate in the four tidal phases, including high and low tide and flood and ebb phase, was examined using the NSMI-index. We found the average NSMI index in high tide is 0.216, in the low tide is 0.278, in flood phase is 0.302, and in ebb phase is 0.295. Both field and satellite data show that the concentration of TSS in the ebb phase increases, and in the low and high tide decreases. Both results also revealed that the accumulation of TSS in the meandered area is relatively high. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization and absolute calibration of an AERONET-OC radiometer
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean Color component of the global Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) utilizes CE-318 sun photometers modified for above-water radiometry from fixed structures such as oil rigs, lighthouses, and service platforms. Primarily, AERONET-OC measurements allow determination of the water-leaving radiance required for the validation of ocean color satellite data products. One instrument from the AERONET-OC network, identified as AERONET #080, was studied in this work. A laser-illuminated integrating sphere of known radiance enabled determination of the linearity with flux and absolute radiance responsivity at multiple wavelengths within seven of the AERONET #080 filter bands. We compared the results to calibrations from the AERONET facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. These results agree within the estimated mean comparison uncertainty of 1.88%(k = 2). We also assessed these results using calibrated lamp-illuminated integrating spheres and observed a spectral dependence to the comparison results that is unexplained.

TI  - A geo-spatial approach to assess Trees outside Forest (ToF) in Haryana State, India
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring the Trees outside Forest (ToF) is gaining significance in the scientific community as they provide critical ecosystem services such as protecting soil and water resources, wildlife habitat, and aesthetics including food, fuel, and fibre. Quantifying ToF can also provide useful information for emission estimation relating to the agriculture, forests, and other land use (AFOLU) category of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Despite the importance of quantifying ToF, very few studies have attempted to quantify them in India's natural resource inventory programs. In this study, we focused on Haryana State, India, to inventory ToF using very high-resolution (VHR) Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite data. Haryana's landscape is interspersed with croplands and ToF, thus providing a challenging environment to test VHR satellite data's ability to quantify the diversified landscape structure. We specifically used CARTOSAT-1 panchromatic (2.5 m) and multispectral LISS-IV (5.8 m) datasets to quantify the vegetation and build a much-needed database for ToF. We used a novel classification scheme based on the geometry, that is, point, line, or polygon formations, to quantify ToF at a scale of 1:10,000. The obtained results suggest ToF with linear and block formations extended to 128.83 and 20.51 km(2), respectively, accounting for similar to 3.38% of the Total Georgraphical Area of Haryana State while point formations established 2,774,531 in numbers. This study highlights the usefulness of VHR satellite data and fused imagery to quantify ToF in highly diverse landscape of Haryana. The results will help address vital ecosystem services from ToF, including greenhouse gas emissions quantification from the Agriculture, Forests and Other LandUse (AFOLU) category.

TI  - Needs and resources of people with type 2 diabetes in peri-urban Cochabamba, Bolivia: a people-centred perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes results in a worldwide public healthcare crisis, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with unprepared and overburdened health systems mainly focused on infectious diseases and maternal and child health. Studies regarding type 2 diabetes in LMICs describe specific interventions ignoring a comprehensive analysis of the local factors people see influential to their health. This study aims to meet this research gap by exploring what people with type 2 diabetes in Bolivia need to maintain or improve their health, how important they perceive those identified needs and to what extent these needs are met. Methods From March until May 2019, 33 persons with type 2 diabetes from three periurban municipalities of the department of Cochabamba participated in this study. The concept mapping methodology by Trochim, a highly structured qualitative brainstorming method, was used to generate and structure a broad range of perspectives on what the participants considered instrumental for their health. Results The brainstorming resulted in 156 original statements condensed into 72 conceptually different needs and resources, structured under nine conceptual clusters and four action domains. These domains illustrated with vital needs were: (1) self-management with use of plants and the possibility to measure sugar levels periodically; (2) healthcare providers with the need to trust and receive a uniform diagnosis and treatment plan; (3) health system with opportune access to care and (4) community with community participation in health and safety, including removal of stray dogs. Conclusions This study identifies mostly contextual factors like low literacy levels, linguistic problems in care, the need to articulate people's worldview including traditional use of natural remedies with the Bolivian health system and the lack of expertise on type 2 diabetes by primary health care providers. Understanding the needs and structuring them in different areas wherein action is required serves as a foundation for the planning and evaluation of an integrated people centred care program for people with type 2 diabetes. This participative method serves as a tool to implement the often theoretical concept of integrated people centred health care in health policy and program development.

TI  - A Four-Parameter Model for Estimating Diurnal Temperature Cycle From MODIS Land Surface Temperature Product
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface diurnal temperature cycle (LSDTC) is an important element in climate system. Diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) models are potential for deriving diurnal variation of land surface temperature (LST) over extended regions from satellite observations. To estimate the LSDTC at high spatial resolution from clear-sky Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data, this study reduced the parameter number of a five-parameter DTC model to only four by fitting the time of maximum temperature as a function of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), elevation and latitude. Using the ground-based LSTs, the proposed four-parameter DTC (FPD) model was evaluated for 48 and 4 available LST observations per day. The results showed that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 2.08 K, 0.88 K, 1.14 K, 1.31 K, 2.27 K, and 1.12 K for grassland, cropland, swamp meadow, desert steppe, desert shrub, and sand desert, respectively, for 48 observations. Comparatively, RMSEs for four observations corresponding to the MODIS overpass times were increased by less than 1 K, except for swamp meadow with an elevation greater than 3,500 m that the error was increased by 1.5 K. Applying the FPD model to MODIS LST product showed that the model could capture the variation of LSTs during a day, and the accuracy of the modeled LSTs depended on the accuracy of MODIS LST product. Generally, the proposed FPD model is simple and easy to be applied to MODIS four LSTs per day under clear skies to acquire LSDTC over extended regions with high spatial resolution.Key PointsThe time of maximum temperature in the five-parameter diurnal temperature cycle model is parameterizedA four-parameter diurnal temperature cycle model is developed, and error of the predicted temperature versus the field data is less than 3 K

TI  - Quantitative appraisal of naturalistic/anthropic shoreline shifts for hurghada: Egypt
T2  - MARINE GEORESOURCES & GEOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This investigation aims to establish a system to test the identification of shoreline changes along the coast of Hurghada. Besides, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) studies the shoreline shift rate analysis. Multi-temporal satellite images have revealed accretion and erosion patterns in the areas of concern. Landsat images with different periods were geometrically and radiometrically corrected, then classified through assigning 8 different classes for the quantitative coastline delineation analysis from 1987 to 2019: (Landsat 5-TM, Thematic Mapper (TM)), Landsat7 ETM+, worldview 2, and Sentinel 2). To detect both land use and land cover change (LULCC) and shoreline growth, a maximum controlled classification tool is used. The DSAS was used to measure the coastal changing rate as a powerful statistical analysis tool, and thus to predict the behavior of the coastal shift over a long time. DSAS used two separate methods: EPR and LRR. The results concluded that, primarily as a consequence of unregulated landfill practices before tourist facilities, Hurghada's coastal region experienced an average accretion rate of 1.38 m/y. Moreover, the El-Gouna study revealed drastic modifications because of the development of its coastal zone's closed inland lagoons. Finally, the creation of the decision matrix reveals the evolution of the shorelines in the three last decades and the statistical projection for the three next decades. This study highlights the problem of extreme erosion in the Southern part (which is still not completely developed).

TI  - Application of the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria to Chinese patients with breast cancer: a prospective study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although the ACOSOG Z0011 study showed that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) could be avoided in a specific population of sentinel lymph node-positive patients, it is not widely accepted by Chinese surgeons. We conducted a prospective single-arm study to confirm whether or not the results of Z0011 are applicable to Chinese patients.Methods: Patients conforming to the Z0011 criteria were prospectively enrolled at the Peking University People's Hospital Breast Center from November 2014 to June 2019. The clinicopathological features of the study group were compared with those of the Z0011 study group. Lymphedema after surgery, the incidence of local-regional recurrence, and survival were analyzed.Results: One hundred forty-two patients who met the Z0011 eligibility criteria were enrolled in this study; 115 underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone. Compared with the Z0011 trial, younger patients were included (median age, 52 [26-82] years vs 54 [25-90] years; P = 0.03). For clinical T stage, tumor histology, hormone status, lymphovascular invasion, and the number of positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), no statistically significant differences were observed. More patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy in this study (90.85% vs 58.0% and 80.99% vs 46.6% respectively, P <0.001). A similar percentage of patients received radiotherapy, but more nodal radiotherapy procedures were carried out in our study (54.5% vs 16.9%). After a median follow-up of 29 months, only 1 patient (0.9%) had ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, and no regional recurrence occurred.Conclusion: Our study showed that it is achievable to avoid ALND in patients eligible for Z0011 in China.

TI  - Evaluation of the sensitivity of the classical swine fever surveillance system in two free zones in Colombia
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Infection with the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causes a disease in pigs that ranges from a hyperacute form in which animals die in a few hours to subclinical disease. Due to this wide range of virulence, several complementary surveillance strategies should be implemented for the early detection of the disease. The objective of the present study was to determine the sensitivity of the surveillance system to detect CSFV outbreaks in a free zone (Zone 1) and in a zone undergoing an eradication process (Zone 2) in Colombia. Stochastic scenario tree models were used to describe the population and surveillance structures and to determine the probability of CSFV detection. The total sensitivity of the surveillance system in the case of a single infected farm in Zone 1 was 31.4% (CI 95%: 7.2-54.1) and in the case of 5 infected farms was 85.2% (CI 95%: 67.3-93.7), while in Zone 2 the sensitivities were 27.8% (CI 95%: 6.4-55.1) and 82.5% (CI 95%: 65-92.9), respectively. The on-farm passive surveillance shows the highest sensitivity for detection of a single CSFV infected farm in both zones (22.8% in Zone 1 and 22.5% in Zone 2). The probability of detection was higher in a family / backyard premise than on a commercial farm in both zones. The passive surveillance at slaughterhouse had a sensitivity of 5.3% and 4.5% for the detection of a single infected farm in Zone 1 and 2, respectively. Active surveillance presented a range of sensitivity between 2.2% and 4.5%. In conclusion, the sensitivity of the surveillance in the two studied zones was quite high, one of reasons for this good sensitivity being the sentinel network based on the voluntary participation of 5,500 collaborators that were trained for the identification and notification of diseases of national interest.

TI  - Mapping potential signs of gas emissions in ice of Lake Neyto, Yamal, Russia, using synthetic aperture radar and multispectral remote sensing data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Regions of anomalously low backscatter in C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of lake ice of Lake Neyto in northwestern Siberia have been suggested to be caused by emissions of gas (methane from hydrocarbon reservoirs) through the lake's sediments. However, to assess this connection, only analyses of data from boreholes in the vicinity of Lake Neyto and visual comparisons to medium-resolution optical imagery have been provided due to a lack of in situ observations of the lake ice itself. These observations are impeded due to accessibility and safety issues. Geospatial analyses and innovative combinations of satellite data sources are therefore proposed to advance our understanding of this phenomenon. In this study, we assess the nature of the backscatter anomalies in Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images in combination with very high resolution (VHR) WorldView-2 optical imagery. We present methods to automatically map backscatter anomaly regions from the C-band SAR data (40m pixel spacing) and holes in lake ice from the VHR data (0.5m pixel spacing) and examine their spatial relationships. The reliability of the SAR method is evaluated through comparison between different acquisition modes. The results show that the majority of mapped holes (71 %) in the VHR data are clearly related to anomalies in SAR imagery acquired a few days earlier, and similarities to SAR imagery acquired more than a month before are evident, supporting the hypothesis that anomalies may be related to gas emissions. Further, a significant expansion of backscatter anomaly regions in spring is documented and quantified in all analysed years 2015 to 2019. Our study suggests that the backscatter anomalies might be caused by lake ice subsidence and consequent flooding through the holes over the ice top leading to wetting and/or slushing of the snow around the holes, which might also explain outcomes of polarimetric analyses of auxiliary L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) data. C-band SAR data are considered to be valuable for the identification of lakes showing similar phenomena across larger areas in the Arctic in future studies.

TI  - Maximizing sentinel node detection in endometrial cancer with dual cervical and transcervical fundal indocyanine green injection: 5-year single-center prospective study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe our latest results using dual cervical and fundal indocyanine green injection for detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in endometrial cancer.Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted between 26 June 2014 and 31 December 2019 with 278 patients that underwent laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer at our institution. In all cases, we performed SLN biopsy with dual cervical and fundal indocyanine green injection. All SLNs were processed with an ultrastaging technique. A total of 128 patients also underwent total pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy.Results: The detection rates were as follows: 93.5 % (260/278) overall for SLNs; 90.7 % (252/278) overall for pelvic SLNs; 68.0 % (189/278) for bilateral SLNs; 66.9 % (186/278) for paraaortic SLNs, and 2.9 % (8/278) for isolated paraaortic SLNs. We found macroscopic lymph node metastasis in 26 patients (10.0 %) and microdisease in lymph nodes in another 48 patients, raising the overall rate of lymph node involvement to 16.2 %. There was one false negative (negative SLN biopsy but positive lymphadenectomy). Applying the SLN algorithm, the sensitivity of detection was 97.9 % (95 % CI 89.1-99.6), specificity 100 % (95 % CI 98.2-100), negative predictive value 99.5 % (95 % CI 97.4-99.9), and positive predictive value 100 % (95 % CI 92.4-100).Conclusions: Dual sentinel node injection is a feasible technique that achieves adequate detection rates. Additionally, this technique allows a high rate of aortic detection, identifying a non-negligible percentage of isolated aortic metastases. Aortic metastases in endometrial cancer are possible and we should not give up actively looking for them. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Perturbation of Urbanization to Earth's Surface Energy Balance
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization, one of the most dramatic forms of land conversion, modifies local climatic environments and threatens human life and health. Here we use the space-for-time approach combined with satellite data to quantify the potential perturbation of surface energy balance and land surface temperature (LST) caused by urbanization at global scale. We estimate that collectively +2.4 degrees C, +0.9 degrees C, and +1.7 degrees C potential changes for annual daytime, nighttime, and mean LST could be triggered when land surface converted from natural area to urban use, due primarily to the decline of latent heat during months from April to October (-23.9--3.2 W m(-2)), and the reduced sensible heat and ground heat storage in other months (-5.2--2.4 W m(-2)). Urbanization perturbation to surface energy balance and temperature exhibit conspicuous spatial heterogeneity (i.e., varying with latitude and climate zones) and temporal asymmetries (i.e., diurnal and seasonal: strong in summer daytime and weak in winter nighttime). These spatial-temporal variations are interrelated closely with local background climate-vegetation regimes, as indicated by strong correlations between urbanization perturbation to surface biophysical effects and precipitation, temperature, vegetation index across regions and months. Our findings provide empirical evidence that biophysical mechanisms of urbanization need to be considered in predicting future trajectories of climate change and local susceptibility of surface energy balance should be accounted for when evaluating urbanization effects and mitigating urban heat.Key PointsSpace-for-time approach is used to quantify surface energy perturbation and temperature (LST) change caused by global urbanizationSurface warmings (e.g., +1.7 degrees C for annual mean LST) could be triggered due primarily to decline in latent heat during April to OctoberSurface energy perturbation exhibits spatial heterogeneity and temporal asymmetries, interrelating with local climate-vegetation regimes

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for exploring different diagnostic and therapeutic modalities to tackle future viral threats. In this vein, we propose the idea of sentinel cells, cellular biosensors capable of detecting viral antigens and responding to them with customizable responses. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a test case, we developed a live cell sensor (SARSNotch) using a de novo-designed protein binder against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. SARSNotch is capable of driving custom genetically-encoded payloads in immortalized cell lines or in primary T lymphocytes in response to purified SARS-CoV-2 Spike or in the presence of Spike-expressing cells. Furthermore, SARSNotch is functional in a cellular system used in directed evolution platforms for development of better binders or therapeutics. In keeping with the rapid dissemination of scientific knowledge that has characterized the incredible scientific response to the ongoing pandemic, we extend an open invitation for others to make use of and improve SARSNotch sentinel cells in the hopes of unlocking the potential of the next generation of smart antiviral therapeutics.

TI  - Botanical gardens as key resources and hazards for biosecurity
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Biodiversity and economic losses resulting from invasive plant pests and pathogens are increasing globally. For these impacts and threats to be managed effectively, appropriate methods of surveillance, detection and identification are required. Botanical gardens provide a unique opportunity for biosecurity as they accommodate diverse collections of exotic and native plant species. These gardens are also often located close to high-risk sites of accidental invasions such as ports and urban areas. This, coupled with routine activities such as the movement of plants and plant material, and visits by millions of people each year, place botanical gardens at risk to the arrival and establishment of pests and pathogens. Consequently, botanical gardens can pose substantial biosecurity risks to the environment, by acting as bridgeheads for pest and pathogen invasions. Here we review the role of botanical gardens in biosecurity on a global scale. The role of botanical gardens has changed over time. Initially, they were established as physic gardens (gardens with medicinal plants), and their links with academic institutions led to their crucial role in the accumulation and dissemination of botanical knowledge. During the second half of the 20th century, botanical gardens developed a strong focus on plant conservation, and in recent years there has been a growing acknowledgement of their value in biosecurity research as sentinel sites to identify pest and pathogen risks (novel pest-host associations); for early detection and eradication of pests and pathogens; and for host range studies. We identify eight specific biosecurity hazards associated with botanical gardens and note potential management interventions and the opportunities these provide for improving biosecurity. We highlight the value of botanical gardens for biosecurity and plant health research in general, and the need for strategic thinking, resources, and capacity development to make them models for best practices in plant health.

TI  - Estimation of component contributions to total terrestrial water storage change in the Yangtze river basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial water storage (TWS) is a key variable in global and regional hydrological cycles. In this study, the TWS changes in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) were derived using the Lagrange multiplier method (LMM) from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data. To assess TWS changes from LMM, different GRACE solutions, different hydrological models, and in situ data were used for validation. Results show that TWS changes from LMM in YRB has the best performance with the correlation coefficients of 0.80 and root mean square error of 1.48 cm in comparison with in situ data. The trend of TWS changes over the YRB increased by 10.39 +/- 1.27 Gt yr(-1) during the 2003-2015 period. Moreover, TWS change is disintegrated into the individual contributions of hydrological components (i.e., glaciers, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater) from satellite data, hydrologic models, and in situ data. The estimated changes in individual TWS components in the YRB show that (1) the contribution of glaciers, surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater to total TWS changes is 15%, 12%, 25% and 48%, respectively; (2) Geladandong glacier melt from CryoSat-2/ICESat data has a critical effect on TWS changes with a correlation coefficients of -0.51; (3) the Three Gorges Reservoir Impoundment has a minimal effect on surface water changes (mainly lake water storage), but it has a substantial effect on groundwater storage (GWS), (4) the Poyang and Doting Lake water storage changes are mainly caused by climate change, (5) soil moisture storage change is mainly influenced by surface water, (6) human-induced GWS changes accounted for approximately half of the total GWS. The results of this study can provide valuable information for decision-making in water resources management.

TI  - Palpable Adenopathy Does Not Indicate High-Volume Axillary Nodal Disease in Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Axillary metastases in the form of palpable adenopathy indicate the need for neoadjuvant chemotherapy or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) disease infrequently have nodal pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and often require ALND. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an accepted treatment for patients with two or fewer non-palpable nodal metastases who are undergoing breast conservation. The proportion of patients with HR+/HER2- disease with palpable adenopathy and two or fewer nodal metastases is unknown. Methods Patients with cT1-T3N1 HR+/HER2- disease with palpable adenopathy were identified from a prospective database. Patients who underwent mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy with ALND were included in this study, whereas patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Clinicopathologic characteristics were compared between patients with two or fewer or more than two positive nodes on ALND. Results Of 180 patients included, 78 (43%) had two or fewer positive nodes on ALND, including 40/72 patients (56%) who underwent lumpectomy. On univariate analysis, cT1 tumor, unifocal tumor, only one palpable node, and two or fewer suspicious nodes on ultrasound were associated with two or fewer positive nodes on ALND. On multivariable analysis, number of suspicious nodes on ultrasound and cT stage were independently associated with two or fewer positive nodes on ALND. Conclusions A substantial minority of patients with cT1-3N1 HR+/HER2- disease with palpable adenopathy had two or fewer positive nodes on ALND. Standard clinicopathologic features and ultrasound findings can help identify candidates for upfront sentinel lymph node biopsy as a strategy to avoid ALND. Prospective studies evaluating this approach are warranted.

TI  - Deformation Monitoring in an Alpine Mining Area in the Tianshan Mountains Based on SBAS-InSAR Technology
T2  - ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fragile habitat of alpine mining areas can be greatly affected by surface disturbances caused by mining activities, particularly open-pit mining activities, which greatly affect the periglacial environment. SBAS-InSAR technology enables the processing of SAR images to obtain highly accurate surface deformation information. This paper applied SBAS-InSAR technology to obtain three years of surface subsidence information based on the 89-scene Sentinel-1A SLC products, covering a mining area (tailings and active areas) in the Tianshan Mountains and its surroundings from 25(th) December 2017 to 2(nd) January 2021. The data were adopted to analyze the characteristics of deformation in the study region and the mining areas, and the subsidence accumulation was compared with field GNSS observation results to verify its accuracy. The results showed that the study area settled significantly, with a maximum settlement rate of -44.80 mm/a and a maximum uplift rate of 28.04 mm/a. The maximum settlement and accumulation of the whole study area over the three-year period were -129.39 mm and 60.49 mm, respectively. The mining area had a settlement value of over 80 mm over the three years. Significantly, the settlement rates of the tailings and active areas were -35 mm/a and -40 mm/a, respectively. Debris accumulation in the eastern portion of the tailings and active areas near the mountain was serious, with accumulation rates of 25 mm/a and 20 mm/a, respectively, and both had accumulation amounts of around 70 mm. For mine tailing pile areas with river flows, the pile locations and environmental restoration should be appropriately adjusted at a later stage. For gravel pile areas, regular cleaning should be carried out, especially around the mining site and at the tunnel entrances and exits, and long-term deformation monitoring of these areas should be carried out to ensure safe operation of the mining site. The SBAS-InSAR measurements were able to yield deformations with high accuracies over a wide area and cost less human and financial resources than the GNSS measurement method. Furthermore, the measurement results were more macroscopic, with great application value for surface subsidence monitoring in alpine areas.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability analysis of green and blue evapotranspiration of wheat in the Egyptian Nile Delta from 1997 to 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing green and blue water evapotranspiration (GWET and BWET) is the key to water resources management and improving water productivity. This study focuses on assessing, evaluating and managing evapotranspiration in Egyptian Nile Delta over 1997-2017 for thirteen regions. The monthly data of minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation and solar radiation from November to May were derived from open access data for calculation of reference evapotranspiration and rainfall accounts. Wheat crop coefficient (K-c) values were estimated using the air temperature and base temperature of crop. GWET and BWET were calculated and mapped for each region in the ArcGIS environment. Land use land cover (LULC) was analyzed during 1997, 2005, 2011, and 2017 using Landsat images. The main findings of the research are as follows: (1) average values of crop coefficients Kc-init, Kc-mid and Kc-end were 0.72, 1.13, and 0.41 through initial, middle, and end growing seasons, respectively; (2) the best regions for saving green and blue water were Sidi-Salim, Bilqas, Ar-Riyad, Al-Hamul, and Biyala; (3) the total water saved was 4.80% and 53.12% of blue and green water accounts; (4) high coefficients of determination between precipitation, GWET, and BWET proportions were 0.99 for both. Furthermore, relative irrigation supply is a good indicator for predicting GWET and BWET with determination coefficients of 0.99 and 0.76, respectively. It can be concluded that the data integration of geographic information and LULC changes is the best way for water management and sustainable agro system development under limited water resources.

TI  - Impacts of land use-based carbon emission pattern on surface temperature dynamics: Experience from the urban and suburban areas of Khulna, Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The human-oriented urban development process significantly affects the thermal environment of cities and surrounding areas by transforming the eco-friendly land use and land cover (LULC) and increasing carbon emission. The impact of such effects is relatively higher in developing countries like Bangladesh, due to unplanned urbanization. The study aimed to examine the influences of land-specific carbon emissions (LCEs) on land surface temperature (LST) dynamics in the urban and suburban areas of Khulna city during 1998-2018. Landsat images of the year 1998, 2008, and 2018 were used to estimate LULC, LST, and LCEs change over the last two decades and documented the LCEs and LST change pattern in both urban and suburban areas. The association between LCEs and LST was examined through linear regression in the GIS environment. The experimental result indicates that (i) carbon emission sources in urban areas and carbon sinks in suburban areas have increased (ii) lowest LST was documented in carbon sinks and the highest LST in the carbon sources (iii) the correlation coefficients were 0.82651, 0.83771 and 0.89216 which indicates the strong significant impacts of LCEs on the increase of LST and become higher and higher from 1998 to 2018, (iv) LST responded highly to the increase of LCEs in the urban areas than in the suburban areas and increased LST of urban areas by 5.54 degrees C. The study signifies the necessity of taking proper policies and strategies immediately for sustainable urban development and the habitable sound environment.

TI  - Application of optical and radar satellite images for mapping tectonic lineaments in kerdous inlier of the Anti-Atlas belt, Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lineament mapping is an important step for lithological and hydrothermal alterations mapping. It is an efficient research task and a part of structural investigation and mineral ore deposits identification. The availability of optical as well as radar remote sensing data, such as Landsat 8 OLI, Terra ASTER and ALOS PALSAR data, allows lineaments mapping at regional and national scale. The accuracy of the obtained results depends strongly on the spatial and spectral resolution of the data. The aim of this study is to compare Landsat 8 OLI, Terra ASTER, and radar ALOS PALSAR satellite data for automatic and manual lineaments extraction. The module Line of PCI Geomatica software was applied on PC1 OLI, PC3 ASTER and HH and HV polarization images to automatically extract geological lineaments. Moreover, the manual extraction was achieved using the RGB color composite of the directional filtered images N - S (0 degrees), NE - SW (45 degrees) and E - W (90 degrees) of the OLI panchromatic band 8. The obtained lineaments from automatic and manual extraction were compared to the faults and photo-geological lineaments digitized from the existing geological map of the study area. The extracted lineaments from PC1 OLI and ALOS PALSAR polarizations images showed the best correlation with faults and photo-geological lineaments. The results indicate that the lineaments extracted from HH and HV polarizations of ALOS PALSAR radar data and PC1 OLI were more efficient for structural lineament mapping.

TI  - Inversion of soil pH during the dry and wet seasons in the Yinbei region of Ningxia, China, based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic monitoring of soil pH changes across different seasons is crucial to understanding soil alkalization and preventing land degradation in arid regions. Here, we explored the potential use of ground-measured hyperspectral data and Landsat 8 OLI remote-sensing images in the inversion of soil pH during the dry and wet seasons. The measured and image data of spectral reflectance and corresponding soil pH data obtained in the laboratory were used to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of soil pH in the Yinbei region, Ningxia, China. First, the hyperspectral data were resampled to match the range of the image bands; then 11 spectral indices were calculated based on the two sets of spectral data. Principal component analysis (PCA), stepwise regression (SR), and gray relational analysis (GRA) were used to select feature variables (sensitive bands and spectral indices) from the spectral data. The back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), ridge regression (RR), and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to construct soil pH inversion models. A total of 24 models established using the different methods were compared in terms of the determination coefficients of the calibration set (R-c(2)) and prediction set (R-p(2)), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative percent deviation (RPD). The results revealed that the mean soil pH in the study area was higher during the dry season (9.28) than the wet season (9.11). The resampled hyperspectral data correlated well with the image data under different levels of soil alkalization (R-2 > 0.9652). Of the different models examined, the global regression models (BPNN, SVM, and RR) were superior to the local regression model (GWR), with better inversion results obtained in the wet than the dry season. The BPNN and SVM models performed better than the RR model, and the PCA-SVM model based on measured data in the dry season achieved the best overall performance (R-p(2) = 0.9724 and RPD = 5.76). These findings provide valuable information on the distribution of Solonetzs land in the study area, facilitating management of soil alkalization and degradation in the Yinbei region.

AB  - Due to the drop in water levels during the monsoon season, the soil particles of the exposed riverbed of Zhuoshui River are easily suspended in the air, causing serious river dust problems and endangering the quality of life and health of local residents. Exposed riverbed is the main source of dust, and it affects PM10 concentration in air quality monitoring stations. In addition to meteorological conditions, the moisture content of the source dust is also an important factor. This study used satellite images from the lower river section (Bridge Ziqiang to Bridge Xibin) to extract the exposed riverbed, used the cluster analysis based on normalized difference water index (NDWI) to further classify the bare land into three categories, and then combined with meteorological factors to construct multi-regression models of PM10 (PM10 = 45.89W + 18.44T - 373.85; R-2 = 0.64, p < 0.001 and PM10 = 21.80T + 39.70W + 37.2M(2) - 646.25; R-2 = 0.74, p < 0.001; W, wind speed; T, air temperature; M-2, bare land with medium NDWI). The results showed that the meteorological factor interpretation rate was about 64%, and if the index of bare land with medium NDWI was included, the model interpretation rate could be increased to 74%, hence the M-2 factor had a high influence on the PM10 concentration.

TI  - Participatory syndromic surveillance as a tool for tracking COVID-19 in Bangladesh
T2  - EPIDEMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Limitations in laboratory diagnostic capacity and reporting delays have hampered efforts to mitigate and control the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic globally. To augment traditional lab and hospitalbased surveillance, Bangladesh established a participatory surveillance system for the public to self-report symptoms consistent with COVID-19 through multiple channels. Here, we report on the use of this system, which received over 3 million responses within two months, for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. Although we observe considerable noise in the data and initial volatility in the use of the different reporting mechanisms, the self-reported syndromic data exhibits a strong association with lab-confirmed cases at a local scale. Moreover, the syndromic data also suggests an earlier spread of the outbreak across Bangladesh than is evident from the confirmed case counts, consistent with predicted spread of the outbreak based on population mobility data. Our results highlight the usefulness of participatory syndromic surveillance for mapping disease burden generally, and particularly during the initial phases of an emerging outbreak.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I argue for an inclusive view of engineering design, and posit designing along with making, operating, maintaining, and disposing as key descriptors of humankind's relationship with artifacts. Engineering design contributes to the definition of artifact characteristics to achieve desired artifact behavior, and includes outcomes ranging from the routine to the highly innovative. I argue for a worldview of engineering design that places greater emphasis on the routine, and suggest three directions that may guide us towards developing a better understanding of this based on a study of literature from design, management, and the history and philosophy of technology. First, we should explore the elements and practices used in different design situations, and the impact of differences in contextual factors. Second, design exploits the reuse and development of design patterns; understanding and exploiting such patterns is an important skill. I make the case that we might focus on distinctions-such as the one between exploiting old certainties and exploring new possibilities-to articulate our understanding of the differences between design activities with different degrees of novelty. Based on these arguments, I make suggestions regarding the relationship between design, science, and management, and for possible application of the arguments in wider design fields.

TI  - Is Residual Nodal Disease at Axillary Dissection Associated with Tumor Subtype in Patients with Low Volume Sentinel Node Metastasis After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), the likelihood of residual nodal disease at axillary dissection (ALND) is high. Whether non-SLN metastasis frequency varies based on tumor subtype and SLN metastasis size is uncertain. We examined the association between tumor subtype and frequency of non-SLN metastases in patients with SLN micro- vs macrometastases after NAC. Methods Patients with invasive breast cancer and a positive SLN biopsy after NAC between July 2008 and July 2019 were identified. Associations between tumor subtype, SLN disease volume, and frequency of non-SLN metastases were examined. Results Among 273 patients with >= 1 positive SLN and a completion ALND, mean age was 51 years, 87% of tumors were ductal, 80% were clinically node-positive at presentation, and 85% were cT2-3. The frequency of non-SLN metastases was non-significantly higher in HR+/HER2- (61%) vs. HER2+ (52%) and triple negative tumors (45%) (p = 0.09). Frequency of SLN micrometastasis was 9% for triple negative tumors compared with 17% for HR+/HER2- and 34% for HER2+ tumors (p = 0.015). Size of SLN metastasis (micro- vs. macrometastases) was not associated with non-SLN metastasis frequency or number within any subtype. Conclusions In patients with a positive SLN after NAC, the likelihood of non-SLN metastasis at ALND was high across all tumor subtypes and did not vary significantly for SLN micro- versus macrometastases. ALND is recommended for SLN micro- and macrometastases after NAC, irrespective of tumor subtype.

TI  - Unilateral versus bilateral nodal irradiation: Current evidence in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancers of the head and neck region often present with nodal involvement. There is a long-standing convention within the community of head and neck radiation oncology to irradiate both sides of the neck electively in almost all cases to include both macroscopic and microscopic disease extension (so called elective nodal volume). International guidelines for the selection and delineation of the elective lymph nodes were published in the early 2000s and were updated recently. However, diagnostic imaging techniques have improved the accuracy and reliability of nodal staging and as a result, small metastases that used to remain undetected and were thus in the past included in the elective nodal volume, will now be included in high-dose volumes. Furthermore, the elective nodal areas are situated close to the parotid glands, the submandibular glands and the swallowing muscles. Therefore, irradiation of a smaller, more selected volume of the elective nodes could reduce treatment-related toxicity. Several researchers consider the current bilateral elective neck irradiation strategies an overtreatment and show growing interest in a unilateral nodal irradiation in selected patients. The aim of this article is to give an overview of the current evidence about the indications and benefits of unilateral nodal irradiation and the use of SPECT/CT-guided nodal irradiation in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.

AB  - All the supervised classification methods need sufficient and efficient samples, which are commonly labeled by visual inspection. In this study, to resolve the issues of insufficient training samples and time-consuming, a novel method for detailed and automated LULC classification by LC_Type1 of MCD12Q1 IGBP schemes in the GEE cloud platform was proposed based on the RF and CART classifiers. The results present that the validation overall accuracy of the RF classifier is higher than the CART, 87.24% in Australia, and 85.18% in the USA, respectively. The automated classification results of the RF classifier are more concentrated than CART, which the RF classifier is more suitable for this automated method. Moreover, the proposed method can accomplish accurate, detailed, and automated LULC classification based on the GEE which is making satellite imagery computing an efficient, flexible, and fast process. The workflow provides a reliable method for detailed, automated, and remotely LULC classification.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the impact of government HIV strategies that aimed to increase HIV testing uptake and frequency among gay and bisexual men (GBM) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Design We analysed HIV testing data from existing passive and sentinel surveillance systems between 2010 and 2018.Methods Six indicators were measured: (1) state-wide total HIV laboratory tests; (2) number of GBM attending publicly-funded clinics; (3) 12-monthly testing uptake; (4) annual testing frequency; (5) HIV testing with a STI diagnosis; and (6) HIV positivity. Mathematical modelling was used to estimate (7) the proportion of men with undiagnosed HIV. Indicators were stratified by Australian vs. overseas-born.Results Overall, 43,560 GBM attended participating clinics (22,662 Australian-born, 20,834 overseas-born) from 2010-2018. Attendees increased from 5,186 in 2010 to 16,507 in 2018. There were increasing trends (p<0.001 for all) in testing uptake (83.9% to 95.1%); testing with a STI diagnosis (68.7% to 94.0%); annual HIV testing frequency (1.4 to 2.7); and a decreasing trend (p<0.01) in HIV positivity (1.7% to 0.9%).Increases in testing were similar in Australian-born and overseas-born GBM. However, there were decreasing trends in the estimated undiagnosed HIV proportion overall (9.5% to 7.7%) and in Australian-born GBM (7.1% to 2.8%), but an increasing trend in overseas-born GBM (15.3% to 16.9%) (p<0.001 for all).

TI  - Appraisal of regional haze event and its relationship with PM2.5 concentration, crop residue burning and meteorology in Chandigarh, India
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution affects not only the air quality in megacities but also in medium and small-sized cities due to rapid urbanization, industrialization, and other anthropogenic activities. From October 28, 2015 to November 3, 2015, the Indo-Gangetic Plains region, including Chandigarh encountered an episode of poor visibility during the daytime. The daily average PM2.5 concentration reached 191 mg/m(3), and visibility reduced by similar to 2.2 times in the Chandigarh region. PM2.5 concentration was found around 4 times higher than a non-haze day and more than 3 times higher than National Ambient Air Quality Standards for 24 h. A significant correlation between PM2.5 and CO (r: 0.87) during the haze period indicated similarity in their emission sources; which was attributed to the burning of solid organic matter. Further, satellite data and back-trajectory analysis of air masses showed large-scale rice stubble burning in the agricultural fields, adjoining to the city areas. The transboundary movement of air masses below 500 m and meteorological conditions played a major role in building the pollution load in the Chandigarh region. Moreover, the enhanced concentration of biomass burning tracers, i.e., organic carbon (similar to 3.8 times) and K+ ions (2 similar to times) in PM2.5 and acetonitrile (similar to 2.3 times) in ambient air was observed during the haze event. The study demonstrates how regional emissions and meteorological conditions can affect the air quality in a city; which can be useful for proper planning and mitigation policies to minimize high air pollution episodes.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in response to coastal upwelling and mesoscale eddies in the South Eastern Arabian Sea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of mesoscale dynamics on variability of phytoplankton biomass in terms of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration was studied in the coastal waters of the South Eastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) using long-term satellite data. Satellite-derived chl-a, sea level anomaly, sea surface temperature, and sea surface wind data for the period 1998-2016 were compiled from various sources and analysed to investigate the chl-a variability associated with coastal upwelling and mesoscale eddies. The Empirical Orthogonal Function and Morlet wavelet analyses were performed to estimate the quantitative variability and the result showed strong seasonal and interannual modulation in chl-a concentration and associated environmental variables. The Okubo-Weiss criterion was applied for the identification of mesoscale eddies. The results indicated the presence of cyclonic (cold core) eddies during the summer monsoon season (June-September). The wind-induced upwelling and the cyclonic eddies were most intense during the summer monsoon season, causing higher values of chl-a compared with other season. It is revealed that the variability of chl-a, which might be attributed to seasonal and interannual differences in the surface and sub-surface nutrients, is caused either by coastal upwelling or cyclonic eddies. In particular, the wind-induced upwelling strongly controls the spatial and temporal variability of chl-a compared with mesoscale eddies along the SEAS. The regression model we adopted points out the dominant role played by the wind and its forcing bring about variability in chl-a. The occurrence of extreme climatic events such as El Nino, La Nina and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) was noticed during the study period and particularly taken into account to understand the interannual fluctuations in chl-a and associated environmental variables. The relative variability in chl-a concentration was prominent during strong El Nino, La Nina, and IOD. We have attempted to determine the relationship between chl-a with coastal upwelling and mesoscale eddies, the overall importance of such physical forcings, and their influence on bio-production in the SEAS.

TI  - Landfast Ice Mapping Using MODIS Clear-Sky Composites: Application for the Banks Island Coastline in Beaufort Sea and Comparison with Canadian Ice Service Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast ice (LFI) is a prominent climatological feature in the Canadian Arctic. LFI is generally defined as immobile near-shore ice that remains fast along the coast and forms seaward from the land. It affects the coastline dynamics, is important for the near-shore ecosystems, wildlife, and human socio-economic activities. A method is proposed for mapping the LFI using time series of 10-day clear-sky composites derived at the Canada Center for Remote Sensing (CCRS) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m imagery. The delineation of coastal zone ice utilizes simultaneous analysis of the mean and standard deviation of MODIS monthly reflectance maps. The application of this method is demonstrated for a 20-year period (2000-2019) over the coastal zone of Banks Island in the Beaufort Sea. Detailed analyses have been conducted for three LFI parameters: (1) the total area (spatial extent) occupied by LFI; (2) the distance from the coast to the outer seaward LFI edge, and (3) the water depth at the outer seaward LFI edge. Comparison with the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) data demonstrates good agreement. The average correlation coefficients between CIS and CCRS time series in April-June, when the area reaches a maximum, are equal to 0.87-0.88. The mean differences (CIS-CCRS) are 344 km(2) (5,464 km(2) vs 5,120 km(2)) or 6.3% for the spatial extent; 1.3 km (17.6 km vs 16.3 km) or 7.4% for the distance; -2.7 m (-27.4 m vs -24.7 m) or 10% for the water depth. Because the CCRS method uses monthly statistics, it tends to exclude potentially more mobile continuous landfast ice zones than the CIS analysis which is based on data collected on a specific date. The long-term trends of the LFI seasonal cycle in our region of interest since 2000 have shown a tendency for an earlier break-up, later onset, and longer ice-free period; however, these trends are not statistically significant.

TI  - Dynamics of seasonal snowpack over the High Atlas
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowpack melting in the High Atlas constitutes the major source of freshwater for the semi-arid agricultural plains of central Morocco. Snow runoff fills dams during spring and recharges groundwater, thus providing the necessary water for irrigation and hydropower production. Despite its critical importance for the region, basic questions about the High Atlas snowpack remain largely unanswered. In particular, the spatial and temporal distribution of snow water equivalent, as well as sublimation losses, potentially significant in this region, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. The scarcity of ground data has been a major obstacle to investigating snow processes in the High Atlas. Here, we demonstrate the potential of remotely-sensed meteorological variables and downscaled climate reanalysis data to gain important insights into snow water balance in a semi-arid region. We apply a distributed energy balance snow model based on SNOW17, constrained by topographic data, meteorological data from satellites and high-resolution dynamically-downscaled ERA-Interim data, to simulate snowpack dynamics within the Oum-Er-Rbia watershed, at the heart of Morocco's High Atlas. The simulations are compared to MODIS snow cover maps and observed snow depth at one field station. Results show that the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of snow cover at various elevation ranges are accurately captured. The snowpack is essentially concentrated above 2500 m, extends over 500-6000 km(2) and holds 0.05-0.4 km(3) at its peak in early February. Additionally, we find that losses by sublimation range from 0.06 to 0.14 km(3) for an average of 0.09 km(3) a year, about 10% of all snowfall. Above 3000 m elevation, sublimation removes on average 20% of the snowpack. Finally, we discuss the sensitivity of our results to uncertainties in the forcing meteorological data. This study reveals the essential components of the snow water balance in the High Atlas and paves the way for better understanding of its sensitivity to climate change.

TI  - Systematic Assessment of MODTRAN Emulators for Atmospheric Correction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric radiative transfer models (RTMs) simulate the light propagation in the Earth's atmosphere. With the evolution of RTMs, their increase in complexity makes them impractical in routine processing such as atmospheric correction. To overcome their computational burden, standard practice is to interpolate a multidimensional lookup table (LUT) of prestored simulations. However, accurate interpolation relies on large LUTs, which still implies large computation times for their generation and interpolation. In recent years, emulation has been proposed as an alternative to LUT interpolation. Emulation approximates the RTM outputs by a statistical regression model trained with a low number of RTM runs. However, a concern is whether the emulator reaches sufficient accuracy for atmospheric correction. Therefore, we have performed a systematic assessment of key aspects that impact the precision of emulating MODTRAN: 1) regression algorithm; 2) training database size; 3) dimensionality reduction (DR) method and a number of components; and 4) spectral resolution. The Gaussian processes regression (GPR) was found the most accurate emulator. The principal component analysis remains a robust DR method and nearly 20 components reach sufficient precision. Based on a database of 1000 samples covering a broad range of atmospheric conditions, GPR emulators can reconstruct the simulated spectral data with relative errors below 1% for the 95th percentile. These emulators reduce the processing time from days to minutes, preserving sufficient accuracy for atmospheric correction and providing model uncertainties and derivatives. We provide a set of guidelines and tools to design and generate accurate emulators for satellite data processing applications.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Geospatial Modeling for 3D City Based on Edge Computing Using Statistical Framework Linear Injection Model Based on Multi-data Source Fusion
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, data on individual spatiotemporal levels have been increasingly available, especially due to the utilization of modern GPS tracking devices. Cloud pollution significantly restricts the potential use for geoscience applications of optical remote sensing images. This paper presents a spatial and time-based melting process for remote imaging using a model of linear injection and information for neighborhood with edge computing assistance. The detailed data have proven helpful for inferring a more precise degree of transmission than conventional methods. Nevertheless, a lack of statistically sound frames remains for modeling mechanistically for the underlying transmission process and this development is particularly important to provide an individual general predictive epidemic framework. In this paper, a New Statistical Framework Linear Injection Model Based on Multi-Data Source Fusion method is proposed to determine the transmission of cloud-free image and to enhance the noise robustness. To improve its noise strength further, the local neighborhood information is introduced for refining initial fused stage image and to obtain more accurate prediction results, derived simultaneously from resolution fine image and fused result. To improve the spectral cohesion of recovered and remaining areas, correction residual strategy based on the Poisson equation has been analyzed. The tests demonstrated that the methods proposed for cases with substantial land cover modifications can work very well; they have less biases and more reliable performance compared with several cutting-edge approaches. To sum up, our solution is a major technical improvement to the current cloud removal system and offers the possibility of handling scenes with substantial land coverage changes.

TI  - Mapping typical salt-marsh species in the Yellow River Delta wetland supported by temporal-spatial-spectral multidimensional features
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The native salt marsh plants of the Yellow River Delta wetland such as Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis, providing significant habitats for rare waterfowl, are the key to conserve biodiversity and enhance habitats of this critical wetland. These plants are undergoing severe degradation due to rapid invasion of Spartina alterniflora, which has been a major growing threat to the livelihood of waterfowl and the sustainability of the Yellow River Delta wetland. Monitoring the spatial pattern of salt marsh species is fundamental to the conservation and restoration of the ecological functions in the Yellow River Delta wetland. The development of remote sensing technologies is making a leap forward, particularly the high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which holds the potential to map heterogeneous wetland regardless of weather. In this study, we developed an innovative framework to map the distribution of salt marsh species with the integration of optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) images. Within this framework, a comprehensive set of features including spectral, spatial and temporal features were considered, and the best feature combination was selected and applied in a random forest classification model to obtain the final map. The results show that the temporal-spectral features combined with the spatial-temporal features of the SAR data can effectively improve the separability of Suaeda salsa, Phragmites australis, and Spartina alterniflora. Compared with using optical or SAR data alone, the combination of optical and SAR data improved the kappa coefficient and the overall classification accuracy by 0.10-0.19 and 6.04-11.61%, respectively. The spatial distribution of the two main native plants and the invasive plant can facilitate ecological restoration of the Yellow River Delta wetland. The framework developed by this study can be efficiently replicated and transferred by similar studies. Our approach lays a solid foundation for intelligent monitoring and management of coastal wetland. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

TI  - Improved estimates of bio-optical parameters in optically complex water using hyperspectral remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, bio-optical parameters were derived from hyperspectral data of optically complex waters using spectrum matching technique (SMT). Models for inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the water column were tuned using in-situ dataset from the study area (i.e., Chilika lagoon). Constructed IOPs were used to simulate remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) spectra at 60 wavelengths (equally spaced between 400 and 700 nm) using radiative transfer solution provided by Hydrolight-Ecolight software (HE53). Results of the simulation were stored as a R-rs - IOP look up table (LUT). To check the accuracy, in-situ measured R-rs were compared with those from the LUT. Retrieved values of two bio-optical parameters i.e., chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)+Detritus absorption coefficient at 440 nm (a(dg)(440)) were compared with corresponding in-situ measurements to get good statistical match. Coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were 0.80 and 2.66 mg m(-3) respectively for Chl-a, whereas 0.77 and 0.23 m(-1) respectively for a(dg)(440). These parameters were also retrieved using two commonly used semi-analytical inversion algorithms (SAA)- (a) Linear matrix inversion (LMI) and (b) Garver-Siegal Maritorena (GSM). Both the SAA showed poor performance. R-2 for Chl-a from GSM and LMI were 0.13 and 0.41, respectively, with RMSE of 6.85 mg m 3 and 4.82 mg m(-3) respectively. For (dg)(440), the value of R-2 from GSM and LMI were 0.87 and 0.71, respectively, but with a high RMSE of 0.91 m(-1) and 0.81 m(-1) respectively. SMT was applied to airborne hyperspectral AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation) dataset of Chilika lake to derive pixel-wise chlorophyll-a concentration and the magnitude of CDOM+Detritus absorption coefficient at 440 nm (adgo440THORN). Spatial variability of these parameters in its different domains (i.e. Northern-, Centraland Southern-region of the lake) have been addressed.

TI  - Snow depth retrieval in North-Western Himalayan region using pursuit-monostatic TanDEM-X datasets applying polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry based inversion Modelling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing is a state-of-the-art tool for snow monitoring and snow parameters estimation. SAR remote sensing-based techniques, such as interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) have already proven useful in the estimation of geophysical parameters of snow. InSAR-based techniques utilize interferometric phase information from repeat-pass datasets for snow parameters retrieval. During the monitoring of snow, the large temporal gap between the repeat passes results in the temporal decorrelation in the snowpack, which leads to the loss of interferometric coherence. Hence, there is a need for a technique for snow parameters estimation, which can work with zero temporal baseline datasets. This study works on the development of a Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) based modelling approach for snow-depth estimation using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X datasets acquired in the pursuit monostatic mode (temporal baseline = 10 seconds). The study area of this work is the Manali region of Himachal Pradesh situated in the Beas basin. Multi-temporal analysis of the snow-depth variation is executed utilizing the two pursuit-monostatic TanDEM-X interferometric quad-pol dataset pairs of the dates 21 January 2015 and 22 January 2015. In this study, the PolInSAR-based Coherence Amplitude Inversion modelling approach is used for the snow-depth retrieval. The magnitude of the complex interferometric coherence is used during the modelling implementation. The snow extinction coefficient is estimated and used as an input during PolInSAR modelling. Further, a comparison of the calculated volume coherence magnitude and the observed volume coherence magnitude is done during model implementation for the snow-depth estimation. The snow depth is estimated at a resolution of 15 m x 15 m in range and azimuth directions respectively. The estimated snow depth for both the dates shows a precise correlation with the ground datasets. The rise in model retrieved snow-depth value from 0.84 m to 1.24 m is observed during the period. The retrieved results were validated using the ground data of snow depth from the Automatic weather station (AWS) of Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), and Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) installed in the Dhundi region of the study area for same dates.

TI  - Can one stop nucleic acid sampling (OSNA) predict nodal positivity following neoadjuvant chemotherapy? A prospective cohort study of 293 patients
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Until recently, axillary node clearance had long been the standard of care in patients with axillary node-positive disease. One stop nucleic acid sampling (OSNA) has been used to guide intraoperative decision-making regarding suitability for axillary node clearance (ANC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of OSNA following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and whether it can predict lymph node burden in ANC. A single center, prospective cohort study was performed on 297 patients having OSNA between 2016 and 2019. Patients were sub-classified according to node positivity at diagnosis and those treated with NACT and outcomes included copy number and lymph node harvest. Axillary complete pathological response was observed in 24/36 patients (67%) following NACT. 14/16 patients (87%) having axillary node clearance had axillary node disease limited to 4 nodes. OSNA copy numbers were significantly higher in patients showing disease progression following NACT. Overall, 73% of patients with lymph node positivity at diagnosis could be successfully treated with a combination of NACT and lymph node excision of four nodes. De-escalating axillary surgical treatment to resection of four nodes following NACT may be effective in balancing oncological resection and limiting treatment morbidity. ONSA can correctly identify patients experiencing disease progression who would benefit from traditional three-level ANC.

TI  - An active-passive fusion strategy and accuracy evaluation for shallow water bathymetry based on ICESat-2 ATLAS laser point cloud and satellite remote sensing imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) on ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2) uses a 532 nm band photon-counting LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), which has certain penetrability to water bodies, and the measured data show that the bathymetric ability reaches nearly one Secchi depth. ATLAS has a limited number of beams and a fixed ground track, and only collects section elevation along the track direction. The fusion of active laser point cloud and passive optical remote sensing satellite image can fill the gap of shallow water depth data in a large range. This paper takes ATLAS as the research object, with the aim of exploring the effective algorithm flow of spaceborne active laser and passive optical fusion processing, and systematically evaluating the bathymetric accuracy of the fusion algorithm. An adaptive Gauss filtering technology based on the density of point cloud was firstly improved to achieve accurate denoising under the condition of uneven surface/underwater density. Subsequently, the depth of underwater points was calculated automatically through steps of water surface modelling, refraction correction, etc. Finally, the control points and check points were randomly extracted to solve the parameters of multispectral inversion model and verify the internal accuracy of the model. In this paper, the accuracy of ATLAS bathymetry was verified by Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB) data in Oahu Island, Hawaii, and the results indicate that the vertical root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 0.56 m to 1.11 m. In Yongle islands and Qilianyu area of the South China Sea, WorldView-2 (WV2) 4 bands multispectral images and ATLAS data were used to carry out the active-passive fusion bathymetry, and the ALB and sonar data were used to evaluate the accuracy. Experimental results show that the internal compliance accuracy of the fusion model is better than 1.25 m (RMSE), and the real bathymetry accuracy is better than 1.42 m (RMSE). The above results reveal the great potential of active-passive fusion bathymetry based on ICESat-2 and other high-resolution remote sensing satellites, which can provide strong technical support for filling the blank of shallow water depth information.

TI  - Partition satellite derived bathymetry for coral reefs based on spatial residual information
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery with high spatial and temporal resolutions provides strong support for remote sensing bathymetry. Heterogeneous underwater environments such as complex bottom types represent the main factor affecting accuracy of satellite derived bathymetry. Segmenting imagery can enhance geospatial adaptability and improve the accuracy. Conventionally, satellite imagery can be subdivided based on bottom types confirmed by a priori knowledge gained from in situ observations (e.g. video and photos); however, this process poses challenges concerning some politically sensitive or unreachable areas. Besides, water depth in coral reef areas is generally shallow (depth range: 0 to 5 m) and complex, and it has proved difficult to improve bathymetric mapping accuracy with passive multispectral imagery in such areas using traditional models. With the spatial distribution of the residuals of discrete points to realize regional segmentation, this study developed an effective partition model for satellite derived bathymetry without the need for a priori knowledge of bottom types. WorldView-2 high resolution (2 m) imagery of Dongdao Island (China) was used in the study. The results of a practical application of the model revealed the following. (1) The developed partition bathymetry model reflected underwater topographical changes and features more clearly than a comparative global model, especially in certain areas of complex terrain. (2) The accuracy of the residual partition model (Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.96 m, Mean Relative Error (MRE): 11.04%, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 1.36 m) is greater than the global model and the conventional partition model. (3) In different water depth intervals, the residual partition model has always the best accuracy. Subregion models corresponding to the proposed models are more stable and more accurate than those to the conventional partition model. In areas of shallow water (depth: 0 to 5 m), the MRE of a subregion-A model using the residual partition method is 14.09%, i.e. better than the global model (19.45%). The findings demonstrate that the developed model can largely overcome the problem of poor precision in shallow water associated with conventional models.

A1  - FDA-Sentinel Covid-19 Working Grp
TI  - A COVID-19-ready public health surveillance system: The Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Review
AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System was established in 2009 to use routinely collected electronic health data for improving the national capability to assess post-market medical product safety. Over more than a decade, Sentinel has become an integral part of FDA's surveillance capabilities and has been used to conduct analyses that have contributed to regulatory decisions. FDA's role in the COVID-19 pandemic response has necessitated an expansion and enhancement of Sentinel. Here we describe how the Sentinel System has supported FDA's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight new capabilities developed, key data generated to date, and lessons learned, particularly with respect to working with inpatient electronic health record data.Early in the pandemic, Sentinel developed a multi-pronged approach to support FDA's anticipated data and analytic needs. It incorporated new data sources, created a rapidly refreshed database, developed protocols to assess the natural history of COVID-19, validated a diagnosis-code based algorithm for identifying patients with COVID-19 in administrative claims data, and coordinated with other national and international initiatives.Sentinel is poised to answer important questions about the natural history of COVID-19 and is positioned to use this information to study the use, safety, and potentially the effectiveness of medical products used for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.

TI  - ACOSOG Z-0011 criteria impact on axillary surgery for early breast cancer in clinical practice: Evaluation in a retrospective cohort of 1900 patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is a trend towards de-escalation in early breast cancer axillary surgery. In the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z-0011 trial, observation was shown to be non-inferior in terms of overall survival to complementary axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) in patients with up to two sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases. The study included patients with T1 -T2 invasive breast cancer, clinically node negative, undergoing breast-conserving surgery with SLN biopsy, followed by systemic therapy and radiotherapy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of applying these ACOSOG Z-0011 inclusion criteria in routine practice.Patients and methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted in a French comprehensive cancer center where patients treated for breast cancer with primary surgery were prospectively included between 2010 and 2016. Patients meeting ACOSOG Z-0011 inclusion criteria were analyzed.Results: Among the 1900 included patients,1497 (79 %) met the ACOSOG Z-0011 criteria before surgery. Of these, 390 (20 %) had one or two metastatic SLN and could have avoided cALND. Out of these patients, 319 (81 %) presented cT1 tumors. During the study period, cALND was performed in 320 (82 %) patients and was free of metastases in 80 % of cases, having an impact on eligibility for adjuvant chemotherapy in only 3 (0.8 %) patients.Conclusions: In situations of primary breast cancer surgery, use of ACOSOG Z-0011 criteria could reduce the rate of cALND by 20 %. Further studies are needed to help select patients for whom abstention from any axillary surgery would be reasonable. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Accurate mapping of Brazil nut trees (<i>Bertholletia excelsa</i>) in Amazonian forests using WorldView-3 satellite images and convolutional neural networks
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The commercialization of Brazil nuts, seeds of Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl. (Lecythidaceae), represents one of the main income-generation activities for local and indigenous people from the Brazilian Amazon region. Because trees of B. excelsa grow and bear fruit almost exclusively in natural forests, information on their spatial distribution is crucial for nut harvest planning. However, this information is difficult to obtain with traditional approaches such as ground-based surveys. Here, we show the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and WorldView-3 satellite images (pixel size = 30 cm) to map individual tree crowns (ITCs) and groves of B. excelsa in Amazonian forests. First, we manually outlined B. excelsa ITCs in the WorldView-3 images using field-acquired geolocation information. Then, based on ITC boundaries, we sequentially extracted image patches and selected 80% of them for training and 20% for testing. We trained the DeepLabv3+ architecture with three backbones: ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2. The average producer's accuracy was 93.87 +/- 0.85%, 93.89 +/- 1.6% and 93.47 +/- 3.6% for ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2, respectively. We then developed a new random patch extraction training strategy and assessed how a reduction in the percentage of training patches impacted the classification accuracy. To illustrate the robustness of the new training strategy, similar F1scores were achieved whether 80% or 10% of the total number of patches were used to train the CNN model. By analyzing the feature maps derived from ResNet-18, we found that the shadow of emergent B. excelsa trees are important for their discrimination. Geometric distortions in the WorldView-3 images resulting from extreme offnadir viewing angles compromise the presence of shadows, thus potentially hampering B. excelsa detection. Our results show that ITCs and groves of B. excelsa can be mapped by integrating CNNs and very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite images, paving the way for monitoring this important tree species in large tracts of Amazonian forests.

TI  - Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging for Sentinel Lymph Node Identification in Melanoma Surgery
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although less common than other types of skin cancers, melanoma is accountable for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths. The standard management for patients with clinically negative nodes includes a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, which is commonly performed using a combination of radioactive tracer (Tc-99) and a blue dye (isosulfan or patent blue). There are numerous drawbacks associated with Tc-99 and blue dyes such as elevated costs, logistical challenges, and anaphylactic reactions among others. In recent years, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) has emerged as a safe, effective, less costly, and more convenient alternative for the identification of SLNs in melanoma. We discuss the case of a 51-year-old man with melanoma in his left upper back. Two SLNs in the left axilla were successfully identified using NIR fluorescence. NIR fluorescence with ICG for SLN identification has proven to increase the sensitivity and accuracy when used in combination with lymphoscintigraphy.

TI  - Landscape index for indicating water quality and application to master plan of regional lake cluster restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the relation between landscape pattern and water quality is essential to making a master plan for restoration of regional lake and wetland clusters, which has not yet been well resolved. Here, we studied the impacts of landscape pattern changes on water quality over lake clusters, taking the aquaculture area in the Lixia River hinterland of China as a case. Multi-temporal Landsat series of remote sensing data from 1985 to 2018 was used and space-for-time substitution (SFTS) method was applied to explore the relationship between landscape pattern and water quality. Results showed that wetland and free water surface were the dominant classes of the lake cluster in 1985 and 1990, but they began to rapidly decrease from 1995 to 2000. The enclosure aquaculture increased rapidly since 1995 and became the dominant class between 1995 and 2018. The patch density of aquaculture water (PD_A) increased from 0.09n/km2 in 1985 to 0.34n/km2 in 2018, with the largest degree of fragmentation in 2000. However, the growth rate of PD_A declined significantly after the enactment of the lake ecological protection policies. The SFTS results showed that PD_A had positive correlation with total nitrogen (TN) (r = 0.26), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) (r = 0.21), and Chlorophyta (r = 0.33), and the water quality degraded with increasing PD_A. Hence, PD_A could be a water quality indicator of lakes in the Lixia River hinterland. The study is expected to provide a viable method to design regional restoration plan for degraded and over-developed wetland areas.

TI  - Radiative transfer modeling to measure fire impact and forest engineering resilience at short-term
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest managers demand reliable and cost-efficient methodologies to implement forest resilience concepts in post-fire decision-making at different spatio-temporal scales. In this paper, we developed a generalizable remote sensing-based tool to measure disturbance impact and engineering resilience at short-term in forest ecosystems affected by wildland fires. The case study was a mixed-severity wildfire that burned several shrubland (dominated by gorse, broom and heath) and tree forest (dominated by oak and pine) ecosystems. Specifically, we retrieved fractional vegetation cover (FVC) over a time-series of pre and post-fire Deimos-2 imagery (spatial resolution of 4 m) from a radiative transfer model (RTM) hybrid inversion approach (Gaussian processes regression algorithm learned from a simulation dataset generated using the PROSAIL-D model). Pre and post-fire FVC retrieval was validated with field data stratified by dominant ecosystem. High accuracy (>90%) and low error (<7%) were achieved in the retrieval over the time-series, despite the influence of background signal of soil and burned legacies. A random point sampling stratified by ecosystem and burn severity was used to extract validated FVC values for the time-series. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed to evaluate the effect of burn severity along the time-series on FVC for each ecosystem. One-way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey's pairwise comparison test were applied to determine the earliest point in the time-series for which the FVC does not differ significantly from the pre-fire FVC. In tree forest ecosystems, the fire impact on FVC was stronger at high burn severity, being similar the impact on shrub ecosystems at medium and high burn severity. Engineering resilience was conditioned both by burn severity and species regenerative strategies. In ecosystems dominated by facultative or obligate seeders, pre-fire FVC was reached later across the time-series, compared to resprouter-dominated ecosystems. The RTM hybrid inversion tool has proved its reliability for assessing disturbance impact and ecosystem engineering resilience at short-term in heterogeneous fire-prone landscapes affected by mixed severity wildfires.

TI  - Evapotranspiration estimates for two tropical mountain forest using high spatial resolution satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical Mountain Forest (TMF) provides important ecological functions like evapotranspiration (ET) that supplies moisture and energy to the atmosphere. ET observations are scarce and difficult to accomplish particularly in areas of high heterogeneity where TMF are. Remote sensing (RS) allows to quantify and to determine ET spatial variation at the landscape level. Detail imaginary improves high spatial variability retrieval. Thought the greater detail introduces cast shadows by trees which hamper image interpretation. The objective of this study is to characterize ET estimation for the TMF of the southern Ecuadorian Andes by combining meteorological data with high-resolution satellite images. Shadows from high resolution images were masked out by applying focal statistics. The analysis included two meteorological periods typical of the area; a wet period when rain prevails and a dry period when precipitation is more sporadic. The reference evapotranspiration (ET0) was calculated using the FAO-Penman Montheid method by applying data obtained from an automatic weather station. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was derived from 2 m resolution WorldView2 satellite images. Results showed a lower ET mean value during the wet period: 1.54 mm day(-1) compared to 2.37 mm day(-1). Two forest types, differentiated from its structural composition and topographical position (ravine and ridge), marked ET spatial variation. Ravine forest that has a more dense and closed canopy showed higher ET values for both meteorological conditions. A comparison between ET estimations and ET field measurements from a scintillometer device showed a good agreement (coefficient of correlation r = 0.89) that proves the validity of the method. This study demonstrates that the application of high spatial resolution improves ET estimation in TMF especially when shadows are removed. Also, emphasizes the importance of analysing spatial heterogeneity to properly assess ecosystem water flux terms.

TI  - Time-series analysis of open data for studying urban heat island phenomenon: a geospatial approach
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is increasing with a faster pace in almost all the cities of India, which has somehow prompted the anthropogenic activities eventually influencing the environment in this climate change scenario. This has led to the more prominent urban heat island (UHI) effect in urban areas, significantly raising the surface temperature of urban built-up. To focus on this issue, a spatio-temporal analysis of UHI over the Jaipur site of Rajasthan has been performed using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for 16 years i.e., from 2003 to 2018 wherein NDVI has been used to analyze the status of vegetation in the urban and non-urban area w.r.t. UHI phenomenon. Study of UHI phenomenon has been done by computing the difference of mean LST between urban area and urban periphery (at a buffer distance of 2 km from urban boundary) both for day and night time. The difference of LST day time observed between urban and non-urban (buffer) is 0.06 degrees C in May, 2003 and 0.51 degrees C in May, 2018 whereas, difference of LST night time between urban and area surrounding to urban is 0.58 degrees C in May, 2003 and 1.41 degrees C in May, 2018. From the quantitative analysis of land use land cover it has been observed that there is a rapid increase of urban area from 63% in 2003 to 69% in 2018 and vegetation cover decreased from 36% in 2003 to 31% in 2018. The percentage decrease of vegetation cover from 2003 to 2018 is 5% and the percentage increase in urban area is 6% which is still continuing at an even faster rate. Data preparation tasks can be greatly minimized by using analysis ready open data available in the public domain for carrying out such studies. The approach followed in the study will assist researchers to carry out a quick spatio-temporal analysis for the identification of areas susceptible to increasing variability of LST. Also, it provides a basis to understand and manage urban stress, one of the major causes of unalterable damages to the environment.

TI  - Aerosol optical properties over Delhi during a dust event in summer 2014: plausible implications
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Delhi experiences frequent dust storms during the pre-monsoon season. We studied one such event that occurred on May 30th, 2014 at New Delhi to understand the changes in the optical properties of aerosols. The present study utilizes the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the ground and satellite measurements along with reanalysis data. The aerosol characteristics were examined during the pre-week and post-week of the dust storm event. The results show that AOD values reach similar to 1.0 in all the modes of measurements (i.e., sun photometer, MODIS, and MERRA-2) on the dust event day. MODIS-derived Aerosol Angstrom Exponent (AAE), which gradually decreases from 1.7 +/- 0.3 to 1.1 +/- 0.3, shows the presence of coarse mode particles during the event. The aerosol layer at an elevation from 1 to 2 km was observed using indigenously developed dual-polarization micro-pulse lidar (MPL) system during the dust event. The source of the dust during the storm was identified by the air mass back-trajectories analysis. The dust column mass density averaged 24 hourly at 850 hPa is 780 mg m(-2) with a prevailing wind direction of west to east with wind speed of 11-13 ms(-1). Shortwave aerosol direct radiative forcing (SWADRF) diurnally averaged at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), the atmosphere (ATM), and surface (SUR) are found to be - 10 W m(-2), 27 W m(-2), and - 37 W m(-2), respectively. The heating rate was enhanced by 56% (from 0.16 to 0.25 K day(-1)) during the event in the whole atmospheric column. Visibility decreased by 31% during the dust storm day compared with its average value of non-dust storm days.

TI  - Land cover composition, climate, and topography drive land surface phenology in a recently burned landscape: An application of machine learning in phenological modeling
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) characterizes the seasonal dynamics of vegetation communities that compose individual satellite pixels and its interannual and spatial variations have been widely associated with climate. However, increasing evidence shows an effect of land cover composition within a pixel on LSP, but it remains unclear the extent of impacts relative to other drivers. To fill this gap, this study quantitatively assessed the contributions of land cover composition, climate, and topography on the spatial and interannual variation in LSP throughout the 2002 Ponil Complex Fire in New Mexico, USA, using a machine learning approach of Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). As the fire mainly converted ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir (evergreen tree) to soil ground and Gambel Oak (deciduous shrub), we computed both the proportion of tree cover to all vegetation cover (PTV) and vegetation fractional cover (VFC) as the metrics of land cover composition from high-resolution images in 2018 and from MODIS growing season greenness from 2001-2018. Start (SOS) and end (EOS) of growing season were derived from 500-m MODIS data from 2001-2018 and 30-m Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 data in 2018. BRT models showed that PTV was the most important predictor of spatial variations in SOS and EOS in 2018, despite the different contributions (20.3% - 42.9%) at 30-m and 500-m spatial scales. Although the growing degree days (28.6%) and the first freeze date (19.6%) were the most important predictors of interannual variations in SOS and EOS from 2001-2018, respectively, VFC also presented an important contribution for SOS (8.4%) and EOS (12.2%). This study demonstrates the utility of machine learning in modeling phenology and highlights the essential role of land cover composition in understanding the spatial and interannual variations of LSP that have been widely associated with topography and climate.

TI  - Secchi Depth estimation for optically-complex waters based on spectral angle mapping-derived water classification using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification-based methods for estimating water quality parameter (WQP) using remote sensing have shown great application potential in inland waters. Water classification algorithms have seen progress in water remote sensing. In this paper, we conducted the Secchi Depth value (Z (SD)) estimation based on a global water typology for the Wuhan area. Firstly, we classified the water into seven types using the Sentinel-2 data. The procedure was based on spectral angle mapping (SAM) of the 13 inland water optical types (IWOTs). Afterwards, seven IWOTs were summarized into four categories for Wuhan area. We then developed empirical models for each water category by stepwise multiple linear regression, generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and sparse spectrum Gaussian process regression (SSGPR), and applied the better approaches (GRNN and SSGPR) to three full satellite images (27 October 2018, 10 May 2019, and 29 July 2019). Finally, the retrieved results were validated using in situ-satellite match-ups and compared with the results based on unclassified imagery. With root-mean-square error (RMSE) of three satellite-derived results reduced from 0.32 m (without classification) to 0.16 m (with classification), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) reduced from 52% to 18%, from 0.51 m (MAPE = 57%) to 0.19 m (MAPE = 21%), and from 0.18 m (MAPE = 35%) to 0.09 m (MAPE = 17%), Z (SD) estimations over optically complex waters were improved based on this water classification. Due to its low cost and ease of operation, the SAM - derived classification applied in this paper provides a possibility for dynamic and high-precision monitoring for water management.

TI  - Cross-calibration of MODIS and VIIRS long near infrared bands for ocean color science and applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Generation of consistent multi-sensor datasets is critical to the assessment of long-term global changes using satellite-borne instruments. Recent research suggests, however, that a fundamental assumption in satellite ocean color data processing concerning the calibration of the long near infrared band (i.e., 865 nm for MODIS) may introduce sensor-specific biases in space and/or time, which may also contribute to cross-sensor inconsistency in the derived reflectance data products. As such, it is necessary to assess the calibration of this band across sensors - performed here for MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/SNPP using 'simultaneous same view' matchups (SSV; similar to simultaneous nadir overpass, but allowing for non-nadir measurements). Towards that end, we assess geometric, temporal, and spatial homogeneity metrics to identify SSVs, and develop a band-shifting approach applicable within standard satellite data processing routines to resolve expected spectral differences in the radiometry. We find top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data from VIIRS/SNPP long near infrared band to be approximately 3% higher than the corresponding MODIS/A data. With the expectation that cross-calibrating the NIRL should improve cross-sensor continuity of downstream geophysical products (e.g., chlorophyll-a), we reprocessed VIIRS data using updated calibration coefficients. While we noticed many minor improvements in cross-sensor continuity in such data products, large-scale geographic and temporal biases between these two datasets still remain. These discontinuities may be the result of disparate errors in polarization correction or atmospheric correction, both of which are modulated by radiant path geometry.

Ben-Gurion, eighty-two years old, was aware of his situation and knew what the ravages of time had done to his ability to function. Still, he felt physically fit enough for one last effort. Thus, he spent five weeks visiting Jewish communities on three continents - his longest stay outside Israel since the country had been founded. The worldview that undergirded the journey and lent them purpose and meaning within the whole of Ben-Gurion's outlook on the Jewish and Israeli reality sheds multifaceted light on the leader in his dotage.

TI  - Drosophila <i>NSD</i> deletion induces developmental anomalies similar to those seen in Sotos syndrome 1 patients
T2  - GENES & GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Haploinsufficiency of the human nuclear receptor binding suppressor of variegation 3-9, enhancer of zeste, and trithorax (SET) domain 1 (NSD1) gene causes a developmental disorder called Sotos syndrome 1 (SOTOS1), which is associated with overgrowth and macrocephaly. NSD family proteins encoding histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methyltransferases are conserved in many species, and Drosophila has a single NSD homolog gene, NSD. Objective To gain insight into the biological functions of NSD1 deficiency in the developmental anomalies seen in SOTOS1 patients using an NSD-deleted Drosophila mutant. Methods We deleted Drosophila NSD using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted gene knock-out, and analyzed pleiotropic phenotypes of the homozygous mutant of NSD (NSD-/-) at various developmental stages to understand the roles of NSD in Drosophila. Results The site-specific NSD deletion was confirmed in the mutant. The H3K36 di-methylation levels were dramatically decreased in the NSD-/- fly. Compared with the control, the NSD-/- fly displayed an increase in the body size of larvae, similar to the childhood overgrowth phenotype of SOTOS1 patients. Although the NSD mutant flies survived to adulthood, their fecundity was dramatically decreased. Furthermore, the NSD-/- fly showed neurological dysfunctions, such as lower memory performance and motor defects, and a diminished extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Conclusions The NSD-deleted Drosophila phenotype resembles many of the phenotypes of SOTOS1 patients, such as learning disability, deregulated ERK signaling, and overgrowth; thus, this mutant fly is a relevant model organism to study various SOTOS1 phenotypes.

TI  - Remote sensing of water transparency variability in the Ibitinga reservoir during COVID-19 lockdown
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As of October 8th, 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Brazil due to COVID-19 hit 5,002,357 and 148,304, respectively, making the country one of the most affected by the pandemic. The State of Sao Paulo (SSP) hosts the largest number of confirmed cases in Brazil, with over 1,016,755 cases to date. This study was carried out to investigate how the social distancing measures could have influenced the Ibitinga reservoir's water transparency in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We hypothesize that although the city's drainage is the major reservoir's input, as opposed to what has been reported elsewhere, the effect of extensive lockdown in the city of Sao Paulo due to COVID-19 is marginal on the water transparency. A time series of OLI/Landsat-8 images since 2014 were used to estimate the Secchi Disk Depth (Z(SD)). The COVID-19 cases and deaths (per 100,000 inhabitants), and social isolation index were used to find links between the Z(SD) and COVID-19. The results showed that the highest Z(DS) (higher than 1.6 m) occurred during the dry season (Austral autumn and beginning of Austral winter) and the lowest (0.4-0.8 m) during March 2020 (end of Austral summer). Paired sample t-Tests between images of 2020 and all the others showed that April 20th values were not different from that of June 14th, April 17th and March 18th. Z(SD) values from May 20th were not statistically different from May 14th and April 15th; June 20th values were not different from June 14th; and March 20th values were statistically different from all. We therefore conclude that, based on satellite data, the lockdown in SSP unlikely have influenced the water transparency in the Ibitinga reservoir.

TI  - Conservation beyond the existing protected area network is required to improve species and habitat representation in a global biodiversity hotspot
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Adequate representation of species and habitats is a critical aspect of an effective protected area (PA) network. Here, we evaluate the representation of focal wildlife species and forest types within the existing 11,241-km2 PA network of the Tanintharyi Region in southern Myanmar, a frontier forest landscape and global biodiversity hotspot, and use spatial prioritisation tools to identify additional priority areas for conservation outside the existing network that contribute towards meeting a 30% representation target. Our study showed that the current configuration of the existing PA network underrepresented 32 of 60 threatened wildlife species and 6 of 8 forest types, with mangroves being the least represented. Spatial prioritisation revealed that by protecting an additional 4032 km2 (8.4% of Tanintharyi's land area), 31% of which were adjacent to the existing PA network, the target representation for all wildlife species and forest types can be achieved. Enhancing the effectiveness of the existing network entails modest expansion by establishing additional conservation areas through various area-based conservation strategies, specifically targeting mangrove forests. Large oil palm agribusiness concessions, however, overlapped with almost 12% of priority conservation areas (consisting of additional areas and parts of the existing PA network), thereby competing with conservation interests. Expanding the area of representation will only succeed if the species and their habitats are adequately protected. Efforts therefore must prioritise the involvement and leadership of local communities and reflect local realities in negotiations among stakeholders.

TI  - Delayed Postoperative Hemorrhage Complicating Major Supramesocolic Surgery Management and Outcomes
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The place of surgery and interventional radiology in the management of delayed (> 24 h) hemorrhage (DHR) complicating supramesocolic surgery is still to define. The aim of the study was to evaluate outcomes of DHR using a combined multimodal strategy.Methods Between 2005 and 2019, 57 patients (median age 64 years) experienced 86 DHR episodes after pancreatic resection (n = 26), liver transplantation (n = 24) and other (n = 7). Hemodynamically stable patients underwent computed tomography evaluation followed by interventional radiology (IR) treatment (stenting and/or embolization) or surveillance. Hemodynamically unstable patients were offered upfront surgery. Failure to identify the leak was managed by either prophylactic stenting/embolization of the most likely bleeding source or surveillance.Results Mortality was 32% (n = 18). Bleeding recurrence occurred in 22 patients (39%) and was multiple in 7 (12%). Sentinel bleeding was recorded in 77 (81%) of episodes, and the bleeding source could not be identified in 26 (30%). Failure to control bleeding was recorded in 9 (28%) of 32 episodes managed by surgery and 4 (11%) of 41 episodes managed by IR (p = 0.14). Recurrence was similar after stenting and embolization (n = 4/18, 22% vs n = 8/26, 31%, p = 0.75) of the bleeding source. Recurrence was significantly lower after prophylactic IR management than surveillance of an unidentified bleeding source (n = 2/10, 20% vs. n = 11/16, 69%, p = 0.042).Conclusion IR management should be favored for the treatment of DHR in hemodynamically stable patients. Prophylactic IR management of an unidentified leak decreases recurrence risks.

TI  - Joint exploitation of space-borne and ground-based multitemporal InSAR measurements for volcano monitoring: The Stromboli volcano case study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a joint exploitation of space-borne and ground-based Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) and Multi Temporal (MT) InSAR measurements for investigating the Stromboli volcano (Italy) deformation phenomena. In particular, we focus our analysis on three periods: a) the time interval following the 2014 flank eruption, b) the July-August 2019 eruption and c) the following post-eruptive phase. To do this, we take advantage from an unprecedented set of space-borne and ground-based SAR data collected from April 2015 up to November 2019 along two (one ascending and one descending) Sentinel-1 (S-1) tracks, as well as, in the same period, by two ground-based systems installed along the Sciara del Fuoco northern rim. Such data availability permitted us to first characterize the volcano long-term 3D deformation behavior of the pre-eruptive period (April 2015-June 2019), by jointly inverting the space-borne and ground-based InSAR measurements. Then, the GB-SAR measurements allowed us to investigate the sin-eruptive time span (3rd July 2019 - 30th August 2019) which revealed rapid deformation episodes (e.g. more than 30 mm/h just 2 min before the 3rd July 2019 explosion) associated with the eruptive activity, that cannot be detected with the weekly S-1 temporal sampling. Finally, the S-1 measurements permitted to better constrain the post 2019 eruption deformations (31st August 2019 - 5th November 2019), which are mainly located outside the GB-SAR sensed area. The presented results demonstrate the effectiveness of the joint exploitation of the InSAR measurements obtained through satellite and terrestrial SAR systems, highlighting their strong complementarity to map and interpret the deformation phenomena affecting volcanic areas.

TI  - Remotely sensed mapping of the intertidal zone: A Sentinel-2 and Google Earth Engine methodology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The coasts of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland support a variety of tidal ranges with intertidal zones that can cover large areas and span several shoreline types. There has been an increased recognition of the ecosystem system services derived from the intertidal zone, however, evidence also suggests an overall reduction in intertidal extents since at least 1945. The intertidal zone has proven to be a difficult environment to regularly survey and map at national scales in many countries due to high cost and logistical complexities, so a new approach that is accurate, rapid, cost-effective and easily updated would provide a powerful tool for coastal zone management. An approach to map the intertidal zone by measuring water occurrence frequencies using tidally calibrated satellite imagery (Sentinel-2), and processed within Google Earth Engine (GEE), is proposed here as a complimentary approach to support traditional aerial or ground surveying. Using the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland as a test case, the resulting output, termed Coast X-Ray, compares favourably with the outputs from high-resolution digital elevation model datasets. Coast X-Ray provides an up-to-date insight into the morphology of the intertidal zone across the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland and can be used by a range of stakeholders to support coastal management and high-level coastal change assessments.

TI  - Optimization of land cover mapping through improvements in Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image dimensionality and data mining feature selection for hydrological modeling
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of land cover in a watershed has a remarkable influence on the water balance and, is a key factor in assessing complex hydrological models at the regional scale. Here, a method is proposed to generate accurate seasonal ad hoc land cover maps from a hydrological standpoint based on the runoff generation capabilities of the land cover types using remote sensing techniques with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and a random forest approach. A multidate study is proposed, minimizing the images as much as possible: one single date for Sentinel-2 data and two dates for Sentinel-1 data. Then, the dimensionality of the satellite data is improved with texture metrics and derived spectral indices, after which a data mining feature selection is conducted through optimization of the classification algorithm, ensuring the accuracy of the final maps. The overall accuracies are remarkably high (93.29%) for the test dataset and still outstanding (85.24%) for the validation dataset. The texture metrics are the most important classification parameters and are mainly derived from VIS (B2 and B3), NIR (B5 and B6) and SWIR (B11). The results outperformed previous works that used large temporal image series and reduced the storage capacity requirements and computational time. Consequently, the hydrological response of the watersheds in terms of NRCS-CN is characterized truthfully, allowing the analysis of the potential runoff and its variation due to seasonal phenology. Future research will be focused on the analysis of rainfall-runoff models and the variability in seasonal runoff in forested watersheds in Mediterranean environments.

TI  - Urban classification using preserved information of high dimensional textural features of Sentinel-1 images in Tabriz, Iran
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring urban land through satellite images has rapidly developed with the advent of modern technologies, and the increasing number of satellites plays a contributing role. While optical images have a high capability in urban monitoring, they still have some limitations, including their dependence on climatic conditions and spectral information, which lead to difficulty in making a distinction between bare land, buildings and other features. The impossibility of optical imagery at night is another issue that can make the land cover classification difficult. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) allows imaging in all climatic conditions and at nighttime, with an ability to detect phenomena based on their geometry, roughness, and location, making the land cover classification much easier. In the present study, radar Sentinel-1 images with polarization VV and VH were used for the land classification in Tabriz. Sentinel-2 images for the same time were applied as a reference for the calibration and accuracy assessment. Maximum likelihood (ML) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were also employed for supervised classification. In both algorithms, the classification was performed in windows with different sizes once by the SAR backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) and then by combining the backscattering coefficients with the statistical data obtained from the texture. The results showed that the use of radar images only with backscattering intensity resulted in poor performance while using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of texture features increased the accuracy. The transmitted frequencies of radar images have different redistributions to different phenomena. The numerical results obtained from the radar image classification show that using only the radar image redistribution led to low accuracies at both VV and VH polarization, but the use of the textural analysis significantly increased the accuracy of the classifications. The statistical results obtained from the ML and SVM classifications for radar images at VV and VH polarization indicated that the latter performed better than the former. When texture analysis was not used in the classes, the classification accuracy was low with kappa values of 0.37 and 0.42 for VV and VH polarization, respectively. The use of texture analysis and obtaining the optimum window size is increase the classification accuracy with a better performance for VH polarization. The SVM classification method with a kappa coefficient of 0.72% showed better performance than the ML one with a kappa coefficient of 0.61%. Conclusively, in the absence of Sentinel-2 datasets, Sentinel-1 images are good alternatives if the preserved texture information is available for the land cover classification. Results of this research are of great importance for developing the remote sensing methods and their techniques can be considered as progressive research in the domain of remote sensing sciences.

TI  - Assessment of Land Degradation in Northern Oman Using Geospatial Techniques
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern coast of Oman (Al-Batinah plain), hosts the major population and irrigated agriculture of the country. Recently, it has experienced considerable land degradation, revealed by an inland shifting of cultivation. The main objective of this study was to assess the magnitude of land degradation in the past 2 decades (2001-2019) using the integration of remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS). The study relied on multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and surface albedo data linked with in situ groundwater salinity measurements. The degree of land degradation was determined by applying the geospatial weighted overlay analysis (WOA) combining both space-based and in situ data. Results showed that degraded lands account for almost 70% of the coastal zone, with 18.6% under severe degradation. Major degradation occurred at Barka and Shinas regions synchronized by significant groundwater salinization. Results of this study assert on the significance of geospatial modeling for mapping land degradation in arid regions.

TI  - Mapping spatial distribution of invasive alien species through satellite remote sensing in Karachi, Pakistan: an urban ecological perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The exponential population growth of Karachi city has taken a very heavy toll on the indigenous environment of this South Asian megacity. In this context, the unlikely roadsides plantation of nonnative species by the city decision-makers was a short-term solution to cultivate green belts, ultimately, to improve city environment. However, this has backfired and become a very serious ecological crisis as the species become invasive alien species and destroyed the native ecological environment of the city significantly. This study provided an accurate spatial extent of invasive alien species and evaluated the intensity of the problem using remote sensing technology. Firstly, the importance value index was developed to highlight the intensity of invasive alien species in native plant communities. Afterwards, the hot spots were sampled to develop training areas for Object Based Image Analysis to map the extent of invasive alien species in the city using high-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery. The overall accuracy of mapping was 93.17% with Kappa coefficient value of 0.904. In addition, to explore hyperspectral remote sensing analysis, two techniques-Derivative Vegetation Index and Spectral Angle Mapper-were employed on EO-I hyperspectral imagery to map invasive alien species using spectral signatures. The analysis revealed 99.94% correlation between the two mapping techniques. Finally, to identify the impact of invasive alien species on the microclimate of the city, a spatiotemporal analysis (1992-2016) at selected sites was performed on Landsat thermal images. The study ruled out the concept of invasive alien species influence on the microclimate of the city as both vegetation growth and ambient air temperature change were not interdependent.

T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on land use and land cover (LULC) expansion and local climate zone (LCZ) changes in relation to warming in the future, the study concentrates on three major parts. First, this research analyzes LULC and LCZ changes from 1991 to 2016 using Landsat satellite images data. This reveals the history of urban expansion over the study period, urban growth rate and urban land demand projection in the target year (2026). Second, the study determines LULC and LCZ changes in the future by using spatial logistic regression model. Third, the examination of urban expansion in relation to warming in the future was conducted. The result shows that the built-up area has more development and expansion to the northern, southern and western parts of Bangkok. The built-up surface temperature climbed and continued to increase between 1991 and 2016. The trend of temperature differences between the built-up areas and other areas, significantly widened in 2026. Most of green area on the western part of Bangkok was replaced by compact mid-rise, compact low-rise, and open low-rise building. The study means that the western part of the city will be warmer approximately 1 to 2 degrees C in the future.

TI  - Investigating water quality of an urban water body using ground and space observations
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite based water quality monitoring and assessment is a thrust area of research. Present study focuses on use of space observations and ground data for assessment of spatial pattern in water quality parameters of an urban water body in Gorakhpur city of Uttar Pradesh, India. Water quality parameters namely, pH, Total Dissolved Solid, Turbidity, Total Hardness, Dissolved Oxygen and Biological Oxygen Demand were measured from the spatially distributed samples collected from the lake. Multiple linear regression models were developed using Landsat-8 OLI data and water quality sampling data to estimate the spatial patterns. It was observed that all the water quality parameters are significantly correlated with the radiance values of the Landsat-8 OLI sensor. Results of the regression model indicate a good agreement between the measured and estimated value of all the water quality parameters i.e., 82%, 70%, 90%, 66%, 84% and 79% respectively. Also, water quality maps when validated with lab tested value showed 71%, 62%, 71%, 55%, 75% and 86% accuracy. This study provides an effective and quick approach for mapping and planning of surface water (Lake) in urban areas with acceptable level of accuracy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop coefficient (K-c) represents the actual crop growth of the crop. It plays an important role in estimating water requirements at the different growth stages of the crop. However, FAO 56 Penman-Monteith K-c method does not account for spatial heterogeneity and uncertainty for regional climatic conditions significantly. Therefore, this study aims to develop the relation between K-c and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using a linear regression and back calculations. These relationships were adjusted to local conditions using information from survey data obtained during Rabi season (2014-2015). The NDVI-K-c model (r(2) = 0.86) has developed using NDVI-K-c from a fine resolution Landsat 8 remote sensing data. NDVI-K-c regression equation was utilized for generating crop coefficient for different month of season. The Vegetation Index-based AET estimated was evaluated with lysimeter data for different crop growth stage across the season. The results have shown that NDVI-K-c estimated AET has been better correlated with NDVI-K-c remote sensing model. Thus, the output of this research can help to calculate actual water demand in a command area and be helpful in allocating water from less demand area toward more demand area.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms over the Sistan region in East Iran are associated with predominant northwest winds (called 120-day winds) which promote desertification, including drying of the Hamoun wetlands. These storms are more frequent in spring and summer seasons in the Sistan region. The study aims to examine the relationship between vegetation cover and wind speed with dust storms intensity in order to understand the behavior of dust sources using satellite remote sensing data (AOD) between 2000 and 2019. Based on the time series, the study period can be divided into three parts based on the following characteristics: high dust intensity (2004), moderate relative intensity of value in all parameters studied (2005 to 2014), and dust reduction (2015-2019). Time series analysis shows a negative relationship between AOD and wind speed owing presumably to vegetative cover changes during years that wind speed has increased. Based on multiple regression analysis by monthly time scales that conforms time series result, monthly NDVI is significantly related to AOD. Analysis of the 3 hourly wind data suggests a positive relationship between wind and dust, and effective thresholds for dust erosion based on wind speeds are proposed for the Sistan region.

TI  - Using Satellite Data for CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) Threat Detection, Monitoring, and Modelling
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) threats are becoming more prevalent, as more entities gain access to modern weapons and industrial technologies and chemicals. This has produced a need for improvements to modelling, detection, and monitoring of these events. While there are currently no dedicated satellites for CBRN purposes, there are a wide range of possibilities for satellite data to contribute to this field, from atmospheric composition and chemical detection to cloud cover, land mapping, and surface property measurements. This study looks at currently available satellite data, including meteorological data such as wind and cloud profiles, surface properties like temperature and humidity, chemical detection, and sounding. Results of this survey revealed several gaps in the available data, particularly concerning biological and radiological detection. The results also suggest that publicly available satellite data largely does not meet the requirements of spatial resolution, coverage, and latency that CBRN detection requires, outside of providing terrain use and building height data for constructing models. Lastly, the study evaluates upcoming instruments, platforms, and satellite technologies to gauge the impact these developments will have in the near future. Improvements in spatial and temporal resolution as well as latency are already becoming possible, and new instruments will fill in the gaps in detection by imaging a wider range of chemicals and other agents and by collecting new data types. This study shows that with developments coming within the next decade, satellites should begin to provide valuable augmentations to CBRN event detection and monitoring.

TI  - Mapping annual irrigation from Landsat imagery and environmental variables across the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the location of irrigated croplands and how they change over time is critical for assessing and managing limited water resources to navigate such challenges as local to global water scarcity, increasing demands for food and energy production, and environmental sustainability. Although efforts have been made to map irrigated area for the U.S., multi-year nationwide maps at field-relevant resolutions are still unavailable; existing products suffer from coarse resolution, uncertain accuracy, and/or limited spatial coverage, especially in the eastern U.S. In this study, we present an approach to map the extent of irrigated croplands across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) for each year in the period of 1997-2017. To scale nationwide, we developed novel methods to generate training datasets covering both the western and eastern U.S. For the more arid western U.S., we built upon the methods of Xie et al. (2019) and further developed a greenness-based normalization technique to estimate optimal thresholds of crop greenness in any year based on those in USDA NASS census years (i.e., 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017). For the relatively humid eastern states, we collected data on the current status of center pivot irrigated and non-irrigated fields and extended these sample points through time using various indices and observational thresholds. We used the generated samples along with remote sensing features and environmental variables to train county-stratified random forest classifiers annually for pixel-level classification of irrigated extent each year and subsequently implemented a logic-based post-classification filtering. The produced Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset (LANID-US) accurately reconstructed NASS irrigation patterns at both the county and state level while also supplying new annual area estimates for intra-epoch years. Nationwide pixel-level locational assessment further demonstrated an overall accuracy above 90% across years. In the 21year study period, we found several hotspots of irrigation change including significant gains in the U.S. Midwest, the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain, and the East Coast as well as irrigation declines in the central and southern High Plains Aquifer and the southern California Central Valley, Arizona, and Florida. The resulting 30 m resolution LANID-US products represent the finest resolution account of nationwide irrigation use and dynamics across the United States to date. The developed approach, training data, and products are further extendable to other years (either before 1997 or after 2017) for continuous monitoring of irrigated area over CONUS and are spatially applicable to other regions with similar climate and cropping landscapes.

TI  - Retrieving high-resolution surface photosynthetically active radiation from the MODIS and GOES-16 ABI data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is a key parameter in plant physiological, biological and physical process-based terrestrial ecosystem models. Deriving highly accurate and spatially continuous PAR from remote sensing data can fill in the gaps of insufficient ground-based measurements. In this study, we provide an efficient approach for estimating PAR by employing look-up table (LUT) method using observations from both MODIS and GOES-16. The GOES-16 is the first satellite of the new-generation US Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-series (GOES-R), which can capture dynamic changes in the atmosphere every 5 min. First, the diurnal variation of surface bidirectional reflectance is characterized assuming that the surface characteristics and solar zenith angles in tropical and middle latitudes at a given time of day do not change dramatically within a month. Next, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud optical depth (COD) are retrieved from the GOES-16 visible observations under both clear-sky and cloudy conditions. Finally, PAR is estimated via the retrieved AOD and COD using the LUT method and a MODIS-based surface albedo product. The estimated PAR was compared against ground-based measurements collected from seven SURFace RADiation budget network (SURFRAD) sites and 23 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites at instantaneous, hourly and daily scales. The instantaneous PAR validation results achieved R-2 values of 0.97 and 0.82, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 18.1 and 51.1 W m(-2), for clear and cloudy skies, respectively. The RMSEs of the hourly averaged PAR were reduced to 16.8 W m(-2) and 40.4 W m(-2), respectively, for clear-sky and cloudy conditions. The daily mean PAR evaluation for all sky conditions shows an overall mean bias error (MBE) of 0.97 W m(-2) and an RMSE of 10.5 W m(-2). Compared with other global PAR datasets, the estimated PAR values in this study have lower RMSEs and higher spatial-temporal resolution. Uncertainties in the retrieved PAR caused by topography and solar-cloud-geometry effects (SCGE) can be reduced by spatial and temporal averaging. Based on an evaluation of retrievals at different spatial-temporal scales, we recommend that a 20 x 20 km(2) domainaveraged PAR be utilized for instantaneous PAR validation, whereas hourly and daily averaged PAR values are nearly independent of spatial scale.

TI  - Empirical models on urban surface emissivity retrieval based on different spectral response functions: A field study
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal emissivity is a prerequisite for retrieving the land surface temperature (LST) and estimating the land surface budget based on data from remote sensing. Despite the availability of empirical models on emissivity retrieval on the meso-scales, their incompatibility for complex surfaces of the micro-scale leads to errors in emissivity retrieval, thus compromising thermal assessments of urban environments. To minimize such errors, this paper proposed a method to retrieve pixel-scale emissivity on the micro-scale. To measure reflectance spectra and emissivity spectra in the field, a PSR+3500 handheld spectrometer and a 102F portable Fourier transform infrared spectrometer were respectively used. Upon resampling these spectra to spectral response functions (SRF) of drone-derived and satellite-derived sensors, diverse reflectance and emissivity values were obtained to establish empirical models characterizing correlations between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and emissivity. Then, these models were applied to the low-altitude hyperspectral image from the Nano-Hyperspec imager on a drone. The results show that the model established by the SRF of a thermal camera achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0129, and the accuracy of emissivity retrieval was within 0.010. For satellite applications, the model founded by the SRF of Aster was the most accurate for retrieving the emissivity of urban surfaces, with a RMSE of 0.0082 and an average accuracy of 0.003. The model based on SRFs of Landsat 8 registered a RMSE of 0.0155 alongside an average accuracy of 0.012, while that based on Modis registered a RMSE of 0.1210, alongside an average accuracy of 0.007.

TI  - Observational Validation of Parameterized Gravity Waves From Tropical Convection in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical gravity waves that are generated by convection are generally too small in scale and too high in frequency to be resolved in global climate models, yet their drag forces drive the important global-scale quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the lower stratosphere, and models rely on parameterizations of gravity wave drag to simulate the QBO. We compare detailed properties of tropical parameterized gravity waves in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6 (WACCM6) with gravity waves observed by long-duration superpressure balloons and also compare properties of parameterized convective latent heating with satellite data. Similarities and differences suggest that the WACCM6 parameterizations are excellent tools for representing tropical gravity waves, but the results also suggest detailed changes to the gravity wave parameterization tuning parameter assumptions that would bring the parameterized waves into much better agreement with observations. While WACCM6 currently includes only nonstationary gravity waves from convection, adding gravity waves generated by the steady component of the heating that are stationary relative to moving convective rain cells is likely to improve the simulation of the QBO in the model. The suggested changes have the potential to alleviate common biases in simulated QBO circulations in models.Plain Language Summary This work examines the connections between tropical rain cells and small-scale atmospheric waves (called gravity waves) in the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6 (WACCM6). Comparisons with high-resolution observations of tropical rain and tropical gravity waves lead us to suggest new methods for future simulations with WACCM6 that are likely to improve WACCM6 representation of interannual wind changes and their impacts on tropical precipitation and winter season weather in the Northern Hemisphere.

TI  - Effects of ocean circulation on the eutrophication of a Mediterranean gulf with river inlets: The Northern Thermaikos Gulf
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermaikos Gulf is a typical, river-fed, microtidal, semi-enclosed, coastal inlet of the east-central Mediterranean Sea. It is an important coastal ecosystem susceptible to several anthropogenic pressures, strong river discharges and variable meteorological and ocean (met-ocean) conditions. One of the most significant environmental problems of the region is the occasional formation of extended eutrophication phenomena (red tides, mucilaginous aggregates), especially over the Northern Thermaikos Gulf (NTG). Herein, we investigate the contribution of hydrodynamic processes on the formation of such events, under the effects of different meteorological and river discharge conditions during the annual cycle. We conducted field observations (physical-chemical measurements), microscopy analysis of phytoplankton samples, satellite ocean color image analysis, and implemented high-resolution numerical hydrodynamic simulations with updated river discharge outflows to detect eutrophication events and correlate them with the prevailing physical processes and ocean circulation patterns. The eutrophication events were mainly associated with the dominance of southerly winds, which affect the ocean circulation over the NTG in three ways: i) they confined the surface waters in the northern parts of the NTG separating the waters masses between the northern and southern regions, ii) they contribute on the northward spreading of nutrient-rich brackish waters towards the northern parts of the Gulf, and iii) they impose an anticyclonic circulation, especially in the inner- and central-Gulf weakening its renewal process. Northerly winds contribute on the renewal of the Gulf imposing a two-layer flow, especially along the eastern coasts. The seasonal observational campaigns of the 2017-2018 period captured three eutrophication events (June-July 2017, December 2017, and May 2018) and two renewal periods (late-July 2017 and October 2017) that were favoured by the two aforementioned types of met-ocean synergy. New insight is provided on the mesoscale ocean circulation and sub-mesoscale local effects on eutrophication events in a typical microtidal coastal system of the east-central Mediterranean, where freshwater discharges by a multi-river inlet.

TI  - Clay content prediction using spectra data collected from the ground to space platforms in a smallholder tropical area
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Proximal and remote sensors are emerging as powerful sources of soil spectral information at an array of temporal and spatial resolutions. This study investigated clay content prediction at three spectral acquisition levels: laboratory, airborne, and spaceborne. Two approaches were tested, the use of prediction models developed with local and regional spectral libraries (52 samples for local scale and 950, 200 e 224 samples for regional scale), termed internal and external models respectively. Local soil samples (52), were collected in a smallholder area, 83 ha, located in southeastern Brazil. Spectral data in the visible (Vis), near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions were acquired in the laboratory using FieldSpec 3 sensor, and the clay content was determined by sedimentation technique. Afterward, bare soil images from AISA-FENIX, Planetscope, Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were obtained. The clay content determined in the laboratory was related to the soil spectra acquired by each of the sensors and was predicted using the Cubist regression tree algorithm. The results obtained from local spectral libraries showed good predictions using FieldSpec 3 and AISA-FENIX sensors. Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI provided satisfactory results, while PlanetScope gave poor results. For the prediction using regional spectral libraries, only lab-based FieldSpec 3 sensor provided a fair prediction, while other sensors gave poor results. This study demonstrated that soil sensing is possible at any level taking into account its advantages and limitations. This approach paves the way for acquiring soil spectra for smallholder farms.

TI  - Multi Angle Rotation Object Detection for Remote Sensing Image Based on Modified Feature Pyramid Networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data generated by satellites have important research and application values. However, traditional detection models have poor adaptability and generalization ability. In order to solve the low accuracy problem of the existing algorithm for small object detection of remote sensing, a small object detection algorithm MARNet (multi-angle rotation network) for remote sensing images of multi-angle rotation was proposed in this study, which used ResNet101 (residual network) as the baseline network. Global attention feature pyramid networks (GA_FPN) structure was designed based on the features of the pyramid network to improve the small object detection performance in remote sensing. Then MergeNet (Merge Network) was designed to better obtain the semantic relationship between features, and the attention mechanism was introduced to enhance the feature information of the target object. Datasets of DOTA (a large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images) and NWPU VHR-10 (northwestern polytechnical university, very-high-resolution) are used to verify the algorithm.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity of Aerosol and Cloud Properties Over the Southeast Atlantic: An Observational Analysis
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeast Atlantic has expansive aerosol plumes overlying clouds for a third of each year. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) were measured from the airborne Sun photometer and lidar during the 2016 NASA ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS field campaign. We compare these measurements with one another and with collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations at native spatial resolutions using <15-min and 3-h temporal collocation criteria. We find better statistical relationships for the <15-min temporal resolution, indicating that AODs in the southeast Atlantic commonly vary below three-hourly temporal scales over MODIS spatial resolutions. We also use the airborne Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) to conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of attenuation-corrected below-aerosol cloud optical depths (CODs) from MODIS and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). MODIS COD retrievals improve their agreement with the SSFR when accounting for overlying aerosol attenuation whereas SEVIRI CODs are mostly underestimated.Plain Language SummaryAerosols are suspended particles in the atmosphere that affect the Earth's regional and global climate both by absorbing and scattering solar light and through their interaction with clouds. Hotspots of aerosols above clouds are present in some parts of the world, yet aerosol products from satellites are largely unavailable in cloudy conditions in part because of large uncertainties at estimating aerosol properties above bright backgrounds such as clouds. In 2016, two research aircraft from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration flew over the southeast Atlantic Ocean, a region with significant biomass burning aerosol (from agricultural fires) and a large oceanic cloud deck, to measure the properties of each. We use the aircraft data to evaluate satellite estimates of liquid cloud thicknesses and aerosol amounts above clouds. We then confirm that changes in aerosols and clouds over time affect the accuracy of satellite measurements. This information is crucial for refining satellite measurements and improving our understanding of how aerosols and clouds affect Earth's climate.

TI  - Application of quasi-deep convective clouds method for VIIRS and MODIS TEB calibration assessments
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A technique that utilizes quasi-deep convective clouds (qDCC) for the calibration assessment of the thermal emissive bands (TEB) on remote sensing instruments has been proven viable. The Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) and NOAA-20 (N20) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) TEB calibration uses a nonlinear algorithm with nonlinear coefficients that rely on on-orbit blackbody (BB) warm-up and cool- down operations for updates. However, a limited BB temperature range affects the calibration's accuracy, particularly for cold scenes. The deep convective clouds (DCC) core, one of the coldest Earth scenes, is suitable for MODIS calibration assessments, more specifically, for the evaluation of the offset term's effect in its TEB quadratic calibration function. Moreover, nighttime qDCC measurements provide the advantage of removing solar reflectance effects during daytime, thus enhancing the assessment's accuracy for the mid-wave infrared TEB. This qDCC method is applied to the Terra MODIS and VIIRS TEB, and their stabilities are assessed using long-term qDCC trending measurements over the instruments' missions. The measurements from bands with an 11-mu m wavelength are used to identify the DCC pixels. The 11-mu m bands, MODIS band 31, and VIIRS bands M15 and I5 are stable throughout the MODIS and VIIRS missions and have shown excellent calibration accuracy and noise performance. Hence, using these bands as references, a normalization method is employed to enhance the accuracy of the stability and consistency assessments. The S-NPP VIIRS TEB show stable trends over the instrument's mission. The S-NPP- to-N20 VIIRS comparison shows that their TEB measurements are consistent over qDCC. The Terra MODIS TEB also shows stable performance-except for bands 27, 29, and 30. Terra MODIS band 30 shows a large downward trend throughout the mission, whereas bands 27 and 29 show slight, upward drifts. Finally, a calibration correction using qDCC assessments is discussed and intended to be used in a future calibration algorithm collection.

TI  - A decadal perspective on north water microbial eukaryotes as Arctic Ocean sentinels
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Water region, between Greenland and Ellesmere Island, with high populations of marine birds and mammals, is an Arctic icon. Due to climate related changes, seasonal patterns in water column primary production are changing but the implications for the planktonic microbial eukaryote communities that support the ecosystem are unknown. Here we report microbial community phenology in samples collected over 12 years (2005-2018) from July to October and analysed using high throughput 18S rRNA V4 amplicon sequencing. Community composition was tied to seasonality with summer communities more variable than distinct October communities. In summer, sentinel pan-Arctic species, including a diatom in the Chaetoceros socialis-gelidus complex and the picochlorophyte Micromonas polaris dominated phytoplankton and were summer specialists. In autumn, uncultured undescribed open water dinoflagellates were favored, and their ubiquity suggests they are sentinels of arctic autumn conditions. Despite the input of nutrients into surface waters, autumn chlorophyll concentrations remained low, refuting projected scenarios that longer ice-free seasons are synonymous with high autumn production and a diatom dominated bloom. Overall, the summer sentinel microbial taxa are persisting, and a subset oceanic dinoflagellate should be monitored for possible ecosystem shifts as later autumn ice formation becomes prevalent elsewhere.

TI  - Performance of the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) Model as a Tool for Monitoring the Response of Durum Wheat to Drought by High-Throughput Field Phenotyping
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The current lack of efficient methods for high throughput field phenotyping is a constraint on the goal of increasing durum wheat yields. This study illustrates a comprehensive methodology for phenotyping this crop's water use through the use of the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model employing very high resolution imagery. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with multispectral and thermal cameras was used to phenotype 19 durum wheat cultivars grown under three contrasting irrigation treatments matching crop evapotranspiration levels (ETc): 100%ETc treatment meeting all crop water requirements (450 mm), 50%ETc treatment meeting half of them (285 mm), and a rainfed treatment (122 mm). Yield reductions of 18.3 and 48.0% were recorded in the 50%ETc and rainfed treatments, respectively, in comparison with the 100%ETc treatment. UAV flights were carried out during jointing (April 4th), anthesis (April 30th), and grain-filling (May 22nd). Remotely-sensed data were used to estimate: (1) plant height from a digital surface model (H, R-2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.18m), (2) leaf area index from multispectral vegetation indices (LAI, R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.63), and (3) actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and transpiration (T) through the TSEB model (R-2 = 0.50, RMSE = 0.24 mm/h). Compared with ground measurements, the four traits estimated at grain-filling provided a good prediction of days from sowing to heading (DH, r = 0.58-0.86), to anthesis (DA, r = 0.59-0.85) and to maturity (r = 0.67-0.95), grain-filling duration (GFD, r = 0.54-0.74), plant height (r = 0.62-0.69), number of grains per spike (NGS, r = 0.41-0.64), and thousand kernel weight (TKW, r = 0.37-0.42). The best trait to estimate yield, DH, DA, and GFD was ETa at anthesis or during grain filling. Better forecasts for yield-related traits were recorded in the irrigated treatments than in the rainfed one. These results show a promising perspective in the use of energy balance models for the phenotyping of large numbers of durum wheat genotypes under Mediterranean conditions.

TI  - Appraisal of seagrass aboveground biomass changes using satellite data within the tropical coastline of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass habitats are crucial marine ecosystem component that affects the biophysical and chemical environment, providing nursery beds to various invertebrates, juvenile fish, and dugongs. This study focuses on mapping and monitoring changes in seagrass total above-ground biomass (STAGB) within the coastline of Peninsula Malaysia. The retrieval of the substrate leaving radiance was realized via was realized via Bottom Reflected Index (BRI) on Landsat ETM + visible bands. A strong relationship was established between BRI and seagrass biomass from in-situ samples (R-2 > 0.8, p < 0.001), hence enable mapping and detection of changes in STAGB. Other related coastal changes caused by natural and human activities, namely total fish landing and erosion were also correlated with STAGB, to demonstrate the impacts of these variables on the habitat. The results offer inputs for coastal zone management, apart shall fast-track the achievements of target 14.2 of SDG 14.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Is Feasible in Cervical Cancer Laparoscopic Surgery: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy efficiency has been confirmed in various solid tumors. This study aimed to assess SLN biopsy feasibility in clinical application and explore how to improve its detection rates and diagnostic accuracy in cervical cancer laparoscopic surgery. Methods. A total of 100 cervical cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery with SLN biopsy were included. Indocyanine green, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), and a combination of both were used during surgeries. Detection rates, sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV) of SLN biopsy, and related factors were analyzed. Results. The overall and bilateral SLN detection rates were 92% (92/100) and 74% (74/100), respectively. Combined tracers had higher bilateral SLN detection rates than CNPs alone (p=0.005). Menopause and lymph node metastasis were associated with lower overall and bilateral SLN detection rates (p<0.05). SLN biopsy sensitivity and NPV for lymph node metastasis in patients with at least one detected SLN were 81.8% (9/11) and 97.3% (72/74), respectively. Among those with bilateral detected SLNs, higher sensitivity and NPV of 87.5% (7/8) and 98.3% (57/58) were observed, respectively. SLN algorithm can ensure that all patients with lymph node metastasis are detected by SLN biopsy. Conclusion. SLN biopsy appears to be safe and effective for specific cervical cancer patients with high detection rates and NPV in laparoscopic surgery, especially for those with detected bilateral SLNs and undergoing the SLN algorithm. Selecting suitable patients for SLN mapping has prospects for clinical application.

T2  - NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The M-s 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 and M-s 7.0 Lushan earthquake in 2013 produced thousands of landslides in the southern region of the Longmen Mountains in China. We conducted field investigations and analyzed remote sensing data to determine the distribution law of earthquake-triggered landslides. The results show a strong negative power law relationship between the size and frequency of landslides in VII, VIII, and IX seismic intensity zones, a weak power law in the X seismic intensity zone, and a lognormal distribution in the XI seismic intensity zone. Landslide density increases with increasing seismic intensity. A sandpile cellular automata model was built under the conceptual framework of self-organized criticality theory to simulate earthquake-induced landslides. Data from the simulations demonstrate that, with increasing disturbance intensity, the dynamical mechanism of the sandpile model changes from a strong power law to a weak power law and then to a lognormal distribution. Results from shaking table experiments of a one-sided slope sandpile show that, for peak ground acceleration (PGA) in the range of 0.075-0.125 g, the relation between the amount and frequency of sand follows a negative power law. For PGA between 0.15 and 0.25 g, the relation obeys a lognormal distribution. This verifies that the abovementioned distribution of earthquake-induced landslides should be a universal law from a physical viewpoint and may apply to other areas. This new perspective may be used to guide the development of an inventory of earthquake-triggered landslides and provide a scientific basis for their prediction.

TI  - All-of-community by all-of-government: reaching Pacific people in Aotearoa New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A large portion of Pacific communities throughout Aotearoa New Zealand continue to face socioeconomic hardship and have ongoing health needs that are affected by social and economic influences. The impact of COVID-19 has only exacerbated these needs and will continue to have an adverse effect on the current wellbeing, future health and sustainable development of these communities-if targeted efforts are not undertaken to meet their unique needs. The collective worldview of Pacific communities is fundamental to their existence; therefore, a response needs to be within a collective community. This viewpoint looks at the worldview of Pacific communities and the impact of COVID-19 and then discusses six key priorities for working with these diverse communities. The successful management and elimination of a pandemic should be assessed by how well Pacific and other vulnerable communities survive such a crisis.

TI  - The use of multi-temporal Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for assessing forest cover change of Lawarchara National Park
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lawachara National Park (LNP) is one of the most renowned protected areas in Bangladesh and a natural habitat of critically endangered Hoolock gibbon. The study's purpose was to assess the long-term change of forest cover using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) technique and evaluate the impact of co-management. Landsat images acquired from the USGS glovis website were used to assess forest cover change using NDVI, a popular technique for identification and estimation of forest areas. NDVI value ranges from (- 1) to (+ 1); a negative value indicates non-vegetated areas including water bodies, road surfaces, settlements, etc., whereas a positive value near (+ 1) indicates the highest density vegetation. NDVI value (0) indicates bare land without vegetation. Based on NDVI values, the forest areas have been divided into four categories, namely: (1) very low or no vegetation area, (2) low-density vegetation area, (3) moderate-density vegetation area, and (4) dense vegetation area. A household survey was carried out among the people living in the adjacent villages to LNP. The study of assessing the forest cover change of LNP using remotely sensed data revealed that, after the initiation of co-management, the dense vegetation area increased by 8.62% in 2006 compared to 2001, but it decreased by 0.77% in 2014. In 2018, dense vegetation decreased by 3.86% relative to the dense vegetation area of 2014. If it is compared as a whole, it can be said that the forest cover has improved under co-management, and the household survey revealed that forest dependence has been reduced which might be considered as one of the reasons for forest cover improvement. However, more improvement can be achieved by focusing on the villages where forest dependence is still high. Betel leaf cultivation inside the forest area is creating a problem for wildlife and also hampering the natural composition of flora. Therefore, it is recommended to rehabilitate betel leaf cultivators outside the forest area with proper compensation. This will harness the full potentiality of the co-management practice, it needs complete monitoring and goodwill from every stakeholder, and hence it will bring good for the whole country.

TI  - How Robust Is the Apparent Break-Down of Northern High-Latitude Temperature Control on Spring Carbon Uptake?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation growth in northern high-latitudes during springtime is strongly temperature limited, and thus anomalously warm springs are expected to result in an increased drawdown of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a recent analysis of the relationship between spring temperature anomalies and atmospheric CO2 anomalies at Point Barrow, Alaska, suggests that the link between spring carbon uptake by northern ecosystems and temperature anomalies has been weakening over recent decades due to a diminishing control of temperature on plant productivity. Upon further analysis, covering the 1982-2015 period, we found no significant change in the relationship between spring vegetation productivity derived from remote sensing data and air temperature. We showed that a reduction in spatial coherence of temperature anomalies, alongside a significant sensitivity to atmospheric transport, is likely responsible for the apparent weakening. Our results, therefore, suggest that spring temperature remains as an important control of northern high-latitude CO2 uptake.

TI  - Contrasting Observed Atmospheric Responses to Tropical Sea Surface Temperature Warming Patterns
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is a theoretical concept which describes the change in global mean surface temperature that results from a sustained doubling of atmospheric CO2. Current ECS estimates range from similar to 1.8 to 5.6 K, reflecting uncertainties in climate feedbacks. The sensitivity of the lower (1,000-700 hPa) and upper (500-200 hPa) troposphere to changes in spatial patterns of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) have been proposed by recent model studies as key feedbacks controlling climate sensitivity. We examine empirical evidence for these proposed mechanisms using 14 years of satellite data. We examine the response of temperature and humidity profiles, clouds, and top-of-the-atmosphere radiation to relative warming in tropical ocean regions when there is either strong convection or subsidence. We find warmer SSTs in regions of strong subsidence are coincident with a decrease in lower tropospheric stability (-0.9 0.4 KK-1) and low cloud cover (similar to-6% K-1). This leads to a warming associated with the weakening in the shortwave cooling effect of clouds (4.2 1.9 Wm(-2)K(-1)), broadly consistent with model calculations. In contrast, warmer SSTs in regions of strong convection are coincident with an increase in upper tropospheric humidity (3.2 1.5% K-1). In this scenario, the dominant effect is the enhancement of the warming longwave cloud radiative effect (3.8 3.0 Wm(-2)K(-1)) from an increase in high cloud cover (similar to 7% K-1), though changes in the net (longwave and shortwave) effect are not statistically significant (p < 0.003). Our observational evidence supports the existence of mechanisms linking contrasting atmospheric responses to patterns in SST, mechanisms which have been linked to climate sensitivity.Plain Language Summary Estimates of how sensitive the Earth's climate is to changes in CO2 vary between climate models. These models are necessary to explore climate projections, but we need to demonstrate that they can accurately describe the real climate system. Recent model studies hypothesize that the location of surface ocean warming may be key to understanding the atmospheric component of climate sensitivity. We examine observational evidence of the extent to which local tropical ocean warming is able to propagate upwards through the atmosphere. We show that the atmospheric response and associated feedbacks are different in contrasting regions. Future patterns in ocean warming may play a key role in determining future climate.

TI  - Assessment of Future Flood Hazards for Southeastern Texas: Synthesizing Subsidence, Sea-Level Rise, and Storm Surge Scenarios
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent hurricanes highlight shortcomings of flood resilience plans in Texas that can worsen with climate change and rising seas. Combining vertical land motion (VLM) with sea-level rise (SLR) projections and storm surge scenarios for the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, we quantify the extent of flooding hazards. VLM rates are obtained from GNSS data and InSAR imagery from ALOS and Sentinel-1A/B satellites. VLM is resampled and projected on LIDAR topographic data, then multiple inundation and flooding scenarios are modeled. By the year 2100, over 76 km(2) are projected to subside below sea level. Subsidence increases the area of inundation over SLR alone by up to 39%. Under the worst-case composite scenario of an 8-m storm surge, subsidence, and the SLR RCP8.5, the total affected area is 1,156 km(2). These models enable communities to improve flood resiliency plans.

TI  - The potential of nature-based solutions to deliver ecologically just cities: Lessons for research and urban planning from a systematic literature review
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Review
AB  - Planning for and implementing multifunctional nature-based solutions can improve urban ecosystems' adaptation to climate change, foster urban resilience, and enable social and environmental innovation. There is, however, a knowledge gap in how to design and plan nature-based solutions in a nonanthropocentric manner that enhances co-benefits for humans and nonhuman living organisms. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to explore how an ecological justice perspective can advance the understanding of nature-based solutions. We argue that ecological justice, which builds on the equitable distribution of environmental goods and bads, social-ecological interconnectedness, nature's agency and capabilities, and participation and inclusion in decision-making, provides a transformative framework for rethinking nature-based solutions in and for cities. A qualitative analysis of 121 peer-reviewed records shows a highly human-centred worldview for delivering nature-based solutions and a relationship to social justice with no direct reference to the dimensions of ecological justice. There is, however, an underlying recognition of the importance of nonhumans, ecosystem integrity and well-being, and a need to consider their needs and capacities through multispecies nature-based solutions design and planning. We conclude with a discussion of the critical aspects for designing and planning ecologically just cities through nature-based solutions and future research directions to further integrate these fields.

TI  - NO<sub>2</sub> anomalies-Economy attribution and rapid climate response
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Close to two decades of NASA Earth Observing System satellite data and algorithms refinements present unique opportunity to revisit the attributions of variability of tropospheric pollutants to economic activity, as well as pollutants contribution to the anthropogenic radiative forcing. The nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the top pollutants produced by industrial and power plants and traffic. That long data record now covers events of economic variability like the recession of 2008/2009, as well as the effects of COVID-19 closures of 2019/2020. In particular, the COVID-19 lockdowns in the winter of 2019/2020 and the spring of 2020 resulted in contracting economies around the world. While numerous imageries of reduced nitrogen dioxide (NO2) appeared to be popular, few studied gave numerical assessment of how much of the anomalies is attributable to the economic slowdown. Furthermore, few studies touched on the possible climate offsets under the reduced emissions. Using principal component (PC) analysis of 16 years of NO2 monthly series data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on the Aura satellite, we show that it is the third PC (PC3) from the deseasonalized hierarchy of principal modes that is best coupled with the economic indicators. This coupling is positive, i. e. PC3 and economic indicators manifest positive covariance. However, the economic variability can explain only 40% of the information in PC3. Furthermore, this mode by itself explains only 3% of the total deseasonalized NO2 variability. We therefore conclude that, while having an unambiguous impact, the economy can be awarded at best third order of importance in the NO2 departures from the seasonal averages.Once we identified PC3 as the NO2 mode that is coupled with the economic variability, we use this mode as an indicator and look for rapid climate adjustments to that part of the NO2 variability that we are confident is coupled with the economic variability. We focus on observational data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on board the NASA Aqua satellite, decompose the series of surface skin temperature and clear-sky outgoing longwave radiances (OLR) into principal components, and identify potential impacts of the NO2 PC3 on these climate variables.

TI  - Genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis of highly and weakly aggressive strains of <i>Sclerotium rolfsii</i>, the causal agent of peanut stem rot
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Stem rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii is a very important soil-borne disease of peanut. S. rolfsii is a necrotrophic plant pathogenic fungus with an extensive host range and worldwide distribution. It can infect peanut stems, roots, pegs and pods, leading to varied yield losses. S. rolfsii strains GP3 and ZY collected from peanut in different provinces of China exhibited a significant difference in aggressiveness on peanut plants by artificial inoculation test. In this study, de-novo genome sequencing of these two distinct strains was performed aiming to reveal the genomic basis of difference in aggressiveness. Results Scleotium rolfsii strains GP3 and ZY, with weak and high aggressiveness on peanut plants, exhibited similar growth rate and oxalic acid production in laboratory. The genomes of S. rolfsii strains GP3 and ZY were sequenced by Pacbio long read technology and exhibited 70.51 Mb and 70.61 Mb, with contigs of 27 and 23, and encoded 17,097 and 16,743 gene models, respectively. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the pathogenicity-related gene repertoires, which might be associated with aggressiveness, differed between GP3 and ZY. There were 58 and 45 unique pathogen-host interaction (PHI) genes in GP3 and ZY, respectively. The ZY strain had more carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in its secretome than GP3, especially in the glycoside hydrolase family (GH), the carbohydrate esterase family (CBM), and the polysaccharide lyase family (PL). GP3 and ZY also had different effector candidates and putative secondary metabolite synthetic gene clusters. These results indicated that differences in PHI, secreted CAZymes, effectors and secondary metabolites may play important roles in aggressive difference between these two strains. Conclusions The data provided a further understanding of the S. rolfsii genome. Genomic comparison provided clues to the difference in aggressiveness of S. rolfsii strains.

TI  - Machine learning-based thermokarst landslide susceptibility modeling across the permafrost region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermokarst landslides (TL) caused by the thaw of ground ice in permafrost slopes are increasing on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), but the understanding of the spatially suitable environmental conditions including terrains and climate for them has not been fully established. Here, we applied multiple machine learning models and their ensemble to explore factors controlling the TL and map its susceptibility at a fine resolution. The models were calibrated and validated using a split-sample approach based on an inventory of TLs from the remote sensing data. The models indicated that summer air temperature and rainfall were the most two important factors controlling the occurrence and distribution of TLs, provided that other geomorphic conditions (i.e., slope, solar radiation, and fine soil) were suitable. The final ensemble susceptibility map based on downscaled climate data and terrain data suggested that ca. 1.4% of the QTP land was classified in high- to very high-susceptibility zone, which is likely to increase in response to future climate change. This study integrated local topography and climate in susceptibility modeling and provided new insights into the geomorphic sensitivity to climate change but also the engineering support over the QTP.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of combined application of indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with early breast cancer. Methods: A total of 415 patients who underwent SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection were enrolled. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) was assessed in 197 patients with ICG and MB combination method, while, the other 218 patients were detected by MB method alone. During surgery, all SLNs were harvested for pathological examination. Then the detection rate and false negative rate of SLNs were comparatively analyzed between the 2 groups. Results: In the combined ICG and MB group, the detection rate of SLNs was 96.9%, significantly higher than that of MB group, which was 89.7% (P < .05). Similarly, in combined group, the average number of SLNs per patient was 3.0, much higher than that of MB group, which was 2.1 (P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference in false negative rate between combined group and MB alone group, which was 7.3% and 10.5%, respectively (P = .791). Conclusion: The combined application of ICG and MB for SLNB is much more effective than MB alone in detecting SLNs.

TI  - Improved DEM Reconstruction Method Based on Multibaseline InSAR
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are vital in the geosciences and many other fields. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), an advanced earth observation technology, has shown its potential in DEM reconstruction. Multi baseline InSAR (MB-InSAR) is currently improving the precision of DEM reconstruction by combining multiple interferograms. However, MB-InSAR for DEM generation can result in severe decorrelation, which may cause significant gaps in the final DEM product. To solve this problem, an improved MB-InSAR DEM reconstruction method is proposed in this study, which we term as the dynamic DEM calculation algorithm. The proposed method can estimate the DEM pixel-by-pixel, which allowed us to select the interferograms dynamically and therefore minimize the void values. For the performance test of the proposed method, 25 ascending and 20 descending TerraSAR-X images over Heifangtai (China) were collected to form repeat-pass interferograms and produce the DEM using the proposed method. Results showed that the number of valid pixels increased by approximately 20% compared with the traditional MB-InSAR DEM reconstruction method without loss of precision, thereby illustrating the feasibility of the proposed method.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the reliability of gridded rainfall products with fine spatial resolution using 29 gauges of a dense observation network in Niger. Four gridded datasets were considered, viz. the African Rainfall Climatology version 2.0 (ARC2), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH) and Tropical Applications of Meteorology using Satellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT). The datasets were quantitatively compared to the gauge rainfall at different timescales and their rainfall detection skills were assessed using four validation metrics and three contingency indices, respectively. Furthermore, their potentials for trend analysis was assessed using a modified Mann-Kendall test; and finally, their capability of capturing damaging rainfalls was evaluated using data of five historical damaging rainfall amounts on a daily basis. The CMORPH product showed a good performance in detecting rainfall events and exhibited the best linear relationship with the gauge rainfall; however, it displayed high errors and relative bias (RB > 100%)-showing its inaccuracy in rainfall quantification. At daily, dekadal and monthly timescale, CHIRPS showed the lowest errors, followed by the ARC2 and TAMSAT, whereas ARC2 exhibited the lowest RB-between-12% and 22%. All of the four datasets were unable to unveil the significant trends found in ground observations and were inaccurate in sensing the depths of damaging rainfall amounts. The overall results revealed that the 3-hourly CMORPH dataset is a good sub-daily rainfall product-whereas daily, dekadal and monthly CHIRPS and ARC2 rainfalls have good potentials for hydro-climatological applications in Niger.

TI  - Phase wise spatial and temporal variations of nitrogen dioxide during and pre COVID-19 lockdown period in tier-1 cities of India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted basic lifestyle of everyone across the globe. To stop the conveyance of the coronavirus into the human body and to flatten the transmission rate curve, almost every country imposed a lockdown. In India, the emergency lockdown was imposed on the 24th of March 2020 which created an economic crisis in the country but proved a boon in disguise for the environment to improve its quality. The study analysed the statuses of air quality with respect to NO2 in pre and during the COVID-19 lockdown period in eight districts of India where tier I cities are located. Nitrous Oxide concentration was determined through Sentinel 5P satellites imagery and Central Pollution Control Board ground station data. The lockdown across the country has helped the environment to regain, and therefore, more studies are required to assess other parameters to explore the implementation of the provision of the well-planned lockdown of 1-week duration in a year for giving enough time to the environment to recuperate. These results show that the study areas (Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Pune) have witnessed a significant drop in nitrogen dioxide (14-62%) as compared to the same period in 2019. This propose an idea that the devilish, COVID-19 lockdown has proved to be an unknown tool for tranquillizing air pollution (NO2) during a lockdown within the Territory of Indian.

TI  - High-resolution Alos Palsar for the Characterization of Water Storage at the Fountaine Des Gazelles Dam in Biskra, Eastern Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates water volume variations in the Fontaine des Gazelles Dam in the province of Biskra using high-, medium-, and low-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). The water surface was extracted using NDWI, and the volume of storage was obtained using the water elevation and spatial analysis. The results obtained in comparison with Peng equation show that there exists a significant change in the water surface. This represents a decrease of more than 29 hm3 between 2005 and 2020, on which precipitations were found to be the main factor of these changes. For validation purposes, NRMSE and MAPE were used. Respectively, with values of 1.30% and 1.50% for Alos Palsar, 8.10% and 8.70% for SRTM1, and 8.20% and 10.10% for SRTM3, it is clear that Alos Palsar performs much better results. This leads us to conclude that Alos Palsar is the most reliable to be adopted in studies related to water volume variations.

TI  - Mismatch repair protein expression defects in endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) is the sentinel cancer in over half female patients with heritable mismatch repair (MMR) mutations as part of Lynch syndrome. Immunohistochemical testing for tumoural MMR-protein expression is the primary screening test identifying cases potentially harbouring familial cancer syndrome-related mutations and is also a predictive biomarker for immune-checkpoint blockade response. Methods: Following Data Protection and Ethical clearance by the University of Malta, 200 EEC cases were retrospectively identified and categorized into three arms: 151 cases above age 50 at diagnosis, 49 cases at or below age 50 at diagnosis and 30 controls with benign endometrial tissue sampling. H&E case slides were re-examined by an independent pathologist to confirm the diagnosis and identify the block best representing the tumour. Four new slides per case were recut and immunohistochemistry performed for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 proteins. Protein expression was analysed semiquantitatively using Allred scoring. Results: 31% of the overall EEC cases were deficient for one or more MMR-proteins. Dual loss of the MLH1-PMS2 protein heterodimer was the most common deficiency, occurring in 24.5% of cases. Loss of MSH2-MSH6 protein expression represented 3.2% of MMR-deficient cases. Well differentiated tumours had a 76.5% proficiency rate as opposed to grade 2/3 disease with 53.2% and 52.9% proficiency rate respectively. There was no significant difference in MMR status when age 50 was used as a hypothetical testing threshold. After correcting for tumour grade, MLH1 and PMS2 expression was shown to be negatively correlated with age-at-diagnosis while MSH6 expression was positively correlated. Conclusion: Reflex MMR proficiency testing of all EEC cases is advisable, as using age 50 as a testing threshold would have missed 82.3% of MMR deficient cases. Prospective evidence is required to clarify the role semi-quantitative scoring plays in MMR status interpretation and patient management in the ever-evolving field of targeted therapeutics.

TI  - Outcomes After Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Radiotherapy in Older Women With Early-Stage, Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Overtreatment of early-stage breast cancer with favorable tumor biology in older patients may be harmful without affecting recurrence and survival. Guidelines that recommend deimplementation of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (Choosing Wisely) and radiotherapy (RT) (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) have been published.OBJECTIVE To describe the use rates and association with disease recurrence of SLNB and RT in older women with breast cancer.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study obtained patient and clinical data from an integrated cancer registry and electronic health record of a single health care system in Pennsylvania. The cohort was composed of consecutive female patients 70 years or older who were diagnosed with early-stage, estrogen receptor-positive, ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-negative, clinically node-negative breast cancer from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2018, who were treated at 15 community and academic hospitals within the health system.EXPOSURES Sentinel lymph node biopsy and adjuvant RT.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) rate and disease-free survival (DFS) rate after SLNB and after RT. Secondary outcomes included recurrence rate, subgroups that may benefit from SLNB or RT, and use rate of SLNB and RT over time. Propensity scores were used to create 2 cohorts to separately evaluate the association of SLNB and RT with recurrence outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs).RESULTS From 2010 to 2018, a total of 3361 women 70 years or older (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 77.0 [73.0-82.0] years) with estrogen receptor-positive, ERBB2-negative, clinically node-negative breast cancer were included in the study. Of these women, 2195 (65.3%) received SLNB and 1828 (54.4%) received adjuvant RT. Rates of SLNB steadily increased (1.0% per year), a trend that persisted after the 2016 adoption of the Choosing Wisely guideline. Rates of RT decreased slightly (3.4% per year). To examine patient outcomes and maximize follow-up time, the analysis was limited to cases from 2010 to 2014, identifying 2109 patients with a median (IQR) follow-up time of 4.1 (2.5-5.7) years. In the propensity score-matched cohorts, no association was found between SLNB and either LRFS (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.37-4.30; P = .71) or DFS (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 0.86-4.32; P = .11). In addition, RT was not associated with LRFS (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.09-1.24; P = .10) or DFS (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.46-2.10; P = .97). Subgroup analysis showed that stratification by tumor grade or comorbidity was not associated with LRFS or DFS. Low absolute rates of recurrence were observed when comparing the groups that received SLNB (3.5%) and those that did not (4.5%) as well as the groups that received RT (2.7%) and those that did not (5.5%).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that receipt of SLNB or RT was not associated with improved LRFS or DFS in older patients with ER-positive, clinically node-negative breast cancer. Despite limited follow-up time and wide 95% CIs, this study supports the continued deimplementation of both SLNB and RT in accordance with the Choosing Wisely and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.

T2  - INSTRUMENTATION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric dust samples were collected using PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 mu m) and PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m) filters in 2019 from Southeast Anatolia, Turkey. The direction and source of the dust were determined using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite view and Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. X-ray diffraction (XRD) has shown the presence of calcite and quartz as major components of the aerosol dust. The albedo parameters of atmospheric dust were experimentally determined for 59.54 keV photons emitted from an Am-241 source. Compton and coherent scattered peaks were acquired with a high purity germanium detector. The sample collected in May has a higher density than in June. The sample density at PM10 is larger than PM2.5 and the density of 23 June 2019 is smaller than for the other dates. The albedo parameters of the filter in June and May for PM10 are greater than those of PM2.5. The dust of larger particles is more reflected by the high-energy photons.

TI  - Investigating the land surface temperature reaction to the land cover patterns during three decades using landsat data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use Land cover changes have a momentous influence on land surface temperature. Therefore, investigating spatial distribution of heat islands is a remarkable issue in environmental studies. The purpose of this study was to assess the interaction between land surface temperature variations with land cover change by using Landsat time-series and utilizing Normalized Vegetation Difference Index in Arsanjan County, Fars, Iran from 1987 to 2018. After estimating Normalized Vegetation Difference Index and land surface temperature time-series value in the experimental areas, index differencing technique was applied to identify their changes. Based on the findings, the reducing or rising trends of land surface temperature in vegetation stratums was related to the increasing or decreasing trend of Normalized Vegetation Difference Index from 1987 to 2003 and 2003 to 2018, respectively. Compared to the period 1987-2003, it is noteworthy that the noticeable increase in changed land surface temperature in the rangeland, farmland and Bakhtegan Lake by 18.2 degrees C, 21.2 degrees C and 18.3 degrees C, respectively, were attributed to the significant shift of Normalized Vegetation Difference Index by - 0.04, - 0.33 and + 0.6 in the mentioned area during the period 2003-2018. The correlations between land cover and land surface temperature were considerably positive in the water area by 0.95 and 0.83 from 1987 to 2003 and 2003 to 2018, respectively, while some negative coefficients were estimated by - 0.95 and - 0.94 in farmland in the mentioned period. These results are applicable with regard to managing heat islands by improving the cultivated area, afforestation and artificial Bakhtegan Lake recharge.

TI  - Geomorphological evolution along international riverine borders: The flow of the Aras River through Iran, Azerbaijan, and Armenia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - International rivers are one of the most politicized natural resources. Their dynamism, whether driven by the influence of natural processes or artificial drivers, can generate political issues between countries where de river is the common boundary. The present study has tried to discern the role of international riverine borders as a limiting factor of their dynamics from a geomorphological point of view. In this context, the main objective of this research is to assess how land cover in the floodplain has been affected by river dynamics along a border by analysing a 160-km-long reach of the Aras River, which is the natural frontier between Iran, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, over the last 35 years (i.e., 1984-2019). Landsat images from 1984 to 2019 have been used to assess land cover changes in a floodplain buffer using Support Vector Machine algorithms and geomorphological changes through indexes such as the River Network Change Index, Channel Mobility Index, Sinuosity index, and Bank retreat index. The results show that active channel has mainly experienced a narrowing process during the study period, with a narrowing rate of 2.05 m/year. In addition, the average value of the River Network Channel Index (-2.45 m/year) reveals that lateral deposition and narrowing were the main processes occurring within the study reach. Channel displacement toward the non-Iranian part was more prominent, being around 27 m on average along the whole study reach which may cause new problems and conflicts that conditions the border situation. In the whole study period, the succession category showed a higher rate of increase in comparison with rejuvenation. Stabilization of surfaces prevailed, with most of the area maintaining the same type during the study period. Regarding land cover types, artificialization appears to be the most prominent transition that express the Aras River, and specifically the floodplain buffer zone, has been strongly affected by human pressure, with farmland activities, urbanization, and damming being the most important types. The key to this habitat degradation comes from the management with irrigation purposes of large reservoirs that directly or indirectly would cause most of the changes detected.

TI  - Monitoring Extreme Impacts of <i>Rugulopteryx okamurae</i> (Dictyotales, Ochrophyta) in El Estrecho Natural Park (Biosphere Reserve). Showing Radical Changes in the Underwater Seascape
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive macroalga Rugulopteryx okamurae represents an unprecedented case of bioinvasion by marine macroalgae facing the European coasts. Since the first apparition of the species in the Strait of Gibraltar in 2015, its fast dispersion along the introduced habitats constitutes a real challenge to develop monitoring strategies that ahead of its impacts. The present study uses three different approaches to address impacts on the benthic ecosystems, at the same time offers relevant data for future management actions in El Estrecho Natural Park (PNE). Information obtained by monitoring permanent sentinel stations revealed a significant loss in resident species coverage after the moment of maximum growth in 2017. Thus, despite coverage of R. okamurae did not strongly varied in the latter years, impacts generated remain high in the habitats studied. Estimations of the invasive species coverage by combining cartographic image analysis and in situ data predicted a major occupation (over 85% coverage) between 10 and 30 m, coinciding with the maximum rocky surface areas (m(2)) mapped on the PNE. Furthermore, a Citizen Science research collaboration evidenced impacts on the benthic seascape through an ad hoc exploration of images that allowed a "before" and "after" comparison of the invasion process in the same geographic locations. This has made it possible to graphically demonstrate severe changes in the underwater seascape and, therefore, the general impact of this new biological invasion. The spatial colonization estimations combined with the impacts reported by both scientific [Sessile Bioindicators in Permanent Quadrats (SBPQ) sentinel stations] and civilian (Citizen Science) monitoring methodologies claim the urgent development of further studies that allow the design of monitoring strategies against R. okamurae expansion across the Mediterranean and Atlantic waters.

TI  - Preliminary characteristics of measurements from Fengyun-4A Lightning Mapping Imager
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geostationary satellite-borne lightning measurements provide new and more effective way for lightning detection from space. In December 2016, Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) onboard the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) geostationary satellite was launched, which was the first satellite-borne lightning imager developed in China. Up to now, LMI has been working stably for more than 4 years to implement the continuous and effective lightning detections within China and its surrounding areas. In this study, the preliminary characteristics of measurements from LMI were analysed in detail by using the LMI data between 2018 and 2019. Moreover, the factors that affect the detection capability of LMI were investigated through an inter-comparison between the observations of LMI and International Space Station (ISS) Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS). The results show that the LMI detection results are generally stable and reliable. The relative spatial distribution, monthly and diurnal variations, and the relative optical radiance of lightning observed by the LMI are consistent with those observed by ISS/LIS. However, the absolute values between the two sensors behave significant differences. Caused by the observation geometry, the detection results of LMI in low-latitude regions are more similar to those of ISS/LIS than in mid-latitude regions. In addition, there are some errors in the lightning radiance observed by LMI, which are possibly affected by the bright cloud background as well as radiometric calibration errors. Through targeted improvements to the onboard and ground algorithms for LMI, its detection capability can be greatly improved in future.

TI  - Equatorial anomaly according to the Interkosmos-19 data and IRI model: A comparison
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The comparison of the IRI model with the foF2 distribution in the equatorial anomaly region obtained by topside sounding onboard the Interkosmos-19 satellite has been carried out. The global distribution of foF2 in terms of LT-maps was constructed by averaging Intercosmos-19 data for summer, winter, and equinox. These maps, in fact, represent an empirical model of the equatorial anomaly for high solar activity F10.7 similar to 200. The comparison is carried out for the latitudinal foF2 profiles in the characteristic longitudinal sectors of 30, 90, 210, 270, and 330 degrees, as well as for the longitudinal variations in foF2 over the equator. The largest difference between the models (up to 60%) for any season was found in the Pacific longitudinal sector of 210 degrees, where there are a few ground-based sounding stations. Considerable discrepancies, however, are sometimes observed in the longitudinal sectors, where there are many ground-based stations, for example, in the European or Indian sector. The discrepancies reach their maximum at 00 LT, since a decay of the equatorial anomaly begins before midnight in the IRI model and after midnight according to the Interkosmos-19 data. The discrepancies are also large in the morning at 06 LT, since in the IRI model, the foF2 growth begins long before sunrise. In the longitudinal variations in foF2 over the equator at noon, according to the satellite data, four harmonics are distinguished in the June solstice and at the equinox, and three harmonics in the December solstice, while in the IRI model only two and one harmonics respectively are revealed. In diurnal variations in foF2 and, accordingly, in the equatorial anomaly intensity, the IRI model does not adequately reproduce even the main, evening extremum. (C) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Modelling and upscaling ecosystem respiration using thermal cameras and UAVs: Application to a peatland during and after a hot drought
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-based thermal infrared cameras provide surface temperature information at very high spatial and temporal resolution and could complement existing phenological camera and spectral sensor networks. Since temperature is one of the main drivers of ecosystem respiration (ER), field-based thermal cameras offer a new opportunity to model and upscale ER in unprecedented detail. We present such an approach based on manual chamber CO2 flux measurements and thermal imagery from a tower-based camera and from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flights. Data were collected over two growing seasons, including the hot drought of 2018, for the two main vegetation microforms (hummock and hollow) of a hemi-boreal peatland in Sweden. Thermal imagery proved suitable for modelling ER in this ecosystem: ER model accuracies were similar when air, soil or surface temperature measurements were used as input. Our findings allowed us to upscale ER using UAV-derived thermal images and we present maps of ER at sub-decimeter resolution (<7 cm). The significantly different ER measured for each microform highlighted the importance of modelling their ER separately. Not accounting for these differences and the microforms' spatial distribution across the peatland led to a bias in upscaled ER of up to 18%. As a result of the severity and timing of the hot drought in 2018, we observed reductions in the ER of both microforms, but more so for hummocks (-48%) than for hollows (-15%), and modelled ER leveled off at high temperatures. These findings indicate that peatland carbon loss during hot droughts may be lower than expected and strongly relates to vegetation composition. The presented upscaling approach offers a new method to analyse how ER varies across a peatland or within a flux-tower footprint, and to interpret biases that occur when using coarse resolution satellite data to upscale chamber or tower-based flux measurements.

TI  - Remote Heart Rhythm Monitoring by Photoplethysmography-Based Smartphone Technology After Cardiac Surgery: Prospective Observational Study
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia after cardiac surgery, yet the precise incidence and significance of arrhythmias after discharge home need to be better defined. Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based smartphone apps are promising tools to enable early detection and follow-up of arrhythmias.Objective: By using a PPG-based smartphone app, we aimed to gain more insight into the prevalence of AF and other rhythm-related complications upon discharge home after cardiac surgery and evaluate the implementation of this app into routine clinical care.Methods: In this prospective, single-center trial, patients recovering from cardiac surgery were asked to register their heart rhythm 3 times daily using a Food and Drug Administration-approved PPG-based app, for either 30 or 60 days after discharge home. Patients with permanent AF or a permanent pacemaker were excluded.Results: We included 24 patients (mean age 60.2 years, SD 12 years; 15/23, 65% male) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valve surgery. During hospitalization, 39% (9/23) experienced postoperative AF. After discharge, the PPG app reported AF or atrial flutter in 5 patients. While the app notified flutter in 1 patient, this was a false positive, as electrocardiogram revealed a 2nd-degree, 2:1 atrioventricular block necessitating a permanent pacemaker. AF was confirmed in 4 patients (4/23, 17%) and interestingly, was associated with an underlying postoperative complication in 2 participants (pneumonia n=1, pericardial tamponade n=1). A significant increase in the proportion of measurements indicating sinus rhythm was observed when comparing the first to the second month of follow-up (P<.001). In the second month of follow-up, compliance was significantly lower with 2.2 (SD 0.7) measurements per day versus 3.0 (SD 0.8) measurements per day in the first month (P=.002). The majority of participants (17/23, 74%), as well as the surveyed primary care physicians, experienced positive value by using the app as they felt more involved in the postoperative rehabilitation.Conclusions: Implementation of smartphone-based PPG technology enables detection of AF and other rhythm-related complications after cardiac surgery. An association between AF detection and an underlying complication was found in 2 patients. Therefore, smartphone-based PPG technology may supplement rehabilitation after cardiac surgery by acting as a sentinel for underlying complications, rhythm-related or otherwise.

TI  - Impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on laboratory-confirmed pneumococcal meningitis and purulent meningitis among children &lt;5 years in Cameroon, 2011-2018
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) entered Cameroon's childhood national immunization programme (NIP) in July 2011 under a 3-dose schedule (6, 10, 14 weeks of age) without any catch-up. We described the impact of PCV13 onserotype distribution among pneumococcal meningitis cases over time.MethodsWe used laboratory-based sentinel surveillance data to identify meningitis cases among 2- to 59-month-old children with clinically-suspected bacterial meningitis (CSBM) admitted to hospitals in Yaounde (August 2011-December 2018). Purulent meningitis cases had a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) count >= 20 per mm(3). Pneumococcal meningitis cases had S. pneumoniae identified from CSF, with serotyping by polymerase chain reaction. Years 2011-2014 were described as early PCV13 era (EPE) and years 2015-2018 as late PCV13 era (LPE) impact periods.ResultsAmong children hospitalized with CSBM who had a lumbar puncture obtained, there was no significant change from the EPE versus the LPE in the percentage identified with purulent meningitis: 7.5% (112/1486) versus 9.4% (154/1645), p = 0.0846. The percentage of pneumococcal meningitis cases due to PCV13 vaccine-serotype (VST) decreased from 62.0% (31/50) during the EPE to 35.8% (19/53) in the LPE, p = 0.0081. The most frequent pneumococcal meningitis VSTs during the EPE were 6A/6B (30%) and 5 (6%), and during the LPE were 14 (13.2%), 3 (7.6%), 4 (5.6%) and 18C (5.6%).ConclusionFour to seven years after PCV13 introduction, the proportion of pneumococcal meningitis due to vaccine serotypes has declined, mainly due to reductions of serotypes 6A/6B, 1, 19A, and 23F; nevertheless, PCV13 VSTs remain common. Because the analyzed surveillance system was not consistent or population based, we could not estimate incidence or overall impact; this emphasizes the need for improved surveillance to document further the utility of PCV13 immunization in Cameroon.

TI  - An Automatic Radiometric Cross-Calibration Method for Wide-Angle Medium-Resolution Multispectral Satellite Sensor Using Landsat Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric calibration of the medium-resolution satellite data is critical for monitoring and quantifying changes in the Earth's environment and resources. Many medium-resolution satellite sensors have irregular revisits and, sometimes, have a large difference in illumination viewing geometry compared with a reference sensor, posing a great challenge for routine cross-calibration practices. To overcome these issues, this study proposed a cross-calibration method to calibrate medium-resolution multispectral data. The Chinese Gaofen-4 (GF-4) panchromatic and multispectral sensor (PMS) data with large viewing angles were used as the test data, and Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) data were used as the reference data. A bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction method was proposed to eliminate the effects of differences in illumination viewing geometry between GF-4 and Landsat-8. The validation using concurrent image shows that the mean relative error (MRE) of cross calibration is less than 6.65%. Validation using ground measurements shows that our calibration results have an improvement of around 14.8% compared with the official released calibration coefficients. The time series cross calibration reveals that, without the requirements of simultaneous nadir observations (SNOs), our calibration activities can be carried out more often in practice. Gradual and continuous radiometric sensor degradation is identified with the monthly updated calibration coefficients, demonstrating the reliability and importance of the timely cross calibration. Besides, the cross-calibration approach does not rely on any specific calibration site, and the difference in illumination viewing geometry can be well considered. Thus, it can be easily adapted and applied to other optical satellite data.

TI  - Sensor calibration impacts on dust detection based on MODIS and VIIRS thermal emissive bands
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust detection using remotely sensed measurements has been one of the challenging problems encountered by atmospheric scientists. MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra (T) and Aqua (A) platforms have been a versatile sensor for well over 21 and 18 years respectively, and have been extremely useful in the retrieval of aerosol information over the entire globe. The MODIS radiances from the Level 1B in general are expected to be within 5% accuracy in the reflective wavelengths and within 1% in the thermal emissive wavelengths. In this paper, we evaluate the sensitivity of previously developed dust detection technique based on thermal emissive wavelengths, which correspond to MODIS bands 20, 29, 31, and 32 respectively. The Thermal Emissive Dust Index (TEDI) performed very comparably to the traditional Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) retrievals by MODIS reflective channels. Since the MODIS Thermal Emissive Bands (TEB) are well calibrated on-orbit using a BlackBody (BB) source, the calibration of these long wave infrared bands is quite robust. As A-MODIS continues to perform well beyond its designed lifetime of 6 years, the instrument has undergone various levels of degradation during its mission time. As a consequence, it is imperative to check the impacts of calibration on the higher-level retrievals. In this paper, we rigorously analyze the sensitivity of TEDI due to the impact of calibration by the aforementioned TEB. The perturbation of the dominant (linear) calibration term demonstrated the following: first, there was a correlation in the sensitivity of the TEDI due to the uncertainty in the linear calibration term. Based on a perturbation in the linear calibration term for all aforementioned bands over a range of +/- 5% yielded the TEDI sensitivity to vary from approximately -3.2% to about -3.6%. When considering the uncertainty in each individual band significant changes were observed. The least change was observed for the perturbation in the calibration of band 20 with the TEDI sensitivity and the largest sensitivity in TEDI was observed in the perturbation of band 31 calibration. Thus, in the case of TEDI, noticeable sensitivity due to calibration uncertainty was observed in bands 29, 31, and 32, reiterating the importance of the TEB calibration in these bands. Also, the dust detection scheme based on A-MODIS was successfully transferred to the follow-on sensors such as Suomi (SNPP) and NOAA 20 (N20) VIIRS. The results presented in this paper would be extremely helpful in understanding impacts of calibration on the higher-level products for both current and future missions based on the MODIS heritage. Finally, the work also identifies the importance of radiometric fidelity in maintaining the accuracy of the dust detection. Results presented will show drastic improvement of the Saharan dust detection after the reduction of the electronic crosstalk in the 8.5 mm channel of T-MODIS. (C) 2021 COSPAR.

T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface crevasses covered by snow bridges can be mapped remotely on ice sheets and glaciers using active microwave synthetic aperture radar. They are highlighted against the surrounding snow due to increased scattering from the side-walls and base of snow bridges and usually appear as linear features. The contrast between crevasses and crevasse-free regions depends on the design of the sensor, the image acquisition parameters and the properties of the snow. Here we quantify how crevassed regions are represented at X-band for different polarizations, look directions and incidence angles, and discuss whether additional information about their physical properties can be gained from their radar signature. Snow bridge thicknesses and crevasse widths are measured on the ground in the McMurdo Shear Zone and Brunt Ice Shelf by ground-penetrating radar and excavation. TerraSAR-X is shown to reliably distinguish crevasse location, balancing penetration into the snow and horizontal resolution. We provide recommendations for radar imaging parameters that optimize the identification of individual crevasses and crevassed regions.

TI  - A density functional theory and neutron diffraction study of the ambient condition properties of sub-stoichiometric yttrium hydride
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several mechanical and thermophysical properties are required as a function of non-stoichiometry for the successful implementation of YH(2-x )for nuclear reactor moderator applications. Density functional theory calculations, in combination with neutron diffraction experiments, were used to study the structural and mechanical properties of YH2-x. Point defect analysis indicated H occupation primarily at the tetrahedral site within an fcc Y sub-lattice, confirming a fluorite YH2 structure. The small positive formation energy for H vacancies under Y-rich conditions predicted that hypo-stoichiometry is accommodated by Y+YH2 at ambient conditions and by H vacancies in the YH2-x single phase that is relevant to high temperatures. Neutron diffraction studies were used to confirm both the occupation of H on tetrahedral sites and the near-stoichiometric composition of the hydride phase in the two-phase Y+YH2 region of the phase diagram that dominates at room temperature. Energy minimized special-quasirandom-structures of H vacancies were used to calculate lattice parameters, elastic constants, and several other properties as a function of composition for the single phase YH2-x. The lattice parameter of YH2-x decreased by only 0.004 angstrom with increasing H/Y for the range 1.31 <= H/Y <= 2.0 indicating a negligible effect on lattice pa- rameters due to vacancy formation. In the two-phase region, however, calculations predicted the density of zY + (1 - z)YH2-x to increase with decreasing H/Y at lower temperatures due to the increased fraction of high-density Y metal. For the high temperature single phase, decreasing H/Y reduced the density as a consequence of the lattice expansion associated with vacancy formation. All elastic constants and moduli increased with increasing hydrogen content in single-phase YH2-x. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nodal Recurrence is a Primary Driver of Early Relapse for Patients with Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Melanoma in the Modern Therapeutic Era
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Management of patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma has changed dramatically over the last few years such that completion lymph node dissection (CLND) has become uncommon, and many patients receive adjuvant immunotherapy or targeted therapy. This study seeks to characterize patterns and predictors of early recurrence in this setting. Patients and Methods All patients with primary cutaneous melanoma undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 3/2016 and 12/2019 were identified. The subset with a positive SLN who did not undergo CLND were examined for further analysis of outcomes and predictors of recurrence. Results Overall, 215 patients with SLN-positive melanoma who did not have CLND were identified. Adjuvant systemic therapy was administered to 102 (47%), with 93% of this subset receiving immunotherapy (n = 95). Median follow-up from SLNB was 20 months (IQR 12-28.5 months), and 57 patients (27%) recurred during this time. The SLN basin was the most common site of recurrence (n = 38, 67% of recurrence), with isolated nodal recurrence being the most common first site of recurrent disease (n = 22, 39% of recurrence). On multivariable analysis, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) of the primary tumor, two or more involved nodes, and > 1 mm nodal deposit were independently associated with higher rates of nodal relapse. Conclusions Nodal recurrence is a primary driver of early disease relapse for patients with SLN-positive melanoma who do not undergo CLND in the era of effective adjuvant systemic therapy. LVI, >= 2 nodes, or > 1 mm nodal disease identifies patients at particularly high risk of nodal relapse.

TI  - Substitution of satellite-based land surface temperature defective data using GSP method
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) as an important environmental variable provides valuable information for earth environmental system modelling. Currently, LST is obtained through satellite thermal sensors at various spatial and temporal resolutions. Although spatially continuous satellite-based LST measurements are intended to overcome the shortcomings of sparse ground-based LST measurements, LST images often contain anomalous values due to the existence of clouds or sensor malfunctioning. The problem becomes more serious where the users deal with high spatial resolution characterized by low temporal resolution. This study examines the capability of a newly developed graph signal processing (GSP) method using two-dimensional single-date thermal data. For this purpose, four Landsat/TIRS datasets are analyzed. The data of five elliptical regions on thermal images are eliminated and then reconstructed through the GSP method and using the LST values of the enclosing rectangles containing the ellipsoids. The results indicate that the temperature variation determined by the GSP method generally conforms to the original image LST values. According to a correlation test conducted on the original image LST and those obtained through the GSP method, the values vary from 58% to 95%, which is an above-the-average rate (RMSE from 0.69 to 2.27). The statistical analysis of the original image LST in both the elliptical regions and the enclosing rectangles containing the ellipsoids indicates that an increase in the variance of LST data causes an increased error in the calculation of temperature by the GSP method, and vice versa. The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan test indicated that an increase in the number of the non-zero spectral bins would result in increased RMSE values for all the dates and the regions. Moreover, the model errors were significant at the 0.05 level across all the image date and five elliptical study regions. Based on the results, the use of this method is recommended for the reconstruction of LST missing values, where dissimilarity of atmospheric conditions limits the use of other methods that depend on the time series data of various dates and a great deal of data calculation.

TI  - Estimation of bioclimatic variables of Mongolia derived from remote sensing data
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global maps of bioclimatic variables currently exist only at very coarse spatial resolution (e.g. World-Clim). For ecological studies requiring higher resolved information, this spatial resolution is often insufficient. The aim of this study is to estimate important bioclimatic variables of Mongolia from Earth Observation (EO) data at a higher spatial resolution of 1 km. The analysis used two different satellite time series data sets: land surface temperature (LST) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and precipitation (P) from Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS). Monthly maximum, mean, and minimum air temperature were estimated from Terra MODIS satellite (collection 6) LST time series product using the random forest (RF) regression model. Monthly total precipitation data were obtained from CHIRPS version 2.0. Based on this primary data, spatial maps of 19 bioclimatic variables at a spatial resolution of 1 km were generated, representing the period 2002-2017. We tested the relationship between estimated bioclimatic variables (SatClim) and WorldClim bioclimatic variables version 2.0 (WorldClim) using determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) and found overall good agreement. Among the set of 19 WorldClim bioclimatic variables, 17 were estimated with a coefficient of determination (R-2) higher than 0.7 and normalized RMSE (nRMSE) lower than 8%, confirming that the spatial pattern and value ranges can be retrieved from satellite data with much higher spatial resolution compared to WorldClim. Only the two bioclimatic variables related to temperature extremes (i.e., annual mean diurnal range and isothermality) were modeled with only moderate accuracy (R-2 of about 0.4 with nRMSE of about 11%). Generally, precipitation-related bioclimatic variables were closer correlated with WorldClim compared to temperature-related bioclimatic variables. The overall success of the modeling was attributed to the fact that satellite-derived data are well suited to generated spatial fields of precipitation and temperature variables, especially at high altitudes and high latitudes. As a consequence of the successful retrieval of the bioclimatic variables at 1 km spatial resolution, we are confident that the estimated 19 bioclimatic variables will be very useful for a range of applications, including species distribution modeling.

TI  - Avoiding Full Lymphadenectomies in Intermediate- and High-Risk Endometrial Cancer by Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Implementation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to avoid staging lymphadenectomies by detecting nodal metastasis in intermediate- and high-risk endometrial cancer (EC).MethodsA single institutional retrospective study was performed including all patients with intermediate- and high-risk EC who underwent surgical nodal staging between January 2012 and December 2019. Patients with disseminated disease detected on imaging techniques or at the time of surgery were excluded. Patients were evaluable if they underwent nodal staging with SLNB and pelvic (PLD) and paraaortic (PALD) lymph node dissection. We analyzed the accuracy of the sentinel lymph node technique. Only patients with at least one sentinel lymph node (SLN) detected were included in the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) analyses. The tracers used were technetium 99m, blue dye, and indocyanine green.ResultsEighty-eight patients presented intermediate- and high-risk EC (51 patients and 37 patients respectively) and underwent SLNB with consecutive PLD and PALD. The median (range) number of sentinel nodes retrieved was 2.9 (0-11). The global detection rate of SLN was 96.6% with a bilateral detection of 80.7% when considering all tracers used. However, when combination of indocyanine green and technetium was used the bilateral detection rate was 90.3%. Nodal metastases were detected in 17 (19.3%) cases, 8 (47%) of them corresponded to low volume metastasis (LVM), 7 (87.5%) of them diagnosed at ultrastaging pathologic exam. Finally, we obtained a sensitivity of 90%, a NPV of 97.5%, and a false negative rate (FNR) of 10% in the intermediate-risk EC compared to sensitivity of 85.7%, NPV of 96.6%, and FNR of 14.3% in the high-risk EC group. The only patient with isolated paraaortic nodal metastasis was found at the high-risk group, 1.1%.ConclusionsAccording to our results, full lymphadenectomy could be avoided by performing SLNB in patients with intermediate-risk EC because the only false negative case detected was at the beginning of ICG learning curve. For high-risk EC patients we did not find enough evidence to support the systematic avoidance of staging full lymph node dissection. Nevertheless, SLNB should be performed in all cases of EC as it improves LVM diagnosis substantially.

TI  - Quantifying Scales of Spatial Variability of Cyanobacteria in a Large, Eutrophic Lake Using Multiplatform Remote Sensing Tools
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms of cyanobacteria are increasing in magnitude and frequency globally, degrading inland and coastal aquatic ecosystems and adversely affecting public health. Efforts to understand the structure and natural variability of these blooms range from point sampling methods to a wide array of remote sensing tools. This study aims to provide a comprehensive view of cyanobacterial blooms in Clear Lake, California - a shallow, polymictic, naturally eutrophic lake with a long record of episodic cyanobacteria blooms. To understand the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms, we evaluated a satellite remote sensing tool for estimating coarse cyanobacteria distribution with coincident, in situ measurements at varying scales and resolutions. The Cyanobacteria Index (CI) remote sensing algorithm was used to estimate cyanobacterial abundance in the top portion of the water column from data acquired from the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor on the Sentinel-3a satellite. We collected hyperspectral data from a handheld spectroradiometer; discrete 1 m integrated surface samples for chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin; multispectral imagery from small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) flights (similar to 12 cm resolution); Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) measurements of chlorophyll-a, turbidity, and colored dissolved organic matter (similar to 10 cm horizontal spacing, 1 m below the water surface); and meteorological forcing and lake temperature data to provide context to our cyanobacteria measurements. A semivariogram analysis of the high resolution AUV and sUAS data found the Critical Scale of Variability for cyanobacterial blooms to range from 70 to 175 m, which is finer than what is resolvable by the satellite data. We thus observed high spatial variability within each 300 m satellite pixel. Finally, we used the field spectroscopy data to evaluate the accuracy of both the original and revised CI algorithm. We found the revised CI algorithm was not effective in estimating cyanobacterial abundance for our study site. Satellite-based remote sensing tools are vital to researchers and water managers as they provide consistent, high-coverage data at a low cost and sampling effort. The findings of this research support continued development and refinement of remote sensing tools, which are essential for satellite monitoring of harmful algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs.

TI  - Caucasians with acral lentiginous melanoma have the same outcome as patients with stage- and limb-matched superficial spreading melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), a relatively rare subtype of cutaneous melanoma, has been reported to have a worse prognosis than other melanomas. We aimed to assess clinical findings in Caucasian ALM patients and compare the data with a matched cohort of superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) patients. Methods We studied 63 patients with ALM and 63 randomly stage- and limb-matched patients with SSM (non-ALM). In both cohorts, guideline-adjusted diagnosis, treatment and follow-up were performed. Results We did not observe differences in prognostic factors (e.g., tumor thickness, ulceration) between the two cohorts. Both in ALM and non-ALM patients positive sentinel lymph node was a significant independent predictor for disease relapse and melanoma-specific death. However, disease relapse and melanoma-specific death rates did not significantly differ between ALM and non-ALM patients. An overall 5-year melanoma-specific survival of 82.5% and 81% was observed in ALM and non-ALM patients, respectively. Conclusions Our data confirm that patients with ALM have no worse outcome than non-ALM patients when correcting for significant prognostic factors. Hence, the reportedly high rates of fatal ALM cases should not be ascribed to pathobiological differences between ALM and non-ALM but are most likely are a consequence of a delay in diagnosis and thus advanced stage of ALM.

TI  - The 2020 glacial lake outburst flood process chain at Lake Salkantaycocha (Cordillera Vilcabamba, Peru)
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes represent a threat for the populations of the Andes and numerous disastrous glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) occurred as a result of sudden dam failures or dam overtoppings triggered by landslides such as rock/ice avalanches into the lake. This paper investigates a landslide-triggered GLOF process chain that occurred on February 23, 2020, in the Cordillera Vilcabamba in the Peruvian Andes. An initial slide at the SW slope of Nevado Salkantay evolved into a rock/ice avalanche. The frontal part of this avalanche impacted the moraine-dammed Lake Salkantaycocha, triggering a displacement wave which overtopped and surficially eroded the dam. Dam overtopping resulted in a far-reaching GLOF causing fatalities and people missing in the valley downstream. We analyze the situations before and after the event as well as the dynamics of the upper portion of the GLOF process chain, based on field investigations, remotely sensed data, meteorological data and a computer simulation with a two-phase flow model. Comparison of pre- and post-event field photographs helped us to estimate the initial landslide volume of 1-2 million m(3). Meteorological data suggest rainfall and/or melting/thawing processes as possible causes of the landslide. The simulation reveals that the landslide into the lake created a displacement wave of 27 m height. The GLOF peak discharge at the dam reached almost 10,000 m(3)/s. However, due to the high freeboard, less than 10% of the lake volume drained, and the lake level increased by 10-15 m, since the volume of landslide material deposited in the lake (roughly 1.3 million m(3)) was much larger than the volume of released water (57,000 m(3), according to the simulation). The model results show a good fit with the observations, including the travel time to the uppermost village. The findings of this study serve as a contribution to the understanding of landslide-triggered GLOFs in changing high-mountain regions.

TI  - Initial scalar lithospheric magnetic anomaly map of China and surrounding regions derived from CSES satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES), China's first satellite to measure geophysical fields with scientific goals in both space and solid earth physics, was launched successfully in February 2018. It carries high-precision magnetometers to measure the geomagnetic field. In this study, the CSES magnetic data were used to extract the signal of the lithospheric magnetic field caused by magnetized rocks in the crust and uppermost mantle. First, an along-track analysis of the CSES magnetic data was undertaken near the Bangui magnetic anomaly in central Africa and the Tarim magnetic anomaly in China, demonstrating that the CSES magnetic data are indeed sensitive to the lithospheric magnetic anomaly field. Then a lithospheric magnetic anomaly map over China and surrounding regions was derived. This map is consistent with the lithospheric part of the CHAOS-7 model. In particular, it clearly reveals four major magnetic anomalies containing long-wavelength signals at the altitude of low-earth-orbiting satellites. Three magnetic highs are located over the Tarim, Sichuan and Songliao basin, the origins of which could be related to large-scale tectonic-magmatic activities during geological history. A prominent magnetic low is otherwise found in the southern Himalayan-Tibetan plateau, possibly caused by the shallow Curie depth in this region. To further improve the precision of the lithospheric magnetic field model, more detailed data processing and multi-source data merging are needed.

TI  - Surface mining caused multiple ecosystem service losses in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China's surface mining greatly supported the rapid socio-economic development; however, there was a scarcity in the systematic understanding of national changes in surface mining changes and associated ecosystem services (ESs) losses, which inevitably affected human well-being and limited sustainable ecosystem management and policy optimization. In this study, we quantified the areal changes in surface mining based on the ChinaCover database and performed further analysis of ES loss from expanded surface mining using multidimensional geospatial data from 1990 to 2015, including MODIS products, meteorological records, and statistical datasets. Our observations reveal that China's surface mining was estimated to be 4746 km2 in 2015 and that Inner Mongolia had the largest surface mining area (28%). Surface mining expanded remarkably from 1990 to 2015, with an increase by 2.7 times after 2000. In particular, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and Qinghai had the greatest increases in surface mining area. Rapid expansion of surface mining led to obvious declines in natural habitat area, water retention, net primary productivity, and grain production, and these ES losses showed apparent spatiotemporal variations. China has taken many measures to reclaim the abandoned surface mining sites. Given the rapid expansion of surface mining and related ES loss, China should continue to perform ecological restoration for its sustainability.

TI  - A Random Forest-Based Algorithm to Distinguish <i>Ulva prolifera</i> and <i>Sargassum</i> From Multispectral Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2017, large-scale macroalgae blooms with different dominant species of Ulm prolifera and Sargassum occurred concurrently in the Yellow and East China Seas, which poses a challenge to the cognition and control of macroalgae disaster. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an algorithm to distinguish U. prolifera and Sargassum from satellite images. In this study, the spectral difference between U. prolifera and Sargasso'', and the capability of several multispectral satellite missions to distinguish them is first analyzed. The results show that the reflectance peak in visible wavelength is always in similar to 550 nm for U. prolifera whether it is floating in clear open water or turbid nearshore water. However, the reflectance of Sargassum floating in clear and turbid water shows totally different characteristics, because most of Sargassum body is submerged in the water and the observed Sargassum reflectance is seriously affected by water reflectance. Compared with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), HuanJing-1, Charge-Coupled Devices (HJ-1 CCD), Aqua Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sentinel 2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), GaoFen-1, Wide Field of View (GF-1 WFV) can preferably capture the spectral difference between U. prolifera and Sargassum. Based on the spectral difference analysis, we propose a random forest-based algorithm to distinguish U. prolifera and Sargasso'', from GF-1 WFV images with an overall accuracy of 97.6% except when U. prolifera and Sargassum mix together. The algorithm is more robust than the existing ones as it allowed more Sargassum samples from different ocean regions to be used in the training; in addition, it avoids negative effects caused by the selection of a threshold. The proposed algorithm is proved effective in distinguishing U. prolifera and Sargasso'', in the Yellow and East China Seas in May and June 2017 and in detecting Sargasso'', in the Atlantic Ocean. Thus, this method can be used in researches including floating macroalgae traceability and competition and succession between different macroalgae species in different regions of the ocean with similar environments.

TI  - Would the obtainable gross primary productivity (GPP) products stand up? A critical assessment of 45 global GPP products
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a vital variable of the global carbon cycle, but the quantification of global GPP is subject to significant uncertainty due to the lack of direct observations at a global scale. Here, we evaluated and compared 45 GPP products in terms of their applicability to different vegetation types at various spatiotemporal scales. The results show that 44 GPP products and obsGPP (Model Tree Ensemble GPP derived from observations and named obsGPP) have similar global patterns with correlation coefficients greater than 0.8 except for NGT, where GOSIF, RS, and BESS are prominent. GPP products have the greatest variation in Suriname, with a mean 75th and 25th percentile difference value 0.4748 (normalized), and we recommend RS, SDGVM and LPJ-wsl as they provide GPP estimates close to the average GPP. In terms of seasonal estimations, considerable disagreement occurs among the GPP products in winter, with a range from 118.76 to 314.95 gC/m(2)/season, among which JULES has the closest GPP value to the average GPP estimation. For studies concerning vegetation types preference is given to the LUE average GPP. The 45 GPP products are more consistent on grasslands but, have obvious differences for savannas. All GPP products have their own specific spatiotemporal scales, such as global or national scales or different seasons and different vegetation types (forest, grasslands, etc.). This study provides guidelines for selecting GPP products. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of rain on wave retrieval from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images in tropical cyclones
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of our work was to investigate the impact of rain on wave observations from C-band (similar to 5.3 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in tropical cyclones. In this study, 10 Sentinel-1 SAR images were available from the Satellite Hurricane Observation Campaign, which were taken under cyclonic conditions during the 2016 hurricane season. The third-generation wave model, known as Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) (version 41.31), was used to simulate the wave fields corresponding to these Sentinel-1 SAR images. In addition, rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite passing over the spatial coverage of the Sentinel-1 SAR images were collected. The simulated results were validated against significant wave heights (SWHs) from the Jason-2 altimeter and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts data, revealing a root mean square error (RMSE) of similar to 0.5 m with a 0.25 scatter index. Winds retrieved from the VH-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR images using the Sentinel-1 Extra Wide-swath Mode Wind Speed Retrieval Model after Noise Removal were taken as prior information for wave retrieval. It was discovered that rain did indeed affect the SAR wave retrieval, as evidenced by the 3.21-m RMSE of SWHs between the SAR images and the SWAN model, which was obtained for the-1000 match-ups with raindrops. The raindrops dampened the wave retrieval when the rain rate was < similar to 5 mm/hr; however, they enhanced wave retrieval for higher rain rates. It was also found that the portion of the rain-induced ring wave with a wave number > 0.05 rad/m (similar to 125 m wavelength) was clearly observed in the SAR-derived wave spectra. (C) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Increasing temperature shortened the carbon uptake period and decreased the cumulative net ecosystem productivity in a maize cropland in Northeast China
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology-mainly associated with climatic factors-is crucial for the accurate estimation of cumulative annual carbon exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. However, the effects of changes in phenology on annual vegetation productivity and its regulatory mechanisms remain unclear, particularly in agricultural ecosystems. Therefore, in this study, we examined the associations among cumulative net ecosystem productivity (NEP), phenological metrics, and climatic factors based on long-term (2005-2014) eddy covariance flux and meteorological observations in a maize cropland in Northeast China. The results showed that carbon uptake period (CUP) was mainly determined by the end date of CUP (ECUP) in autumn. Cumulative NEP from May to September (NEP5_9), a period generally corresponding to the growing season, significantly increased with NEPmax (defined in this study as the 90th percentile of daily NEP during CUP) and CUP. NEPmax explained greater interannual variation in NEP5_9 than CUP. The start date of CUP (SCUP) and ECUP were both advanced with increasing winter temperature, but ECUP was more temperature-sensitive than SCUP. Thus, CUP tended to shorten with increasing temperature, ultimately decreasing cumulative NEP. In addition, NEPmax decreased with increasing precipitation in summer and autumn. The Greenup and MidGreendown dates from the MODIS Global Vegetation Phenology (MCD12Q2) product generally captured the interannual variation in the carbon flux-based SCUP and ECUP, respectively, well. The results of this study would be of great significance for predicting the response of ecosystem productivity to plant phenology shifts in agricultural ecosystems in future climate change scenarios.

T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area belongs to the coast of El-Omayed Biosphere Reserve on the western Mediterranean coast of Egypt. This work represents one of the limited studies analyzing historical change rates of its shoreline and predicting future changes to identify the parts requiring management interventions. The shorelines of five dates covering a period of 34 years between 1984 and 2018 were extracted from five Level-2 Landsat images. The Water Index (WI2015) provided the best extraction results of three common water indices when compared with a reference shoreline digitized from high resolution Google Earth imagery. End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) were automatically calculated to determine shoreline change rates. The two methods provided very similar results (R-2 exceeding 0.98). EPR was used for evaluating historical changes (1984-2018) and predicting future shoreline positions (2030 and 2050). The results showed that the shoreline exhibited alternation between erosion and accretion with varied rates. The average erosion rate is 1.67 m/year and highest accretion is 1.88 m/year. These changes result basically from longshore sediment transport generated by the waves and currents approaching mostly from NW quadrant. The western parts are also affected by the protective structures supporting the intensive touristic activities characterizing the study area. The future trends of predicted shorelines showed that urgent and long-term protective measures are required to avoid the partial and complete loss of the several parts of its beaches jeopardizing the sustainability of the tourism activities in the study area.

TI  - Quantification of urban heat intensity with land use/land cover changes using Landsat satellite data over urban landscapes
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon which may have adverse effects on our environment and is stimulated as a result of urbanization or land cover changes. Thermal remote sensing has been found beneficial to study the effect of urbanization on UHI intensity. This paper analyses the variation in land surface temperature (LST) with land cover changes in Varanasi city of India from 1989 to 2018 using Landsat satellite images. A new index named Urban Heat Intensity Ratio Index (UHIRI) was proposed to quantify the urban heat intensity from 1989 to 2018 which was found to increase from 0.36 in year 1989 to 0.87 in year 2018. Further, contribution of each land cover towards UHI was determined using land cover contribution index (LCCI). The negative value of LCCI for water and vegetation indicates its negative contribution towards UHI, whereas positive value of LCCI for bare soil and built-ups depicted its positive contribution towards UHI. The LCCI value for urban land cover shows significant increase in 29 years, i.e. 0.49, 1.43, 3.40 and 4.37 for years 1989, 1997, 2008 and 2018, respectively. The changes in normalized LST from years 1989 to 2018 for the conversion of bare land to built-ups and vegetation to built-ups were found to be as -0.11 and 0.42, respectively. This led to conclusion that the replacement of vegetation with urban land cover has severe impact on increasing UHI intensity.

TI  - Assessment and valuation of health impacts of fine particulate matter during COVID-19 lockdown: a comprehensive study of tropical and sub tropical countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to challenge the whole world. The disease has claimed many fatalities as it has transcended from one country to another since it was first discovered in China in late 2019. To prevent further morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, most of the countries initiated a countrywide lockdown. While physical distancing and lockdowns helped in curbing the spread of this novel coronavirus, it led to massive economic losses for the nations. Positive impacts have been observed due to lockdown in terms of improved air quality of the nations. In the current research, ten tropical and subtropical countries have been analysed from multiple angles, including air pollution, assessment and valuation of health impacts and economic loss of countries during COVID-19 lockdown. Countries include Brazil, India, Iran, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Validated Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) binning model is used on data collated from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) for particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) for all the countries for the month of January to May 2019 and 2020. The concentration results of PM2.5 show that air pollution has drastically reduced in 2020 post lockdown for all countries. The highest average concentration obtained by converting aerosol optical depth (AOD) for 2020 is observed for Thailand as 121.9 mu g/m(3) and the lowest for Mexico as 36.27 mu g/m(3). As air pollution is found to decrease in the April and May months of 2020 for nearly all countries, they are compared with respective previous year values for the same duration to calculate the reduced health burden due to lockdown. The present study estimates that cumulative about 100.9 Billion US$ are saved due to reduced air pollution externalities, which are about 25% of the cumulative economic loss of 435.9 Billion US$.

AB  - We evaluated the sensitivity of the chromosomal aberration (CA) and mitotic index (MI) assays on peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of Caiman latirostris, following ex vivo exposure to the alkylating agent, MMS. Two concentrations of MMS were tested in cultured peripheral blood. Relative to controls, MMS exposure reduced the number of metaphases observed, but both the numbers of cells with MN and the percentages of aberrant metaphases increased. The types of CA identified were chromosome and chromatid breaks, chromosomal rearrangements, monosomies, and nullisomies, with significantly higher values in the MMS-exposed groups. The incorporation of the MI and CA tests in C. latirostris can provide information on damage caused by xenobiotic exposures.

TI  - Land degradation mapping in the MATOPIBA region (Brazil) using remote sensing data and decision-tree analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of agricultural activities in Brazil resulted in a loss of approximately 50% of the native vegetation of the Cerrado biome, mainly to the north of the biome in a region known as MATOPIBA. Besides contributing to accelerate climate change, the removal of native vegetation is associated with increase soil degradation. In this study, we used the decision tree method to predict degradation using as indicators Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived indices over the period 1985-2018. Results showed that approximately 4677 km(2) (0.63%) of MATOPIBA region is under strong signs of degradation, mostly on pasture and grasslands areas, commonly used for grazing. Although the percentage of degraded areas is relatively small, the mapping indicated that the majority of degradation patches are concentrated not only in areas of low resilience, e.g., areas dominated by weakly structured sandy soils, but also where highly stable latosols dominate. More importantly, these areas were frequently affected by fire over the study period. This finding suggests that the combination of unsustainable traditional land management practices, such as fire, the replacement of forest by pasture, and anthropic activities such as inadequate road planning, are the main factor that trigger degradation processes in this Brazilian region. The study results are important for decision makers for defining investment priorities for conservation and for the recovery of degraded areas. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Metastasizing Malignant Melanoma Following Laser Therapy of a Pigmented Mole
T2  - AKTUELLE DERMATOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - A 21-year-old female patient had a pigmented mole on her shoulder for years, which was removed by a dermatologist by laser surgery. One year later, a pigmentation was observed at the lasered spot. Suspecting a malignant melanoma, the lesion was excised by another dermatologist; the dermatopathological workup confirmed an ulcerated malignant melanoma, Clark level IV, max. tumour thickness according to Breslow 2.4mm. After a sentinel lymph node biopsy of the axilla had been initially unremarkable, the patient presented after a few months with jaw pain, revealing an osteolytic metastasis in the mandible. Further staging showed multiple pulmonary, hepatic, mediastinal and other osseous metastases. Under a therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib, after a brief improvement, an uncontrollable cerebral oedema occurred leading to the death of the patient.In view of the tragic course of the disease, the question arises as to the compatibility of primary laser therapy of pigmented moles with the dermatological specialist standard. Risks associated with laser therapy of melanocytic nevus cell nevi include the possible misdiagnosis of a malignant melanoma as a nevus, which cannot be examined dermatohistologically after laser therapy due to the destructive procedure, the possibly incomplete removal of nevus cells, which may subsequently show malignant transformation, and difficulties in clinical follow-up of a lesion after laser treatment. Dysplastic naevi should therefore not be removed destructively with laser therapy; guidelines also advise against laser treatment of melanocytic naevi and recommend that, if a patient's request for laser therapy of the lesions should be followed, at least a punch biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of a benign lesion. Failure to perform this recommended diagnostic procedure might constitute a diagnostic error with the possible consequence of a reversal of the burden of proof.

TI  - Axillary response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with advanced nodal disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients with positive nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has increased. We examine axillary response rates after NAC in patients with clinical N2-3 disease to determine whether SLNB should be considered.Methods Breast cancer patients with clinical N2-3 (AJCC 7th Edition) disease who received NAC followed by surgery were selected from our institutional tumor registry (2009-2018). Axillary response rates were assessed.Results Ninety-nine patients with 100 breast cancers were identified: 59 N2 (59.0%) and 41 (41.0%) N3 disease; 82 (82.0%) treated with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and 18 (18.0%) SLNB. The majority (99.0%) received multiagent NAC. In patients undergoing ALND, cCR was observed in 20/82 patients (24.4%), pathologic complete response (pCR) in 15 patients (18.3%), and axillary pCR in 17 patients (20.7%). In patients with a cCR, pCR was identified in 60.0% and was most common in HER2+ patients (34.6%).Conclusion In this analysis of patients with clinical N2-3 disease receiving NAC, 79.3% of patients had residual nodal disease at surgery. However, 60.0% of patients with a cCR also had a pCR. This provides the foundation to consider evaluating SLNB and less extensive axillary surgery in this select group.

TI  - Intracellular interferon signalling pathways as potential regulators of covalently closed circular DNA in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is still a major global health threat as 250 million people worldwide continue to be chronically infected with the virus. While patients may be treated with nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, this only suppresses HBV titre to sub-detection levels without eliminating the persistent HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) genome. As a result, HBV infection cannot be cured, and the virus reactivates when conditions are favorable. Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines known to induce powerful antiviral mechanisms that clear viruses from infected cells. They have been shown to induce cccDNA clearance, but their use in the treatment of HBV infection is limited as HBV-targeting immune cells are exhausted and HBV has evolved multiple mechanisms to evade and suppress IFN signalling. Thus, to fully utilize IFN-mediated intracellular mechanisms to effectively eliminate HBV, instead of direct IFN administration, novel strategies to sustain IFN-mediated anti-cccDNA and antiviral mechanisms need to be developed. This review will consolidate what is known about how IFNs act to achieve its intracellular antiviral effects and highlight the critical interferon-stimulated gene targets and effector mechanisms with potent anti-cccDNA functions. These include cccDNA degradation by APOBECs and cccDNA silencing and transcription repression by epigenetic modifications. In addition, the mechanisms that HBV employs to disrupt IFN signalling will be discussed. Drugs that have been developed or are in the pipeline for components of the IFN signalling pathway and HBV targets that detract IFN signalling mechanisms will also be identified and discussed for utility in the treatment of HBV infections. Together, these will provide useful insights into design strategies that specifically target cccDNA for the eradication of HBV.

TI  - A comparative study between the incidence and epidemiological features of Influenza-Like Illness and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Italian epicenter (Lombardy)
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In Lombardy, the influenza surveillance system relies on sentinel physicians that weekly report data on the number of Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) and a part of them also collect nasopharyngeal samples for virologic analyses. This study aims at comparing the ILI incidence of 2019?2020 influenza season with the incidence of COVID-19 cases in order to better understand the current epidemic and to evaluate whether the implementation of ILI surveillance system could succeed in early detection and monitoring of COVID-19 diffusion. Methods: The distribution of ILI cases in the seasons 2017?2018, 2018?2019 and 2019?2020 was taken in consideration and the curve trends were compared and analyzed according to geographical areas, age groups and time differences. Results: The curve trends presented a similar pattern up to the 9th week; in fact, a reduction in the ILI incidence rate was observed in the 2017?2018 and 2018?2019 season but in the 2019?2020 an increase in the reported ILI emerged. The relation between the numbers reported by 2019?2020 ILI surveillance and those reported for COVID-19 is supported by the curve trends, the correspondence between age groups, the correspondence by geographical location, and also by the results of the nasopharyngeal swab tests performed. Discussion: The influenza surveillance system is an effective tool for early detection of COVID-19. It may provide timely and high-quality data evaluating the SARS-CoV-2 burden among population with ILI. Implementation of the system has to be prioritized in order to identify any future novel respiratory pathogen with pandemic potential. ? 2021 The Authors.

TI  - ENSO feedback drives variations in dieback at a marginal mangrove site
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean-atmosphere climatic interactions, such as those resulting from El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are known to influence sea level, sea surface temperature, air temperature, and rainfall in the western Pacific region, through to the north-west Australian Ningaloo coast. Mangroves are ecologically important refuges for biodiversity and a rich store of blue carbon. Locations such as the study site (Mangrove Bay, a World Heritage Site within Ningaloo Marine Park and Cape Range National Park) are at the aridity range-limit which means trees are small in stature, forests small in area, and are potentially susceptible to climate variability such as ENSO that brings lower sea level and higher temperature. Here we explore the relationship between mangrove dieback, and canopy condition with climatic variables and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)-a measure of ENSO intensity, through remote sensing classification of Landsat satellite missions across a 29 year period at a north-west Australian site. We find that the SOI, and seasonal mean minimum temperature are strongly correlated to mangrove green canopy (as indicator of live canopy) area. This understanding of climate variations and mangrove temporal heterogeneity (patterns of abundance and condition) highlights the sensitivity and dynamics of this mangrove forest and recommends further research in other arid and semi-arid tropical regions at mangrove range-limits to ascertain the extent of this relationship.

TI  - Ordering the city: revolution, modernity and road renaming in Shanghai, 1949-1966
T2  - URBAN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 1949 and 1966, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-led municipal government of Shanghai renamed more than one in seven of the city's roads. Renaming was an important marker of revolutionary change in China's largest and most foreign-influenced city. Road renaming in socialist China has been commonly understood to have been extensive. This article argues, however, that the nature and extent of renaming in socialist Shanghai was less dramatic than has been assumed. It demonstrates that renaming was not simply an iconoclastic process, but rather involved the pragmatic weighing of symbolic change against potential disruption. Further, it contends that renaming was driven by a desire to order the city, in line with the CCP's modernist worldview.

T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important environmental problems in recent years in the Middle East including Iran is the dust storm events. The main goal of this research was to conduct statistical analyses to identify the dusty days with visibility to less than 1 km. This study also dealt with the recognition of sources of this phenomenon and the route for dusts to enter Isfahan Province. In this study, data were collected for a 20-year period (1994-2013) including daily dust data at the ground stations, brightness temperature at wavelengths of 11 mu m and 12 mu m, and GDAS data for tracking the dust particle route in HYSPLIT software. Naein and Airport stations with frequencies of 920 and 919 days of dust (respectively) were identified as two critical centers of dust in Isfahan province. The spring season had the highest number of days with dust. Also, the highest and lowest frequencies of this event were observed in April-May-June and December-January, respectively. The border area between Iraq and Syria, west and southwest of Iraq, was the main source of the dust transported to Isfahan. Thermodynamic conditions of atmosphere using the Skew-T diagrams were stable during the dust events in the study area.

TI  - CNT-based tapered optical fiber for ethanol remote sensing over 3-km optical fiber
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T
M3  - Article
AB  - Certain organic liquids like ethanol in water are considered hazardous and have an enormous environmental impact since it is toxic and classified as class I flammable liquids. Remote sensing with complex sensors is a common technique for detecting and tracking spillages of hazardous spillages. Most of the applied remote sensing methods suffer from location and control issues that force the user to be at the exact sensing spot during operation. The present work introduces a simple and highly sensitive tapered multimode optical fiber (TMOF) sensor coated with carbon nanotubes (CNT) for flammable liquids remote sensing applications. The new proposed sensor ability to transfer signals to a remote data collection center of about 3 km from the sensor location was investigated. Ethanol was utilized as the index solution to be tested in the present work. The proposed sensor was attached to 3 km multimode silica optical fiber and characterized towards different concentrations of ethanol in de-ionized water at room temperature. Various characterization techniques have investigated the detailed structural properties of the sensing layer. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed remote sensor exhibits rapid response with recovery times of 8.7 s and 18 s, respectively, and relative absorbance of 26% upon exposure to 100% ethanol. The sensor attains an overall sensitivity of 1.3/vol% towards low ethanol concentrations in water (0.01-0.5%). Besides, the optical sensor manifests outstanding repeatability when exposed to another cycle of ethanol with concentrations of 20% and 40% in de-ionized water. The proposed optical remote sensor's superior performance via low cost and simple techniques indicates its high efficiency for ethanol detection in various industrial applications.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Effect of Land Use Change on Gully Erosion Density in the Black Soil Region of Northeast China From 1965 to 2015: A Case Study of the Kedong County
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Kedong County is typical of the black soil region of northeast China in being highly susceptible to accelerated soil erosion by gullying. Using data sourced from Corona satellite imagery for 1965, SPOT5 for 2005 and GF-1 for 2015, the spatial distribution of gullies in the research area was mapped. Land use data for 1965, 2005, and 2015 were obtained from the topographic map of 1954, and from Landsat images for 2005 and 2015. Over the last 50 years, the extent of gully erosion in the study area has increased markedly, most notably on cultivated land, while gully density rose from 2,756.16 m(2)/km(2) to 14,294.19 m(2)/km(2). Cultivating land on slopes, especially on slopes greater than similar to 4 degrees, may rapidly aggravate gully erosion. The greatest increases in gully density occurred in situations when cultivated land and other/degraded land were transformed, which gully erosion density increased by 49,526.69 m(2)/km(2). Other/degraded land is the most vulnerable land in the study area, with the highest gully erosion density. In these cases, gully density initially increases and, although the "Grain for Green" project has been implemented, gully erosion density has not always declined in the recent past.

TI  - First record of plastic debris in the stomach of a hooded seal pup from the Greenland Sea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic debris is globally found around the world and the remote Arctic is no exception. Arctic true seals are sentinel species of marine pollution and represent the link between marine food webs and Arctic apex predators like polar bears and humans. With regard to true seals, ingested macroplastics have never been reported in an Arctic species. We harvested 10 harp seals Pagophilus groenlandicus and 8 hooded seals Cystophora cristata from the breeding grounds in the pack ice of the Greenland Sea. The digestive tract was inspected exclusively for the presence of macroplastics (>5 mm). Two pieces of single-use plastic were found in the stomach of a weaned hooded seal pup. This study indicates that young Arctic marine predators may ingest macroplastics, and therefore may be at risk during their early stages of life due to human caused plastic pollution even in the remote Arctic pack ice.

TI  - Tree hollow densities reduced by frequent late dry-season wildfires in threatened Gouldian finch (<i>Erythrura gouldiae</i>) breeding habitat
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Tree hollows are a key habitat resource for hollow-nesting species, including the northern Australian Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae). Certain fire and disturbance regimes limit tree hollow availability in the northern Australian savannas.Aims. This study investigated the influence of fire regime and vegetation structure on the density of tree hollows at Gouldian finch breeding sites.Methods. Fire scars were mapped across breeding sites by using LANDSAT images. Vegetation plots within sites were spatially stratified according to three fire-regime attributes, namely, fire frequency, late dry-season wildfire frequency and time since the last fire. Tree hollow and vegetation structural attributes were measured at each vegetation plot. We modelled the relationship among hollow density, fire and vegetation attributes by using general linear mixed models with site as the random factor.Key results. We found that the highest tree-hollow density was found at plots with high eucalypt tree density and cover and with the lowest frequency of late dry-season wildfires (<1 wildfire over 5 years). Tree-hollow density declined after >2 years without fire. Hollow density was not directly related to total fire frequency.Conclusions. This study adds to previous work on grass seed resources in highlighting the importance of fire in Gouldian finch ecology. This study particularly highlighted the importance of reducing the impacts of high-intensity late dry-season wildfires because of their negative impacts on tree-hollow density, which is a key resource for breeding Gouldian finches.

TI  - Malignant adnexal tumour of the shoulder-a rare case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant adnexal tumours are a very rare and highly aggressive primary skin neoplasms. Among them, malignant hidradenocarcinoma is a particularly aggressive tumour that arises from the intradermal duct of eccrine sweat glands. It more commonly arises de novo and rarely from a pre-existing hidradenoma. It is an aggressive tumour with regional lymph nodal and distant visceral metastasis. The prognosis is poor with a 5-year survival rate of 30%. Here, we present a 48-year-old female who came with a swelling over the left shoulder. On examination, it appeared to be chronic sebaceous cyst. The patient underwent wide local excision and the specimen was diagnosed as malignant nodular hidradenocarcinoma. Subsequent re-excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed and margins were found to be microscopically negative for tumour. Based on the available literature wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy appear to be the most common initial treatment plans.

TI  - Responses of phytoplankton community structure and association to variability in environmental drivers in a tropical coastal lagoon
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and seasonal heterogeneity in phytoplankton communities are governed by many biotic and abiotic drivers. However, the identification of long-term spatial and temporal trends in abiotic drivers, and their interdependencies with the phytoplankton communities' structure is understudied in tropical brackish coastal lagoons. We examined phytoplankton communities' spatiotemporal dynamics from a 5-year dataset (n = 780) collected from 13 sampling stations in Chilika Lagoon, India, where the salinity gradient defined the spatial patterns in environmental variables. Generalized additive models showed a declining trend in phytoplankton biomass, pH, and dissolved PO4 in the lagoon. Hierarchical modelling of species communities revealed that salinity (44.48 +/- 28.19%), water temperature (4.37 +/- 5.65%), and season (4.27 +/- 0.96%) accounted for maximum variation in the phytoplankton composition. Bacillariophyta (Indicator Value (IV): 0.74) and Dinophyta (IV: 0.72) emerged as top indicators for polyhaline regime whereas, Cyanophyta (IV: 0.81), Euglenophyta (IV: 0.79), and Chlorophyta (IV: 0.75) were strong indicators for oligohaline regime. The responses of Dinophyta and Chrysophyta to environmental drivers were much more complex as random effects accounted for similar to 70-75% variation in their abundances. Prorocentrum minimum (IV: 0.52), Gonyaulux sp. (IV: 052), and Alexundrium sp. (IV: 0.51) were potential indicators of P-limitation. Diploneis weissflogii (IV: 0.43), a marine diatom, emerged as a potential indicator of N-limitation. Hierarchical modelling revealed the positive association between Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Euglenophyta whereas, Dinophyta and Chrysophyta showed a negative association with Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Euglenophyta. Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager satellite models predicted the highest and lowest Cyanophyta abundances in northern and southern sectors, respectively, which were in accordance with the near-coincident field-based measurements from the lagoon. This study highlighted the dynamics of phytoplankton communities and their relationships with environmental drivers by separating the signals of habitat filtering and biotic interactions in a monsoon-regulated tropical coastal lagoon.

TI  - Recent HIV infection among pregnant women in the 2017 antenatal sentinel cross-sectional survey, South Africa: Assay-based incidence measurement
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionNew HIV infection during pre-conception and pregnancy is a significant contributor of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in South Africa. This study estimated HIV incidence (defined as new infection within the last one year from the time of the survey which included both new infections occurred during pregnancy or just before pregnancy) among pregnant women and described the characteristics of recently infected pregnant women at national level.MethodsBetween 1 October and 15 November 2017, we conducted a national cross-sectional survey among pregnant women aged 15-49 years old attending antenatal care at 1,595 public facilities. Blood specimens were collected from pregnant women and tested for HIV in a centralised laboratory. Plasma viral load and Limiting Antigen Avidity Enzyme Immunosorbent Assay (LAg) tests were further performed on HIV positive specimens to differentiate between recent and long-term infections. Recent infection was defined as infection that occurred within one year from the date of collection of blood specimen for the survey. Data on age, age of partner, and marital status were collected through interviews. Women whose specimens were classified as recent by LAg assay and with viral loads >1,000 copies/mL were considered as recently infected. The calculated proportion of HIV positive women with recent infection was adjusted for assay-specific parameters to estimate annual incidence. Survey multinomial logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with being recently infected using HIV negative women as a reference group. Age-disparate relationship was defined as having a partner 5 or more years older.ResultsOf 10,049 HIV positive participants with LAg and viral load data, 1.4% (136) were identified as recently infected. The annual HIV incidence was 1.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-1.7). In multivariable analyses, being single (adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.8-6.2) or cohabiting (aOR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.8-7.7), compared to being married as well as being in an age-disparate relationship among young women (aOR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.0-4.7; reference group: young women (15-24years) whose partners were not 5 years or more older) were associated with higher odds of recent infection.ConclusionsCompared to previous studies among pregnant women, the incidence estimated in this study was substantially lower. However, the UNAIDS target to reduce incidence by 75% by 2020 (which is equivalent to reducing incidence to <1%) has not been met. The implementation of HIV prevention and treatment interventions should be intensified, targeting young women engaged in age-disparate relationship and unmarried women to fast track progress towards the UNAIDS target.

TI  - Performance stability of the MODIS and VIIRS LAI algorithms inferred from analysis of long time series of products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The science teams of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) have been supporting various global climate, biogeochemistry, and energy flux research efforts by producing valuable long-term Leaf Area Index (LAI) products. Although intensive LAI validation studies have been carried out globally, retrieval accuracy has been assessed only over short time spans and product quality is reported as a constant based on the assumption that it is stationary. However, a preliminary evaluation found a time-dependent signal degradation of the MODIS sensors which may cause the uncertainty of the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) product to exceed the preset uncertainty buffer in the retrieval algorithm and result in MODIS LAI quality variation and time-series inconsistency with VIIRS LAI. Therefore, to ensure the reliability of trend-detection studies and to answer the critical question of whether the algorithm configuration is still suitable for the uncertainty level of present BRF product, there is a need for a more comprehensive investigation regarding the performance stability of LAI retrieval algorithm due to model uncertainty and input uncertainties. This paper reports analyses of inter-annual stability and trends of LAI uncertainties (inferred from product quality flag rather than ground-based validation) as well as LAI magnitudes using multi-year (MODIS: 2001-2019, VIIRS: 2013-2019) and multi-site (445 sites) datasets. We found that the quality metrics of the two products are consistent across different biome types and LAI values (R2 ranged from 0.88 to 0.99). In the 19-year MODIS period, we found a significant increasing trend in LAI magnitudes (4.5%/ decade) which agrees with previous reports, while there was no significant trend in product quality. Moreover, quality metrics showed much smaller inter-annual variations than LAI values, which confirms the performance stability of retrieval algorithms and suggests that the configuration of MODIS algorithm is still compatible with the uncertainty of algorithm inputs. Additionally, this study provides support to the "Greening Asia" studies by eliminating the possibility that the "greening" could be attributed to artificial trends caused by sensor degradation. We also found very small inter-annual variations in atmospheric conditions (e.g., cloud and aerosols), which further assures that the performance stability of retrieval algorithm. Overall, our results demonstrate the robustness of the retrieval algorithm in the presence of changes in input uncertainties. The temporal stability of the algorithm performance indirectly strengthen the confidence in the continuous use of MODIS LAI products either independently or in combination with its successor - VIIRS LAI - to study global and regional vegetation dynamics

TI  - Variations of groundwater storage in different basins of China over recent decades
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important freshwater resource, groundwater is of great significance to agriculture, industry, and daily life. The investigation of groundwater storage (GWS) in different regions of China is critical for water resource management and conservation. However, previous studies used different methods and data to monitor GWS in different regions of China, which made their results difficult to compare and cross validate. Here, we used a unified method by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and global models to study the variations of GWS in 10 major basins in China from April 2002 to December 2016. Results showed that GWS in the i) Songhua River basin (SRB), Liao River basin (LRB), Haihe River basin (HRB), Yellow River basin (YRB), Huaihe River basin (HHRB), and southeast basin (SEB) exhibited decreasing trends, ii) Yangtze River basin (YZRB) and Pearl River basin (PRB) presented increasing trends, and iii) southwest basin (SWB) and continental basin (CB) displayed both decreasing and increasing trends during the study period. These results were validated by comparing them with a large number of previous studies, which revealed that they were accurate and reliable. Comparing with the climate data and bulletin data, the analysis of causes for these trends indicated that drought and irrigation water-use led to a decline in GWS in several basins of northern China. The decreasing trend of GWS in the SEB was related to water use for production, whereas groundwater recharge from precipitation drove the increasing trends of GWS in the YZRB and PRB. In contrast, the wide geographical areas and complex factors of the SWB and CB led to the increasing-decreasing trends of GWS. This study enriches the GWS for China over the past decade, especially for SEB, PRB, and CB with rare GWS information. It will be helpful for the country's groundwater resource management and systematic water conservation.

TI  - A practical reanalysis data and thermal infrared remote sensing data merging (RTM) method for reconstruction of a 1-km all-weather land surface temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An all-weather land surface temperature (LST) dataset at moderate to high spatial resolutions (e.g. 1 km) has been in urgent need, especially in areas frequently covered in clouds (i.e. the Tibetan Plateau). Merging satellite thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave (PMW) observations is a widely-adopted approach to derive such LST datasets, whereas the swath gap of the PMW data leads to considerable data deficiency or low reliability in the merged LST, especially at the low-mid latitudes. Fortunately, reanalyzed data provides the spatiotemporally continuous LST and thus, is promising to be merged with TIR data for reconstructing the all-weather LST without this issue. However, few studies along this direction have been reported. In this context, based on the decomposition model of LST time series, this study proposes a novel reanalysis and thermal infrared remote sensing data merging (RTM) method to reconstruct the 1-km all-weather LST. The method was applied to merge Aqua/ Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Global/China Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS/CLDAS) data over the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding area. Results show that the RTM LST has RMSEs of 2.03-3.98 K and coefficients of determination of 0.82-0.93 under all-weather conditions when validated against the ground measured LST. Besides, from comparison between RTM LST and current existing PMW-TIR merged LST, it is found the former LST efficiently outperforms the latter one in terms of accuracy and image quality, especially over the MW swath gap-covered area. In addition, compared to the MODIS-CLDAS merged all-weather LST based on the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), the two LSTs have comparable accuracy while the RTM LST has higher spatial completeness. The method is promising for generating a long-term all-weather LST record at moderate to high spatiotemporal resolutions at large scales, which would be beneficial to associated studies and applications.

TI  - Chlorophyll-a Retrieval From Sentinel-2 Images Using Convolutional Neural Network Regression
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we explore harnessing the power of regression-oriented convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the assessment of surface water quality from remote sensing images. They are used to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration of Lake Balik (Turkey), through multispectral Sentinel-2 images. The proposed approach is tested with a data set (n=320) of in situ Chl-a measurements acquired during 2017-2019. We investigate both 2-D and 3-D convolution strategies and report the results of a series of rigorous validation experiments, aiming to measure both spatial, short-term, and long-term temporal generalization performance, thus highlighting validation misconduct encountered often in the state-of-the-art. The regression-oriented CNNs outperform various alternatives, in all generalization scenarios with performances reaching 0.95, 0.93, and 0.76 in terms of R-2, respectively. It has been deployed as an online service producing regularly water quality maps for the lake under study as the first of its kind in Turkey.

TI  - Constant-level spatio-temporal integrated search algorithm for repeating sun-synchronous orbit satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Metadata information and catalogue services are major ways of making satellite images findable and accessible. Spatio-temporal indexing is the key to ensuring efficient searches. Because spatial information and temporal information are usually independently maintained and indexed, the image retrieval process has to include two search steps: a spatial query and a temporal query. As most Earth Observation satellites are specially designed to have repeating sun-synchronous orbits (RSSO), this type of satellite data has a close correlation between its spatial coverage and temporal coverage information. In this paper, an integrated spatio-temporal indexing mechanism is proposed for RSSO satellites. The spatio-temporal Look-Up Table (st-LUT) that serves as the index reflects the coupled correlation between the spatial and temporal coverage information within one orbit revisiting cycle. Image retrieval algorithms are designed based on the st-LUT. In this study, Landsat 8 data are used to demonstrate the proposed indexing mechanism and search algorithms. Because this new method only focuses on the changes in the spatial and temporal information over time in one orbit revisiting cycle, the search space is limited to the constant level. This method provides an effective RSSO satellite data retrieval capability for dealing with the challenges of rapidly growing data volumes.

TI  - Ecological resilience in tropical Andean lakes: A paleolimnological perspective
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about whether changes in lake ecosystem structure over the past 150 years are unprecedented when considering longer timescales. Similarly, research linking environmental stressors to lake ecological resilience has traditionally focused on a few sentinel sites, hindering the study of spatially synchronous changes across large areas. Here, we studied signatures of paleolimnological resilience by tracking change in diatom community composition over the last 2000 years in four Ecuadorian Andean lakes with contrasting ecoregions. We focused on climate and anthropogenic change, and the type of biological responses that these changes induced: gradual, elastic, or threshold. We combined multivariate ordination techniques with nonlinear time-series methods (hierarchical generalized additive models) to characterize trajectories of community responses in each lake, and coherence in such trajectories across lakes. We hypothesized that remote, high-elevation lakes would exhibit synchronous trends due to their shared climatic constraints, whereas lower elevation lakes would show less synchronous trends as a consequence of human density and land-cover alteration. We found that gradual and elastic responses dominated. Threshold-type responses, or regime shifts, were only detected in the less remote lake, after a long period of gradual and elastic changes. Unexpected synchrony was observed in diatom assemblages from geographically distant and human-impacted lakes, whereas lakes under similar broad-scale environmental factors (climate and ecoregion) showed asynchronous community trajectories over time. Our results reveal a complex ecological history and indicate that Andean lakes in Ecuador can gradually adapt and recover from a myriad of disturbances, exhibiting resilience over century to millennial timescales.

TI  - Secondary School Students' Reasoning About Science and Personhood
T2  - SCIENCE & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific advances, particularly in evolutionary biology, genetics, neuroscience and artificial intelligence, present many challenges to religious and popular notions of personhood. This paper reports the first large-scale study on students' beliefs about the interactions between science and widely held beliefs about personhood. The paper presents findings from a questionnaire survey (n = 530) administered to English secondary school students (age 15-16) in which their beliefs and concepts regarding personhood and the position of science were investigated. The survey was motivated in part by an interview study and a previous, smaller survey which revealed that many students struggle to reconcile their beliefs with what they suppose science to say and also that some have reluctantly dismissed the soul as a 'nice story' which is incompatible with scientific facts. The results from this larger-scale survey indicate that a majority of the students believe in some form of soul. Even so, and regardless of whether or not they identified themselves as religious, most students expressed a belief that human persons cannot be fully explained scientifically, a position that some students perceived as a partial rejection of what it means to hold a scientific worldview.

TI  - Resource Stability and Federal Agency Performance
T2  - AMERICAN REVIEW OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Resources are essential for organizations to cope with challenges and to achieve their desirable outcomes. Although much scholarly attention has been paid to the type or level of resources allocated or used to enhance organizational effectiveness, relatively little effort has been made to analyze whether and how resource changes influence organizational performance. Considering today's unstable fiscal climate, this study focuses on how government agencies respond to their budget fluctuations-both gains and cuts-and their distinctive impact on agency performance. Using data from the Performance and Accountability Reports from FY 2004 through FY 2014, we analyze the effect of budgetary resource changes on organizational performance in 52 U.S. federal agencies. Findings show that agency effectiveness is significantly influenced by budget changes. In particular, we find an asymmetric relationship between budgetary resource changes and organizational performance. It appears that budget cuts are not associated with changes in agency performance, whereas budgetary resource gains are associated with dampened agency effectiveness. Ultimately, this study provides insights into public organizations' resilience and calls for considering change management perspectives when exploring resource-performance linkages.

TI  - Estimating Signal-to-Clutter Ratio of InSAR Corner Reflectors From SAR Time Series
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR) of a radar point target, such as a corner reflector, is an essential step for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry and positioning, as it influences the phase measurement variance as well as the absolute positioning precision. The standard method to estimate the SCR of a point target relies on the debatable assumption of spatial ergodicity, using the clutter of the surrounding as representative of the clutter at the point target. Here, we estimate the SCR of a corner reflector using a time series of SAR measurements, i.e.,\ assuming temporal ergodicity. This assumption is often more realistic, particularly in a complex environment, in the presence of other point scatterers, and for small-sized reflectors. Empirical results on a corner reflector network, using Sentinel-1 SAR measurements, show that the temporal method yields a less biased and more precise estimate of the average SCR. A second experiment shows that the InSAR phase variance as well as positioning precision, predicted using SCR estimated by the temporal estimation method, is closer to the truth.

TI  - Assessing changes of carbon stock in dipterocarp forest due to hydro-electric dam construction in Malaysia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are among the leading global concerns, as they could reduce the carbon sink and sequestration potential of the forest. The impoundment of Kenyir River, Hulu Terengganu, Malaysia, in 1985 due to the development of hydropower station has created a large area of water bodies following clearance of forested land. This study assessed the loss of forest carbon due to these activities within the period of 37 years, between 1972 and 2019. The study area consisted of Kenyir Lake catchment area, which consisted mainly of forests and the great Kenyir Lake. Remote sensing datasets have been used in this analysis. Satellite images from Landsat 1-5 MSS and Landsat 8 OLI/TRIS that were acquired between the years 1972 and 2019 were used to classify land uses in the entire landscape of Kenyir Lake catchment. Support vector machine (SVM) was adapted to generate the land-use classification map in the study area. The results show that the total study area includes 278,179 ha and forest covers dominated the area for before and after the impoundment of Kenyir Lake. The assessed loss of carbon between the years 1972 and 2019 was around 8.6 million Mg C with an annual rate of 0.36%. The main single cause attributing to the forest loss was due to clearing of forest for hydro-electric dam construction. However, the remaining forests surrounding the study area are still able to sequester carbon at a considerable rate and thus balance the carbon dynamics within the landscapes. The results highlight that carbon sequestration scenario in Kenyir Lake catchment area shows the potential of the carbon sink in the study area are acceptable with only 17% reduction of sequestration ability. The landscape of the study area is considered as highly vegetated area despite changes due to dam construction.

TI  - Optimal Spatiotemporal Scales to Aggregate Satellite Ocean Color Data for Nearshore Reefs and Tropical Coastal Waters: Two Case Studies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed ocean color data are useful for monitoring water quality in coastal environments. However, moderate resolution (hundreds of meters to a few kilometers) satellite data are underutilized in these environments because of frequent data gaps from cloud cover and algorithm complexities in shallow waters. Aggregating satellite data over larger space and time scales is a common method to reduce data gaps and generate a more complete time series, but potentially smooths out the small-scale, episodic changes in water quality that can have ecological influences. By comparing aggregated satellite estimates of K-d(490) with related in-water measurements, we can understand the extent to which aggregation methods are viable for filling gaps while being able to characterize ecologically relevant water quality conditions. In this study, we tested a combination of six spatial and seven temporal scales for aggregating data from the VIIRS instrument at several coral reef locations in Maui, Hawai'i and Puerto Rico and compared these with in situ measurements of K-d(490) and turbidity. In Maui, we found that the median value of a 5-pixels, 7-days spatiotemporal cube of satellite data yielded a robust result capable of differentiating observations across small space and time domains and had the best correlation among spatiotemporal cubes when compared with in situ K-d(490) across 11 nearshore sites (R-2 = 0.84). We also found long-term averages (i.e., chronic condition) of VIIRS data using this aggregation method follow a similar spatial pattern to onshore turbidity measurements along the Maui coast over a three-year period. In Puerto Rico, we found that the median of a 13-pixels, 13-days spatiotemporal cube of satellite data yielded the best overall result with an R-2 = 0.54 when compared with in situ K-d(490) measurements for one nearshore site with measurement dates spanning 2016-2019. As spatiotemporal cubes of different dimensions yielded optimum results in the two locations, we recommend local analysis of spatial and temporal optima when applying this technique elsewhere. The use of satellite data and in situ water quality measurements provide complementary information, each enhancing understanding of the issues affecting coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs, and the success of management efforts.

TI  - Intra-mammary lymph nodes, an overlooked breast cancer prognostic tool?
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDue to the high variability of incidence and prevalence of intra-mammary lymph nodes (IMLNs), they might be overlooked during clinical and radiological examinations. Properly characterizing pathological IMLNs and detecting the factors that might influence their prevalence in different stages of breast cancer might aid in proper therapeutic decision-making and could be of possible prognostic value.MethodsMedical records were reviewed for all breast cancer patients treated at the National Cancer Institute of Cairo University between 2013 and 2019. Radiological, pathological, and surgical data were studied.ResultsIntra-mammary lymph nodes were described in the final pathology reports of 100 patients. Five cases had benign breast lesion. Three cases had phyllodes tumors and two cases had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). All ten cases were excluded. The remaining 90 cases all had invasive breast cancer and were divided into two groups: one group for patients with malignant IMLNs (48) and another for patients with benign IMLNs (42). Pathological features of the malignant IMLN group included larger mean tumor size in pathology (4.7cm), larger mean size of the IMLN in pathology (1.7cm), higher incidence of lympho-vascular invasion (65.9%), and higher rate of extracapsular extension in axillary lymph nodes (57.4%). In addition, the pathological N stage was significantly higher in the malignant IMLN group.ConclusionClinicians frequently overlook intra-mammary lymph nodes. More effort should be performed to detect them during preoperative imaging and during pathological processing of specimens. A suspicious IMLN should undergo a percutaneous biopsy. Malignant IMLNs are associated with advanced pathological features and should be removed during surgery.

TI  - Mapping Spatial Distribution and Biomass of Intertidal <i>Ulva</i> Blooms Using Machine Learning and Earth Observation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Opportunistic macroalgal blooms have been used for the assessment of the ecological status of coastal and estuarine areas in Europe. The use of earth observation (EO) data sets to map green algal cover based on a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was explored. Scenes from Sentinel-2A/B, Landsat-5, and Landsat-8 missions were processed for eight different Irish estuaries of moderate, poor, and bad ecological status using European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) classification for transitional water bodies. Images acquired during low-tide conditions from 2010 to 2018 within 18 days of field surveys were considered. The estimates of percentage coverage obtained from different EO data sources and field surveys were significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.94) with Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.69 +/- 0.13. The results showed that the NDVI technique could be successfully applied to map the coverage of the blooms and to monitor estuarine areas in conjunction with other monitoring activities that involve field sampling and surveys. The combination of wide-spread cloud-coverage and high-tide conditions provided additional constraints during the image selection. The findings showed that both Sentinel-2 and Landsat scenes could be utilized to estimate bloom coverage. Moreover, Landsat, because of its legacy program, can be utilized to reconstruct the blooms using historical archival data. Considering the importance of biomass for understanding the severity of algal accumulations, an artificial neural networks (ANN) model was trained using the in situ historical biomass samples and the combination of radar backscatter (Sentinel-1) and optical reflectance in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions (Sentinel-2) to predict the biomass quantity. The ANN model based on multispectral imagery was suitable to estimate biomass quantity (R-2 = 0.74). The model performance could be improved with the addition of more training samples. The developed methodology can be applied in other areas experiencing macroalgal blooms in a simple, cost-effective, and efficient way. The study has demonstrated that both the NDVI-based technique to map spatial coverage of macroalgal blooms and the ANN-based model to compute biomass have the potential to become an effective complementary tool for monitoring macroalgal blooms where the existing monitoring efforts can leverage the benefits of EO data sets.

TI  - Declining greenness in Arctic-boreal lakes
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The highest concentration of the world's lakes are found in Arcticboreal regions [C. Verpoorter, T. Kutser, D. A. Seekell, L. J. Tranvik, Geophys. Res. Lett. 41, 6396-6402 (2014)], and consequently are undergoing the most rapid warming [J. E. Overland et al., Arctic Report Card (2018)]. However, the ecological response of Arcticboreal lakes to warming remains highly uncertain. Historical trends in lake color from remote sensing observations can provide insights into changing lake ecology, yet have not been examined at the panArctic scale. Here, we analyze time series of 30-m Landsat growing season composites to quantify trends in lake greenness for >4 x 10(5) waterbodies in boreal and Arctic western North America. We find lake greenness declined overall by 15% from the first to the last decade of analysis within the 6.3 x 10(6)-km(2) study region but with significant spatial variability. Greening declines were more likely to be found in areas also undergoing increases in air temperature and precipitation. These findings support the hypothesis that warming has increased connectivity between lakes and the land surface [A. Bring et al., J. Geophys. Res. Biogeosciences 121, 621-649 (2016)], with implications for lake carbon cycling and energy budgets. Our study provides spatially explicit information linking climate to panArctic lake color changes, a finding that will help target future ecological monitoring in remote yet rapidly changing regions.

TI  - Shrub decline and expansion of wetland vegetation revealed by very high resolution land cover change detection in the Siberian lowland tundra
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation change, permafrost degradation and their interactions affect greenhouse gas fluxes, hydrology and surface energy balance in Arctic ecosystems. The Arctic shows an overall "greening" trend (i.e. increased plant biomass and productivity) attributed to expansion of shrub vegetation. However, Arctic shrub dynamics show strong spatial variability and locally "browning" may be observed. Mechanistic understanding of greening and browning trends is necessary to accurately assess the response of Arctic vegetation to a changing climate. In this context, the Siberian Arctic is an understudied region. Between 2010 and 2019, increased browning (as derived from the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index) was observed in the Eastern Siberian Indigirka Lowlands. To support interpretation of local greening and browning dynamics, we quantified changes in land cover and transition probabilities in a representative tundra site in the Indigirka Lowlands using a timeseries of three very high resolution (VHR) (0.5 m) satellite images acquired between 2010 and 2019. Using spatiotemporal Potts model regularization, we substantially reduced classification errors related to optical and phenological inconsistencies in the image material. VHR images show that recent browning was associated with declines in shrub, lichen and tussock vegetation and increases in open water, sedge and especially Sphagnum vegetation. Observed formation and expansion of small open water bodies in shrub dominated vegetation suggests abrupt thaw of ice-rich permafrost. Transitions from open water to sedge and Sphagnum, indicate aquatic succession upon disturbance. The overall shift towards open water and wetland vegetation suggests a wetting trend, likely associated with permafrost degradation. Landsat data confirmed widespread expansion of surface water throughout the Indigirka Lowlands. However, the increase in the area of small water bodies observed in VHR data was not visible in Landsat-derived surface water data, which suggests that VHR data is essential for early detection of small-scale disturbances and associated vegetation change in permafrost ecosystems.

TI  - Exploring the relationships between tree canopy cover and socioeconomic characteristics in tropical urban systems: The case of Santo Domingo, Dominican
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the distribution of urban tree canopy cover and its relationship with socioeconomic characteristics is critical for informing urban planning and ecological research. However, most knowledge on this topic comes from studies in high-income countries (e.g., North America), and thus, little is known for other cultural, ecological, and political contexts. Here, we derived a high-spatial resolution (1.2 m) land-use/land-cover map for the tropical city of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and examined how socioeconomic characteristics (i.e., population density, socioeconomic status, detached homes, homeownership, and householder's age) relate to residential tree canopy cover at the neighborhood scale. We found that previous theory developed in North American cities applied only partially to Santo Domingo. Of the five socioeconomic variables examined, only two showed relationships with tree canopy consistent with previous findings from North American cities. In particular, socioeconomic status, one of the better-studied correlates of urban tree canopy, was not positively associated with tree canopy cover. At the same time, our new land-use/land-cover map revealed the presence of important areas with low levels of tree canopy cover, which may require additional attention by city planners. Our study reinforces the value of high-spatial resolution satellite data for examining urban areas, and highlights the need for further understanding the characteristics related to the distribution of tree canopy cover outside North America.

TI  - Research Priorities for Coastal Geoscience and Engineering: A Collaborative Exercise in Priority Setting From Australia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the result of a collaborative priority setting exercise to identify emerging issues and priorities in coastal geoscience and engineering (CGE). We use a ranking process to quantify the criticality of each priority from the perspective of Australian CGE researchers and practitioners. 74 activities were identified across seven categories: Data Collection and Collation, Coastal Dynamics and Processes, Modelling, Engineering Solutions, Coastal Hazards and Climate Change, Communication and Collaboration, and Infrastructure, Innovation, and Funding. We found consistent and unanimous support for the vast majority of priorities identified by the CGE community, with 91% of priorities being allocated a score of >= 3 out of 5 (i.e., above average levels of support) by >= 75% of respondents. Data Collection and Collation priorities received the highest average score, significantly higher than four of the other six categories, with Coastal Hazards and Climate Change the second ranked category and Engineering Solutions the lowest scoring category. Of the 74 priorities identified, 11 received unified and strong support across the CGE community and indicate a critical need for: additional coastal data collection including topographic and bathymetric, hydrodynamic, oceanographic, and remotely sensed data; improved data compilation and access; improved understanding of extreme events and the quantification of future impacts of climate change on nearshore dynamics and coastal development; enhanced quantification of shoreline change and coastal inundation processes; and, additional funding to support CGE research and applications to mitigate and manage coastal hazards. The outcomes of this priority setting exercise can be applied to guide policy development and decision-making in Australia and jurisdictions elsewhere. Further, the research and application needs identified here will contribute to addressing key practical challenges identified at a national level. CGE research plays a critical role in identifying and enabling social, environmental, and economic benefits through the proactive management of coastal hazard impacts and informed planning to mitigate the potential impacts of growing coastal risk, particularly in a changing climate. The prevalence and commonalities of the challenges faced by coastal communities globally due to increasing pressures from coastal hazards in a changing climate suggest that our findings will be applicable to other settings.

TI  - Assessment of Water Quality Along the Southeast Coast of India During COVID-19 Lockdown
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world and has had a devastating impact on both lives and livelihoods in India. The only way to defeat the rapid spread of COVID-19, is to shut down socio-economic activities and to maintain minimal human interaction with the implementation of a lockdown. Such lockdowns have manifested in a pollution curtailment in almost all spheres of the planet, including in marine pollution. Quantifying this decrease in pollution levels enables the scientific community to assess the contribution of anthropogenic (especially non-essential) activities to global/regional pollution levels. This paper aims to study the impact of the stringent lockdown period (phase 1 and 2) on coastal water quality along the Chennai coast of India, by analyzing suspended matter concentration (SPM), a key element of water quality and diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d(490), using LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. LANDSAT-8/OLI, L1TP scenes were subjected to radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction to derive surface reflectance values from raw digital numbers using ACOLITE software and a brief insight has been given for the Dark Spectrum Fitting algorithm used in ACOLITE. SPM concentration decreased by 15.48 and 37.50% in the Chennai and Ennore ports, respectively, due to minimal vessel movement and cargo handling. The stringent lockdown led to the operation of fewer thermal plant units, thus less fly ash was emanated, resulting in a 28.05% reduction in SPM levels over Ennore creek. As industrial and commercial activities subsided, the city's water bodies became clearer than they were just a fortnight prior to the lockdown, with a reduction of 22.26% of SPM in Adyar and 33.97% in Cooum riverine estuaries. Decrease in K-d(490) showed a positive relationship with SPM and thus improved coastal water quality because of the reduction of SPM during this period. The variations in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were studied using National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) data and reduced levels in particulate matter concentration (PM2.5 and PM10) for the Adyar residential area (24.38 and 28.43%) and for the Nungampakkam commercial area (36.09 and 67.18%) were observed. A significant reduction in PM2.5 concentration (45.63%) was observed in the Ennore-Manali Industrial region.

TI  - Remote sensing of inland Sabkha and a study of the salinity and temporal stability for sustainable development: A case study from the West coast of Qatar
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The inland sabkha of the Arabian Gulf is important to study for the occurrence of minerals, rocks, soil salinity, and stability of the sabkha due to the high demand for infrastructure and agriculture development region. This study describes the spectral absorptions of evaporite minerals, discriminates rocks, maps salt crusts, gypsiferous soil flats, and soil salinity, and studies the temporal stability of an inland sabkha of the Dukhan area, west coast of the State of Qatar. This was performed using satellite data of the Hyperion of EO1, ASTER of Terra, and multispectral instrument (MSI) of Sentinel-2. The occurrence of minerals in the area is detected using Hyperion data by the linear spectral unmixing (LSU) method and studied for their spatial distribution. The different geological formations of the sabkha were discriminated by using the VNIR (visible and near-infrared) and SWIR (shortwave infrared) spectral bands from ASTER by principal component analysis (PCA). The image developed by using the principal components (R:PC2, G:PC3, B:PC5) showed the formations in different tones. Salinity of the area was mapped using monthly data of MSI from 2018 to 2020 by normalized difference salinity index (NDSI) (band11-band12)/(band11 + band12). The results of the index displayed the distribution of salinity in the area. Besides, moisture of the area was studied by using the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) (b8-b11)/(b8 + b11) and described the temporal stability of the sabkha. All the results of image analyses were validated through field and laboratory studies. The study of laboratory spectra of evaporite minerals namely gypsum, anhydrite, and halite present in the salt crusts and gypsiferous soil flats showed their unique spectral absorptions in between 1.4-1.5 mu m and 1.9-2.0 mu m whereas, the calcite and dolomite minerals of the carbonate formations exhibited deep absorptions near 2.345 and 2.495 mu m respectively.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - A comparative analysis of Galactic extinction at low Galactic latitudes
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We use near-infrared (J - K) colours of bright 2MASS galaxies, measured within a 7- arcsec-radius aperture, to calibrate the Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis DIRBE/IRAS Galactic extinction map at low Galactic latitudes (vertical bar b vertical bar < 10 degrees). Using 3460 galaxies covering a large range in extinction (up to A(K)= 1(m).15 or E(B - V) similar or equal to 3(m).19), we derive a correction factor f = 0.83 +/- 0.01 by fitting a linear regression to the colour-extinction relation, confirming that the Schlegel et al. maps overestimate the extinction. We argue that the use of only a small range in extinction (e.g., A(K) < 0(m).4) increases the uncertainty in the correction factor and may overestimate it. Our data confirm the Fitzpatrick extinction law for the J- and K-band. We also tested four all-sky extinction maps based on Planck satellite data. All maps require a correction factor as well. In three cases, the application of the respective extinction correction to the galaxy colours results in a reduced scatter in the colour-extinction relation, indicating a more reliable extinction correction. Finally, the large galaxy sample allows an analysis of the calibration of the extinction maps as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude. For all but one extinction map, we find a marked offset between the Galactic Centre and Anticentre region, but not with the dipole of the cosmic microwave background. Based on our analysis, we recommend the use of the GNILC extinction map by Planck Collaboration XLVIII with a correction factor f = 0.86 +/- 0.01.

TI  - Semi-analytical approach to retrieve the chromophoric dissolved organic matter absorption coefficient in non-turbid waters: preliminary application to Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data
T2  - MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset and in situ datasets collected from the East China Sea and Lake Qiandaohu, a novel approach was developed to analytically retrieve the absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)) in non-turbid waters. This approach comprised two parts: (1) a green-red band quasi-analytical algorithm, used to accurately derive the total absorption coefficient (a); and (2) the use of the retrievals from (1) are to semi-analytically retrieve a(CDOM). This approach for partitioning a(CDOM) from a was based on the blue band line height at 443 nm, LH(443), which uses the summed absorption coefficients of phytoplankton and CDOM (a(phc)) at three characteristic wavelengths (412, 443 and 490 nm). This proposed algorithm was then tested and validated using the three datasets. The algorithm was found to perform reasonably well in retrieving a(CDOM), with respective mean R-2 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 0.84 and 42.8%, compared with 0.64 and 72.9% for the empirical model and 0.40 and 66.2% for the extended quasi-analytical algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm was able to retrieve a(CDOM) from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data. One implication for the MERIS satellite data, which exhibit reasonable seasonal variability over the East China Sea, is that it can be used to explore biogeochemical effects on aquatic environments.

TI  - Gardner-associated fibroma of the neck: role of a multidisciplinary evaluation for familial adenomatous polyposis diagnosis
T2  - TUMORI JOURNAL
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Introduction: Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple adenomas in the colon and rectum with a lifetime risk of 80%-100% to develop colorectal cancer if undetected or untreated. Gardner-associated fibroma (GAF) is a rare, benign soft tissue lesion with uncertain pathogenesis. GAF is generally associated with FAP in its clinical variant, called Gardner syndrome (GS). Case Description: A 16-year-old boy with no comorbidities and no significant medical history was referred to the Unit of Hereditary Digestive Tract Tumours, Department of Surgery, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy, for genetic counselling after surgical removal of a right anterior cervical paramedian fibroma. The histopathology on the specimen led to the diagnosis of GAF. He had no family history for colorectal cancer or gastrointestinal polyposis and denied any gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical examination showed a small frontal osteoma and colonoscopy showed the presence of multiple small sessile polyps (>100 polyps, diameter <5 mm) diffusely present on the large bowel. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic germline variant in the APC gene. The predictive genetic test on the patient's parents and sister was negative for the identified APC mutation; therefore, the patient carried an apparent de novo germline mutation. Conclusions: GAF may represent a sentinel sign of FAP, preceding gastrointestinal symptoms and endoscopic findings. A careful multidisciplinary approach is determinant for correct and early diagnosis of FAP.

TI  - Light pollution in India: appraisal of artificial night sky brightness of cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectacular progress of lighting equipment in recent decades has resulted in an enormous increase in outdoor lights and night-sky brightness which is the most noticeable effects of light pollution has increased rapidly in many countries. Any pollution is a consequence of urbanization forces, which correspond to a significant threat to human health and the environment. Despite the increasing awareness and interest, there is a need for quantification of light pollution at a national and local scale. In developing nations like India, the supremacy of basic issues often undermines the new-found urban problems that have the potential of affecting the environment at a larger scale. Light pollution is one such predicament that needs a response. This study intends to mark the fundamental concept of light pollution, its impacts, and develop an atlas of the ten most populated Indian cities following the magnitude of their brightness computed using high-resolution satellite data. It also attempts to relate the degree of brightness of these cities with safety in cities, which is the primary purpose of lighting at night, also taking into account various factors that may impact the night time lighting and safety in urban areas. According to the study, street lights installed in a city exhibit a considerable correlation with the brightness levels of the cities, which may point towards a significant source of light pollution in cities. The paper concludes with a discussion of some best practices in the context of light pollution and the scope for further investigation.

TI  - Integrated water vapour content retrievals from ship-borne GNSS receivers during EUREC<SUP>4</SUP>A
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the framework of the EUREC(4)A (Elucidating the role of clouds-circulation coupling in climate) campaign that took place in January and February 2020, integrated water vapour (IWV) contents were retrieved over the open tropical Atlantic Ocean using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data acquired from three research vessels (R/Vs): R/V Atalante, R/V Maria S. Merian and R/V Meteor. This paper describes the GNSS processing method and compares the GNSS IWV retrievals with IWV estimates from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth reanalysis (ERA5), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) infrared products and from terrestrial GNSS stations located along the tracks of the ships. The ship-borne GNSS IWV retrievals from R/V Atalante and R/V Meteor compare well with ERA5, with small biases (-1.62 kgm(-2) for R/V Atalante and +0.65 kgm(-2) for R/V Meteor) and a root mean square (rms) difference of about 2.3 kgm(-2). The results for the R/V Maria S. Merian are found to be of poorer quality, with an rms difference of 6 kgm(-2), which is very likely due to the location of the GNSS antenna on this R/V prone to multipath effects. The comparisons with ground-based GNSS data confirm these results. The comparisons of all three R/V IWV retrievals with MODIS infrared products show large rms differences of 5-7 kgm(-2), reflecting the enhanced uncertainties in these satellite products in the tropics. These ship-borne IWV retrievals are intended to be used for the description and understanding of meteorological phenomena that occurred during the campaign, east of Barbados, Guyana and northern Brazil. Both the raw GNSS measurements and the IWV estimates are available through the AERIS data centre (https://en.aeris-data.fr/, last access: 20 September 2020). The digital object identifiers (DOIs) for R/V Atalante IWV and raw datasets are https://doi.org/10.25326/71 (Bosser et al., 2020a) and https://doi.org/10.25326/74 (Bosser et al., 2020d), respectively. The DOIs for the R/V Maria S. Merian IWV and raw datasets are https://doi.org/10.25326/72 (Bosser et al., 2020b) and https://doi.org/10.25326/75 (Bosser et al., 2020e), respectively.

TI  - Evaluation of regions suitable for vicarious calibration of ocean color satellite sensors in the South China Sea
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate retrieval of biogeochemical components of the ocean at a global scale from space requires accurately calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance, which is usually achieved by deriving a vicarious gain coefficient (g-factor) through a process called system vicarious calibration (SVC). Currently, only two SVC sites, Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) and BOUee pour l'acquiSition d'une Serie Optique a Long termE (BOUSSOLE), are routinely operated to support the SVC process for all on-orbit ocean color satellite payloads. However, high-quality matchups between satellite observations and in situ measurements are rare because of the strict requirements of the SVC process. Meanwhile, a stable g-factor is usually computed by averaging sufficient gain measurements. Therefore, more SVC sites are required to derive a stable g-factor in a short duration, particularly for the initial calibration of newly launched satellite sensors. In this study, nearly twenty years of well-calibrated ocean color satellite data were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of physical and optical properties of waters and the atmosphere in the South China Sea (SCS) to evaluate the feasibility of establishing a SVC site. A region was identified that meets all requirements that were used to evaluate the MOBY and BOUSSOLE sites. Two in situ measurements within this region were used to derive a g-factor for MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua and were compared with the g-factor derived using MOBY data. The consistence of the two g-factors indicates that the identified region in the SCS could be a potential area for establishing a long-term moored SVC site.

TI  - What is <i>Sumak Kawsay?</i> A Qualitative Study in the Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - A qualitative study of the main characteristics of sumak kawsay (buen vivir, living well/good life) in the Ecuadorian Amazon shows that it has four constitutive elements of which a multitude of interpretations coexist: an indigenous and nature-focused worldview, community, an economy based on solidarity, and ancestral knowledge. Understandings of sumak kawsay are rooted in the practices and beliefs of the communities interviewed rather than in theoretical constructions of idyllic community forms, and in this connection differences can be observed between the academic "indigenist" view of it and local discourses.Una aproximacion cualitativa a las caracteristicas principales del sumak kawsay (buen vivir, living well/good life) en la Amazonia ecuatoriana muestran la existencia de cuatro elementos constitutivos del sumak kawsay en los que colindan multitud de interpretaciones: cosmovision indigena y naturaleza, comunidad, economia solidaria, y conocimiento ancestral. Las comprensiones del sumak kawsay enraizan con practicas y creencias de las personas y no con construcciones teoricas de formas comunitarias idilicas, y al respecto, apreciamos diferencias entre la vision academica "indigenista" del sumak kawsay y los discursos locales.

TI  - Historical land cover classification from CORONA imagery using convolutional neural networks and geometric moments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical CORONA imagery, a very high-resolution panchromatic imagery captured during 1960-72, has a lot of unexplored potentials to represent the land cover of the pre-Landsat era. This pre-Landsat land cover can be a valuable input to many long-term environmental modelling problems. While automated binary change detection and multi-class classification by manual photo-interpretation have been the two most popular applications of CORONA imagery, automated multi-class classification of CORONA imagery has not been explored. In this research, we propose two supervised classification methods capable of extracting spatial features for the classification of CORONA imagery. The first method utilizes two-dimensional convolutional neural networks (2D-CNN) for classification, whereas the second method involves stacking the CORONA imagery with its texture features obtained through geometric moments (GM) and performing pixel-wise classification using the random forest (RF) classifier and is termed as GM-RF. The proposed methods are tested on two study sites - the critical zone observatory (CZO) managed by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh (India) and a site near Chhapra in Bihar (India). For estimating the capabilities of the proposed methods and to compare the proposed methods with other methods, overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa coefficient (k) along with z-scores statistics are used. The effects of various hyperparameters (e.g. percentage of training data, patch size, order of geometric moments) on accuracy are also evaluated. The classification accuracies achieved through the 2D-CNN and GM-RF method in terms of are higher than 90% for both study sites indicating that the proposed methods can classify CORONA imagery with little domain knowledge about the study areas, and hence can be used in a variety of applications.

TI  - Corrections of political misinformation: no evidence for an effect of partisan worldview in a US convenience sample
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Misinformation often has a continuing effect on people's reasoning despite clear correction. One factor assumed to affect post-correction reliance on misinformation is worldview-driven motivated reasoning. For example, a recent study with an Australian undergraduate sample found that when politically situated misinformation was retracted, political partisanship influenced the effectiveness of the retraction. This worldview effect was asymmetrical, that is, particularly pronounced in politically conservative participants. However, the evidence regarding such worldview effects (and their symmetry) has been inconsistent. Thus, the present study aimed to extend previous findings by examining a sample of 429 pre-screened US participants supporting either the Democratic or Republican Party. Participants received misinformation suggesting that politicians of either party were more likely to commit embezzlement; this was or was not subsequently retracted, and participants' inferential reasoning was measured. While political worldview (i.e. partisanship) influenced the extent to which participants relied on the misinformation overall, retractions were equally effective across all conditions. There was no impact of political worldview on retraction effectiveness, let alone evidence of a backfire effect, and thus we did not replicate the asymmetry observed in the Australian-based study. This pattern emerged despite some evidence that Republicans showed a stronger emotional response than Democrats to worldview-incongruent misinformation. This article is part of the theme issue 'The political brain: neurocognitive and computational mechanisms'.

TI  - WINTERC-G: mapping the upper mantle thermochemical heterogeneity from coupled geophysical-petrological inversion of seismic waveforms, heat flow, surface elevation and gravity satellite data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new global thermochemical model of the lithosphere and underlying upper mantle constrained by state of the art seismic waveform inversion, satellite gravity (geoid and gravity anomalies and gradiometric measurements from ESA's GOCE mission), surface elevation and heat flow data: WINTERC-G. The model is based upon an integrated geophysical-petrological approach where seismic velocities and density in the mantle are computed within a thermodynamically self-consistent framework, allowing for a direct parametrization in terms of the temperature and composition variables. The complementary sensitivities of the data sets allow us to constrain the geometry of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, to separate thermal and compositional anomalies in the mantle, and to obtain a proxy for dynamic surface topography. At long spatial wavelengths, our model is generally consistent with previous seismic (or seismically derived) global models and earlier integrated studies incorporating surface wave data at lower lateral resolution. At finer scales, the temperature, composition and density distributions in WINTERC-G offer a new state of the art image at a high resolution globally (225 km average interknot spacing). Our model shows that the deepest lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is associated with cratons and, also, some tectonically active areas (Andes, Persian Gulf). Among cratons we identify considerable differences in temperature and composition. The North American and Siberian Cratons are thick (>260 km) and compositionally refractory, whereas the Sino-Korean, Aldan and Tanzanian Cratons have a thinner, fertile lithosphere, similar to younger continental lithosphere elsewhere. WINTERC-G shows progressive thickening of oceanic lithosphere with age, but with significant regional differences: the lithospheric mantle beneath the Atlantic and Indian Oceans is, on average, colder, more fertile and denser than that beneath the Pacific Ocean. Our results suggest that the composition, temperature and density of the oceanic mantle lithosphere are related to the spreading rate for the rates up to 50-60 mmyr(-1): the lower spreading rate, the higher the mantle fertility and density, and the lower the temperature. At greater spreading rates, the relationship disappears. The 1-D radial average of WINTERC-G displays a mantle geothermal gradient of 0.55-0.6 Kkm(-1) and a potential temperature of 1300-1320 degrees C for depths >200 km. At the top of the mantle transition zone the amplitude of the maximum lateral temperature variations (cratons versus hotspots) is about 120 K. The isostatic residual topography values, a proxy for dynamic topography, are large (>1 km) mostly in active subduction settings. The residual isostatic bathymetry fromWINTERC-G is remarkably similar to the pattern independently determined based on oceanic crustal data compilations. The amplitude of the continental residual topography is relatively large and positive (>600 m) in the East European Craton, Greenland, and the Andes and Himalayas. By contrast, central Asia, most of Antarctica, southern South America and, to a lesser extent, central Africa are characterized by negative residual topography values (>-400 m). Our results show that a substantial part of the topography signal previously identified as residual (or dynamic) is accounted for, isostatically, by lithospheric density variations.

TI  - Measuring health care experiences that matter to Indigenous people in Australia with cancer: identifying critical gaps in existing tools
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Measurement of patients' healthcare experiences is increasingly used as an indicator of quality of care, but there are concerns that existing measures omit information that is meaningful to patients and that results may not be used systematically to inform service improvement. Further, current approaches may be inadequate for some population groups, such as Indigenous people in Australia, whose healthcare experience is impacted by the context of colonisation and discordance between Indigenous understandings of health and the Western biomedical health system. This study aimed to assess the extent to which existing patient experience measures used in Australia collect information about critical aspects of cancer care, as previously identified by Indigenous people affected by cancer and their health care providers. Methods A two-stage process was used to examine the adequacy of existing patient experience measures for Indigenous people in Australia: (1) relevant tools and measures were identified and assessed, and four measures selected as suitable comparators; (2) comparators were examined in detail and mapped against topics identified in earlier research as important to Indigenous people with cancer. Gaps in topic coverage in comparators were identified. Results No comparators completely captured the critical aspects of cancer care identified by Indigenous people affected by cancer and their health care providers. The number of topics 'partially' captured by the four comparators ranged from 4 to 7 out of 9. While most topics were partially covered, the lack of questions around culture and cultural safety was notable. Conclusions Existing tools are likely to miss key aspects of Indigenous peoples' experiences of cancer care in Australia. Failure to adequately assess care experiences related to cultural safety may compromise efforts to improve health outcomes. Addressing gaps requires development of experience measures that are strengths-based, reflect an Indigenous worldview and measure aspects of experience relevant to Indigenous people.

TI  - The Firm Next Door: Using Satellite Images to Study Local Information Advantage
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use novel satellite data that track the number of cars in the parking lots of 92,668 stores for 71 publicly listed U.S. retailers to study the local information advantage of institutional investors. We establish car counts as a timely measure of store-level performance and find that institutional investors adjust their holdings in response to the performance of local stores, and that these trades are profitable on average. These results suggest that local investors have an advantage when processing information about nearby operations. However, some institutional investors do not adjust for the quality of their local information and continue to rely on local signals even when they are poor predictors of firm performance and returns. This overreliance on poor local information is reduced for institutional investors with greater industry expertise and those with greater incentives to maximize short-term trading profits.

TI  - Correction of training process in object-based image interpretation via knowledge based system capabilities
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - For accurate interpretation of high-resolution images, correct training-samples are required to model the decision-making process for data classification. The automatic production of that is an important step; however, the control and correction, whether at the level of pruning the wrong data or resolving their defects, should be considered. Accordingly, in this research, a hybrid (combined deductive and inductive) interpretation system by modeling and improving the training processing was proposed for very high-resolution images. In other words, an automatic knowledge-based method is performed to apply the modeling of the ontological relationships in order to train and control the object-based support vector machine classification. In the correction process, sequence stages including automatic separation and expanding the training data and the ontology properties of the target classes for improving the defect of training data were used. Finally, high-resolution test images are used to validate the results and evaluate the method. In this respect, the proposed method is tested in different implementation cases and compared with other algorithms in each step. The experimental results indicate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed method.

TI  - Ecological environment changes of mining areas around Nansi lake with remote sensing monitoring
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground mining activity has existed for more than 100 years in Nansi lake. Coal mining not only plays a supporting role in local social and economic development but also has a significant impact on the ecological environment in the region. Landsat series remote sensing data (1988 similar to 2019) are used to research the impact of coal mining on the ecological environment in Nansi lake. Then support vector machine (SVM) classifier is applied to extract the water area of the upstream lake from 1988 to 2019, and ecological environment and spatiotemporal variation characteristics are analyzed by Remote Sensing Ecology Index (RSEI). The results illustrate that the water area change is associated with annual precipitation. In terms of ecological quality, the area of poor ecological quality areas increased by 101.782 km(2), while the area of good and excellent quality areas decreased by 218.988 km(2) from 2009 to 2019. So compared with 2009, the ecological quality of the lake is worse in 2019, and then the reason for this change is due to large-scale underground mining. Therefore, the coal mines from the natural reserve may be closed or limited to the mining boundary for protecting the lake's ecological environment.

TI  - From local to regional compound flood mapping with deep learning and data fusion techniques
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Compound flooding (CF), as a result of oceanic, hydrological, meteorological and anthropogenic drivers, is often studied with hydrodynamic models that combine either successive or concurrent processes to simulate inundation dynamics. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and data fusion (DF) techniques have emerged as effective alternatives for post-flood mapping and supported current efforts of complex physical and dynamical modeling. Yet, those techniques have not been explored for large-scale (regional) compound flood mapping. Here, we evaluate the performance of a CNN & DF framework for generating CF maps along the southeast Atlantic coast of the U.S. as a result of Hurricane Matthew (October 2016). The framework fuses multispectral imagery from Landsat analysis ready data (ARD), dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar data (SAR), and coastal digital elevation models (DEMs) to produce flood maps at moderate (30 m) spatial resolution. The highest overall accuracy (97%) and f1-scores of permanent water/floodwater (99/100%) are achieved when ARD, SAR and DEM datasets are readily available and fused. Moreover, the resulting CF maps agree well (80%) with hindcast flood guidance maps of the Coastal Emergency Risk Assessment and can effectively match post flood high water marks of the U.S. Geological Survey distributed in coastal counties. We ultimately evaluate the framework with different DF alternatives and highlight their usefulness for large-scale compound flood mapping as well as calibration of hydrodynamic models. The cost-effective approach proposed here enables efficient estimation of exposure to compound coastal flooding and is particularly useful in data scarce regions.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives Determine if Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is associated with improved overall survival compared to wide local excision (WLE) when treating cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck (CMHN) and to report the proportion of patients treated with MMS versus WLE who also underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods Retrospective cohort study of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) analyzing the overall survival of patients diagnosed with T1 to T4 CMHN between 2004 and 2016 who were treated with either WLE or MMS.Results On multivariable analysis, treatment with WLE versus MMS was not significantly associated with overall survival (HR, 1.094; 95% CI, 0.997-1.201). On multivariable analysis, lower Charlson-Deyo score (HR, 0.489; 95% CI, 0.427-0.560), negative margins (HR, 0.754; 95% CI, 0.705-0.807), and N0 classification (HR 0.698; 95% CI, 0.668-0.730) were associated with improved overall survival. Seventy-seven percent of patients treated with MMS did not undergo SLNB, while 45% of patients treated with WLE did not undergo SLNB (P < .001).Conclusions No difference in overall survival between MMS and WLE when treating CMHN. Patients treated with MMS were significantly less likely to undergo SLNB, suggesting an opportunity for enhancement of multidisciplinary care.Level of Evidence 4 Laryngoscope, 2021

M3  - Article
AB  - When the covariance matrix formulation is used for multilook polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, Wilks' Lambda can be used for change detection between acquisitions at two time points. We briefly describe the theory for dual polarization, diagonal only data. A case study illustrates the technique on Sentinel-1 C-band data covering the international Frankfurt Airport. We successfully detect change including direction of change in the sense that Wilks' Lambda shows whether radar signal increases or decreases over time.

TI  - Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Have Adverse Effects on Benthic Communities in the Baltic Sea: Implications for Environmental Status Assessment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in benthic macrofaunal communities are indicative of environmental stressors, including eutrophication and hypoxia. However, some species are sensitive not only to hypoxia but also to various environmental contaminants. We tested which of the environmental predictors (sediment organic carbon, sediment concentrations of metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], bottom water oxygen, salinity, temperature, and surface chlorophyll-a concentration) that best explained the following response variables: (1) macrofauna community composition, (2) abundance of a benthic sentinel species, the amphipod Monoporeia affinis; and (3) the Benthic Quality Index (BQI). All data originated from 29 reference monitoring stations in the Baltic Sea and the statistical tests included both uni- and multivariate analyses. The community composition and BQI were best explained by the same combination of salinity, depth, temperature and PAH concentrations. The abundance of M. affinis, which is sensitive to hypoxia and chemical exposure, was best explained by PAHs as a single predictor. Our findings suggest that benthic communities in the Baltic Sea are influenced by anthropogenic contaminants, which should be taken into account when benthos is used for eutrophication status assessment.

TI  - Simulation of Dissolved Organic Carbon Flux in the Penobscot Watershed, Maine
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important component of the carbon cycle as a measure of the hydrological transport of carbon between terrestrial carbon pools into soil pools and eventually into streams. As a result, changes in DOC in rivers and streams may indicate alterations in the storage of terrestrial carbon. Exploring the complex interactions between biogeochemical cycling and hydrologic processes, as well as the micro-climate variabilities that impact the rate of DOC fluxes, are challenging because the information is not readily available from in-situ measurements or from empirical models alone. This is particularly true of large-scale watersheds. The Penobscot Watershed is the largest watershed of the Gulf of Maine and the second largest in New England. Its typical soils, with high organic matter and a large forested and wetland landscape, result in higher DOC fluxes than what has been observed previously for most rivers in the northern temperate or boreal zones (Hope et al., 1994; Mulholland, 1997; Aitkenhead and McDowell, 2000).In this study, we emphasized the simulation of streamflow and DOC fluxes from the Penobscot Watershed (and several tributaries within the Penobscot Watershed) using the spatially distributed process-based Regional Hydro- Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys) model. Simulated results were evaluated using field measurements (streamflow, DOC fluxes) and remotely sensed products (Net Primary Production (NPP) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The average DOC flux for the Penobscot Watershed during 2004-2012 using the RHESSys model was 69 kg C/ha/year. The RHESSys simulated DOC flux is shown to correlate well with observed values, as well as with results previously reported from the empirical Load Estimator (LOADEST) model (71 kg C/ha/year) for 20 04-2007 (Huntington and Aiken, 2013).Our simulated results also show a temporal variation in the amount of DOC flux, indicating that the antecedent DOC concentration from one year can impact the DOC export in following years. Thus, DOC concentration is positively correlated with streamflow and antecedent precipitation, in agreement with previous studies (Agren et al., 2010; Huntington and Aiken, 2013; Tian et al., 2013). The successful application of the rigorous RHESSys model in the Penobscot Watershed makes it a reasonable platform to test future scenarios impacting the hydrology and biogeochemistry within similar large complex watersheds.

TI  - Spatial scale effect of Sentinel-2, Landsat OLI, and MODIS imagery in the assessment of landscape condition of Zagros mountains
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The scale of satellite images affects the recognition of landscape patterns and conditions. Therefore, this research focused on relationships between landscape fragmentation and function using multi-sensor imagery in semi-arid regions of Iran. Landscape function leakiness index (LI) and fragmentation metrics were calculated based on Sentinel-2, Landsat OLI, and MODIS data and compared using regression models and principal component analysis. Upscaled data were obtained based on changing the resolution of native Sentinel-2 from 10 to 30 m and 250 m. Results showed low (4%) and high (91%) fragmentation values in good and poor rangelands, respectively. The Sentinel-2 native LI index was the best indicator of vegetation cover (R-2 = 0.99, p < 0.001) and fragmentation (R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.05) and its upscaling to 30 m correlated better with fragmentation values than 250 m. The findings indicated that landscape functionality has reduced in the degraded areas because of increasing fragmentation and inter-patch spaces.

TI  - Trees outside forests are an underestimated resource in a country with low forest cover
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees outside forests (TOF) are an underrepresented resource in forest poor nations. As a result of their frequent omission from national forest resource assessments and a lack of readily available very-high-resolution remotely sensed imagery, TOF status and characterization has until now, been unknown. Here, we assess the capacity of openly available 10 m ESA Sentinel constellation satellite imagery for mapping TOF extent at the national level in Bangladesh. In addition, we estimate canopy height for TOF using a TanDEM-X DEM. We map 2,233,578 ha of TOF in Bangladesh with a mean canopy height of 7.3 m. We map 31 and 53% more TOF than existing estimates of TOF and forest, respectively. We find TOF in Bangladesh is nationally fragmented as a consequence of agricultural activity, yet is capable of maintaining connectedness between remaining stands. Now, TOF accounting is feasible at the national scale using readily available datasets, enabling the mainstream inclusion of TOF in national forest resource assessments for other countries.

TI  - High-frequency monitoring of anomalous methane point sources with multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate the capability of the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) to detect and quantify anomalously large methane point sources with fine pixel resolution (20 m) and rapid revisit rates (2-5 d). We present three methane column retrieval methods that use shortwave infrared (SWIR) measurements from MSI spectral bands 11 (similar to 1560-1660 nm) and 12 (similar to 2090-2290 nm) to detect atmospheric methane plumes. The most successful is the multiband-multi-pass (MBMP) method, which uses a combination of the two bands and a non-plume reference observation to retrieve methane columns. The MBMP method can quantify point sources down to about 3t h(-1) with a precision of similar to 30 %-90 % (1 sigma) over favorable (quasi-homogeneous) surfaces. We applied our methods to perform high-frequency monitoring of strong methane point source plumes from a well-pad device in the Hassi Messaoud oil field of Algeria (October 2019 to August 2020, observed every 2.5 d) and from a compressor station in the Korpezhe oil and gas field of Turkmenistan (August 2015 to November 2020, observed every 5 d). The Algerian source was detected in 93 % of cloud-free scenes, with source rates ranging from 2.6 to 51.9 t h(-1) (averaging 9.3 t h(-1)) until it was shut down by a flare lit in August 2020. The Turkmen source was detected in 40 % of cloud-free scenes, with variable intermittency and a 9-month shutdown period in March-December 2019 before it resumed; source rates ranged from 3.5 to 92.9 th(-1) (averaging 20.5 th(-1)). Our source-rate retrievals for the Korpezhe point source are in close agreement with GHGSat-D satellite observations for February 2018 to January 2019, but provide much higher observation density. Our methods can be readily applied to other satellite instruments with coarse SWIR spectral bands, such as Landsat-7 and Landsat-8. High-frequency satellite-based detection of anomalous methane point sources as demonstrated here could enable prompt corrective action to help reduce global methane emissions.

TI  - The effects of urban land cover dynamics on urban heat Island intensity and temporal trends
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessments of surface urban heat island (UHI) have focused on using remote sensing and land cover data to quantify UHI intensity and spatial distribution within a certain time period by including land cover information. In this study, we implemented a prototype approach to characterize the spatiotemporal variations of UHI using time series of Landsat land surface temperature products and annual land change information. We analyzed UHI distribution and change in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in the north-central United States and found that the mean UHI intensity in the region was as large as 2.2 degrees C during the period 1986-2017 with an increasing trend of 0.02 degrees C per year within the area with a 5-km non-urban extent. The UHI intensity associated with high intensity urban land cover usually is stronger than with low intensity urban land cover. We evaluated the impact of different non-urban reference extents on UHI variation using different non-urban buffers. The result also suggests that the overall temporal trends of UHI intensity are almost the same when using a 5-km or 10-km non-urban buffer surrounding the urban core. The prototype approach provides a framework to consistently quantify UHI and monitor its change to a large geographic extent.

TI  - Combining morphological filtering, anisotropic diffusion and block-based data replication for automatically detecting and recovering unscanned gaps in remote sensing images
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Filling damaged pixels in satellite images is a key task present in many Remote Sensing applications. As a representative example of image restoration issue, we can refer to the failure of the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) on board the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) sensor, in which 22% of the scanned pixels in the SLC-off images were missed, thus creating unexpected stipe-type gaps in the scenes. In order to improve the usability of ETM + SLC-off data in a straightforward manner, in this paper we propose a unified methodology that automatically segments and repairs Landsat-7 scenes occluded by stripes. The proposed framework combines Morphology-based filtering, anisotropic diffusion and block-based pixel replication as an effective, fully unsupervised restoration methodology designed to cope with different gap sizes in Landsat images. Our approach does not require having as input data any prior gap mask, side reference image or time-dependent frames of the same scene to work properly. As shown in the experimental results, the current methodology performs adequately for a variety of multispectral remote sensing images with different stripe-size thicknesses and heterogeneous segments. We attest to the accuracy and robustness of our end-to-end framework throughout a variety of qualitative and quantitative evaluations involving state-of-the-art restoration methods.

TI  - Non-binary worldviews in education
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I discuss the potential of developing a kind of worldview education that has the purpose of enabling teachers and students to understand how worldviews are formed. I explore how suggestions of Ann Taves can be helpful towards such an aim and pay special attention to research into self-defined 'non-religious people. It seems their worldviews can defy the secular-religious divide and be categorised as non-binary. Taves have suggested to use worldviews as an overarching rubric, that encompasses both religious, non-religious and non-binary views, which I see as corresponding with suggestions towards worldview education in schools. It signals a need for a new language for certain parts of human activity related to meaning-making. A kind of Worldview education is already a part of school subjects in Norway, Sweden, England, Finland, Netherlands and beyond, and scholars are now exploring possibilities in this. I review some recent discussions among educationalists against the suggestions of Taves, who define worldviews in terms of Big Questions, draw upon a global meanings system theory used by psychologists, and biological and evolutionary grounding of the concepts which, according to Taves would make the worldview concept more stable than the highly contested concept of religion.

TI  - Optimized landslide susceptibility mapping and modelling using PS-InSAR technique: a case study of Chitral valley, Northern Pakistan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Chitral valley lies in the eastern Hindu Kush range, one of the hotspot of landslide activities that leads to loss of lives and economy. Comprehensive landslide inventory and Landslide susceptibility provide the basic information to analyses and medicate the landslide activities which are not available for the area. Probabilistic and statistical methods have been using to develop susceptibility maps but limitations are countered to assess high accuracy. In this study Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technique has been applied to estimate the slope deformation velocity (Vslope), which can be used to optimize the landslide susceptibility map for the study area. The frequency ratio and logistic regression models were applied for comparative assessment and to forecast the correlation between causative factors and landslide occurrence. Area Under Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve approach was used for accuracy comparison of both models which showed 75.45% and 85.61% accuracy for FR and LR respectively. LR method's result was found superior and combined with the results of PS-InSAR to extract new Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (LSM) for the area which removed misclassifications in the results. This optimized susceptibility model will be helpful to mitigate the landslide disaster and provide support to authorities in the management of different development programs in the study area.

TI  - Mixed pixel removal in north Tamil Nadu region for accurate area measurement
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing, vegetation and water areas delineation from satellite image plays a vital role for urban and rural planning. Delineation of vegetation and water area is a challenging task due to mixed pixels and geometric distortion over the boundary region. Geometric distortion arises due to change in velocity and speed of satellite during image acquisition, and mixed pixels arises due to different surfaces in a particular area. Traditional methods apply classifier algorithms such as support vector machine, neural network, and fuzzy for vegetation and water area delineation. The traditional methods require more training dataset and consume more interpretation time for delineation. In this article, we propose transverse dyadic wavelet transform (TDyWT) to delineate vegetation and water area from Landsat 8 images. The TDyWT method enhances the boundary and curvature area of satellite image for accurate delineation. From the experimental results, the proposed TDyWT approach delineates the area of subclass for vegetation and water areas with 95% of accuracy with respect to the ground truth.

TI  - Impact of lockdown on particulate matter concentrations in Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Colombia was reported on March 6, 2020. For this reason. on March 25, preventive isolation was declared mandatory. These measures involved the suspension of economic activities and drastically reduced the number of vehicles on the road. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic on PM2.5 concentrations at 5 monitoring stations and aerosol optical depth values of the Terra/MODIS satellite. We analyzed and compared the weekly and monthly concentrations of PM2.5 before and during the lockdown between the week of January 6 to June 22, 2020, and compared the daily values obtained from the Terra/MODIS satellite for the months of January-June during the years 2018-2020 to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Similar to other monitored sites in the world, we observed substantial reductions in weekly PM2.5 concentrations, from 41 to 84% (Bogota), from 13 to 66% (Funza), from 17 to 57% (Boyaca), from 35 to 86% (Valledupar) and 31 at 60% (Risaralda). Unlike other studies, the aerosol optical depth values increased up to 59% during the months of lockdown compared to previous years and up to 70% of the weekly mean when compared to before the lockdown. These spatiotemporal behaviors of PM2.5 and the aerosol optical depth in Colombia are influenced by reductions in vehicular flow during quarantine, regional rainfall. and height of the planetary boundary layer. Emissions from economic activities affect pollutant levels in the area. The analysis of the levels of pollutants during the lockdown provides a baseline for regulatory agencies to establish mitigation plans. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Serological evidence of West Nile virus infection in human populations and domestic birds in the Northwest of Morocco
T2  - COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) was recently detected in Culex pipiens mosquitoes in Morocco. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of WNV in humans and in domestic birds in two regions of Morocco by the detection of IgG antibodies. Blood samples were obtained from 91 human patients and 92 domestic birds from September to December 2019. All study samples were tested using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) and WNV neutralization tests (VNT) were performed on positive sera. Of all samples, 4 (4.39 %) humans and 4 (4.34 %) birds were found to be seropositive for flaviviruses by the cELISA test. The VNT revealed that three of the four human samples detected positive by cELISA contained neutralizing antibodies against WNV. Two bird samples were confirmed positive by VNT. These results show a significant seroprevalence of antiWNV antibodies and therefore suggest the active circulation and exposure of human and bird populations in the northwest of Morocco.

TI  - High discordance rate in assessing sentinel node positivity in cutaneous melanoma: Expert review may reduce unjustified adjuvant treatment
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Identification of sentinel node (SN) metastases can set the adjuvant systemic therapy indication for patients with stage III melanoma. Studies re-evaluating the diagnosis of initially positive SN biopsies are scarce.Materials and methods: Dutch patients with melanoma who underwent SN biopsy between 2003 and 2014 were selected from PALGA, the Dutch Pathology Registry. Histopathological slides of SN-positive patients were retrieved for review. A random sample was reassessed by an expert melanoma pathologist. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients who were misclassified (false-positive) was compared with those with a true positive SN status. For comparison, a group of SN-negative patients was included. Multivariable logistic analysis was performed to assess clinicopathological characteristics associated with misclassification of SN status.Results: Diagnosis was downgraded from melanoma metastasis to nodal nevus in 38 of the 322 reviewed patients (11.8%). Considering the inclusion criteria of phase III adjuvant trials, at least 4.3% of patients would have falsely qualified for adjuvant therapy. In multivariable analysis, patients with a low SN tumour burden and subcapsular SN tumour location had a significantly higher chance of being misclassified. The five-year RFS of the 38 downgraded patients was 86.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 72.6-96.6), similar to the 85.9% (95% CI = 84.9-86.8, p = 0.18) for 6413 SN-negative patients and better than the 53.2% (95% CI = 47.2-59.9, p = 0.009) of 284 patients who were truly SN positive upon review.Conclusion: More than 10% of originally positive SN biopsies of patients with melanoma concern misclassified nodal nevi. We advocate that when adjuvant treatment is considered in patients with stage III melanoma, SN biopsies should be reassessed by an expert melanoma pathologist.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Development and Validation of Nomograms to Predict Local, Regional, and Distant Recurrence in Patients With Thin (T1) Melanomas
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSEAlthough the prognosis of patients with thin primary cutaneous melanomas (T1, <= 1.0 mm) is generally excellent, some develop recurrence. We sought to develop and validate a model predicting recurrences in patients with thin melanomas.METHODSA Dutch population-based cohort (n = 25,930, development set) and a cohort from an Australian melanoma treatment center (n = 2,968, validation set) were analyzed (median follow-up 6.7 and 12.0 years, respectively). Multivariable Cox models were generated for local, regional, and distant recurrence-free survival (RFS). Discrimination was assessed using Harrell's C-statistic for each outcome. Each nomogram performance was evaluated using calibration plots defining low-risk and high-risk groups as the lowest and top 5% of the nomogram risk score, respectively. The nomograms' C-statistics were compared with those of a model including the current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging parameters (T-stage and sentinel node status).RESULTSLocal, regional, and distant recurrences were found in 209 (0.8%), 503 (1.9%), and 203 (0.8%) Dutch patients, respectively, and 23 (0.8%), 61 (2.1%), and 75 (2.5%) Australian patients, respectively. C-statistics of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.82) for local RFS, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.78) for regional RFS, and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.83) for distant RFS were obtained for the development model. External validation showed C-statistics of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.90), 0.76 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.82), and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.80), respectively. Calibration plots showed a good match between predicted and observed rates. Using the nomogram, the C-statistic was increased by 9%-12% for the development cohort and by 11%-15% for the validation cohort, compared with a model including only T-stage and sentinel node status.CONCLUSIONMost patients with thin melanomas have an excellent prognosis, but some develop recurrence. The presented nomograms can accurately identify a subgroup at high risk. An online calculator is available at www.melanomarisk.org.au.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the tends on HIV/syphilis prevalence and sexual behaviors using the HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance data of young students in China from 2015 to 2019 and provide evidence for the formulation of HIV/AIDS prevention and control measures among young students. Methods: From 2015 to 2019, a nationwide continuous cross-sectional survey was conducted in cities where colleges and technical schools were concentrated in each province. Multi-stage cluster sampling with the simple size 800, anonymous questionnaire, and blood sample collection were implemented to achieve general demographic information, sexual behavior, and serological information, analyze the trends and influence on HIV/syphilis infection and behaviors. Results: During 2015-2019, there was no linear trend on the antibody-positive rate of HIV[2019, 0.03% (17/54 110)], and there was a weak correlation on the antibody-positive rate of syphilis [2019, 0.08%(41/54 110)]. In 2019, the proportion of the respondents ever had sex was 8.71%(4 731/54 339), of those having regular sex partner in the last year was 3.96% (2 153/54 339), of those having a temporary partner was 1.81%(984/54 339), of a commercial sex partner was 0.19% (101/54 339), and of homosexual partners was 0.19% (101/54 339), who they were all stable. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the young students who had male homosexual partners were most likely to be infected by HIV. The young students who had multiple sexual partners, including homosexual partners, were foreigners or minorities were most likely to be infected by syphilis (all P<0.05). Conclusions: The antibody-positive rates of HIV and syphilis remained low and stable among young students from 2015 to 2019 in China. However, the risk of sexual transmission of HIV and syphilis still remains among young students.

TI  - Mapping soil organic carbon stock by hyperspectral and time-series multispectral remote sensing images in low-relief agricultural areas
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision digital soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks mapping is very important for agricultural production management and global carbon cycle. The spatial heterogeneity of farmland SOC is not only influence by the environmental factors of soil formation but also the management practices of tillage, fertilization, and irrigation. However, the traditional modeling covariates of digital soil mapping, such as terrain factors, land use types and climate factors have weak spatial variations in low-relief agricultural areas, and they cannot reflect the large spatial variation of SOC. Thus the time-series multispectral remote sensing images will be used for mapping soil properties in low relief regions in this study, meanwhile a new collaborative verification strategy was put forward to evaluate the spatial distribution characteristics of soil maps. The current study was performed in a nearly flat agricultural region southeast of Iowa (with an area of approximately 385.45 ha), where 195 surface soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected. A hyperspectral image (Headwall-Hyperspec, 380-1700 nm) and the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 were used to construct the prediction models of SOC stock and its relevant soil properties of SOC and soil bulk density (SBD) through partial least square regression (PLSR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. The collected soil samples and evaluation indexes of root mean square error (RMSE), R-2, and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) were used to evaluate the model performance. Results are as follows: (1) hyperspectral images were successfully used to predict the SOC stock, SOC, and SBD through PLSR and ELM, while ELM (RPIQ = 2.03, 1.97, 1.64) outperformed PLSR (RPIQ = 1.83, 1.97, 1.53); (2) the time-series multispectral remote sensing images of Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 can reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of the SOC stock, SOC and SBD by PLSR and ELM, but the combination of Sentinel 2 images and ELM obtained the best prediction results (RPIQ = 1.45, 1.25, 1.26); and (3) the differences of the soil maps predicted by the hyperspectral image and time-series multispectral remote sensing images were small, and the largest percentage errors nearly appeared on the edges of the farmland patches owing to mixed pixels. This study further confirmed the good prediction abilities of the time-series multispectral remote sensing images in low relief farmland regions. Lastly, this mapping strategy can provide additional valuable information for agricultural management and carbon cycle.

TI  - Mapping and analyzing the local climate zones in China's 32 major cities using Landsat imagery based on a novel convolutional neural network
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme provides researchers with a standard method to monitor the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and conduct temperature studies. How to generate reliable LCZ maps has therefore become a research focus. In recent years, researchers have attempted to use Landsat imagery to delineate LCZs and generate maps worldwide based on the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT). However, the mapping results obtained by the WUDAPT method are not satisfactory. In this paper, to generate more accurate LCZ maps, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (namely, LCZ-CNN), which is designed to cope with the issues of LCZ classification using Landsat imagery. Furthermore, in this study, we applied the LCZ-CNN model to generate LCZ mapping results for China's 32 major cities distributed in various climatic zones, achieving a significantly better accuracy than the traditional classification strategies and a satisfactory computational efficiency. The proposed LCZ-CNN model achieved satisfactory classification accuracies in all 32 cities, and the Overall Accuracies (OAs) of more than half of the cities were higher than 80%. We also designed a series of experiments to comprehensively analyze the proposed LCZ-CNN model, with regard to the transferability of the network and the effectiveness of multi-seasonal information. It was found that the first convolutional stage, corresponding to low-level features, shows better transferability than the second and third convolutional stages, which extract high-level and more image- or task-oriented features. It was also confirmed that the multi-seasonal information can improve the accuracy of LCZ classification. The thermal characteristics of the different LCZ classes were also analyzed based on the mapping results for China's 32 major cities, and the experimental results confirmed the close relationship between the LCZ classes and the magnitude of the Land Surface Temperature (LST).

AB  - Objective: To assess and compare the performance of limiting-antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (LAg-Avidity EIA) and pooling PCR in the surveillance for recent infection rates of HIV-1 in men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: Blood samples were collected from MSM selected through snowball sampling method in sentinel surveillance in 13 prefectures of Yunnan province from 2016 to 2017. The samples were tested for HIV-1 antibody. The confirmed positive samples were tested by LAg-Avidity EIA. The negative samples were tested by pooling PCR. The recent infection rates of HIV-1 were estimated by the algorithm based on LAg-Avidity EIA and pooling PCR respectively. The two results were compared. Results: During 2016-2017, a total of 5 363 blood samples were collected from MSM, in which 407 samples were HIV-1 positive (including 177 positive tested previously) and 4 956 samples were HIV-1 negative. A total of 211 samples(91.7%) were tested by LAg-Avidity EIA, 69 were confirmed to be recent infections. A total of 4 469 samples were tested by pooling PCR, 8 were confirmed to be acute infections. The recent infection rates of HIV-1 from 2016 to 2017 estimated by LAg-Avidity EIA were 3.36% and 4.84%, and the recent infection rates estimated by pooling PCR were 3.27% and 3.02% respectively. The differences in recent infection rates of HIV-1 estimated by the two algorithms were not significant. Conclusions: The recent infection rates of HIV-1 estimated by LAg-Avidity EIA and pooling PCR in sentinel surveillance in MSM in Yunnan had good consistency from 2016 to 2017. Using the two methods might have a better stability in continuous surveillance for recent infection rates of HIV-1.

TI  - Breast cancer patients with a negative axillary ultrasound may have clinically significant nodal metastasis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction The non-invasive nature of the preoperative axillary ultrasound (AUS) fits the current trend of increasingly conservative axillary management. Recent publications suggest that early disease patients with clinically and radiologically negative axillae do not require sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This study aims to determine the true extent of axillary node disease in negative preoperative AUS patients. Methods A 10-year breast cancer registry was reviewed to identify women with pathologically confirmed T1-2 invasive breast cancer and a negative preoperative AUS. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Combined positive lymph node count of SLNB +/- ALND was used to determine total nodal burden (TNB). Axillae were classified into low nodal burden (LNB) defined as 1-2 positive nodes and high nodal burden (HNB) defined as >= 3 positive nodes. Results 762 patients with negative AUS were included. There were 46.9% and 53.0% T1 and T2 tumours, respectively. 76.9% were node negative (0 LN +), 18.9% had LNB (1-2 LN +) and 4.2% had HNB (>= 3LN +). Specifically, HNB disease was seen in 2% of T1 tumours and 6.2 % of T2 tumours with a negative AUS. In multivariate analysis, T2 strongly associated with >= 3 positive ALNs (OR 2.66 CI 1.09-6.51 p = 0.03) as did lymphovascular invasion (OR 3.56 CI 1.52-8.30 p = < 0.01). Conclusion This study shows that AUS in its current form cannot exclude HNB axillary metastasis to the extent of eliminating the need for surgical staging of the axilla. This may impact axillary local-regional recurrence and disease-free survival. We caution that a negative AUS has a rate of 4.2% of HNB. Therefore, in cases of negative AUS with a T2 tumour, we advocate continued use of SLNB.

TI  - Assessment of FY-4A and Himawari-8 Cloud Top Height Retrieval through Comparison with Ground-Based Millimeter Radar at Sites in Tibet and Beijing
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of passive satellite cloud top height (CTH) retrieval shows regional dependence. This paper assesses the CTH derived from the FY-4A and Himawari-8 satellites through comparison with those from the ground-based millimeter radar at two sites: Yangbajing, Tibet, China (YBJ), and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP), Beijing, China. The comparison shows that Himawari-8 missed more CTHs at night than FY-4A, especially at YBJ. It is found that the CTH difference (CTHD; radar CTH minus satellite CTH) for FY-4A and Himawari-8 is 0.06 +/- 1.90 km and -0.02 +/- 2.40 km at YBJ respectively, and that is 0.93 +/- 2.24 km and 0.99 +/- 2.37 km at IAP respectively. The discrepancy between the satellites and radar at IAP is larger than that at YBJ. Both satellites show better performance for mid-level and low-level clouds than for high-level clouds at the two sites. The retrievals from FY-4A agree well with those from Himawari-8, with a mean difference of 0.08 km at YBJ and 0.06 km at IAP. It is found that the CTHD decreases as the cloud depth increases at both sites. However, the CTHD has no obvious dependence on cloud layers and fractions. Investigations show that aerosol concentration has little impact on the CTHD. For high and thin clouds, the CTHD increases gradually with the increase of the surface temperature, which might be a key factor causing the regional discrepancy between IAP and YBJ.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Out-migration is one of the most recognized adaptation practices when dealing with scarce resources and disasters. With the general objective of exploring migration as an impact of climate-induced disasters, our study was conducted in Khaniyapani, in the Sunapati rural municipality of Ramechhap district, Nepal. Disaster prioritization was conducted using the pair-wise ranking method, with results suggesting that drought and soil erosion are the most severe disasters in the study area. The severity maps were prepared using remotely sensed data. A Normalized Difference Drought Index and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation were used to produce the drought and erosion severity maps, respectively. Approximately 46.2% of the total study area was found to experience severe droughts, and almost 10% of the area had high soil erosion rates. In total, 100 out of 794 households were interviewed for a semi-structured questionnaire. Drought severity was found to directly impact livelihoods due to a decline in agricultural productivity, a decline in livestock, and drying of water sources. Out of 100 families, 64 practiced seasonal migration. A decline in agricultural productivity and livestock, and water scarcity were identified as the most influencing push factors. Excessive seasonal migration has reduced the resilience of these families. Drought-resistant land, water, and crop management techniques and practices, and alternative income-generating activities should be promoted to curb the seasonal migration.

TI  - A spectral index for winter wheat mapping using multi-temporal Landsat NDVI data of key growth stages
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat is one of the most important staple crops in the world. Accurate and timely information on the spatial distribution and temporal change of winter wheat is critical for food security and environmental sustainability. Multi-temporal images and time series data of medium resolution are widely used in winter wheat mapping. However, relatively long revisit times and image noise often result in a deficiency in full time series data. In this paper, a new spectral index, called the winter wheat index (WWI), using multi-temporal Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of four key growth stages of winter wheat, was proposed to highlight and map winter wheat. Two distinctive NDVI contrasts, each consisting of an NDVI peak and trough, were identified and used in the WWI. The proposed index was evaluated through qualitative and quantitative analyses as well as winter wheat mapping, and compared with three state-of-the-art methods. To map winter wheat using WWI, a Monte Carlo cross validation procedure was adopted to determine the optimal thresholds of the WWI. Visual comparison showed that winter wheat was highlighted by higher WWI values, whereas other land cover types had lower WWI values. The experimental results from quantitative analysis indicated that WWI achieved better separability between winter wheat and other land cover types than the other comparative indices. The proposed WWI also produced more accurate winter wheat mapping results, compared with the stateof-art methods. Therefore, the proposed WWI provides a useful variable for winter wheat mapping, which reduced the dependence on full time series data and the use of noise images, and can be applied in other study areas.

TI  - Analyzing spatial relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) of three urban agglomerations (UAs) of Eastern India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The trend of increasing land surface temperatures (LST) and emergence of urban heat islands (UHI) has become a pressing challenge for city planners and policy makers. In developing countries like India in particular, the rapid rate of urbanization occurring at present has caused significant alteration in climate, thereby causing a rise in health risks. This study was thus undertaken to examine the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) and LST using remote sensing data over three major urban agglomerations UAs), namely the English Bazar urban agglomerations (EBUA), Raiganj urban agglomeration (RUA) and Balurghat urban agglomeration (BUA) in Eastern India. Seasonal variations of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) were assessed for a better understanding of the spatial variation in SUHI patterns across UAs. The results showed that built-up areas, especially the high density residential zones (HDRZ), presented relatively higher LST and SUHI across UAs. From the results of landscape metrics, it was observed that SUHI was higher in core areas across the UAs which were largely dominated by HDRZs. The findings will certainly assist in understanding the spatial pattern of SUHI over UAs and further help to plan and implement effective land use planning for small and medium size cities of India.

TI  - Coupling random forest and inverse distance weighting to generate climate surfaces of precipitation and temperature with Multiple-Covariates
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially interpolated temperature and precipitation are hydrological variables that are widely applied in models of ecology, hydrology, agronomy, and other environmental sciences. The accuracy of meteorological data directly determine model performance. However, the interpolation of temperature and precipitation over complex areas is affected by the value observed with surrounding meteorological stations and also by aspects of the physical environment, such as terrain and land cover effects. These effects significantly limit the precise interpolation of temperature and precipitation. To normalize these effects, a new method coupling random forest (RF) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) was proposed, RF-IDW. The proposed method was applied to generate the climate surfaces of both precipitation and temperature in China in 2015. During the interpolation with RF-IDW, the temperature and precipitation were decomposed into a basic part (indicating the atmospheric properties) and local parts (representing the effects of the physical environment). The complex correlations were determined between precipitation/temperature and multiple-covariates of landcover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), elevation, slope, longitude, soil moisture, latitude and Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Next, 10-fold and leave-one-region-out cross-validation were applied to verify the accuracy of RF-IDW for the interpolation of meteorological values. We also compared the RF-IDW performance to that of RF, IDW, Anusplin, and MLR to further investigate its feasibility. Based on 10-fold cross-validation, the coefficient of determinations (R-2) between interpolated value and observed values were 0.962 for precipitation and 0.990 for temperature, indicating that the RF-IDW can accurately interpolate climate surfaces. The performance comparison showed that the RF-IDW reduced the mean absolute error by 55 mm to 120 mm for precipitation interpolation and 0.06 degrees C to 0.8 degrees C for temperature interpolation, especially in the complex region. The result of monthly interpolations implied the good robustness of the RF-IDW. Overall, the proposed RF-IDW approach allows improved spatial interpolation of complex region and suggest alternate methods for the spatial interpolation of hydrological variables.

TI  - Ozone profile retrievals from TROPOMI: Implication for the variation of tropospheric ozone during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in January and February 2020, production and living activities were drastically reduced to impede the spread of the virus, which also caused a strong reduction of the emission of primary pollutants. However, as a major species of secondary air pollutant, tropospheric ozone did not reduce synchronously, but instead rose in some region. Furthermore, higher concentrations of ozone may potentially promote the rates of COVID-19 infections, causing extra risk to human health. Thus, the variation of ozone should be evaluated widely. This paper presents ozone profiles and tropospheric ozone columns from ultraviolet radiances detected by TROPOospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard Sentinel 5 Precursor (S-5P) satellite based on the principle of optimal estimation method. We compare our TROPOMI retrievals with global ozonesonde observations, Fourier Transform Spectrometry (FTS) observation at Hefei (117.17 degrees E, 31.7 degrees N) and Global Positioning System (GPS) ozonesonde sensor (GPSO(3)) ozonesonde profiles at Beijing (116.46 degrees E, 39.80 degrees N). The integrated Tropospheric Ozone Column (TOC) and Stratospheric Ozone Column (SOC) show excellent agreement with validation data. We use the retrieved TOC combining with tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) of NO2 and HCHO from TROPOMI to assess the changes of tropospheric during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Although NO2 TVCD decreased by 63%, the retrieved TOC over east China increase by 10% from the 20-day averaged before the lockdown on January 23, 2020 to 20-day averaged after it. Because the production of ozone in winter is controlled by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) indicated by monitored HCHO, which did not present evident change during the lockdown, the production of ozone did not decrease significantly. Besides, the decrease of NOx emission weakened the titration of ozone, causing an increase of ozone. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we compare lands settled between 1862-1940 under the Homestead Act to lands that sold for cash during the same time. We combine recently digitised individual land patents with modern satellite data and find a negative effect of homesteading on modern land use that cannot be explained by land quality, title characteristics or unobserved differences in settlers. We test the hypothesis that early homestead settlement put homesteaders 'in the way' of future development, creating a path dependence in land use decisions for homesteads, despite the fact that their legal rights were identical to purchased lands.

TI  - Demystifying uncertainty in PM10 susceptibility mapping using variable drop-off in extreme-gradient boosting (XGB) and random forest (RF) algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates uncertainty in machine learning that can occur when there is significant variance in the prediction importance level of the independent variables, especially when the ROC fails to reflect the unbalanced effect of prediction variables. A variable drop-off loop function, based on the concept of early termination for reduction of model capacity, regularization, and generalization control, was tested. A susceptibility index for airborne particulate matter of less than 10 mu m diameter (PM10) was modeled using monthly maximum values and spectral bands and indices from Landsat 8 imagery, and Open Street Maps were used to prepare a range of independent variables. Probability and classification index maps were prepared using extreme-gradient boosting (XGBOOST) and random forest (RF) algorithms. These were assessed against utility criteria such as a confusion matrix of overall accuracy, quantity of variables, processing delay, degree of overfitting, importance distribution, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).

TI  - Dichotomous effects on lymphatic transport with loss of caveolae in mice
T2  - ACTA PHYSIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Fluid and macromolecule transport from the interstitium into and through lymphatic vessels is necessary for tissue homeostasis. While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominant route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation. Thus, how does the lack of caveolae impact "lymphatic function"?Methods Various aspects of lymphatic transport were measured in mice constitutively lacking caveolin-1 ("CavKO"), the protein required for caveolae formation in endothelial cells, and in mice with a LEC-specific Cav1 gene deletion (Lyve1-Cre x Cav1(flox/flox); "LyCav") and ex vivo in their vessels and cells.Results In each model, lymphatic architecture was largely unchanged. The lymphatic conductance, or initial tissue uptake, was significantly higher in both CavKO mice and LyCav mice by quantitative microlymphangiography and the permeability to 70 kDa dextran was significantly increased in monolayers of LECs isolated from CavKO mice. Conversely, transport within the lymphatic system to the sentinel node was significantly reduced in anaesthetized CavKO and LyCav mice. Isolated, cannulated collecting vessel studies identified significantly reduced phasic contractility when lymphatic endothelium lacks caveolae. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase was able to partially restore ex vivo vessel contractility.Conclusion Macromolecule transport across lymphatics is increased with loss of caveolae, yet phasic contractility reduced, resulting in reduced overall lymphatic transport function. These studies identify lymphatic caveolar biology as a key regulator of active lymphatic transport functions.

TI  - Breast cancer: comparison of quantitative dual-layer spectral CT and axillary ultrasonography for preoperative diagnosis of metastatic axillary lymph nodes
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY EXPERIMENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundOur aim was to compare the diagnostic performance of quantitative dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DLSCT) and axillary ultrasound (US) for diagnosing lymph node metastases in breast cancer patients.MethodsDLSCT and axillary US were prospectively performed in 70 needle biopsy-verified breast cancer patients. Histopathology and imaging data were available for evaluation in 36 axillae from 34 patients. In each patient, ipsilateral, contralateral, and inguinal lymph nodes (LNs) were semiautomatically segmented, and iodine density, spectral slope, Z effective, virtual non-contrast (VNC), conventional CT HU values, and Delta contrast enhancement (Delta CE, conventional CT HU minus VNC) were measured. Using histopathology as reference, the diagnostic performance of DLSCT and axillary US was compared.ResultsOf 36 axillae, 23 had metastatic lymph nodes. Compared with non-metastatic LNs, metastatic LNs had significantly different iodine density (p = 0.021), spectral slope (p <0.001), Z effective (p < 0.001), conventional CT HU values (p < 0.01), and <Delta>CE (p < 0.01). All DLSCT parameters were significantly different between arterial phase and portal-venous phase (p < 0.001) except for VNC (p = 0.092). Delta CE had the highest diagnostic performance (sensitivity 0.79, specificity 0.92, positive predictive value 0.95, negative predictive value 0.69) with a significantly increased sensitivity compared with conventional CT HU (p = 0.027). There were no significant differences between Delta CE and axillary US for sensitivity (p = 1.000) or specificity (p = 0.320).ConclusionsDLSCT is a promising quantitative technique for evaluating LN metastases and could potentially reduce the need for sentinel LN biopsy.

TI  - Variation of stroke-associated pneumonia in stroke units across England and Wales: A registry-based cohort study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPneumonia is common in stroke patients and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Prevalence of stroke-associated pneumonia varies between studies, and reasons for this variation remain unclear. We aimed to describe the variation of observed stroke-associated pneumonia in England and Wales and explore the influence of patient baseline characteristics on this variation.MethodsPatient data were obtained from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme for all confirmed strokes between 1 April 2013 and 31 December 2018. Stroke-associated pneumonia was defined by new antibiotic initiation for pneumonia within the first seven days of admission. The probability of stroke-associated pneumonia occurrence within stroke units was estimated and compared using a multilevel mixed model with and without adjustment for patient-level characteristics at admission.ResultsOf the 413,133 patients included, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 4 (IQR: 2-10) and 42.3% were aged over 80 years. Stroke-associated pneumonia was identified in 8.5% of patients. The median within stroke unit stroke-associated pneumonia prevalence was 8.5% (IQR: 6.1-11.5%) with a maximum of 21.4%. The mean and variance of the predicted stroke-associated pneumonia probability across stroke units decreased from 0.08 (0.68) to 0.05 (0.63) when adjusting for patient admission characteristics. This difference in the variance suggests that clinical characteristics account for 5% of the observed variation in stroke-associated pneumonia between units.ConclusionsPatient-level clinical characteristics contributed minimally to the observed variation of stroke-associated pneumonia between stroke units. Additional explanations for the observed variation in stroke-associated pneumonia need to be explored which could reduce variation in antibiotic use for stroke patients.

TI  - Real-time prediction of spatial raster time series: a context-aware autonomous learning model
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time prediction of spatial raster time series, such as those derived from satellite remote sensing imagery, is important for making emergency decisions on various geo-spatial processes/events. However, because of the scalability issue and large training time requirement, the neural network (NN)-based models often fail to perform real-time prediction, in spite of their tremendous potential. In this paper, we propose ContRast, a variant of recurrent NN-based context-aware raster time series prediction model that attempts to resolve these issues by: (1) eliminating the need for offline adjustment of network structure by employing self-evolving autonomous learning of recurrent neural network, (2) saving training time by adopting single-pass parameter learning mechanism, and (3) reducing redundant learning by skipping sub-regional data associated with similar spatio-temporal context and reusing already learned parameters to predict for the same. Experimental evaluations with respect to predicting normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-raster derived from MODIS Terra satellite remote sensing imagery show that ContRast is highly effective for real-time prediction of spatial raster time series, and it significantly outperforms the existing models. In addition, the theoretical analyses of model complexity and computational cost further justify our empirical observations.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline change analysis of Selangor was studied from Landsat satellite multispectral images taken during the years 1990-2015 and was analyzed using the digital shoreline analysis system technique. The results show that almost 51% of the total analyzed shoreline length experienced erosion. By comparing the average erosion rate between 5 coastal districts of Selangor, Kuala Selangor recorded the highest average erosion rate - 3.50 m/yr (endpoint rate) or - 3.64 m/yr (linear regression rate). The highest erosion rate for the entire Selangor coast was recorded in Kuala Selangor district coast with - 18.61 m/yr (endpoint rate) and - 19.78 m/yr (linear regression rate); these readings were recorded at Sungai Yu transect. Kuala Langat has been identified as the coastal district that has the highest percentages of erosion. (Thirty-nine percentage of total transects along Kuala Langat showed accretion.) Coastal adaptive capacity assessment of Selangor coastline indicates that about 123.05 km of the total analyzed shoreline length (327.23 km) has a low adaptive capacity (eroded), 40.18 km of the shoreline have a medium adaptive capacity (eroded) and 164 km of the shoreline has a high adaptive capacity of long-term shoreline trends.

T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale. Neo-adjuvant systemic therapy includes endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, which is widely used. Luminal breast cancer is resistant to chemotherapy and is more likely to not respond to chemotherapy before surgery. Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitor. Palbociclib with letrozole combination therapy was an effective chemotherapy in metastatic luminal type breast cancer and had fewer side effects; however, the benefit of palbociclib in neoadjuvant systemic therapy is unclear. Patient concerns A 50-year-old female patient visited our hospital with palpable lump in the right breast. The lymph nodes fixed in the ipsilateral axilla. Diagnosis The patient was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast; the nuclear grade was moderate. The ipsilateral fixed lymph node was diagnosed as metastasis. The breast cancer subtype was luminal A type and was positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and negative for HER2/neu and Ki-67 marker index Interventions Neo-systemic therapy was performed with 3 cycles of adriamycin with docetaxel. After follow-up study, the breast and axillary lesions progressed. Palbociclib with letrozole was administered as second neo-systemic therapy for 10 months. Subsequently, breast-conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Outcomes In the postoperative pathologic result, 4 mm invasive lesion remained, and the sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative. The results achieved a residual cancer burden classification class 1. Conclusion Second-line neo-systemic therapy can further reduce the size of the tumor and increase the likelihood of avoiding the side effects of surgery. Palbociclib with letrozole may be a good treatment in the preoperative stage for luminal breast cancer that is resistant to chemotherapy.

AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most common cancers of the Caucasian population and accounts for 20% of all skin tumors. An S3 guideline of the German Oncology Guidelines Program has been available since 2019. The diagnosis is based on the clinical examination. Excision and histological confirmation is required for all clinically suspicious lesions to allow prognostic assessment and correct treatment. The therapy of first choice is complete excision with histological control of the surgical margin. In cutaneous SCC with risk factors such as tumor thickness > 6 mm, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may be discussed, but there is currently no clear evidence regarding its prognostic and therapeutic relevance. Adjuvant radiotherapy may be considered if there is a high risk of recurrence, radiotherapy should be considered in case of inoperable tumors. For inoperable local or locoregional recurrence, electrochemotherapy can also be indicated. In case of inoperable/or metastasized SCC, the immune checkpoint inhibitor cemiplimab is approved and recommended as the therapy of first choice. In case of contraindications, chemotherapeutics, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors or palliative radiotherapy can be used. Since evidence is limited, systemic therapy should preferably be performed in clinical studies. Follow-up should be risk-adapted and includes dermatological examinations supplemented by ultrasound examinations in high-risk patients.

AB  - Recent studies provide an alarming view on the prevalence of burnout that has increased worldview markedly. This study aims to determine the level of burnout, association between socio-demographic characteristics and the correlation between burnout elements. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 118 critical care nurses using Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) to assess their emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA). It consists of 22 items with a 7 -point Likert type rating scale. No significant difference between socio-demographic characteristics and the levels of burnout. 64.4% of participants scored high on emotional exhaustion, most of the participants (72.9%) had high levels of depersonalization and 37.3% of the participants reported high levels of personal accomplishment. Despite having high levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, critical care nurses in the tertiary hospital can maintain a positive evaluation of their accomplishment.

TI  - A study of dry spells in Iran based on satellite data and their relationship with ENSO
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the maximum number of consecutive dry days (MCDDs) is one approach to analyze precipitation behavior in arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. This study is a first attempt to investigate the MCDDs and their relationship with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in winter months over Iran. The study was carried out using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data on a daily basis at 1 degrees latitude x 1 degrees longitude spatial resolution and reanalysis data for the period 1998-2019. Results showed that the highest values of MCDDs are observed in southeastern Iran and the lowest in northwestern Iran. Based on the coefficients of the linear trend of the MCDDs, the significant increasing trends are remarkably more abundant than declining trends, especially in the northern half of the country in December and January. The results regarding the relationship between ENSO and MCDDs indicated a non-stationary behavior, with a significant negative correlation for December (especially in the southwest) and positive correlation for January and February (especially in the southeast). The largest differences in the correlation coefficients were observed between December and January. In general, during El Nino (La Nina) phases, the length of MCDDs decreases (increases) in December and increases (decreases) in January especially in the southern half. By comparing different large-scale climate parameters for the 2 months, we found that during El Nino (La Nina) phases, a negative (positive) anomaly of geopotential height and a positive (negative) anomaly of zonal wind and specific humidity are observed over the region in December, while the opposite situation occurs in January. The innovation of this study is the use of satellite data that provide a continuous spatial coverage of the region and the consideration of the ENSO teleconnection pattern in regards to dry spells. We find that El Nino (La Nina) has contradictory effects on MCDDs in different winter months in the southern half of the country. These findings are of great importance for a country like Iran that lies in arid and semi-arid regions, as they can be useful for water resources management.

TI  - Field-scale soil moisture bridges the spatial-scale gap between drought monitoring and agricultural yields
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is highly variable in space and time, and deficits (i.e., droughts) play an important role in modulating crop yields. Limited hydroclimate and yield data, however, hamper drought impact monitoring and assessment at the farm field scale. This study demonstrates the potential of using field-scale soil moisture simulations to support high-resolution agricultural yield prediction and drought monitoring at the smallholder farm field scale. We present a multiscale modeling approach that combines HydroBlocks - a physically based hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM) - with machine learning. We used HydroBlocks to simulate root zone soil moisture and soil temperature in Zambia at 3 h 30 m resolution. These simulations, along with remotely sensed vegetation indices, meteorological data, and descriptors of the physical landscape (related to topography, land cover, and soils) were combined with district-level maize data to train a random forest (RF) model to predict maize yields at district and field scales (250 m). Our model predicted yields with an average testing coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.57 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 310 kg ha(-1) using year-based cross-validation. Our predicted maize losses due to the 2015-2016 El Nino drought agreed well with losses reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our results reveal that soil moisture is the strongest and most reliable predictor of maize yield, driving its spatial and temporal variability. Soil moisture was also a more effective indicator of drought impacts on crops than precipitation, soil and air temperatures, and remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based drought indices. This study demonstrates how field-scale modeling can help bridge the spatial-scale gap between drought monitoring and agricultural impacts.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Mapping to Investigate Coral Bleaching in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India Using Geoinformatics
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Andaman and Nicobar islands with vast variety of mostly endangered coral species are witnessing gradual coral bleaching. The present study focussed on temporal monitoring of various corals disposition along with impact of bleaching in two (North Reef and North Sentinel) islands of Andaman and Nicobar during the year 2010 and 2019. Floating algae index (FAI) and turbidity mapping was performed to evaluate the impact of excess macro algae on the coral reefs. The temporal coral mapping revealed that sand over reef, reefward front and exposed reef flat exhibit decrease by 2.23%, 18.55% and 33.86%, whereas algae over reef increased by 28.84%, respectively, in North Reef island. In case of North Sentinel island, exposed reef flat, sand over reef and reefward front decreased by 37.78%, 9.05%, 37.89%, whereas algae over reef increased by 55.81% during the observation period. FAI showed that in both islands concentration of macroalgae increased from year 2010 to 2019. Highest SST recorded for North Reef island was 35 degrees C in year 2017, whereas for North Sentinel island the highest value was 35 degrees C for year 2016. Turbidity values (11.86-44.53 NTU) clearly indicated pronounced effect of sedimentation and tourism activities in North Reef island which is corroborated by higher coral mortality conditions (24.70%) as compared to North Sentinel island (19.88%) reflecting increased bleaching on North Reef island. Accuracy assessment for coral classified image has been performed, for North Reef island overall accuracy of classified image for 2010 and 2019 is 86% and 84% for North Reef island, whereas for North Sentinel island overall accuracy of classified image for 2010 and 2019 is 83% and 82%.

TI  - Application of preoperative computed tomographic lymphography for precise sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer patients
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn light of the extensive application of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients and the recently investigated failure of SLNB after lumpectomy, it has become important to explore methods for preoperative mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and their lymphatics to direct precise SLNB and improve the identification rate of SLNs.MethodsTwenty-seven patients with suspected breast cancer based on the results of the clinical examination and imaging were enrolled in the study. Computed tomographic lymphography (CTLG) followed by CT three-dimensional reconstruction was performed to determine the localization of SLNs and lymphatics on the body surface preoperatively. Intraoperatively combined staining with methylene blue and indocyanine green was used to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of CTLG.ResultsSLNs and lymphatics from the breast were identified using CTLG in all patients, and preoperative SLNs and lymphatics localization on the body surface showed a significant role in the selection of operative incision and injection points. The accuracy rate of SLN and lymphatic detection by CTLG was 92.6% compared with intraoperatively combined staining. Moreover, preoperative CTLG performed well in SLN number detection, and the accuracy rate was 95.2%.ConclusionWe evaluate the procedure and application of preoperative CTLG in the superficial localization of SLNs and lymphatics, which may lead to a decreased incidence of cutting off the lymphatics of SLNs and consequently more rapid and accurate SLN detection. This method promotes personalized SLN mapping, providing detailed information about the number and anatomical location of SLNs and lymphatics for adequate surgical planning for breast cancer patients.

TI  - Unexpected greening in a boreal permafrost peatland undergoing forest loss is partially attributable to tree species turnover
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery are useful in measuring vegetation response to climate warming in remote northern regions. These indices show that productivity is generally declining in the boreal forest, but it is unclear which components of boreal vegetation are driving these trends. We aimed to compare trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to forest growth and demographic data taken from a 10 ha mapped plot located in a spruce-dominated boreal peatland. We used microcores to quantify recent growth trends and tree census data to characterize mortality and recruitment rates of the three dominant tree species. We then compared spatial patterns in growth and demography to patterns in Landsat-derived maximum NDVI trends (1984-2019) in 78 pixels that fell within the plot. We found that NDVI trends were predominantly positive (i.e., "greening") in spite of the ongoing loss of black spruce (the dominant species; 80% of stems) from the plot. The magnitude of these trends correlated positively with black spruce growth trends, but was also governed to a large extent by tree mortality and recruitment. Greening trends were weaker (lower slope) in areas with high larch mortality, and high turnover of spruce and birch, but stronger (higher slope) in areas with high larch recruitment. Larch dominance is currently low (similar to 11% of stems), but it is increasing in abundance as permafrost thaw progresses and will likely have a substantial influence on future NDVI trends. Our results emphasize that NDVI trends in boreal peatlands can be positive even when the forest as a whole is in decline, and that the magnitude of trends can be strongly influenced by the demographics of uncommon species.

TI  - Stroke Risk Among Elderly Users of Haloperidol and Typical Antipsychotics Versus Atypical Antipsychotics: A Real-World Study From a US Health Insurance Claims Database
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimated stroke risk associated with new exposure to haloperidol, or any typical antipsychotic, versus atypical antipsychotic among patients aged >= 65 years regardless of dementia status. Methods: IBM MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Database data (January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2017) were used. Stroke risk for new users of typical antipsychotics (T1 cohort) or haloperidol (T2 cohort) was compared with new users of atypical antipsychotics (C1 cohort) aged >= 65 years. Crude incidence rate (IR) and incidence proportion of stroke were estimated within each cohort and gender subgroup. Three propensity score (PS) matching strategies were employed: Unadjusted (crude), Sentinel PS replication, and a large-scale regularized regression model (adapted PS). Results: Overall, 36,734 (T1), 24,074 (T2), and 226,990 (C1) patients were included. Crude IRs for stroke per 1000 person-years were 17.67 (T1), 23.74 (T2), and 14.17 (C1). In preplanned analyses, PS-matched calibrated hazard ratio (cHR) for stroke T1 versus C1 cohort was 1.08 (95% calibrated confidence interval [cCI] = 0.75, 1.55) with Sentinel PS strategy and 1.31 (95% cCI = 1.07, 1.60) with adapted PS strategy. The cHR for stroke in patients of T2 versus C1 was 1.69 (95% cCI = 1.08, 2.75) with Sentinel PS strategy and 1.45 (95% cCI = 1.17, 1.80) with adapted PS strategy. Conclusion: Stroke risk in elderly new users of haloperidol was elevated compared to new users of atypical antipsychotics and was elevated for typical antipsychotics using the adapted PS strategy.

TI  - Quad-pol Advanced Land Observing Satellite / Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS/PALSAR-2) data for modelling secondary forest above-ground biomass in the central Brazilian Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests (SFs) are one of the major carbons sinks in the Neotropics due to the rapid carbon assimilation in their above-ground biomass (AGB). However, the accurate contribution of SFs to the carbon cycle is a great challenge because of the uncertainty in AGB estimates. In this context, the main objective of this study is to explore full polarimetric Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS/PALSAR-2) data to model SFs AGB in the Central Amazon. We carried out the forest inventory in 2014, measuring 23 field plots. Supplementary land-use classification history was used to create 120 additional independent sample plots by adjusting growth curves using SFs age and previous land-use intensity from field plots and literature database. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis was performed to select the best model by corrected weighted Akaike Information Criterion (AICw) and validated by the leave-one-out bootstrapping method. The best-fitted model has six parameters and explained 65% of the above-ground biomass variability. The prediction error was of Root Mean Square Error of the Prediction (RMSEP) = 8.8 +/- 3.0 tonnes ha(-1) (8.8%). The most explanatory variables for modelling secondary forest AGB were those that result from multiple scattering (Shannon Entropy), volumetric scattering (Bhattacharya decomposition), and double-bounce scattering (ratio VV/HH, vertically transmitted and received polarization/horizontally transmitted and received polarization). Including past-use of SF areas in the model with the Landsat time series classification, as the frequency of clear cuts and the number of years of active land-use before abandonment, the MLR has increased by 10%, achieving 71% of the variability explained by the model. The uncertainty report showed that ground truth AGB estimation (inventory, allometry, and plot expansion factors) might represent 50% of the errors in the modelling estimation. In contrast, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) inversion models (SAR error and regression) have achieved 20%. The results showed that additional information on secondary forest land-use history could improve the performance of AGB recovery models, as well as can be used to expand the sampling units on tropical forests.

TI  - Change detection of riparian woodland vegetation in the Okavango Delta, Botswana
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian vegetation in the Okavango Delta has extensive economic, social and environmental benefits. However, despite its importance, it is threatened by changes in variation in hydrology, anthropogenic activities, and other environmental conditions. Some riparian vegetation communities may change rapidly in response to both long term and short term disturbances. Long term monitoring of riparian woodland vegetation can help reveal changes in these woodland species, enabling timeous management interventions. In this study we classified, mapped and conducted change detection analysis of the spatial extent of different communities of riparian woodland in the Okavango Delta. Woodland species were identified in the field and their percentage cover estimated. Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis in PC-ORD was used to classify woodland vegetation into four communities. These communities were Croton megalobotrys-Hyphaene petersiana, Vachellia erioloba-Gymnosporia senegalensis, Phoenix reclinata-Syzygium cordatum and Vachellia tortilis-Combretum imberbe. Multi response permutation procedures (MRPP) was used to test if there was any significant difference in plant species composition between different vegetation communities. MRPP showed that communities varied significantly (p < 0.05) from each other in composition, which may be indicative of the prevailing environmental conditions in the Delta. Landsat data was used to produce land cover maps at 3 time-steps which were then used in the change detection analysis for riparian woodland vegetation. Phoenix reclinata-Syzygium cordatum areal extent increased from 1991 to 2019, whilst Croton megalobotrys-Hyphaene petersiana decreased. The area covered by Vachellia tortilis-Combretum imberbe and Vachellia erioloba-Gymnosporia senegalensis was fluctuating over the study period. The results suggest that the Phoenix reclinata-Syzygium cordatum community is more susceptible to variations in hydrology whilst the Vachellia erioloba-Gymnosporia senegalensis community is more stable. The Croton megalobotrys-Hyphaene petersiana and Vachellia tortilis-Combretum imberbe communities are also susceptible to prevailing environmental conditions including the hydrology, soil nutrient status as well as the occurrence of elephants in large densities in the Delta and anthropogenic activities. This information will serve as baseline for monitoring of riparian woodland vegetation in the Okavango Delta.

TI  - Granulometric characterization of sediments in the anastomosed system of the Apure river Venezuela
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Apure river is the largest tributary of the Orinoco river basin in the Venezuelan plains, it transports considerable amounts of sediments in the range of coarse sand to clay, and its distribution is fundamental to understand the processes of sedimentation in the different fluvial environments. However, little attention has been given to its sedimentary features. We present a field investigation of the different streams of the anastomosis system, which are controlled by a change in the underlying lithostratigraphy of the channel. We analyze the grain size distribution of the sediments in the different fluvial environments to understand the patterns of evacuation and the transport mechanisms under conditions of variable energy. We examine seven sections distributed in an area of 65 km2, where the distribution of the morphosedimentary environments from a combination of data of Landsat 8 images, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and sedimentological samples in the field were stablished. We found a predominance of fine to medium silt (71%) in relation to the clay (18%) and sand (11%). This variation is mainly associated to the existence of controls of lithological origin. The C-M diagram suggest that the sediments were transported in a graded to uniform suspension. This study reveals that sorting and transport of sediment in the anastomosis system of the study area is mainly influenced by the hydrodynamic of the flow stream. This study requires additional validation; however, it supports that changes in the amount and distribution of grain size within the fluvial system affect the morphology of the channel in anastomosis rivers, and it help to improve the present understanding of the sedimentological records and the geomorphological changes, determine the stability of the channel, and its environmental effects.

TI  - The real potential of current passive satellite data to map aboveground biomass in tropical forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass estimation at large scale is challenging and generally entails large uncertainty in tropical regions. With their wall-to-wall coverage ability, passive remote sensing signals are frequently used to extrapolate field estimates of forest aboveground biomass (AGB). However, studies often use limited reference data and/or flawed validation schemes and thus report unreliable extrapolation error estimates. Here, we compared the ability of three medium- to high-resolution passive satellite sensors, Landsat-8 (L8), Sentinel-2B (S2) and Worldview-3 (WV3), to map AGB in a forest landscape of Thailand. We used a large airborne LiDAR-derived AGB dataset as a reference to train and validate a random forest algorithm and conducted robust error assessments and variable selection using spatialized cross-validations. Our results indicate that the selected predictors strongly varied among the three sensors and between analyses were restricted to low (<= 200 Mg ha(-1)) and high (>200 Mg ha(-1)) AGB areas. WV3 and S2 data outperformed L8 data to extrapolate AGB (RMSE of 68 and 72 against 84 Mg ha(-1), respectively) due to the inclusion of the red-edge band and, probably, to their higher spatial and spectral resolution. Sensitivity to large AGB values was higher for WV3 than for S2 and L8 with saturation point of 247 Mg ha(-1) against 204 and 192 Mg ha(-1). AGB values above these saturation points remained poorly predictable, especially for L8, indicating that several tropical forest AGB maps should be interpreted with extreme caution. However, predicted gradients of lower AGB values (<= 200 Mg ha(-1)), i.e., in early forest successional stages, were fairly consistent among sensors (r > 0.70), even if the mean absolute difference between estimates was large when AGB predictions were extrapolated out of the calibration area at regional level (34%). We finally showed that calibrating the model only within the sensitivity AGB domain (e.g., <200 Mg ha(-1)) minimizes the risk of induced bias for estimating small AGB values. These results provide important benchmarks for interpreting previously published maps and to improve future validation schemes.

TI  - Cultural religiosity moderates the relationship between perceived societal injustice and satisfaction with one's life
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mono-cultural studies have demonstrated that individual religiosity buffers the negative relationship between perceived injustice and personal well-being. However, it is unclear whether this relationship holds as strongly across societies with varying levels of cultural religiosity. We argue that higher levels of societal religiosity provide a cultural context that reduces pressure on its members to ameliorate societal injustice and consequently attenuates the link between injustice and an individual's satisfaction with life. To test this hypothesis, we assessed representative citizens from 136 societies with varying levels of religiosity, individual perceptions of societal injustice, and satisfaction with life. Using multi-level modeling on responses from 362,340 respondents, while controlling for societal wealth and societal freedom, we found that the relationship between injustice and life satisfaction was pan-societal but also that it was weaker at higher levels of societal religiosity. We explain this attenuation effect by arguing that sociocultural contexts higher in religiosity provide a worldview and set of value priorities that support their members to disengage from concerns about secular affairs and orient their concerns towards transcendent issues, deriving their satisfaction from less worldly pursuits.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological models are a conceptual representation of a simplified hydrological cycle. The hydrological cycle is the water cycle that circulates water from the land surface to the atmosphere and back again to the land. With the use of Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS), an event-based model and a continous hydrological model were established in Zijinguan watershed of Daqinghe River basin. To study the loss methods provided by HEC-HMS and its appropriateness for model fitting, is the main objective of this paper. The watershed was delineated with HEC-GeoHMS in ArcGIS, and its properties were extracted from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of 30 m x 30 m. The HEC-HMS includes a soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method and a soil moisture calculation (SMA) loss method, simulating the event and continuous runoff, respectively. SCS Unit hydrograph and Muskingum were used for flow routing. Specifically, eight rainfall events were selected for calibrating (6 events) and verifying (2 events) the event-based model. Similarly, for the continuous model the wet seasons of eight different years were used for calibration and verification. The calibrated parameters of the events model were used in the continuous model. The soil moisture and evapotranspiration data were decoded from the satellite data to set in the continuous model. The performance of SCS-CN and SMA models was compared. During the calibration period, the values of NSE, PEV and PEPF range from 0.605 to 0.744, 3.1 to 13.58%, and 11.104 to 27.72%, and during validation they are 0.527 to 0.634, 4.35% to 5.01%, and 13.66% to 27.88%, for SCS-CN model. For the SMA model, the values of NSE, PEV and PEPF during calibration range from 0.434 to 0.604, 2.879 to 34.326%, -4.831 to 57.48%, and during validation they are 0.094 to 0.624, -19.52% to -12.55%, and 40.213% to 50.15%. Overall, the performance of SCS-CN model is found more satisfactory than that of SMA model.

TI  - Deforestation susceptibility assessment and prediction in hilltop mining-affected forest region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work mainly focused on deforestation susceptibility (DS) assessment and its prediction based on statistical models (FR, LR & AHP) in the Saranda forest, India. Also, efforts had been made to quantify the effect of mining on deforestation. We had considered twenty-five (twenty present and five predicted) causative variables of deforestation, including climate, natural or geomorphological, forestry, topographical, environmental, and anthropogenic. The predicted variables have been generated from different simulation models. Also, very high-resolution, Google Earth imagery have been used in time series analysis for deforestation from 1987 to 2020 data and generated dependent variable. On deforestation analysis, it was observed that a total of 4197.84 ha forest areas were lost in the study region due to illegal mining, agricultural and tribal people allied activities. The DS results have shown that of total existing forest area, 11.22% area were under very high, 16.08% under high, 16.18% under moderate, 24.25% under low, and 32.27% falls very low categories. According to the DS assessment and predicted results, the very high susceptibility classes were found at and close to mines, agricultural, roads and settlement's surrounding sites. The sensitivity analysis results also shown that some causative variables (maximum temperature (2.95%), minimum temperature (0.51%), rainfall (2.69%), LST (4.56%), hot spot (7.36%), aspect (1.14%), NDVI (2.64%), forest density (3.78%), lithology (3.26%), geomorphology (3.00%), distance from agricultural (19.40%), soil type (2.05%), solar radiation (5.97%), LULC (3.26%), drought (3.16%), altitude (2.85%), slope (5.97%), distance from mines (18.05%), roads (2.17%), and settlements (5.18%)) were more sensitive to deforestation. Most of the sensitive parameters showed a positive correlation with DS. The AUC values of the ROC curve had shown a better fit for AHP (0.72) than (0.69) FR and LR (0.68) models for present DS results. The correlation results had shown a good inverse relationship between DS and distance from mines and foliar dust concentration. This work will espouse the future work in the effective planning and management of the mining-affected forest region and predicted deforestation susceptibility would be helpful for forest ecosystem study and policymaking.

TI  - Applying machine learning methods to detect convection using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) advanced baseline imager (ABI) data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - An ability to accurately detect convective regions is essential for initializing models for short-term precipitation forecasts. Radar data are commonly used to detect convection, but radars that provide high-temporal-resolution data are mostly available over land, and the quality of the data tends to degrade over mountainous regions. On the other hand, geostationary satellite data are available nearly anywhere and in near-real time. Current operational geostationary satellites, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) and Satellite-17, provide highspatial- and high-temporal-resolution data but only of cloud top properties; 1 min data, however, allow us to observe convection from visible and infrared data even without vertical information of the convective system. Existing detection algorithms using visible and infrared data look for static features of convective clouds such as overshooting top or lumpy cloud top surface or cloud growth that occurs over periods of 30 min to an hour. This study represents a proof of concept that artificial intelligence (AI) is able, when given highspatial- and high-temporal-resolution data from GOES-16, to learn physical properties of convective clouds and automate the detection process.A neural network model with convolutional layers is proposed to identify convection from the high-temporal resolution GOES-16 data. The model takes five temporal images from channel 2 (0.65 mu m) and 14 (11.2 mu m) as inputs and produces a map of convective regions. In order to provide products comparable to the radar products, it is trained against Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS), which is a radar-based product that uses a rather sophisticated method to classify precipitation types. Two channels from GOES-16, each related to cloud optical depth (channel 2) and cloud top height (channel 14), are expected to best represent features of convective clouds: high reflectance, lumpy cloud top surface, and low cloud top temperature. The model has correctly learned those features of convective clouds and resulted in a reasonably low false alarm ratio (FAR) and high probability of detection (POD). However, FAR and POD can vary depending on the threshold, and a proper threshold needs to be chosen based on the purpose.

TI  - Aerosol characteristics from earth observation systems: A comprehensive investigation over South Asia (2000?2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study summarizes two decades (2000?2019) of climatology and trends in aerosol loading and optical properties using a high spatial resolution data obtained from NASA?s MODIS MAIAC and MISR aerosol products supplemented by moderate resolution aerosol data from OMI sensor over South Asia (SA). MISR AOD showed good agreement against AERONET AOD with 68.68% of the retrievals falling within the expected error and high Pearson?s correlation coefficient (R = 0.83). The 20 years geometric mean of MAIAC and MISR AOD revealed higher loading of aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Eastern coast of India by 30% to 44% compared to the mean AOD over the entire SA. The highest mean AOD under cloud-free conditions was noted during monsoon season, followed by pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter. The high contribution of coarsemode AOD (cAOD) mainly from natural aerosol emission and small-mode AOD (sAOD) from local anthropogenic emissions are the main driver to high AOD in monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. Besides, the presence of high humidity during the monsoon season favors the hygroscopic growth of the particles and leads to higher AOD values over SA. The high spatial resolutions of MODIS/MAIAC and MISR aerosol products enabled the identification of previously unobserved aerosol hotspots over Bihar, West Bengal, and the eastern Indian coastal state of Odisha, which is mainly dominated by small aerosol particles. The contributions of smaller aerosol particles to the total aerosol loading were found to be higher during post-monsoon and winter over most states in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In contrast, the contribution of coarser particles was higher over Pakistan during premonsoon and monsoon seasons. Smaller particles were predominantly retrieved over the Indian states dominated by mining industries, including Jharkhand and Odisha. A typical dominance of absorbing carbonaceous aerosols was also noted over the northwestern region of IGP during post-monsoon, which otherwise was mainly affected by mixed dust aerosols and carbonaceous aerosols in pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. A statistically significant positive temporal trend in AOD was observed for the whole study period, over most of the SA region, which was influenced by the increase in small particles over India and Bangladesh. Urban/industrial weakly absorbing aerosols were found to be the main contributor to a similarly positive trend over Central India and East coast Indian states. Overall, recent advancements in high spatial resolution satellite-based aerosol optical properties showed good potential to identify the aerosol hotspots and constrain aerosol types across a highly polluted SA region.

TI  - Drought analysis and groundwater prioritization of a typical data-scarce drought-prone hydrological basin using geospatial techniques
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of recurrent drought events have necessitated the spatiotemporal trends analysis of drought and prioritization of groundwater resource in Sokoto-Rima River Basin. Difference Drought Index (DDI) was calculated from downloaded MODIS satellite images in dry seasons within two decadal windows (2000-2018). The index confirmed the trails of droughts in the basin with sub-basins I and IV the worst hit. Morphometric analysis of the basin revealed sixth order and elongated basin type with all the sub-basins flowing in South eastern direction. The favorable geomorphic units for groundwater prospecting can be found in dissected hills, folded mountain, and flood plains. Structural analysis revealed low lineament density and length in sub-basins I and II and high in sub-basins III and IV respectively. Sub-basins IV and I have been ranked as the groundwater deficit and surplus basins respectively using the results obtained from geomorphic, morphometric, and structural analyses. The results obtained from the spatiotemporal trends and sub-basin wise prioritization analyses affirmed that agricultural practices and availability of groundwater resources in sub-basin IV will be at great risk. Conclusively, this study accurately identified areas under groundwater scarcity and these techniques can be applied to any hydrological basin. The regional hydrogeological mapping of aquifers is recommended for further understanding on their vulnerability and resilience to drought events.

TI  - Scapular winging in surgical treatment of breast cancer, prospective study to optimize the follow-up protocol
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction One of the most common complications of the surgical treatment of breast cancer is limited range-of-motion in the shoulder. Scapular winging is one of the most underdiagnosed shoulder mobility impairments. Objective The main objective of this study was to determine the incidence of scapular winging in patients who underwent breast cancer surgery as the basis for expanding the protocol to patients who have had a sentinel lymph node biopsy. The secondary objective was to determine the risk factors that lead to the development of a winged scapula presented after breast cancer treatment in our sample. Methods This was a prospective, observational, and multidisciplinary study. Between 2013 and 2018, 214 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and treated for it surgically were followed by Rehabilitation Department for 3 years. The patients were evaluated in the 1st, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th and 36th months following surgery. Scapular winging was evaluated at each visit by means of static and dynamic tests. Results The cumulative incidence of scapular winging was 3.6% and seven cases of winged scapula were diagnosed. All the cases were diagnosed at the first visit, 1 month after the intervention. In the univariate analysis, the axillary lymph node dissection technique was a more significant risk factor for a winged scapula than sentinel lymph node biopsy. Conclusions The axillary lymph node dissection technique is a risk factor for developing a winged scapula. No evidence was found for any other significant risk factor.

TI  - Specifying the relationship between land use/land cover change and dryness in central Vietnam from 2000 to 2019 using Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) change and climate change are thought to be closely related and mutually influential, especially in contexts where land is converted for urban expansion or agriculture. We represent a first attempt to specify the relationship between LULC change and dryness in a region of Vietnam that is profoundly affected by climate change. Using the temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI), we specified the relationships and changes underway in Vietnam's Ba river basin, one of the largest river systems in the South Central Coast. Using Google Earth Engine, we extracted land use data from Landsat images and calculated TVDI values from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for 2000 to 2019. We found, first, that agricultural area and deforestation rose by 7.2% and 2.4% annually, respectively. These changes were driven by economic development, rising crop prices, illegal logging, wildfires, and emergence of new agricultural areas. Second, areas classified in the driest TVDI intervals (dry and very dry) occupied 57% of the basin in 2019, 70% of which was agricultural lands and 20% other (mainly urban and bare lands). These driest land categories expanded at an average rate of 0.08% to 0.1% per year. Moreover, 90% of areas classified as "very wet" and "wet" were forest. We observed a strong relationship between LULC change and TVDI. Climate change and LULC change thus appear to be propelling the basin's climate toward increasing dryness, suggesting the need for policies to reduce the agricultural area and expand forests while developing more adaptive and sustainable livelihoods.

TI  - Identification of polluted clouds and composition analysis based on GF-5 DPC data
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Large amounts of fine polluted particles due to anthropogenic activities can enter into the lower at-mosphere and may pollute the lower water clouds, especially continental cumulus. Continental polluted cumulus (CPCU) plays an important role in the process of atmospheric radiative transfer and the Earth's environmental change. Based on the sensitivity of polarization to small particles, GF-5 DPC data were used to identify polluted clouds. In addition, dynamic transport and composition of polluted clouds were further analyzed. Firstly, a novel method based on two tests was used to identify polluted clouds in China. The source and transport characteristics of the polluted clouds were analyzed by using wind field and backward trajectory pattern. Secondly, based on the monitoring data from the Sun-sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET), the types of atmospheric aerosol composition in China were classified into ten types by considering influences of the climate types, Digital Elevation Model and social econ-omy, etc. Finally, the composition of polluted clouds in different regions was further identified according to regional aerosol composition, and the results were verified by the Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) software. The identifying results of polluted clouds showed that there were four polluted clouds over China on May 27, 2018 and high concentration of small dust particles. The changes in the component ratios of different polluted clouds respond well to the results of airflow sources and transport. Compared with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) data, the proposed method is effective and robust. The proposed method of identification and composition analysis based on GF-5 DPC data for polluted clouds can enrich the application of DPC data in the field of atmospheric and environmental detection.

TI  - The Role of Worldview in Moral Case Deliberation: Visions and Experiences of Group Facilitators
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the role of worldview in moral case deliberation (MCD). MCD is a form of clinical ethics support which aims to assist caregivers in reflection on moral dilemmas, experienced in daily practice. Bioethicists acknowledge that existential and religious aspects must be taken into account in the analysis of ethical questions, but it remains unclear how these elements are addressed in clinical ethics support. We investigated how facilitators of MCD address worldview in MCD. MCD facilitation is often done by spiritual caregivers, but not in their role as spiritual caregiver. Discussing worldview is no standard part of the procedure in MCD. This study was qualitative, focusing on the views and experiences of the facilitators of MCD. Semi-structured interviews (N = 12) were conducted with facilitators of MCD. Grounded theory was used for analysis. The results show that worldview plays both an explicit and an implicit role in the MCD process. The explicit role concerns the religious beliefs of patients and professionals. This calls for avoiding stereotyping and devoting attention to different visions. The implicit role comes to the fore in addressing core values and spiritual fulfillment. In order to clarify the fundamental nature of values, more explicit attention for worldview might be useful during MCD. However, this should be done with caution as the term 'worldview' might be interpreted by participants in terms of religious and personal beliefs, rather than as an invitation to reflect on one's view of the good life as a whole.

TI  - Measuring diversity from space: a global view of the free and open source rasterdiv R package under a coding perspective
T2  - COMMUNITY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation of species diversity over space and time has been widely recognised as a key challenge in ecology. However, measuring species diversity over large areas might be difficult for logistic reasons related to both time and cost savings for sampling, as well as accessibility of remote ecosystems. In this paper, we present a new R package - rasterdiv - to calculate diversity indices based on remotely sensed data, by discussing the theory behind the developed algorithms. Obviously, measures of diversity from space should not be viewed as a replacement of in situ data on biological diversity, but they are rather complementary to existing data and approaches. In practice, they integrate available information of Earth surface properties, including aspects of functional (structural, biophysical and biochemical), taxonomic, phylogenetic and genetic diversity. Making use of the rasterdiv package can result useful in making multiple calculations based on reproducible open source algorithms, robustly rooted in Information Theory.

TI  - Using TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) measurements and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) CO modelling to understand the contribution of meteorology and emissions to an extreme air pollution event in India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several ambient air quality records corroborate the severe and persistent degradation of air quality over northern India during the winter months, with evidence of a continued, increasing trend of pollution across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) over the past decade. A combination of atmospheric dynamics and uncertain emissions, including the post-monsoon agricultural stubble burning, make it challenging to resolve the role of each individual factor. Here we demonstrate the potential use of an atmospheric transport model, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) to identify and quantify the role of transport mechanisms and emissions on the occurrence of the pollution events. The investigation is based on the use of carbon monoxide (CO) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite and the surface measurement network, as well as the WRF-Chem simulations, to investigate the factors contributing to CO enhancement over India during November 2018. We show that the simulated column-averaged dry air mole fraction (XCO) is largely consistent with TROPOMI observations, with a spatial correlation coefficient of 0.87. The surface-level CO concentrations show larger sensitivities to boundary layer dynamics, wind speed, and diverging source regions, leading to a complex concentration pattern and reducing the observation-model agreement with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0.41 to 0.60 for measurement locations across the IGP. We find that daily satellite observations can provide a first-order inference of the CO transport pathways during the enhanced burning period, and this transport pattern is reproduced well in the model. By using the observations and employing the model at a comparable resolution, we confirm the significant role of atmospheric dynamics and residential, industrial, and commercial emissions in the production of the exorbitant level of air pollutants in northern India. We find that biomass burning plays only a minimal role in both column and surface enhancements of CO, except for the state of Punjab during the high pollution episodes. While the model reproduces observations reasonably well, a better understanding of the factors controlling the model uncertainties is essential for relating the observed concentrations to the underlying emissions. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of undertaking rigorous policy measures, mainly focusing on reducing residential, commercial, and industrial emissions in addition to actions already underway in the agricultural sectors.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity of eDNA Transport Improves Stream Assessment of Threatened Salmon Presence, Abundance, and Location
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of environmental DNA (eDNA) within management strategies for lotic organisms requires translating eDNA detection and quantification data into inferences of the locations and abundances of target species. Understanding how eDNA is distributed in space and time within the complex environments of rivers and streams is a major factor in achieving this translation. Here we study bidimensional eDNA signals in streams to predict the position and abundance of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) juveniles. We use data from sentinel cages with a range of abundances (3-63 juveniles) that were deployed in three coastal streams in New Brunswick, Canada. We evaluate the spatial patterns of eDNA dispersal and determine the effect of discharge on the dilution rate of eDNA. Our results show that eDNA exhibits predictable plume dynamics downstream from sources, with eDNA being initially concentrated and transported in the midstream, but eventually accumulating in stream margins with time and distance. From these findings we developed a fish detection and distribution prediction model based on the eDNA ratio in midstream versus bankside sites for a variety of fish distribution scenarios. Finally, we advise that sampling midstream at every 400 m is sufficient to detect a single fish at low velocity, but sampling efforts need to be increased at higher water velocity (every 100 m in the systems surveyed in this study). Studying salmon eDNA spatio-temporal patterns in lotic environments is essential to developing strong quantitative population assessment models that successfully leverage eDNA as a tool to protect salmon populations.

TI  - Impact of immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy among men who have sex with men infected with HIV in Chengdu, southwest China: trends analysis, 2008-2018
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Given the rampant HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Chengdu, southwest China, Treat All policy, defined as immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation after HIV diagnosis, was implemented since 2014. Real-world research evaluating impacts of immediate ART on HIV epidemics is needed to optimize policy-making as national and international guidelines have been lowering ART eligibility threshold. The purpose of this study is to: assess temporal trends of the HIV epidemic and impacts of Treat All policy among MSM; and lay foundation for HIV-related policy evaluation using longitudinal routine data from health information systems. Methods Data used in this study were HIV sentinel seroprevalence, annual reported HIV cases and ART coverage rate among MSM in Chengdu from 2008 to 2018, derived from national HIV/AIDS information system. Temporal trends of the HIV epidemic were described using Joinpoint Regression Program. Interrupted time-series method was deployed to evaluate Treat All policy. Results HIV sentinel seroprevalence rose from 11.20% in 2008 to 17.67% in 2013 and Annual Percent Change (APC) was 8.25% (95% CI - 2.40%, 20.07%), then decreased to 5.17% in 2018 (APC = - 19.63%, 95% CI - 27.54%, - 10.86%). Newly reported HIV cases increased from 168 cases in 2008 to 1232 cases in 2015 (APC = 26.99%, 95% CI 21.32%, 32.93%), and reduced to 1014 cases in 2018 (APC = - 8.80%, 95% CI - 18.45%, 2.01%). ART coverage rate has been climbing from 11.11% in 2008 to 92.29% in 2018 and Average Annual Percent Change was 16.09% (95% CI 11.76%, 20.59%). Results of interrupted time-series models showed that compared to an annual increase of 0.87% during pre-policy period, there was a decline of 3.08% (95% CI - 0.0366%, - 0.0250%) per year of HIV sentinel seroprevalence since 2014; and compared to an annual increase of 116 cases before 2014, there was an annual drop of 158 newly reported HIV cases (95% CI - 194.87%, - 121.69%) during the post-policy period. Conclusions Immediate ART after HIV diagnosis could potentially curb HIV transmission at population level among MSM, along with other strategies. Future assessment of HIV prevention and control policy can be carried out using routinely collected longitudinal data from health information systems.

TI  - Greening the career incentive structure for local officials in China: Does less pollution increase the chances of promotion for Chinese local leaders?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Does it pay to be "greener" as a local official in China? In this paper, we examine the effect of local environment regulation outcomes, i.e., local pollution, on leaders' chances of promotion. This is an important question because only when the Chinese cadre evaluation system rewards local officials' green behaviors, these officials would move away from their past priority in promoting economic growth at all costs, so that the environmental crisis in China might be addressed. We collect party secretary data for Chinese counties between 2001 and 2014 to measure promotion patterns. We construct county-year SO2 and PM2.5 pollution measures using NASA satellite data. We adopt an instrumental variable approach to deal with potential endogeneity issues of the pollution variables: for both PM 2.5 and SO2, we use ventilation coefficient, i.e., the product of wind speed and mixing layer height, as the instrument. Our empirical analysis shows that for county party secretaries, those who are able to reduce air pollution are more likely to be promoted. We find similar results for county magistrates. However, we do not find evidence for this pollution-promotion link for prefecture and provincial party secretaries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - North American boreal forests are a large carbon source due to wildfires from 1986 to 2016
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are a major disturbance to forest carbon (C) balance through both immediate combustion emissions and post-fire ecosystem dynamics. Here we used a process-based biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), to simulate C budget in Alaska and Canada during 1986-2016, as impacted by fire disturbances. We extracted the data of difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) for fires from Landsat TM/ETM imagery and estimated the proportion of vegetation and soil C combustion. We observed that the region was a C source of 2.74 Pg C during the 31-year period. The observed C loss, 57.1 Tg C year(-1), was attributed to fire emissions, overwhelming the net ecosystem production (1.9 Tg C year(-1)) in the region. Our simulated direct emissions for Alaska and Canada are within the range of field measurements and other model estimates. As burn severity increased, combustion emission tended to switch from vegetation origin towards soil origin. When dNBR is below 300, fires increase soil temperature and decrease soil moisture and thus, enhance soil respiration. However, the post-fire soil respiration decreases for moderate or high burn severity. The proportion of post-fire soil emission in total emissions increased with burn severity. Net nitrogen mineralization gradually recovered after fire, enhancing net primary production. Net ecosystem production recovered fast under higher burn severities. The impact of fire disturbance on the C balance of northern ecosystems and the associated uncertainties can be better characterized with long-term, prior-, during- and post-disturbance data across the geospatial spectrum. Our findings suggest that the regional source of carbon to the atmosphere will persist if the observed forest wildfire occurrence and severity continues into the future.

TI  - The "Great Debate" at Melanoma Bridge 2020: December, 5th, 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Debate session at the 2020 Melanoma Bridge virtual congress (December 3rd-5th, Italy) featured counterpoint views from experts on five specific controversial issues in melanoma. The debates considered whether or not innate immunity is important in the response to cancer and immunotherapy, how useful are the revised American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification for the staging of patients, the use of sentinel node biopsy for staging patients, the use of triplet combination of targeted therapy plus immunotherapy versus combined immunotherapy, and the respective benefits of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant therapy. As is usual with Bridge congresses, the debates were assigned by meeting Chairs and positions taken by experts during the debates may not have necessarily reflected their own personal opinion.

TI  - An entropy-based approach for the optimization of rain gauge network using satellite and ground-based data
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and precise rainfall records are crucial for hydrological applications and water resources management. The accuracy and continuity of ground-based time series rely on the density and distribution of rain gauges over territories. In the context of a decline of rain gauge distribution, how to optimize and design optimal networks is still an unsolved issue. In this work, we present a method to optimize a ground-based rainfall network using satellite-based observations, maximizing the information content of the network. We combine Climate Prediction Center MORPhing technique (CMORPH) observations at ungauged locations with an existing rain gauge network in the Rio das Velhas catchment, in Brazil. We use a greedy ranking algorithm to rank the potential locations to place new sensors, based on their contribution to the joint entropy of the network. Results show that the most informative locations in the catchment correspond to those areas with the highest rainfall variability and that satellite observations can be successfully employed to optimize rainfall monitoring networks.

TI  - Mapping geographical areas at risk for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) by analysing bulk tank milk from Swedish dairy cattle herds for the presence of TBE virus-specific antibodies
T2  - ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The vector-borne human viral zoonosis tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is of growing concern in Sweden. The area where TBE is considered endemic has expanded, with an increasing geographical distribution of Ixodes ricinus as the tick vector and a rising number of reported TBE cases in humans. Efforts to map TBE risk areas have been carried out by sentinel monitoring, mainly based on individual sampling and analysis of wild and domestic animals, as well as ticks, for tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). However, the interpretation of the geographical distribution has been hampered by the patchy and focal nature of TBEV occurrence. This study presents TBEV surveillance data based on antibody analysis of bulk tank milk collected from dairy herds located throughout Sweden before (May) and after (November) the vector season. A commercial TBEV antibody ELISA was modified and evaluated for use in this study. Results The initial comparative TBEV antibody analysis revealed a good correlation between milk and serum antibody levels from individually sampled cows. Also, the TBEV-antibody levels for the mean-herd serum showed good comparability with TBEV antibody levels from bulk tank milk, thus indicating good predictability of seroprevalence when analysing bulk tank milk from a herd. Analyses of bulk tank milk samples collected from 616 herds in May and 560 herds in November showed a geographical distribution of TBEV seropositive herds that was largely consistent with reported human TBE cases. A few TBEV-reactive herds were also found outside known locations of human TBE cases. Conclusion Serological examination of bulk tank milk from dairy cattle herds may be a useful sentinel surveillance method to identify geographical presence of TBEV. In contrast to individual sampling this method allows a large number of animals to be monitored. TBEV seropositive herds were mainly found in coastal areas of southern Sweden similar to human TBE cases. However, some antibody-reactive herds were found outside known TBE areas at the time of the study.

TI  - Active surveillance of patients who have sentinel node positive melanoma: An international, multi-institution evaluation of adoption and early outcomes after the Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy trial II (MSLT-2)
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background For patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive cutaneous melanoma, the Second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy trial demonstrated equivalent disease-specific survival (DSS) with active surveillance using nodal ultrasound versus completion lymph node dissection (CLND). Adoption and outcomes of active surveillance in clinical practice and in adjuvant therapy recipients are unknown.Methods In a retrospective cohort of SLN-positive adults treated at 21 institutions in Australia, Europe, and the United States from June 2017 to November 2019, the authors evaluated the impact of active surveillance and adjuvant therapy on all-site recurrence-free survival (RFS), isolated nodal RFS, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and DSS using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models.Results Among 6347 SLN biopsies, 1154 (18%) were positive and had initial negative distant staging. In total, 965 patients (84%) received active surveillance, 189 (16%) underwent CLND. Four hundred thirty-nine patients received adjuvant therapy (surveillance, 38%; CLND, 39%), with the majority (83%) receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. After a median follow-up of 11 months, 220 patients developed recurrent disease (surveillance, 19%; CLND, 22%), and 24 died of melanoma (surveillance, 2%; CLND, 4%). Sixty-eight patients had an isolated nodal recurrence (surveillance, 6%; CLND, 4%). In patients who received adjuvant treatment without undergoing prior CLND, all isolated nodal recurrences were resectable. On risk-adjusted multivariable analyses, CLND was associated with improved isolated nodal RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.88), but not all-site RFS (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.45-1.02). Adjuvant therapy improved all-site RFS (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.47-0.57). DSS and DMFS did not differ by nodal management or adjuvant treatment.Conclusions Active surveillance has been adopted for most SLN-positive patients. At initial assessment, real-world outcomes align with randomized trial findings, including in adjuvant therapy recipients.Lay SummaryFor patients with melanoma of the skin and microscopic spread to lymph nodes, monitoring with ultrasound is an alternative to surgically removing the remaining lymph nodes.The authors studied adoption and real-world outcomes of ultrasound monitoring in over 1000 patients treated at 21 centers worldwide, finding that most patients now have ultrasounds instead of surgery.Although slightly more patients have cancer return in the lymph nodes with this strategy, typically, it can be removed with delayed surgery.Compared with up-front surgery, ultrasound monitoring results in the same overall risk of melanoma coming back at any location or of dying from melanoma.

TI  - The effect of low-level thin arctic clouds on shortwave irradiance: evaluation of estimates from spaceborne passive imagery with aircraft observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud optical properties such as optical thickness along with surface albedo are important inputs for deriving the shortwave radiative effects of clouds from spaceborne remote sensing. Owing to insufficient knowledge about the snow or ice surface in the Arctic, cloud detection and the retrieval products derived from passive remote sensing, such as from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are difficult to obtain with adequate accuracy - especially for low-level thin clouds, which are ubiquitous in the Arctic. This study aims at evaluating the spectral and broadband irradiance calculated from MODIS-derived cloud properties in the Arctic using aircraft measurements collected during the Arctic Radiation-IceBridge Sea and Ice Experiment (ARISE), specifically using the upwelling and downwelling shortwave spectral and broadband irradiance measured by the Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) and the BroadBand Radiometer system (BBR). This starts with the derivation of surface albedo from SSFR and BBR, accounting for the heterogeneous surface in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) with aircraft camera imagery, followed by subsequent intercomparisons of irradiance measurements and radiative transfer calculations in the presence of thin clouds. It ends with an attribution of any biases we found to causes, based on the spectral dependence and the variations in the measured and calculated irradiance along the flight track.The spectral surface albedo derived from the airborne radiometers is consistent with prior ground-based and airborne measurements and adequately represents the surface variability for the study region and time period. Somewhat surprisingly, the primary error in MODIS-derived irradiance fields for this study stems from undetected clouds, rather than from the retrieved cloud properties. In our case study, about 27 % of clouds remained undetected, which is attributable to clouds with an optical thickness of less than 0.5.We conclude that passive imagery has the potential to accurately predict shortwave irradiances in the region if the detection of thin clouds is improved. Of at least equal importance, however, is the need for an operational imagery-based surface albedo product for the polar regions that adequately captures its temporal, spatial, and spectral variability to estimate cloud radiative effects from spaceborne remote sensing.

TI  - The additive role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to axillary nodal status evaluation in cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary nodal status is crucial for the management of cases with recently diagnosed breast cancer; usually addressed via axillary ultrasonography (US) along with tissue sampling in case of suspicion. Axillary nodal dissection and sentinel biopsy may be done, but are rather invasive, carrying a potential complication risk, which raises the need for non-invasive, reliable, pre-operative axillary imaging. We aimed at evaluating the performance of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) regarding preoperative axillary evaluation, using functional information derived from diffusion capacity differences between benign and malignant tissue. We included 77 axillary nodes from 77 patients (age range 20-78 years, mean 50 +/- 12.6 SD) in our prospective study, presenting with variable clinical breast complaints, all scoring BIRADS 4/5 on sonomammography (SM). They underwent axillary evaluation by both US and DW-MRI where US classified nodes into benign, indeterminate, or malignant by evaluating nodal size, shape, cortical thickness, and hilar fat. Qualitative DWI classified them into either restricted or not and a cut-off apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was calculated to differentiate benign and malignant nodal involvement. Results for each modality were correlated to those of final histopathology, which served as the standard of reference.Results: The calculated sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV for US was 100%, 36.6%, 75.3%, 71.2%, and 100%, respectively. Statistical indices for qualitative DWI were 76.6%, 63.3%, 76.6%, 63.3%, and 71.4%, respectively (P value < 0.001). The calculated cut off value for ADC between infiltrated and non-infiltrated nodes was 0.95 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s concluding statistical indices of 76.6%, 63.3%, 76.6%, 63.3%, and 71.4%, respectively (P value < 0.001).Conclusion: Combining DW-MRI to conventional US improves diagnostic specificity and overall accuracy of preoperative axillary evaluation of patients with recently discovered breast cancer.

TI  - High-resolution sea surface wind speeds of Super Typhoon Lekima (2019) retrieved by Gaofen-3 SAR
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese space-borne multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument at C-band (5.43 GHz). In this paper, we use data collected from GF-3 to observe Super Typhoon Lekima (2019) in the East China Sea. Using a VH-polarized wide ScanSAR (WSC) image, ocean surface wind speeds at 100m horizontal resolution are obtained at 21:56:59 UTC on 8 August 2019, with the maximum wind speed, 38.9 m center dot s(-1). Validating the SAR-retrieved winds with buoy-measured wind speeds, we find that the root mean square error (RMSE) is 1.86 m center dot s(-1), and correlation coefficient, 0.92. This suggests that wind speeds retrieved from GF-3 SAR are reliable. Both the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fine grid operational forecast products with spatial resolution, and China Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction Enhance System (GRAPES) have good performances on surface wind prediction under weak wind speed condition (< 24 m center dot s(-1)), but underestimate the maximum wind speed when the storm is intensified as a severe tropical storm (> 24 m center dot s(-1)). With respect to SAR-retrieved wind speeds, the RMSEs are 5.24 m center dot s(-1) for ECMWF and 5.17 m center dot s(-1) for GRAPES, with biases of 4.16 m center dot s(-1) for ECMWF and 3.84 m center dot s(-1) for GRAPES during Super Typhoon Lekima (2019).

TI  - Mapping of tank silt application using Sentinel-2 images over the Berambadi catchment (India)
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping soil properties is becoming more and more challenging due to the increase in anthropogenic modifica-tion of the landscape, calling for new methods to identify these changes. A striking example of anthropogenic modifications of soil properties is the widespread practice in South India of applying large quantities of silt from dry river dams (or "tanks") to agricultural fields. Whereas several studies have demonstrated the interest of tank silt for soil fertility, no assessment of the actual extent of this age-old traditional practice exists. Over South-Indian pedological context, this practice is characterized by an application of black-colored tank silt to red-colored soils such as Ferralsols. The objective of this work was to evaluate the usefulness of Sentinel-2 images for mapping tank silt applications, hypothesizing that observed changes in soil surface color can be a proxy for tank silt application. We used data collected in a cultivated watershed in South India including 217 soil surface samples characterized in terms of Munsell color. We used two Sentinel-2 images acquired on February and April 2017. The surface soil color over each Sentinel-2 image was classified into two soil types ("Black" and "Red" soils). A change of soil color from "Red" in February 2017 to "Black" in April 2017 was attributed to tank silt application. Soil color changes were analyzed accounting for possible surface soil moisture changes. The pro-posed methodology was based on a well-balanced Calibration data created from the initial imbalanced Calibra-tion dataset thanks to the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) methodology, coupled to the Cost-Sensitive Classification And Regression Trees (Cost-Sensitive CART) algorithm. To estimate the uncertainties of i) the two-class classification at each date and ii) the change of soil color from "Red" to "Black", a bootstrap pro-cedure was used providing fifty two-class classifications for each Sentinel-2 image. The results showed that 1) the CART method allowed to classify the "Red" and "Black" soil with correct overall accuracy from both Sentinel-2 images, 2) the tank silt application was identified over 202 fields and 3) the soil color changes were not related to a surface soil moisture change between both dates. With the actual availability of the Sentinel-2 and the past availability of the LANDSAT satellite imageries, this study may open a way toward a simple and accurate method for delivering tank silt application mapping and so to study and possibly quantify retroactively this farmer practice.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Co-expression network analysis identifies novel molecular pathways associated with cadmium and pyriproxyfen testicular toxicity in Gammarus fossarum
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Omics approaches are continuously providing new clues on the mechanisms of action of contaminants in species of environmental relevance, contributing to the emergence of molecular ecotoxicology. Co-expression network approaches represent a suitable methodological framework for studying the rich content of omics datasets. This study aimed to find evidence of key pathways and proteins related to the testicular toxicity in the sentinel crustacean species Gammarus fossarum exposed to endocrine disruptors using a weighted protein co-expression network analysis. From a shotgun proteomics dataset of male gonads of G. fossarum organisms exposed to cadmium (Cd), pyriproxyfen (Pyr) and methoxyfenozide (Met) in laboratory conditions, four distinct modules were identified as significantly correlated to contaminants' exposure. Protein set enrichment analysis identified modules involved in cytoskeleton organization and oxidative stress response associated with the Cd exposure. The module associated with Pyr exposure was associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) response, and the module correlated with Met exposure was characterized by a significant proportion of amphipod-restricted proteins whose functions are still not characterized. Our results show that co-expression networks are efficient and adapted tools to identify new potential mode of actions from environmental sentinel species, such as G. fossarum, using a proteogenomic approach, even without an annotated genome.

TI  - Monitoring and water quality impacts of an herbicide treatment on an aquatic invasive plant in a drinking water reservoir
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective treatment options are needed for the management of aquatic invasive species. An herbicide treatment was used to control an invasive aquatic plant, yellow floating heart (Nymphoides peltata) in a 3350-acre drinking water reservoir. The purpose of this research was to document the success of the treatment in an individual cove of the reservoir using in-situ sampling and reservoir-wide using remotely sensed Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. We also determined if the dying vegetation negatively impacted biological oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the cove. The aquatic herbicide ProcellaCORTM (active ingredient = florpyrauxifen-benzyl) was used to treat a 55-acre infestation of YFH at a rate of 3 Prescription Dose Units (PDU)/ac-ft by a certified applicator in July 2019. Total surface coverage of yellow floating heart in the reservoir was reduced by more than 90% within 15 days after the treatment, and to less than 3.0 acres within 50 days after the treatment. No blooming flowers were observed after treatment and the surface coverage was close to 0% within 17 days after treatment in the cove. The effect of the herbicide treatment also appeared to carry over into the following growing season as the total surface coverage of yellow floating heart in the reservoir was less than 8 acres one year after the treatment in July 2020. The herbicide treatment resulted in short term increases in biological oxygen demand and decreases in dissolved oxygen at some sites in the cove within 3?10 days after the treatment. Dissolved oxygen then increased and concentrations were greater 42 days after treatment than they were before the treatment. Our results show that ProcellaCORTM has the potential to control yellow floating heart infestations with relatively short-term negative impacts on dissolved oxygen concentrations. We also show that Sentinel-2 satellite imagery can be used to monitor the success of herbicide applications over large spatial and temporal scales that would not be possible from ground based monitoring alone.

TI  - Environmental Correlates of Lyme Disease Emergence in Southwest Virginia, 2005-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America. Though human infection is mostly transmitted in a limited geography, the range has expanded in recent years. One notable area of recent expansion is in the mountainous region of southwestern Virginia. The ecological factors that facilitate or constrain the range of human Lyme disease in this region remain uncertain. To evaluate this further, we obtained ecological data, including remotely sensed data on forest structure and vegetation, weather data, and elevation. These data were aggregated within the census block groups of a 9,153 km(2) area around the cities of Blacksburg and Roanoke, VA, an area with heterogeneous Lyme disease transmission. In this geographic area, 755 individuals were reported to have Lyme disease in the 10 yr from 2006 to 2015, and these cases were aggregated by block group. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to evaluate which environmental variables influenced the abundance of Lyme disease cases. Higher elevation and higher vegetation density had the greatest effect size on the abundance of Lyme disease. Measures of forest edge, forest integrity, temperature, and humidity were not associated with Lyme disease cases. Future southward expansion of Lyme disease into the southeastern states may be most likely in ecologically similar mountainous areas.

TI  - Ketamine Use in Operation Enduring Freedom
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction:Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic increasingly used in the prehospital and battlefield environment. As an analgesic, it has been shown to have comparable effects to opioids. In 2012, the Defense Health Board advised the Joint Trauma System to update the Tactical Combat Casualty Care Guidelines to include ketamine as an acceptable first line agent for pain control on the battlefield. The goal of this study was to investigate trends in the use of ketamine during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Freedom's Sentinel (OFS) during the years 2011-2016.Materials and Methods:A retrospective review of Department of Defense Trauma Registry (DoDTR) data was performed for all patients receiving ketamine during OEF/OFS in 2011-2016. Prevalence of ketamine use, absolute use, mechanism of injury, demographics, injury severity score, provider type, and co-administration rates of various medications and blood products were evaluated.Results:Total number of administrations during the study period was 866. Ketamine administration during OEF/OFS increased during the years 2011-2013 (28 patient administrations in 2011, 264 administrations in 2012, and 389 administrations in 2013). A decline in absolute use was noted from 2014 to 2016 (98 administrations in 2014, 41 administrations in 2015, and 46 administrations in 2016). The frequency of battlefield ketamine use increased from 0.4% to 11.3% for combat injuries sustained in OEF/OFS from 2011 to 2016. Explosives (51%) and penetrating trauma (39%) were the most common pattern of injury in which ketamine was administered. Ketamine was co-administered with fentanyl (34.4%), morphine (26.2%), midazolam (23.1%), tranexamic acid (12.3%), plasma (10.3%), and packed red blood cells (18.5%).Conclusions:This study demonstrates increasing use of ketamine by the U.S. Military on the battlefield and effectiveness of clinical practice guidelines in influencing practice patterns.

TI  - CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASOUND IN LOCATING AXILLARY SENTINEL LYMPH NODES IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A PROSPECTIVE STUDY
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective was to explore the clinical value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in locating the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with early breast cancer. We screened 143 consecutive patients with breast cancer between July 2017 and August 2019. The number of SLNs identified by CEUS and dual labeling (blue dye and radiolabeled colloid) were recorded. The accuracy of CEUS plus fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was assessed. The rate of identification of SLNs with CEUS was 84.0% (121/144), and that of dual labeling was 97.92% (141/144). There was no significant association between non-enhancement (p = 0.060) or inhomogeneous enhancement (p = 0.468) and lymph node metastasis. The sensitivity and specificity of CEUS-SLNs plus FNAC was 78.38% and 100%, respectively. The technique of CEUS is a promising method for locating the axillary SLN. But it is hard to identify lymph node metastasis with CEUS alone. CEUS-SLNs plus FNAC is a sound technique for diagnosis of the metastasis of SLN.

TI  - The environmental impact of the consumption of fishery and aquaculture products in France
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of climate change, diet is a key driver of environmental impacts. Previous research has emphasized the environmental benefit of increasing consumption of fishery and aquaculture products (FAPs) in Europe. However, increasing the proportion of FAPs in consumer diets could also lead to a transfer of environmental damage from earth to sea. It is thus important to evaluate the environmental impacts of FAPs on marine ecosystems globally. For that purpose, an original database characterizing the origin of FAPs consumed in France has been constructed, and matched to indicators of environmental impact. Use of the database revealed that the FAPs in the French diets (1.7 Mt live weight) had a corresponding primary production required (PPR) worth 1252 Mt, with an impact per ton of product live weight worth 2622 kg CO2 eq. for climate change, 18 kg PO(4)(3)(-)eq. for eutrophication, and 26,604 MJ for energy use. Some heterogeneity across species was found, implying that the species composition of the FAPS consumed had a strong influence on environmental footprint. Furthermore, production methods also substantially affect global impact. The results show that, among FAPS consumed in France, trawled crustaceans and farmed shrimps or prawns are the greatest contributors to global warming (27,800 and 13,344 kg CO2 eq. per ton live weight, respectively), despite good performances regarding trophic level based ecosystem indicators (a PPR of 3 and 9 Mt respectively). Shellfish register the smallest footprint both globally and at ecosystem level (545 kg CO2 eq., 1 kg PO43- eq., 10,414 MJ, and a PPR of 5 Mt per ton live weight). Our result suggest that, to avoid a transfer of environmental burden from land to sea, policies aimed at promoting consumption of FAPs in European diets should be refined to take account of differential impacts across species, origin and production methods of those FAPs.

TI  - Risk assessment of land degradation (RALDE) model
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation threatens the sustainability of human societies due to the loss of resources, services, and goods. To assess land degradation, models are useful and fruitful due to the complex and multidisciplinary processes acting. The present research attempts to design and develop a new model to assess land degradation based on biophysical and socioeconomic parameters to investigate land at a high risk of degradation. The use of models can shed light on the land degradation processes and will contribute to better design of restoration and rehabilitation processes. The identification of regions that are more vulnerable to degradation can improve land planning and enhance development. Fars Province, in Southern Iran, was selected as a test area to assess risk of land degradation by means of the risk assessment of land degradation (RALDE) model. Data gathered from the different governmental offices of Fars Province and MODIS satellite data were used for this purpose. The hazard maps of natural, human and degradation trend were produced with a geographical information system (GIS) tool. The final land degradation risk map was developed by first overlaying all three natural, human, and degradation trend layers, and then it was compared with current state layer of degradation in GIS. Areas under risk were classified to subclasses with different probability level to show a statistical picture of risk. In RALDE, the percentage of risk probability is evaluated according to trend and potential for degradation. Results show that degradation risk probability ranges between 6 and 58%. The areas under different subclasses of severe to very severe risk cover about 67% of the study area. RALDE shows higher threats of land degradation for these zones, and we propose immediate attention to this region with related conservational and reclamation works. Fars Province has been used successfully to apply the RALDE model and its use for other regions will contribute to improving land degradation assessment and promoting development programmes.

TI  - How do authoritarians experience freedom? Absolute and conditional freedom as different predictors of the authoritarian worldview
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article shows the relationship between two forms of experiencing freedom and an authoritarian worldview. The authors argue that the psychological sense of philosophical distinction between unconditional (negative) and conditional (positive) freedom can rely on the extrinsic or intrinsic character. Based on previous research, the authors expected that the tendency to experience freedom in an extrinsic way could be related to the increase in right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). On the other hand, the tendency to experience freedom in an intrinsic way was expected to decrease RWA and SDO. The hypotheses were verified in a correlational study conducted on a sample of 762 adult respondents. The results showed that RWA was negatively predicted by intrinsic freedom and positively predicted by extrinsic one. Both effects were mediated the first resulted from the perceived threat to social order, and the second from the decreased perception of the social world as a competitive jungle. On the other hand, SDO was negatively predicted by intrinsic freedom and positively predicted by extrinsic one. These effects were also mediated - the former by decreased social threat, and the second by increased perception of the social world as a competitive jungle.

TI  - Identification of atmospheric and oceanic teleconnection patterns in a 20-year global data set of the atmospheric water vapour column measured from satellites in the visible spectral range
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a global long-term (1995-2015) data set of total column water vapour (TCWV) derived from satellite observations to quantify to which extent the temporal patterns of various teleconnections can be identified in this data set. To our knowledge, such a comprehensive global TCWV data set was rarely used for teleconnection studies. One important property of the TCWV data set is that it is purely based on observational data. We developed a new empirical method to decide whether a teleconnection index is significantly detected in the global data set. We compared our new method to well-established hypothesis tests and found good agreement with the results of our approach. Based on our empirical method more than 40 teleconnection indices were significantly detected in the global TCWV data set derived from satellite observations. In addition to the satellite data we also applied our method to other global data sets derived from ERA-Interim. One important finding is that the spatial patterns obtained for the ERA TCWV data are very similar to the observational TCWV data set indicating a high consistency between the satellite and ERA data. Moreover, similar results are also found for two selections of ERA data (either all data or mainly clear-sky data). This finding indicates that the clear-sky bias of the satellite data set is negligible for the results of this study. However, for some indices, also systematic differences in the spatial patterns between the satellite and model data set were found probably indicating possible shortcomings in the model data. For most "traditional" teleconnection data sets (surface temperature, surface pressure, geopotential heights and meridional winds at different altitudes) a smaller number of significant teleconnection indices was found than for the TCWV data sets, while for zonal winds at different altitudes, the number of significant teleconnection indices (up to > 50) was higher. The strongest teleconnection signals were found in the data sets of tropospheric geopotential heights and surface pressure. In all global data sets, no "other indices" (solar variability, stratospheric AOD or hurricane frequency) were significantly detected. Since many teleconnection indices are strongly correlated, we also applied our method to a set of orthogonalised indices, which represent the dominant independent temporal teleconnection patterns. The number of significantly detected orthogonalised indices (20) was found to be much smaller than for the original indices (42). Based on the orthogonalised indices we derived the global spatial distribution of the cumulative effect of teleconnections. The strongest effect on the TCWV is found in the tropics and high latitudes.

TI  - Acinic Cell Carcinoma of the Breast: Report of a Case With Immunohistochemical and Next-Generation Sequencing Studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Acinic cell carcinoma of the breast is a rare subtype of triple-negative breast cancer that recapitulates the appearance of tumors seen in salivary glands. We present the case of a 42-year-old woman with an irregular, nontender mass above the left nipple during routine obstetric appointment at 24 weeks gestation. She was subsequently diagnosed with triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, Nottingham grade 3, via core needle biopsy. She was treated with neoadjuvant therapy (doxorubucin and cyclophosphamide) antenatally and paclitaxel in the postpartum period followed by left mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy. The carcinoma in the mastectomy specimen showed a spectrum of morphologic patterns with immunohistochemistry revealing strong positivity for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), lysozyme, and S100. The histomorphology paired with the immunoprofile led us to the diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma. We retrospectively performed immunostains in the core biopsy specimen, which demonstrated GATA-3 and DOG-1 positivity. Next-generation sequencing of the postneoadjuvant specimen using a 70-gene panel revealed 2 single-nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations: tumor protein 53 (TP53) (c.747G>T) SNV mutation and rearranged during transfection (RET) (c.2899G>A) SNV mutation.

TI  - Improving estimation of soil organic matter content by combining Landsat 8 OLI images and environmental data: A case study in the river valley of the southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a typical ecologically fragile area. Once the surface vegetation degenerates, it may not be restored. This requires the development of soil organic matter (SOM) monitoring method without destroying the surface, so as to ensure the sustainable development of plateau agriculture. This work investigated the environmental factors that are significantly related to SOM content in the river valley of the southern QTP. These environmental factors include soil hydrothermal factors (soil moisture content and soil temperature), topographic factors (elevation and slope) and vegetation factor (NDVI). The original band reflectivity (OR) of Landsat 8 OLI images and the band reflectivity after the first-order derivative (FDR) and the second-order derivative (SDR) processing were combined with the above environmental factors to estimate SOM content. The results showed that the accuracy of the model was improved obviously by adding environmental factors. The estimation effect of back propagation neural network (BPNN) model was better than that of geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, partial least squares regression (PLSR) model and multivariable linear regression (MLR) model. GWR model can also meet the estimation requirements, while PLSR and MLR models cannot achieve effectively the estimation of SOM content. FDR-BPNN model considering environmental factors was the best model for estimating SOM content, with R2 being 0.947, RMSEC being 4.701 g.kg- 1 and MAEV being 5.485 g.kg 1. Moreover, the model had the lowest uncertainty and the highest stability. This study will provide a good insight for the monitoring of SOM content in the future, and provide basic data support for the implementation of precision agriculture in the QTP.

TI  - Interference management via cooperative beam biasing and power control for mmWave satellite clusters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to tackle the problem of spectrum scarcity, spectrum sharing among satellite communication systems becomes a common phenomenon. Due to the spectrum sharing, mmWave satellite cluster, which is considered as a prominent part of the space information networks, may suffer severe mutual interference among inter-satellite data links. In this paper, we firstly conduct the interference analysis for satellite clusters. Then, we formulate the interference problem as a constrained optimization problem in the performance metric of the total achievable data rate. To alleviate the interference between satellite clusters, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based cooperative beam biasing and power control scheme (CBP-PSO) from the perspectives of the joint beam domain and power domain is proposed. And the interference management problem is transformed to find the best combination of the boresight direction and transmission power based on the improved PSO algorithm. Specially, in the interference analysis and proposed scheme, different satellite cluster formations and antenna configurations are taken into account. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed CBP-PSO scheme based on cooperative beam biasing and power control can effectively improve the achievable data rate of the interfered data links, even for the severe in-line interference.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of armed conflict on the environment are extremely complex and difficult to investigate, given the impossibility of accessing the affected area and reliable data limitation. Very-high-resolution satellite imageries and highly reliable machine learning algorithms become very useful in studying direct and indirect impacts of war on the ecosystem, in addition to connected effects on human lives. The Rohingya conflict is described as one of the worst humanitarian crises and human-made disasters of the 21st Century. Quantification of damage due to the conflict and the suitability of human resettlement has been lacking despite the ongoing agreements to repatriate refugees and the importance of ecosystem services for the communities' survival. In this work, the investigation of environmental conditions pre-, during, and post-conflict in the conflict zone was carried out using satellite data. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based computing platform with a widely applied algorithm, the Random Forest (RF) classifier was implemented and experienced. Striking near-complete demolition of inhabited regions, dramatic and highly significant increase in burning areas, and substantial deforestation were found. The study discusses the reasons behind such findings from the Rakhine case and debates some general conservation lessons applicable to other countries undergoing post-conflict transitions.

TI  - Water bodies changes in Tigris and Euphrates basin has impacted dust storms phenomena
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tigris and Euphrates basin (TEB) has long been one of the active dust sources in the Middle East. In the last four decades, inefficient water resources management has intensified dust activities in the TEB. Dried water bodies have a high potential for dust emission. Therefore, several studies have been conducted in TEB to identifying dust sources. Nevertheless, the role of water body changes in dust emission is not yet clear. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of natural and anthropogenic drivers on changes in water bodies and dust emissions. The long-term spatial-temporal monitoring of water bodies changes was performed using 36-year Landsat 5, 7, and 8 multi-spectral images. Using visual interpretation of MODIS-RGB143 images, 904 dust storm events were identified, about 61% of them originated from dried beds of lakes, marshlands, and river margins. The lowest area of water bodies was observed in the period from 2000 to 2004 and 2008 to 2012. The area of water bodies in the two mentioned periods has decreased by 31% and 33%, respectively. Severe droughts have occurred in the region during these two periods. Overall, this has led to an increase of almost 23% in dust activities. However, the relationship between change in the area of water bodies and dust emission in the TEB is not necessarily linear and straightforward. In general, it can be concluded that the dried beds of water bodies is the largest source of dust emission in the TEB.

TI  - Quality of the ERA5 and CFSR winds and their contribution to wave modelling performance in a semi-closed sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the quality of ERA5, a recent reanalysis wind product, and its contribution to wave modelling performance in a semi-closed sea, the Black Sea. This investigation includes a comparison of ERA5 surface wind fields with the ones from the CFSR to assess if this latest reanalysis improved the representation of the surface winds. Wind speeds from both reanalyses were validated with measurements at Gloria, the only sea wind measurement station on the Black Sea. Validations were also conducted using altimeter and scatterometer satellite data after which results were later compared against each other. The second aim of this study investigates whether a wave hindcast model forced with the ERA5 wind fields has improved prediction of wave parameters. A SWAN model with default settings was used to compare the results under the same conditions. Performance analyzes of the default SWAN wave estimates with both ERA5 and CFSR winds were conducted using three offshore buoy measurements and altimeter data of satellites over the Black Sea. Results show that ERA5 winds are more biased compared to CFSR winds at Gloria location. Both CFSR and ERA5 underestimate wind speeds. ERA5 performs better than the CFSR in lower wind speeds and worse in higher wind speeds. However, ERA5 winds have less bias and are more scattered than the CFSR winds against the satellite data. SWAN driven by CFSR winds performs better than the one driven by ERA5 winds against both buoy and satellite data.

TI  - Mapping of wheat lodging susceptibility with synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop lodging reduces yield quantity and grain quality of cereal crops. Understanding seasonal variation in crop lodging susceptibility enables lodging risk assessments and predictions of associated crop yield losses. We demonstrate a novel remote sensing-based approach, using sparse field observations and widely available synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery, to map a safety factor against root lodging (SFA) in wheat. SFA quantifies the ability of the rooting system to support the self-weight moment of the whole plant and can be used as an indicator of in-season root lodging susceptibility. SAR satellite images, from Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2, were acquired synchronously with field measurements in Jolanda di Savoia, Ferrara, Italy during the 2018 winter wheat growing season. The field data included measurements from non-lodged (healthy) wheat such as plant height, height at the centre of gravity, self-weight moment of the whole plant, soil anchorage strength, SFA and those from lodged wheat such as crop angle of inclination, lodged area and the point of plant failure (stem or root). Field measurements confirmed that SFA decreased progressively through the season and was consistent with the observed lodging. Strong and significant correlations through the season were observed between SFA and SAR satellite image metrics. The validated regression models showed a strong relationship between fieldmeasured SFA and the metrics from RADARSAT-2 (R2CV = 0.84, RMSECV = 0.54) and Sentinel-1 data (R2CV = 0.73, RMSECV = 0.59). However, it is possible that the relationship between SFA and SAR parameters is confounded by the variations in crop biomass, which is highly correlated with SFA (r = -0.71, p < 0.0001). Our study, for the first time, demonstrates the use of remote sensing SAR data for lodging susceptibility assessment. Current and planned satellite platforms have the potential for large scale, operational assessment of lodging susceptibility in cereal crops.

TI  - Combining high-resolution remotely sensed data with local and Indigenous Knowledge to model the landscape suitability of culturally modified trees: biocultural stewardship in Kitasoo/Xai'xais Territory
T2  - FACETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental management and monitoring must reconcile social and cultural objectives with biodiversity stewardship to overcome political barriers to conservation. Suitability modelling offers a powerful tool for such "biocultural" approaches, but examples remain rare. Led by the Stewardship Authority of the Kitasoo/Xai'xais First Nation in coastal British Columbia, Canada, we developed a locally informed suitability model for a key biocultural indicator, culturally modified trees (CMTs). CMTs are trees bearing evidence of past cultural use that are valued as tangible markers of Indigenous heritage and protected under provincial law. Using a spatial multi-criteria evaluation framework to predict CMT suitability, we developed two cultural predictor variables informed by Kitasoo/Xai'xais cultural expertise and ethnographic data in addition to six biophysical variables derived from LiDAR and photo interpretation data. Both cultural predictor variables were highly influential in our model, revealing that proximity to known habitation sites and accessibility to harvesters (by canoe and foot) more strongly influenced suitability for CMTs compared with site-level conditions. Applying our model to commercial forestry governance, we found that high CMT suitability areas are 51% greater inside the timber harvesting land base than outside. This work highlights how locally led suitability modelling can improve the social and evidentiary dimensions of environmental management.

TI  - Land use and land cover change detection and spatial distribution on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regarded as the third pole of the Earth, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a region with complex terrain. Vegetation is widely distributed in the southeastern part of the plateau. However, the land use and land cover changes (LULCC) on the TP have not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we propose a method of studying the dynamic changes in the land cover on the TP. Landsat OLI images (2013 and 2015) were selected to extract the LULCC information of Nyingchi County, the DEM was used to extract objects' land curved surface area and analyze their three-dimensional dynamic change information, which realized a four-dimensional monitoring of the forestry information on time and spatial level. The results showed that the forest area in 2015 decreased by 7.25%, of which the coniferous forest areas decreased by 25.14%, broad-leaved forest areas increased by 12.65%, and shrubbery areas increased by 14.62%. Compared with traditional LULCC detection methods, the change detection is no longer focused on the two-dimensional space, which helps determine the three-dimensional land use and land cover changes and their distribution. Thus, dynamic spatial changes can be observed. This study provides scientific support for the vegetation restoration and natural resource management on the TP.

TI  - Evaluation of aqua MODIS thermal emissive bands stability through radiative transfer modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua has been in operation providing continuous global observations for science research and applications since 2002. The long-term stability of thermal emissive bands (TEBs) of Aqua MODIS was monitored through inter-comparisons with measurements by hyperspectral or multi-spectral infrared sensors or through vicarious monitoring over cold targets such as Dome-C and deep convective clouds. The radiative transfer modeling (RTM)-based simulation models are developed to perform the long-term monitoring of the stability of Aqua MODIS TEBs. Long-term European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global atmospheric reanalysis data are used as inputs to the RTM simulation. By confining ocean in low to middle latitudes as the area of interest, the long-term stabilities of Aqua MODIS TEBs are monitored through observation minus background (O-B) brightness temperature (BT) bias between MODIS measurements and simulations from the RTM. In general, the RTM-based O-B analysis shows that the long-term stability of Aqua MODIS TEBs are maintained well. It is shown that Aqua MODIS surface bands are all radiometrically stable with yearly BT bias drifts <0.005 K/year for B20, B22, and B23 and similar to 0.01 K/year for B31 and B32. The carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption channels of Aqua MODIS, e.g., B33 to B36, are stable with a BT bias drift < 0.005 K/year. It is also found that after accounting for the long-term growth of greenhouse gas N2O, the O-B bias trends for B24 and B25 are quite stable with yearly BT bias drifts around 0.0002 and 0.0055 K/year, respectively. The stabilities of the moisture-sensitive channels B27 to B29 and the ozone channel B30 of Aqua MODIS are also evaluated and the remnant small variations in the O-B bias trending of these channels are further discussed. The RTM-based inter-comparison of MODIS TEB measurements with global atmospheric and climate re-analysis data provides validation of the long-term radiometric stability of Aqua MODIS TEBs. The analysis in this paper also demonstrates that the comparison of well-calibrated MODIS TEB measurements with RTM simulation helps quantify the long-term impacts of global greenhouse gas concentration growth on the BT decreases in the MODIS greenhouse gas-sensitive channels.

M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an indispensable component of earth surface energy exchange studies and forms basis for various environmental applications. The present study attempts to estimate Landsat-8 satellite-based spatial distribution of crop ET using Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model and validate through ET estimated using multilevel micrometeorological tower-based Bowen Ratio Energy Balance (BREB). The study was conducted over Indian Agricultural Research Institute farm during the summer (kharif maize) and winter (wheat) season of 2017-2018. The result of BREB showed the intra-seasonal variations in actual ET estimation ranging from maximum ET of 3.84 mm day(-1) and 2.64 mm day(-1) for maize and wheat during mid-stage to minimum ET of 1.88 mm day(-1) for maize in maturity and 1.14 mm day(-1) in an initial stage of wheat. It was observed that SSEBop slightly overestimated the crop ET; however, it showed the good agreement with BREB estimated ET (R-2 = 0.76) with d-index of 0.92 and root-mean-square error of 0.48 mm day(-1). It can be concluded that despite slight overestimation of ET by SSEBop, satellite-based SSEBop model can be recommended for crop ET estimation over large area and can be used for various water management studies.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The South African Journal of Psychology, in pages 273-279, of 2017, published a very important and commendable editorial by Kopano Ratele aimed at re-igniting the debate on issues surrounding 'decades-old confusion about the definition, scope, impetus for, and ultimate aims of an African psychology within South Africa (SA)'. His incisive contribution in response to these issues was submitted under the title: Frequently asked questions about African psychology. In attempting to join this debate, the aim is not to challenge but to complement the fine responses made by Ratele (2017b) to the questions he had raised. Specifically, the aim of this article is to keep this important debate about the state of African psychology alive by showing that there are still some unexplored questions about African psychology that need to be raised and responded to. It is the conviction of the present author that it is through such debates that a better understanding of the meaning and scope, and vision and mission of the nascent academic discipline of African psychology could be achieved.

T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - Although several indices have been constructed and available at the Index database (IDB) for Sentinel-2 satellite to map and study several earth resources, no indices have been developed to map oil spill. We constructed band ratios (5 + 6)/7, (3 + 4)/2, (11+12)/8 and 3/2, (3 + 4)/2, (6 + 7)/5 using the high-resolution MSI (multi-spectral instrument) visible-near infrared-shortwave infrared spectral bands of Sentinel-2 by summing-up the bands representing the shoulders of absorption features as numerator and the band located nearest to the absorption feature as denominator to discriminate oil spill, and demonstrate the potential of this method to map the Wakashio oil spill which occurred in the Indian Ocean, off Mauritius. The resulted images discriminated the oil spill well. We also decorrelated the spectral bands 4, 3 and 2 by studying the spectral band absorptions and discriminated the spill as very thick, thick and thin. The results of decorrelation stretch method exhibited the distribution of types of oil spill in a different tone, distinctly. Both the image transformation methods (band ratios and decorrelation stretch methods) showed their capability to map oil spills, and these methods are recommended to use for similar spectral bands of other sensors to map oil spills.This study demonstrated the application of band ratios and decorrelation stretch methods to map oil spill.The methods discriminated the oil spill off Mauritius, and showed spill thicknesses from the Sentinel-2 data.The new methods are recommended to use for the spectral bands of other sensors to map oil spill.

TI  - Multi-phase seismic source imprint of tropical cyclones
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coupling between the ocean activity driven by winds and the solid Earth generates seismic signals recorded by seismometers worldwide. The 2-10 s period band, known as secondary microseism, represents the largest background seismic wavefield. While moving over the ocean, tropical cyclones generate particularly strong and localized sources of secondary microseisms that are detected remotely by seismic arrays. We assess and compare the seismic sources of P, SV, and SH waves associated with typhoon Ioke (2006) during its extra-tropical transition. To understand their generation mechanisms, we compare the observed multi-phase sources with theoretical sources computed with a numerical ocean wave model, and we assess the influence of the ocean resonance (or ocean site effect) and coastal reflection of ocean waves. We show how the location and lateral extent of the associated seismic source is period- and phase-dependent. This information is crucial for the use of body waves for ambient noise imaging and gives insights about the sea state, complementary to satellite data. The authors locate the maximum seismic energy imprint and lateral extent of the seismic sources generated by Typhoon Ioke. Based on this data set, they present a new tool to shed light on the generation mechanism of secondary microseisms body waves.

TI  - Evaluation of the LOTOS-EUROS NO<sub>2</sub> simulations using ground-based measurements and S5P/TROPOMI observations over Greece
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of chemical transport models, CTMs, is essential for the assessment of their performance regarding the physical and chemical parameterizations used. While regional CTMs have been widely used and evaluated over Europe, their validation over Greece is limited. In this study, we investigate the performance of the Long Term Ozone Simulation European Operational Smog (LOTOS-EUROS) v2.2.001 regional chemical transport model in simulating nitrogen dioxide, NO2, over Greece from June to December 2018. In situ NO2 measurements obtained from 14 stations of the National Air Pollution Monitoring Network are compared with surface simulations over the two major cities of Greece, Athens and Thessaloniki. Overall the LOTOS-EUROS NO2 surface simulations compare very well to the in situ measurements showing a mild underestimation of the measurements with a mean relative bias of similar to -10 %, a high spatial correlation coefficient of 0.86 and an average temporal correlation of 0.52. The CTM underestimates the NO2 surface concentrations during daytime by similar to -50 +/- 15 %, while it slightly overestimates during night-time similar to 10 +/- 35 %. Furthermore, the LOTOS-EUROS tropospheric NO2 columns are evaluated against ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) NO2 measurements in Athens and Thessaloniki. We report that the CTM tropospheric NO2 column simulations over both urban and rural locations represent the diurnal patterns and hourly levels for both summer and winter seasons satisfactorily. The relative biases range between similar to -2% and -35 %, depending on season and relative NO2 load observed. Finally, the CTM was assessed also against space-borne Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) carrying the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) tropospheric NO2 observations. We conclude that LOTOS-EUROS simulates extremely well the tropospheric NO2 patterns over the region with very high spatial correlation of 0.82 on average, ranging between 0.66 and 0.95, with negative biases in the summer and positive in the winter. Updated emissions for the simulations and model improvements when extreme values of boundary layer height are encountered are further suggested.

TI  - Aboveground mangrove biomass estimation in Beibu Gulf using machine learning and UAV remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of canopy height variables, vegetation index, texture index, and laser point cloud index measured with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) low altitude remote sensing, we used eight machine learning (ML) models to estimate the aboveground biomass of different species of mangroves in Beibu Gulf and compared the accuracy of different ML models for these estimations. The main species of typical mangrove communities in Kangxiling were Aegiceras corniculata and Sonneratia apetala. The trunks of Sonneratia apetala were thicker, with an average height of 11.82 m, whereas Aegiceras corniculata trees were shorter, with an average height of 2.58 m. The XGBoost regressor (XGBR) model had the highest accuracy in estimating mangrove aboveground biomass (R-2 = 0.8319, RMSE = 22.7638 Mg/ha), followed by the random forest regressor model (R-2 = 0.7887, RMSE = 25.5193 Mg/ha). Support vector regression, decision tree regressor, and extra trees regressor had poor fitting effects. Mangrove texture index ranked first in importance for the model, followed by the mangrove laser point cloud height index, and the laser point cloud intensity index performed the worst in the model. Mangrove aboveground biomass in the study area is high in the north and low in the south, ranging from 38.23 to 171.80 Mg/ha, with an average value of 94.37 Mg/ha. Generally, the XGBR method can better estimate the aboveground biomass of mangroves based on the measured mangrove plot data and UAV low-altitude remote sensing data. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - NestNet: a multiscale convolutional neural network for remote sensing image change detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technologies, the frequency of observations of the same location is increasing, and many satellites and sensors produced a large amount of time series images. These images make long-term change detection and dynamic characteristic estimation of ground features possible. However, conventional remote sensing image change detection methods mostly rely on manual visual interpretation and supervised or unsupervised computer-aided classification. Traditional methods always face many bottlenecks when processing big and fast-growing datasets, such as low computational efficiency, low level of automation, and different identification standards and accuracies caused by different operators. With the rapid accumulation of remote sensing data, it has become an important but more challenging task to conduct change detection in a more precise, automated and standardized way. The development of geointelligent computing technologies provides a means of solving these problems and improve the accuracy and efficiency of remote sensing image change detection. In this paper, we presented a novel deep learning model called nest network(NestNet) based on a convolutional neural network to improve the accuracy of the automatic change detection task by using remotely sensed time series images. NestNet extracts the respective features of bi-temporal images using an encoding parallel module and subsequently employs absolute different operations to process the features of two images. Compared with change detection method based on U-Shaped network plus plus (UNet++), the parallel module improves the efficiency of NestNet. Finally, a decoding module is used to generate a predicted change image. This paper compares NestNet to traditional methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models on two datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of NestNet is better than that of state-of-the-art methods. It can be concluded that the NestNet model is a potential approach for change detection using high resolution remote sensing images.

TI  - Climatological variations in aerosol optical depth and aerosol type identification in Liaoning of Northeast China based on MODIS data from 2002 to 2019
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatological variations of aerosol optical properties are significant in the study of aerosol effect on regional environment. The MODIS level 2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) products (MOD04/MYD04) at 10 km were used to identify the spatial distribution, interdecadal trends, and aerosol types from 2002 to 2019 in Liaoning province over Northeast China. The highest AOD was distributed in central Liaoning, with a peak value of approximately 0.6 and the fine mode fraction (FMF) was higher in eastern Liaoning about 0.8. The overall AOD for Liaoning in summer was significantly higher than that in other seasons, and the higher AOD values were observed in central Liaoning and the area around Bohai Rim (up to approximately 0.7). The frequency of 0.1 <= AOD < 0.2 and 0.2 <= AOD < 0.3 was highest in 14 cities of Liaoning. For FMF > 0.8, the cities were categorised into those with an increase frequency of 15% to 20%, and those with a decrease frequency of 5% to 10%. During 2014 to 2019, the interannual variation in AOD in Liaoning exhibited a significant downward trend, with a minimum AOD of approximately 0.25 in 2019. The FMF in Liaoning from 2002 to 2019 exhibited a fluctuating trend around 0.5. The AOD in Liaoning showed an increasing trend from 2002 to 2008 with a maximum of approximately 0.02/year and a clear decreasing trend from 2009 to 2019 of approximately -0.02/year. Maritime aerosol mostly occurred in cities in western Liaoning accounted for 20.58% to 36.52%. Dust aerosol had a considerable influence on central Liaoning accounting for 2.95% to 16.18%. In eastern Liaoning, continental background aerosol accounted for 36.69% to 43.30%. These results revealed the influence of AOD and fine particles on aerosol extinction in Northeast China and provided important information for the climate change in Northeast Asia.

TI  - Detecting degraded, prone and transition ecosystems by environmental thresholds and spectral functions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For determining of the desert ecosystem based on transition zones, a quantitative approach was applied in Khorasan Razavi province in northeast of Iran. The spectral and morphological algorithms were implemented in remote-sensing images of MODIS surface reflectance in order to determine the ecogeomorphic thresholds between the transition zones of the semi-arid ecosystems. Furthermore, the spectral angle mapper analysis was applied for the surface conditions and the mathematical morphology algorithm of dilation was used for identifying the recovery and erodibility potential trends in the heterogeneous land surface covers. A detailed assessment of the mapping was achieved by implementation of an iterative self-organized clustering technique (ISODATA) and calculation of separability of formed typologies classes using the transformed divergence algorithm. The assessment of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) in each cluster indicates an increasing trend of standard deviation, which shows maximum values near desert thresholds. According to the results, several desert thresholds were detected in susceptible ecosystems to desertification in Khorasan Razavi that were affected by natural and anthropogenic factors. Further evaluation shows the location of the transition zones and the thresholds under changing climatic conditions. In synopsis, in prone areas with the high potential to desertification, the ecosystem is susceptiblt to shift to desert state.

TI  - Grassland vegetation and roads have dominant influence on decadal-scale spatial-temporal patterns of fires in a species-rich protected Terai habitat in northeastern India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Terai ecoregion of the Himalayan foothills is among the most fire-affected ecosystems in the Indian subcontinent. Although most of the Terai has already been lost to agriculture and urbanization, the few remaining native habitats are strictly protected due to their high biodiversity and ecological importance. The use of fires to maintain vegetation and wildlife habitat in these protected areas is an integral part of forest management. Although fires are initiated by forest managers or local people, their eventual spread and behaviour are not controlled. We hypothesize that distributions of fires are determined by several direct and indirect drivers like fuel load, fuel moisture content, presence of natural or artificial fire breaks, and climatic attributes of precipitation and temperature. Using the moderate-resolution (375m) satellite sensor-based data we studied the environmental influence on the spatial-temporal patterns of fire events over 18 years (2000-2018) in a 519 km(2) protected area in northeastern India. The park has a mosaic of vegetation formations - including dry and swampy alluvial grassland, early successional woodland, and moist tropical forest. Despite high rainfall, there is an intense dry season that renders the herbaceous vegetation susceptible to fires. Using spatial and spatial-temporal Poisson regression models in a rigorous conditional autoregressive Bayesian framework, we found that net primary productivity (a proxy of vegetation type and fuel load), distance to roads (a measure of human influence), elevation (through its influence on floods and vegetation type), and river area extent (by determining the area under vegetation) had a significant influence on the spatial distributions of fires. The climatic signal on interannual variation in fires was weak, but dry season rainfall reduced fire incidence. The disproportionate distribution of fires adjacent to roads compared to the interior, and the repeated burning of some grassland patches need to be addressed in fire management.

TI  - Forest fire detection on LANDSAT images using support vector machine
T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent days, the major threat in the world is forest fire that affects the biodiversity, climate change, and so forth. So detection process is more essential to monitor the forest region. To detect the forest fire, the paper proposes a novel detection technique of support vector machine (SVM)-Krill herd that can effectively detect the fire region using different kinds of features. Land surface temperature, fire intensity, water vapor, and top of atmosphere temperature are being extracted as some of the features that can be exposed. These features are preferred to classify the LANDSAT image into two classes using SVM optimized by Krill herd. The Euclidean distance is chosen to find the similarity between the test and trained image and then predict the giving query image containing a fire or not based on its training samples. With the help of the feature extractor parameters, the performances have to be analyzed. When compared with existing fire detection algorithms like active fire detection, SFIDE, convolutional neural network (CNN), hybrid intelligent, and PSO-SVM algorithm, the proposed SVM-Krill herd-based detection method increases the accuracy by 1.562%, 0.675%, 1.290%, 0.876%, and 1.038%. The proposed detection method of SVM-Krill herd achieves 99.21% accuracy and high precision as 98.41%.

TI  - Extraction of fractional vegetation cover in arid desert area based on Chinese GF-6 satellite
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The red edge band is considered as one of the diagnosable characteristics of green plants, but the large-scale remote sensing retrieval of fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) based on the red edge band is still rare. To explore the application of the red edge band in the remote sensing estimation of FVC, this study proposed a new vegetation index (normalized difference red edge index, RENDVI) based on the two red edge bands of Chinese GaoFen-6 satellite (GF-6). The FVC estimated by using three vegetation indices ( NDVI, RENDVI1, and RENDVI2) were evaluated based on the field survey FVC obtained in Minqin Basin of Gansu Province. The results showed that there was a good linear correlation between the FVC estimated by GF-6 WFV data and the FVC investigated in the field, and the most reasonable estimation of FVC was obtained based on RENDVI2 model (R-2 = 0.97611 and RMSE = 0.07075). Meanwhile, the impact of three confidence levels (1, 2, and 5%) on FVC was also analyzed in this study. FVC obtained from NDVI and RENDVI2 has the highest accuracy at 2% confidence, while FVC based on RENDVI1 achieved the best accuracy at 5% confidence. It could be concluded that it is feasible and reliable to estimate FVC based on red edge bands, and the GF-6 Wide Field View (WFV) data with high temporal and spatial resolution provide a new data source for remote sensing estimation of FVC.

TI  - Building up an ecologically sustainable and socially desirable post-COVID-19 future
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 crisis has emphasized how poorly prepared humanity is to cope with global disasters. However, this crisis also offers a unique opportunity to move towards a more sustainable and equitable future. Here, we identify the underlying environmental, social, and economic chronic causes of the COVID-19 crisis. We argue in favour of a holistic view to initiate a socio-economic transition to improve the prospects for global sustainability and human well-being. Alternative approaches to "Business-As-Usual" for guiding the transition are already available for implementation. Yet, to ensure a successful and just transition, we need to change our priorities towards environmental integrity and well-being. This necessarily means environmental justice, a different worldview and a closer relationship with nature.

TI  - Remote detection of marine debris using satellite observations in the visible and near infrared spectral range: Challenges and potentials
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of remote detection of marine debris, nearly all published studies are focused on either controlled experiments, or Sentinel-2 data with mixed band resolutions that are subject to large uncertainties. To date, key questions such as the following have not been addressed adequately: To what extent can the various forms of marine debris be remotely detected and differentiated through satellite observations in the visible and near infrared (NIR) spectral range, and how? Here, using published reflectance spectra of various types of floating matters, I address these questions through sensitivity analyses, simulations, and spectral analyses of satellite images. While the study is by no means comprehensive, several observations can still be made. First, it appears impossible to remotely detect marine microplastics from all existing and planned optical sensors. This is simply because the contribution of these particles to the sensor signal, even when they are aggregated on the water surface at the reported maximum particle density, is at least 60 times lower than the required signal (similar to 0.2% subpixel coverage) and 20 times lower than the sensor noise for a sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 200. In contrast, detecting macroplastics and other debris is possible when they form large patches along ocean fronts or windrows. Second, assuming a SNR of 200, discriminating large patches of marine debris from floating algae is only possible with a subpixel coverage of 0.3%. These threshold values are based on the sensor SNRs only, and they represent the lower bounds of detection and discrimination, respectively. The real threshold values above which a detection or discrimination is possible also depend on the observing conditions, and therefore higher. Third, currently, Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) sensors provide an optimal trade between resolution and coverage, yet MSI sensors have SNRs <200, and interpretation of the MSI spectra requires extra caution due to variable spatial resolutions in different bands, among other factors. From the perspective of pure spectroscopy, it is possible to discriminate floating algae from non-algae floating matters but difficult to differentiate the type of the latter (either plastic or non-plastic debris, foam, etc) because different non-algae floating matters all show relatively flat reflectance spectral shapes in the vis-NIR spectral range. Finally, based on these results, recommendations are made on algorithm designs and sensor designs, for example spectral analysis should be performed over the difference spectra to minimize the impact of variable subpixel coverage, and certain spectral bands are more important than others for the remote detection of marine debris.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy Should Not be Routine in Older Patients with ER-Positive HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Who Are Willing and Able to Take Hormone Therapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The SSO Choosing Wisely campaign recommended selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in clinically node-negative women aged >= 70 years with ER+ breast cancer. We sought to assess the association of SLNB positivity, adjuvant treatment, and survival in a population-based cohort. Patients and Methods Women aged >= 70 years treated for ER+ HER2- breast cancer between 2010 and 2016 were identified in our prospective provincial database. Overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of SLNB positivity with use of adjuvant treatments and survival outcomes. Results We identified 2662 patients who met study criteria. SLNB was positive in 25%. Increased use of chemotherapy (ChT), hormone therapy (HT), and radiotherapy (RT) was significantly associated with SLNB positivity. Five-year OS was 86%, and BCSS was 96% with median follow-up of 4.3 years. BCSS was worse with grade 3 disease (HR 4.1, 95% CI 2.1-8.1, p < 0.0001) and better with HT (HR 0.5 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p = 0.01). Patients with a positive SLNB treated without adjuvant therapy had lower BCSS (HR 3.2 95% CI 1.2-8.4, p = 0.017) than those with a negative SLNB, but patients with a positive SLNB treated with any combination of ChT, HT, and/or RT, had similar BCSS to those with a negative SLNB. Conclusions BCSS in this population was excellent at 96%, and BCSS was similar with negative and positive SLNB when patients received HT. SLNB can be omitted in elderly patients willing to take HT.

TI  - Modeling the geographic spread and proliferation of invasive alien plants (IAPs) into new ecosystems using multi-source data and multiple predictive models in the Heuningnes catchment, South Africa
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geographic spread and proliferation of Invasive Alien Plants (IAPs) into new ecosystems requires accurate, constant, and frequent monitoring particularly under the changing climate to ensure the integrity and resilience of affected as well as vulnerable ecosystems. This study thus aimed to understand the distribution and shifts of IAPs and the factors influencing such distribution at the catchment scale to minimize their risks and impacts through effective management. Three machine learning Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) techniques, namely, Random Forest (RF), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and their respective ensemble model were used to predict the potential distribution of IAPs within the catchment. The current and future bioclimatic variables, environmental and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument satellite data were used to fit the models to predict areas at risk of IAPs invasions in the Heuningnes catchment, South Africa. The present and two future climatic scenarios from the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) were considered in modeling the potential distribution of these species. The two future scenarios represented the minimum and maximum atmospheric carbon Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 for 2050 (average for 2041-2060). The results show that IAPs are predicted to expand under the influence of climate change in the catchment. Concurrently, riparian zones, bare areas, and the native vegetation which is rich in biodiversity will greatly be affected. The mean diurnal range (Bio2), warmest quarter maximum temperature (Bio5), and the warmest quarter precipitation (Bio18) were the most important bioclimatic variables in modeling the spatial distribution of IAPs in the catchment. Comparatively, all the models were successful in predicting the potential distribution of IAPs for all the scenarios. The BRT, MaxEnt, and RF predicted the spatial distribution of IAPs with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.89, 0.92, and 0.94, respectively. The study highlighted the importance of multi-source data and multiple predictive models in predicting the current and potential future IAP distribution. The results from this study provide baseline information for effective land management, planning, and continuous monitoring of the further spread of IAPs within the Heuningnes catchment.

TI  - A new methodology for offshore wind speed assessment integrating Sentinel-1, ERA-Interim and in-situ measurement
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore Wind (OW) speed assessment is a key aspect for the development of new wind farms at sea. Satellites can be used to globally obtain ocean and sea distribution, compensating limited in-situ measurements. In this study, a new methodology to estimate the wind's speed potential is here proposed. Preliminary, Sentinel-1 (S-1) images have been analyzed by means of the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software, extrapolating wind speed data for each cell pixel size of a testing area. Then GIS (Geographic Information System) software has been used to map wind data and find the best pixel location comparing these data with in-situ data. Furthermore, wind speed has been analyzed using the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset for areas within 11 km and 40 km from the Lillgrund OW farm in the Baltic Sea to better understand wind regimes. Finally, wind speed parameters obtained by S-1 in Sea Surface Water (SSW) with the 10 m standard high have been compared with wind speed recorded by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems of two turbine using wind profile formula. Obtained results show the comparison accuracy of wind speed assessment for each center of the pixels by S-1 satellite images and in-situ (SCADA) measurements. Data actually depends on the distance between the selected center pixel and the location of the turbines. The obtained wind speed differences (0.26 m/s -RMSE = 1.38 and 0.92 m/s -RMSE = 1.82) pinpointed the direct effect of the distance between the selected pixel center and the in-situ measurements location in the S-1 imagery for wind speed potential assessment. Obtained results proved an improvement of the OW assessment accuracy using multiple satellite observations, demonstrating that SAR wind maps can support OW speed sites assessment by introducing observations in different phases of an OW farm project.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Estimation of evapotranspiration from a suite of geostationary satellites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-spectral and diurnal meteorological data from optical-thermal observations of Indian Geostationary satellites were used to estimate country-scale evapotranspiration (ET). In this study radiation and vegetation products from a suite of Indian geostationary satellites, Kalpana-1 (K-1) and Indian National SATellite (INSAT) 3A Charged Couple Detector (CCD), were used. ET was derived as a function of net available energy and evaporative fraction within a single-source energy balance framework. The scaling function for albedo, net radiation and soil heat flux were developed with ground measured data from twenty-three Agro-Met Station (AMS) installed in different agro-climatic zones of India. These scaling functions were applied on the satellite data to derive intermediate inputs for surface energy balance. Further, evaporative fraction was derived from Priestley-Taylor parameter (phi) and day-time net available energy. On regional scale, pixel-by-pixel dynamic phi(i) was computed from upper (phi (max)) and lower (phi (min)) limits of warm and wet edges of thermal inertia-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) triangle. Here, thermal inertia was represented by morning rise in surface brightness temperature (Delta T) between 02:30 and 06:30 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The dynamic phi(i) with upper and lower limits were computed using Delta T - NDVI triangle. The derived net radiation was validated with AMS measured net radiation at seven agro-climatic zone of India showed Root mean Square Error (RMSE) between 37 and 87 W m(-2). The estimated ET was validated at six agricultural and five natural grassland and wetland vegetation sites with AMS measured ET for a year. The RMSE of 10 days ET sum were varying from 7.50 to 17.70 mm for agricultural and for natural vegetation sites it varies from 8.60 to 13.10 mm. The errors variation among all site is depending on the sub-pixel heterogeneity and difference in K-1 and AMS footprints. The ET sum over agricultural kharif (June to October) and rabi (November to April) season also able distinguish normal and drought year. This study provides a robust methodology for generating near real time ET at country scale from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO's) present and future high-resolution geostationary satellites over India.

TI  - Paucity of data evaluating patient centred outcomes following sentinel lymph node dissection in endometrial cancer: A systematic review
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is presently used by the majority of gynaecologic oncologists for surgical staging of endometrial cancer. SLND assimilated into routine surgical practice because it increases precision of surgical staging and may reduce morbidity compared to a full, systematic LND. Previous research focussed on the accuracy of SLND. Patient centred outcomes have never been conclusively demonstrated. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate patient centred outcomes of SLND for endometrial cancer patients. Literature published in the last five years (January 2015 to April 2020) was retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library, across five domains: (1) perioperative outcomes; (2) adjuvant treatment; (3) patient-reported outcomes (PROs); (4) lymphedema, and (5) cost. Covidence software ascertained a standardised and monitored review process. We identified 21 eligible studies. Included studies were highly heterogeneous, with widely varying outcome measures and reporting. SLND was associated with shorter operating times and lower estimated blood loss compared to systematic LND, but intra-operative and post-operative complications were not conclusively different. There was either no impact, or a trend towards less adjuvant treatment used in patients with SLND compared to systematic LND. SLND had lower prevalence rates of lymphedema compared to systematic LND, although this was shown only in three retrospective studies. Costs of surgical staging were lowest for no node sampling, followed by SLND, then LND. PROs were unable to be compared because of a lack of studies. The quality of evidence on patient-centred outcomes associated with SLND for surgical staging of endometrial cancer is poor, particularly in PROs, lymphedema and cost. The available studies were vulnerable to bias and confounding.

TI  - An evapotranspiration model driven by remote sensing data for assessing groundwater resource in karst watershed
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquifer recharge may depend mainly on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration. Hydrological models used to estimate groundwater reserves use evapotranspiration models that are mainly determined by climate demand. In particular, mechanisms of plant transpiration are neglected, although transpiration constitutes 70% of evapotranspiration. This is problematic when considering karst watershed, which are poorly documented at the interface between soil and atmosphere where vegetation and soil properties control water flows. To fill this gap, we propose an evapotranspiration model that integrates the processes of plant transpiration and soil evaporation. The dynamics of vegetation is evaluated using the Enhanced Vegetation Indexes from the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers. The soil evaporation calculation account for the impact of coarse elements at soil surface. The "Simple Crop coefficient for Evapotranspiration" (SimpKcET) model is tested at flux tower sites over forest of Font-Blanche, Puechabon and the agricultural area of Avignon. The simulated daily evapotranspirations are very close to the observations (RMSE similar to 0.5 mm.d(-1)), while the model is simple compared to other models proposed in the literature. The SimpKcET is implemented in a karst hydrological model to evaluate the impact of evapotranspiration estimation on the aquifer flow rate simulation. This approach is applied to the vast watershed of Fontaine de Vaucluse. In comparison to the water bucket model that is frequently used in karst models, SimpKcET provide ET simulations that are more in line with ET processes. A cross wavelet analysis highlighted the improvement of the simulated recharge and observed flow rate relationship brought by the consideration of evaporation and transpiration processes. The use of remote sensing data related to plant activity makes it possible to propose a parsimonious model that can be applied to all types of vegetation (agricultural, natural, mixed forest) and that can be transferred to other karst models.

TI  - Remote sensing image fusion with multistream deep ResCNN
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image pan-sharpening is the fusion of multispectral (MS) image and panchromatic (PAN) image into fused image with MS and high-resolution information features. In recent years, deep learning technology has been widely used in abounding fields such as text and image recognition. Inspired by this, we proposed a multistream deep ResCNN (RIFRCNN)based fusion method for remote sensing images. First, we put forward automatic learning matching module (ALMM). The utilization of ALMM can realize dynamic optimization matching of MS and PAN images with different resolutions. Second, we build feature fusion residual blocks suitable for RIFRCN to optimize network parameters. Finally, we input MS image and PAN image with different resolution and complete the fusion task through ALMM, fusion, and reconstruction module. Experiments onWorldView and QuickBird datasets manifest that the proposed RIFRCNN can effectively fuse MS and PAN images, and the fusion images generated in the experiments of true and false color images show better results than the state-of-the-art technology.

TI  - Cause and Process Mechanism of Rockslide Triggered Flood Event in Rishiganga and Dhauliganga River Valleys, Chamoli, Uttarakhand, India Using Satellite Remote Sensing and in situ Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The catchments of Rishiganga and then Dhauliganga valleys in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand were impacted by a catastrophic flood triggered due to a massive rockslide, caused by wedge failure on 7th February, 2021. It is estimated that the massive rockslide of similar to 23 million cubic meter volume containing base rock, deposited ice, and snow got detached from the northern slopes of the Trishul mountain range near Ronti Glacier and created a vertical fall of almost 1700 m before severely impacting the Ronti Gad valley located at 1.5 km downstream of Ronti Glacier snout. The huge detached mass of rock and ice (GLIMS ID: G079733E30381N) swiftly moved downstream through the glaciated valley entraining snow, debris, mud on its way, caused rapid fluidization, created massive water/slush waves, and washed away partially or completely the hydel power projects and bridges in its route. It is estimated that similar to 0.93 Peta Joules of potential energy led to the generation of a significant amount of kinetic and thermal energy, good enough to trigger above-mentioned processes. Post-event analysis of high-resolution satellite data shows flood water marks in the valley and on the rock outcrops reaching up to similar to 80-150 m height on the way to Raini Village. The mud and the slush produced through this process led to the formation of a dammed lake and temporarily blocked one of the tributaries of the Rishiganga joining from the northeast. This study provides an insight into the sequence of events as they unfolded, through multi-temporal satellite image analysis, aerial survey, seismological data in conjunction with various other geo-spatial and geo-visualization tools for unraveling the flood event that has happened on February 7, 2021. We also discuss the potential cause of rockslide and the process mechanism of this unique event, causing loss of lives and property besides widespread devastation.

TI  - Daily leaf area index from photosynthetically active radiation for long term records of canopy structure and leaf phenology
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical biophysical indicator that describes foliage abundance in ecosystems. An accurate and continuous estimation of LAI is therefore desirable to quantify ecosystem status and function (e.g. carbon and water exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere). However, deriving accurate LAI measurements at regular temporal intervals remains challenging, requiring either destructive sampling or manual collection of canopy gap fraction measurements at discrete time intervals. In this study, we present four methods to obtain continuous LAI data, simply derived from above and below canopy measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the Borden Forest Research Station from 1999 to 2018. We compared LAI derived using the four PAR-based methods to independent measurements of LAI from optical methods and the MODIS satellite LAI product. LAI derived from all four PAR-based methods captured the seasonal changes in observed and remotely sensed LAI and showed a close linear correspondence with one another (R-2 of 0.55 to 0.76 compared to MODIS LAI, and R-2 of 0.78 to 0.84 compared to LAI-2000 measurements). A PAR-based method using Miller's Integral theorem showed the strongest linear relationship with LAI-2000 measurements (R-2 =0.84, p<0.001, SE=0.40). In many years MODIS LAI indicated an earlier start of season and earlier end of season than the daily PAR-based LAI datasets showing systematic biases in the MODIS assessment of growing season.The four PAR-based LAI methods outlined in this study provide an LAI dataset of unprecedented temporal resolution. These methods will allow precise determination of phenological events, improve leaf to canopy scaling in process-based models, and provide valuable insight into dynamic vegetation responses to global climate change.

TI  - Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging, sentinel lymph node mapping in patients with vulvar cancer: peritumoral injection dosage and waiting times in our experience
T2  - GYNECOLOGICAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Vulvar cancer is a rare gynecological malignancy that primarily affects women of postmenopausal age. Treatment is mainly surgical, particularly for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma, the most prevalent histotype. In patients with unifocal tumors with a maximum diameter of <4 cm, in the absence of suspected inguinal lymph nodes, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is recommended. The use of a radioactive tracer is mandatory; the use of the vital blue dye is optional. Results Two patients diagnosed with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (FIGO IB stage) underwent bilateral radical vulvectomy, SLN search and removal, and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy at the Cannizzaro Hospital Operative Unit of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department (Catania, Italy). Three milliliters of indocyanine green (ICG) 0.5 mg/mL was administered in 3 peritumoral injections under general anesthesia to screen the SLN. The images were acquired using an intraoperative infrared camera system, which allowed intraoperative visualization of the SLN. An SLN was identified for each patient. The lymph nodes examined by the pathologist were negative for metastatic localization of the disease. However, patients underwent bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, as this procedure is not currently codified as a gold standard for the detection of SLN in vulvar cancer. All the lymph nodes removed were negative for the localization of vulvar carcinoma metastases. Conclusions The potential of the administration of indocyanine green (ICG) allows the execution of SLN biopsy, avoiding the multiple administrations of radiocolloid in the pre-operative phase, painful for the patient, elimination, and exposure to radioactivity. Therefore, while requiring standardization of the methodology and a large-scale application, this procedure could open a new surgical management perspective in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer.

TI  - Deep Compositional Spatial Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial processes with nonstationary and anisotropic covariance structure are often used when modeling, analyzing, and predicting complex environmental phenomena. Such processes may often be expressed as ones that have stationary and isotropic covariance structure on a warped spatial domain. However, the warping function is generally difficult to fit and not constrained to be injective, often resulting in "space-folding." Here, we propose modeling an injective warping function through a composition of multiple elemental injective functions in a deep-learning framework. We consider two cases; first, when these functions are known up to some weights that need to be estimated, and, second, when the weights in each layer are random. Inspired by recent methodological and technological advances in deep learning and deep Gaussian processes, we employ approximate Bayesian methods to make inference with these models using graphics processing units. Through simulation studies in one and two dimensions we show that the deep compositional spatial models are quick to fit, and are able to provide better predictions and uncertainty quantification than other deep stochastic models of similar complexity. We also show their remarkable capacity to model nonstationary, anisotropic spatial data using radiances from the MODIS instrument aboard the Aqua satellite.

TI  - Semantic segmentation sample augmentation based on simulated scene generation-case study on dock extraction from high spatial resolution imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning-based semantic segmentation methods, such as fully convolutional networks (FCNs), are state-of-the-art techniques for object extraction from high spatial resolution images. However, collecting massive scene-formed training samples typically required in FCNs is time-consuming and labour-intensive. A suit of automatic sample augmentation schemes based on simulated scene generation is proposed in this study to reduce the manual workload. Proposed schemes include style transfer, target embedding, and mixed modes by utilizing techniques, such as texture transfer, image inpainting, and region-line primitive association framework, which automatically expand the sample set on the basis of a small number of real samples. Dock extraction experiments using UNet are conducted on China's GaoFen-2 imagery with expanded sample sets. Results showed that the proposed schemes can successfully generate sufficient simulation samples, increase sample diversity, and subsequently improve semantic segmentation accuracy. Compared with the results that use the original real sample set, measures of F (1)-score (F (1)) and intersection over union (IoU) of dock extraction accuracy demonstrate a maximum improvement of 20.53% and 23.01%, respectively, after sample augmentation.

TI  - Assessing the influence of different validation protocols on Ocean Colour match-up analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple approaches have been used by the Ocean Colour community for validating satellite-derived products using in situ data, with most of them derived from mainly two approaches, one suggested by Bailey and Werdell (2006) (BW06) and one suggested by Zibordi et al. (2009a) (Z09), each with a different set of quality checking and spatiotemporal collocation criteria. The question remains what sort of information is added or missed when choosing one over the other. In this work, the differences among validation approaches were determined by using a common dataset of in situ and satellite data. The match-up exercise was separated into two groups of datasets based on the spatial resolution of the sensors to be validated. Sentinel-3A/OLCI data were selected as a representation of medium spatial resolution sensors, and two validation approaches were selected to this matchup dataset. The high spatial resolution sensors were represented by Sentinel-2A/MSI data, and three validation approaches were tested. Data from the AERONET-OC network were chosen as the common in situ dataset. For Sentinel-3A/OLCI, the number of match-ups varies depending on the validation approach used. Bailey and Werdell (2006) produces 20% more match-ups for Sentinel-3A/OLCI due to its more relaxed filtering criteria compared to the criteria applied by Zibordi et al. (2009a). The validation metrics vary between different validation methods giving a different impression of accuracy of the satellite products. Also, the satellite data selected by BW06 have a statistical distribution with a higher median and standard deviation when compared to Z09. Similar findings are also confirmed for the match-up analysis conducted for Sentinel-2A/MSI. Therefore, although a common reference dataset was used, the validation statistical results were influenced by the validation approach selected. This does not suggest that one validation protocol is better than the other, but it implies that validation statistics reported in different studies may not always be directly comparable. Additionally, it was determined that BW06 could be a better fit when trying to obtain a sufficient number of matchups for calibration purposes in the shortest time.

TI  - Comparison of PBIA and GEOBIA classification methods in classifying turbidity in reservoirs
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Our goal is to compare the performance of Classification and Regression Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithms, from supervised image classification, and approaches on Pixel-Based Image analysis (PBIA) and Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), to classify turbidity in reservoirs. Tod do so, we use Landsat 8 image and bands and spectral indices, as predictive parameters, as well as the classification algorithms based on PBIA and GEOBIA. The Brazilian Itaipu reservoir was adopted, as a case study. Our results show that the RF classifier obtained the highest accuracy in both classification approaches, followed by CART and NB. The KA and OA indices of the GEOBIA classifications were superior to the PBIA classifications in both algorithms. This study contributes with an approach to quickly and accurately delineating turbidity spectral limits in reservoirs.

TI  - Factors controlling the asymmetry of soil moisture and vegetation dynamics in a hilly Mediterranean catchment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between hydrology, terrain, and vegetation, is an essential element in understanding complex landscapes, and in forecasting their evolution under climate change. In Mediterranean Europe, few studies have been performed on the interrelation between them. In this study, soil moisture, vegetation, and water table dynamics were measured on opposing hillslopes of a semi-arid, Mediterranean catchment in southern Spain, to quantify the aspect influence on ecohydrological dynamics of an oak-woodland savanna or "dehesa". Observations of a network of 32 soil moisture sensors on two opposing hillslopes, a north-facing slope (NFS), and a south-facing one (SFS), detected a similar moisture dynamics, although the influence of the vegetation induces a lagged response where the NFS dries out earlier compared to the SFS. Analysis of successive soil water profiles after storm events suggests that the water moves downwards as an unsaturated preferential flow along the walls of the fractured granite material, with residence times between 16.3 and 36.7 days. Our results show that there is a direct coupling between the hillslope hydrology, the depth of the weathered bedrock, much higher on the NFS, and the vegetation dynamics. Vegetation is much denser on NFS, as LIDAR-derived biomass estimates were 29% higher than on the SFS. The evolution of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), obtained from the Sentinel-2 time series, also shows completely opposing trends with a minimum value at the end of winter for the NFS, whereas the SFS reaches minimum values in summer. A significant correlation between NDVI and soil moisture was found for the SFS (Pearson's R of 0.81). However, this correlation is very poor on the NFS, but a good correlation with water table was found (R = 0.46). This shows how the deep weathering on the NFS allows for an additional water source, contained in the rock moisture and saturated zone, that represents an important source for the vegetation, whereas on the SFS only soil moisture supports the vegetation. These vegetation differences in turn directly impact surface soil moisture, leading to the observed, relatively similar trends on both hillslopes.

TI  - Field-scale assessment of Belgian winter cover crops biomass based on Sentinel-2 data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter cover crops, used as green manure, can supply up to 45 units of nitrogen per hectare to the following summer crops. In order to contribute to the establishment of the nitrogen balance sheet for fertilisation recommendation of subsequent main crop at field scale, this supply is currently derived from the biomass production, classically estimated visually using 3 classes: 0?1, 1?3, 3+ tons of dry matter per hectare (Mg DM ha-1). The capabilities of Sentinel-2 satellite data to retrieve an operator-independent winter cover crop biomass have been assessed. Biomass samples were collected in 1 m quadrats for various types of winter cover fields classically used in Belgium (mustard, phacelia, oat and a range of mixed cover), in 2016 and 2017 (yield between 0.1 to 5 tons of dry matter per hectare). Empirical relationships between the winter cover crop biomass and a wide range of vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 have been defined, and the most performant VI identified. For pure stands of winter cover crops, the cross-validation RMSE (CVRMSE) of the best model is 0.36 Mg DM ha-1 for mustard and 0.3 Mg DM ha-1 for phacelia. The CVRMSE observed for mixed stands, around 0.61 Mg DM ha-1, is roughly two times higher than the CVRMSE observed for pure stands. The added-value of objective satellitebased estimation of winter cover biomass was also assessed by comparing respective estimations with regards to an independent reference dataset made of sample measurements on the ground. Models based on Earth observation showed better results than farmer visual assessment for mustard crops, and were as good as farmers for phacelia crops.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution and variation of wind erosion over the Tibetan Plateau based on a coupled land-surface wind-erosion model
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion has notable impacts on ecology, water supply and regional climate, but its distributions and longterm changes are still poorly quantified for the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study develops a coupled land-surface wind-erosion model (HRLDAS-WEPS) in two dimensions horizontally to analyze wind-erosion distributions and its temporal variations under the climate change in 1979?2015 over the entire TP. Two model enhancements are also used, including the application of MODIS vegetation datasets and the optimization of snow-cover parameterizations. Evaluation results indicate that the enhanced coupled model can generally represent the winderosion distributions over the TP, being mainly located in the arid and semi-arid areas and occurring in winter and spring, as compared with station observations and satellite datasets. In 1979?2015, wind erosion has a significant (P < 0.01) decreasing trend of -0.54 kg m- 2 yr- 1 for annual total soil loss averaged over the arid and semi-arid areas of the TP, which is mainly due to the significant (P < 0.01) declining wind speed and increasing soil moisture. The severest wind-erosion reduction is located to the northwest of the 200 mm precipitation line and the Qaidam Basin. Furthermore, a significant turning point of wind-erosion variation is found in 1992. Specifically, wind erosion over the TP decreases from 1979 to 1991 (-1.26 kg m- 2 yr- 1), and then stays at a low level with a slight increase (0.08 kg m- 2 yr- 1) since 1993. This is probably due to the abrupt change of wind speed over the TP in 1991.

TI  - Geospatial land surface-based thermal scenarios for wetland ecological risk assessment and its landscape dynamics simulation in Bayanbulak Wetland, Northwestern China
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Modifications to land surface thermal regime by climate change and land cover/land-use change may influence ecosystem structure and function in arid landscapes, but relevant studies are scarce. Large changes in the land surface thermal regime can disturb the hydro-ecological integrity of these landscapes. Thus, it is important to assess landscape change and ecological risk to promote arid landscape sustainability. Objectives This study predicted the landscape change and quantified the Bayanbulak ecological risk evolution through a susceptibility-hazard assessment system. Methods CA-Markov model was used to simulate the landscape change, while ERA model that builds the susceptibility-hazard indices rapport was applied to evaluate the Bayanbulak wetland ecological risk using 30 m remotely sensed data. Results Findings unveiled that modifications in water, meadow, and marshes are predicted to decline at a rate of 39.3, 6.32, 23.98% in 2069 respectively. As wetland hazard, the LST average increased from 20 to 22 degrees C with a maximum value of 35.2 degrees C from 1994 to 2019. Likewise, wetland susceptibility mean value increased from 1.10 to 1.20, a growth rate of 9.09%. Though the decline in high-risk zones, moderate risk zones drastically augmented at the extent of 70.5% while low risk and no risk zones declined with a reduction rate of 18.9 and 95.8% respectively. Overall observations exhibited that Bayanbulak ecological risk is slightly evolving. Conclusion Bayanbulak is a pool of ecosystem services. By highlighting its ecological risk evolution, we call upon the focus on factors driving LST increment and adopt climatic adaptation measures of aqua-terrestrial ecosystems for Bayanbulak management.

TI  - Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence and backscattering analysis for crop monitoring
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate the synergic use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering (i.e., sigma nought sigma 0) and InSAR coherence (gamma) maps as a tool for crop growth monitoring. Experiments were carried out using Sentinel-1 TOPS SAR data and field observations in one of the State General Directorate of Agriculture Enterprise farms in Konya (Central Turkey). The phenological stages of maize, sunflower, and wheat have been analyzed and compared to coherence and backscatter time series of Sentinel-1 data on multiple tracks and polarizations. The results evidence a strong correlation between different phenological stages of the crops and the InSAR coherence. Specifically, the observed coherence values are the highest for the maize (gamma asc, desc = 0.47) and sunflower (gamma asc = 0.49, gamma desc = 0.48) after plowing the fields and seeding the crops. The coherence decreases with the plants' growth and reaches the lowest values for maize, sunflower, and wheat (gamma = 0.08, gamma = 0.09 and gamma = 0.07, respectively) when the ground is completely covered by plants. Then, a coherence increase is observed after the harvesting time (gamma = 0.51, gamma = 0.50 and gamma = 0.42 for maize, sunflower, and wheat, respectively). In terms of multi-temporal SAR backscattering, we find significant changes of the sigma 0 values during the crops' growing stages due to the changes in their leaf geometry and physical structure. The highest sigma 0 values for the maize, sunflower, and wheat are obtained as -9.18 dB, -5.24 dB and -10.05 dB, respectively, for the ascending orbit, in mid growing stages. Results show the improved capacity of SAR-driven measurements for agriculture monitoring and precise farming activities when InSAR coherence and backscattering are synergistically used. Specifically, the coherence allows estimating the main growth stages of the different crop types. Moreover, SAR backscattering provides reliable information on the whole growth stages during the agricultural season, and it might be profitably exploited for crop assessment.

TI  - Towards Fine-Scale Yield Prediction of Three Major Crops of India Using Data from Multiple Satellite
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is enormous scope and prospective of crop yield prediction at finer scale for both farm-level crop management as well as for crop insurance settlement at gram panchayat (GP) level in India. Now with the advent of satellite sensors like the MSI from Sentilnel-2 with fine spatial resolution, the possibility of generating frequent information on crop condition at field scale is increasing. This study demonstrated the combined use of high-resolution data from Sentinel-2 (10 m and 20 m); moderate-resolution data from MODIS (500 m) and coarser-resolution radiation data from INSAT-3D (4 km) for estimating yield of three major crops of India at GP and taluka level using a semi-physical model based on crop-specific radiation use efficiency. The novelty of this study lies in the data fusion approach using parameters from multiple spatial resolution of Geostationary and Lower Earth Orbiting satellites within the basic semi-physical model framework. The methodology has been demonstrated in Cuttack district of Odisha for rice; Rajkot district of Gujarat for cotton; and Indore district of MP and Fatehabad district of Haryana for wheat. We validated our result at GP, taluka and district level. At GP level, the root mean square error (RMSE) was found to be 16.5% for rice and 5.8% for wheat in Indore district. At taluka level, the RMSE was found to be 15%, 5.7%, 4.4% and 7.4% for rice, wheat in Indore district, wheat in Fatehabad district and cotton, respectively. The study concluded that high resolution remote sensing data would be of immense use for finer scale yield estimation, which can be aggregated at GP and taluka level with satisfactory accuracy (p = 95%).

TI  - Anomalous behaviour detection using one-class support vector machine and remote sensing images: a case study of algal bloom occurrence in inland waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms are a frequent subject in scientific discussions and are the focus of many recent studies, mainly due to their adverse effect on society. Given the lack of ground truth data and the need to develop tools for their detection and monitoring, this research proposes a novel method to automate detection. Concepts derived from multi-temporal image series processing, spectral indices and classification with One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) are used in this proposal. Imagery from multi-spectral sensors on Landsat-8 and MODIS were acquired through the Google Earth Engine API (GEE API). In order to evaluate our method, two bloom detection case studies (Lake Erie (USA) and Lake Taihu (China)) were performed. Comparisons were made with methods based on spectral index thresholds. Also, to demonstrate the performance of the OC-SVM classifier compared to other machine learning methods, the proposal was adapted to be used with a Random Forest (RF) classifier, having its results added to the analysis. In situ measurements show that the proposed method delivers highly accurate results compared to spectral index thresholding approaches. However, a drawback of the proposal refers to its higher computational cost. The application of the new method to a real-world bloom case is demonstrated.

TI  - Perception of impact is affected by stimulus intensity
T2  - SPORTS BIOMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Perception of external loads may be a central topic to understand adjustments to the mechanical demands during movement. Nevertheless, the association between the perceived and the real load received is still controversial. This study aimed to correlate vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) to the perception of impact in different regimens of stimulus application. Ten physically active men performed drop jumps from four different heights (0.20, 0.40, 0.60 and 0.80 m). A force plate measured the vGRF, while perception of impact was evaluated through Borg's Ratings of Perceived Exertion. Higher values of maximum vGRF (Fy_max) and impulse of the first 50 ms (I_50), and reduced time to reach Fy_max indicate increased external forces as drop jump height raised. Perception of impact increased gradually with increasing jump height for I_50. Fy_max and I_50 showed moderate to strong correlations to perceived load for 70% and 90% of participants, respectively. Higher and different intensity of stimulus facilitated the perception of impact, presenting moderate to strong correlations to kinetic parameters related to external load during landing from drop jump. Perception of higher impacts could be used as a surrogate to monitor 'real' impacts and possibly also for managing impact-related injury risk.

TI  - Improving the accuracy of global precipitation measurement integrated multi-satellite retrievals (GPM IMERG) using atmosphere precipitable water and altitude in climatic regions of Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global precipitation measurement integrated multi-satellite retrievals (GPM IMERG) provide a new opportunity to estimate precipitation remotely. However, the accuracy of estimations varies in different regions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to improve the IMERG precipitation estimations using two influencing factors including total precipitable water (TPW) and altitude data. The investigations were performed in six rainfall climatic regions of Iran using daily and six-hourly IMERG estimations in years 2015 to 2017. TPW was extracted from a locally developed algorithm for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements. Different models named as M1 to M4 were investigated by considering combinations of the linear and quadratic forms of the IMERG precipitation, TPW, and altitude. The results were evaluated by root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), and Nash-Sutcliffe (NSc). The results showed that the M1 represents the best performance among the proposed models, which uses linear relationship of the IMERG estimations and TPW along with the constant value. The mean values of r, RMSE, and NSc criteria for daily precipitation estimations of IMERG were acquired as 0.46, 5.88, and -2.77 mm, respectively. Those values were improved by M1 to 0.52, 0.18, and 0.27 mm, respectively. Moreover, the evaluation results of IMERG six-hourly precipitation estimations showed r, RMSE, and NSc of 0.65, 11.26, and -33.27 mm. The values of these criteria were improved by M1 to 0.65, 0.07, and 0.32 mm. In general, the results proved the ability of TPW to improve IMERG precipitation estimations in the study area.

TI  - Women, goddesses and tantric praxis: a liberatory antidote to 'Hindutva' nationalist politics
T2  - CONTEMPORARY SOUTH ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - While modern India is complex, plural and perhaps foundationally connected with its rich liberatory paths, there is reason to be concerned when a large number of people are fed hate-filled rhetoric against their own long-term neighbors. Today the virulent ideology of a purported "Hindu" rashtra is growing under governmental provocation. It needs an alternative vision which can be resurrected from India's own suppressed history. That is Tantric India, whose liberatory paths with women and goddesses is compatible with the contemporary world. India has been a magnet for "spiritual" seekers around the world because the great sages were helping to free us from our conditioned selves. This worldview, that encompassed all Indic dharmas, was developed especially by Shaiva, Shakta and Buddhist enlightened beings, and was set against an upper caste hegemony of truncated Vedism. The true masters who developed a real science of tantric praxis taught how to appreciate the world here and now without violence to the self, earth or the perceived other. From ancient yogic explorations of humanistic psycho-spiritual development that has been a hallmark of India, a profoundly egalitarian world view had developed during 8th through 12th centuries. It is time we reexamine that history and imagine a different Subcontinent.

TI  - Building change detection in very high-resolution remote sensing image based on pseudo-orthorectification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When using very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images acquired at different times to detect building changes, the building positional inconsistencies caused by different satellite imaging angles are an outstanding issue. To tackle this problem, a novel building change detection method based on pseudo-orthorectification (PO) is proposed. First, to determine the building displacement value, a fast line detection method is used to accurately extract the building vertical facade contour lines under the constraint of the Object Space Positioning Consistency (OSPC). Second, the building roof sample selection is automatically conducted under the constraint of building facade contour lines, and the Grab-Cut algorithm is used to extract the roofs combining with corresponding geometric rules. Then, the roof of each building is shifted along the elevation line to its real location. Finally, subtraction is applied to generate the difference image, and reliable change information is obtained by integrating NDVI and shadow information of the building. Three sets of WorldView and QuickBird satellite images are used to compare the proposed method with three state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed method can reach 92.80%, which is 12.66% higher than that of compared methods.

TI  - Observed evidence of the growing contributions to aerosol pollution of wildfires with diverse spatiotemporal distinctions in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol pollution has become an increasingly serious problem in China. Among the multiple factors causing aerosol pollution, wildfires in China are occurring more frequently and have gradually become one of the most important contributing factors. However, little is known about their potential causality trends or spatial characteristics. In this research, satellite data of fire events and atmospheric aerosol datasets from 2001 to 2016 were applied in the geographical, statistical ?Geodetector model? (GDM) to better understand their causal relationship. From long term observation data in China, we found that the increase in wildfires over the study period greatly enhanced their impacts on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in recent years. The contribution of burning areas to AOD was 18.29% in 2001 and increased to 38.94% in 2016, and the contribution of fire radiative power (FRP) was 18.80% in 2001 and became 36.05% in 2016. In addition, seasonal research suggested that wildfires contributed rapidly to aerosol pollution, usually from April to September. The regional results in China showed that wildfires can be a relatively dominant factor for aerosol pollution in the southern regions, so that more importance should be attached to the complicated pollution conditions. Overall, our findings highlight the causal effects of wildfires on atmospheric aerosol pollution in China. We suggest that the rising contributions of wildfires to AOD in China should be noticed, and attention should be given to adaptions to local conditions regarding wildfires and aerosol pollution management.

TI  - Analyses of land surface temperature (LST) variability among local climate zones (LCZs) comparing Landsat-8 and ENVI-met model data
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The acceleration of urbanization has caused the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon because it has changed the built and natural structure. In recent years, the common concept of a local climate zone (LCZ) has become the top priority for UHI studies for eliminating the lack of standardization. This paper presents the statistical relation between LCZ and land surface temperature (LST) for the hot and arid summer period in Adana City of Turkey. It combines vector-based analysis to map LCZ classes and raster-based research to obtain LST derived from a Landsat-8 and ENVI-met 4.3.0 microclimate model. Firstly, LCZs were classified using five parameters including building height, building surface fraction, aspect ratio, pervious and impervious surface fraction. Secondly, the mean LST for each LCZ was obtained from Landsat-8 and ENVI-met. Finally, the statistical significance of temperature differences of each LCZ was analysed by pairwise comparisons using the ANOVA Tukey-HSD test. The results show that built types had generally warmer LSTs than land cover types. LST difference was 0.5?1.0 ?C in built types, while it was 1.0?2.0 ?C in land cover types in Landsat 8. On the other hand, the differences of LST range from 1.5 to 3.0 ?C for built types, and 3.0?8.0 ?C for land cover types in ENVI-met. Subsequent post-hoc tests demonstrated that the mean LSTs obtained from Landsat-8 and ENVI-met exhibited statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Moreover, the ENVI-met data had more obvious relationships with the LCZ-LST statistical results when compared with the Landsat-8 results. This study?s results will act as a guide for urban planners and future researchers to maintain a standardized UHI and ensure sustainable development, and have approved the current LCZ classification.

TI  - Performance evaluation of multi-parametric synthetic aperture radar data for geological lineament extraction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The demarcation of linear geomorphological features due to fracture systems, underlying or exposed faults, drainage lines etc. from satellite images has been one of the most widely used applications in geological studies. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has been recognized as an effective tool for lineament extraction due to its unique sensitivity to subtle topography, soil moisture and texture. However, the typical SAR sensor parameters such as frequency, polarization and look direction plays a vital role in enhancing the performance for a specific application. Therefore, the study aims to analyse the multi-frequency (C- and L-band), multi-polarization (like and cross) and multi-look direction SAR data for geological lineaments extraction. In this paper, Sentinel-1 and Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-2 Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR)-2 datasets acquired over a part of the Indo-Burma ranges of Manipur region (northeastern part of India) are considered for analysis. The lineaments extracted from SAR datasets are compared with reference to lineaments provided by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) through their portal. The study observes that the like-polarization C-band SAR data provide optimal results for this application. It is also observed that the integration of lineaments extracted from multi-look SAR data can significantly improve the performance than that derived from single-look data. Overall, the study also focuses on the spatial distribution of lineaments with respect to the local structural regime for a better understanding of the regional tectonic setup.

TI  - Ten years of corn yield dynamics at field scale under digital agriculture solutions: A case study from North Italy
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmer's management decisions and environmental factors are the main drivers for field spatial and temporal yield variability. In this study, a 22 ha field cultivated with corn for more than ten years using different prescription maps of nitrogen application rates was investigated. Prescription maps were developed based on archived yield maps, soil analysis and recently integrated with Sentinel 2 satellite images. In addition, farmer experience and availability of variable rate application (VRA) requirements had an influence on the development of the homogeneous management zones. The initial approach with VRA was quite simple, based on a simple partitioning of the field into three rectangular zones (defined mainly based on previous yield maps and farmer experience). The partitioning changed with time and knowledge, evolving to the final five irregularly shaped zones (defined based on Farm works decision support software). Furthermore, since 2010 the farmer began using soil moisture sensor for irrigation decisions. Results of the present study highlight an improvement in corn yield and a reduction in total applied nitrogen. Corn yield improved on average by 31% on a ten years basis to reach more than 14 ton/ha dm. in 2018. At the beginning of VRA, yield maps showed a high spatial variation between field zones compared to reduced variation in the following seasons. In addition, the nitrogen applied reduced by around 23% while the total yield was improving. These results showed an increase in the partial factor productivity from less than 54 to around 87 kg of corn grain per kg of nitrogen applied. This promising result shows that farmer management decisions can improve every season by continuous monitoring of crop performance, understanding field variability and taking advantage of recently developed decision support software tools.

TI  - Hydroponic farming hotspot analysis using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic and high-resolution satellite data of Majuli Island, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Majuti is the world's largest Riverine Island, formed by the headward erosion and migration of the Brahmaputra River. It is a part of the floodplains, which causes loss of arable lands, crops and farmers' livelihood. To cope and adapt, farming communality adopted hydroponics farming. In this study, high-resolution satellite data (similar to 3 m) were deployed to detect hotspots of hydroponics growing under flood conditions. A Getis-Ord Gi* spatial statistics technique was employed along with vegetation indices. The spatial maps exhibit that at several locations of Majuli Island, hydroponics was detected during the monsoon season. In total, 14 major sites were identified under hydroponics with a total area of 5.6 ha. The accuracy of hydroponics was assessed using precision and recall with the F1 score of 0.94. Around six sites of hydroponics were also validated with the independent high-resolution Google Earth image. This study demonstrates the utility of spatial statistics technique and high-resolution data for hotspot analysis of hydroponics farming. The method can be adopted for making plans and policies to identify locations for the commercialization of hydroponics farming, which could assist in food security, employment and farmer's livelihood and has the potential to meet the second sustainable development goal (SDG).

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term evaluation of the population change trend of different plant species in lagoons is of great importance in preserving the environment. Lagoons are the fundamental habitats for aquatic biodiversity conservation, which has at least one relatively narrow connection to the sea. In this research, Landsat time-series data are used to investigate the changes in Azolla (or green devil) expansion, and its effective factors over 30 years from the arrival of this aquatic fern from 1988 to 2018 in the International Lagoon of Anzali in the North of Iran using the spectral angular mapper (SAM) method and related field data. The results indicated that (1) the changes of Azolla plant expansion have a direct correlation with the volume of lagoon water and rainfall and an inverse relation with the region temperature, (2) The spread of Azolla has not been steady over three decades, increasing in some years and decreasing in others, (3) The high Azolla surface cover has caused environmental hazards in the lagoon and has reduced the value in the eastern, southwestern, and partly central parts of the area. Therefore, in order to maintain balance in the natural ecosystem of Anzali Lagoon, fundamental decisions must be made for determining the range and shelter of the lagoon and controlling the outflow of water resources.

TI  - SNOW COVER AREA ANALYSIS AND ITS RELATION WITH THE TEMPERATURE IN SIBINACOCHA LAKE WATERSHED, PERU, DURING 1984-2019 USING LANDSAT AND ERA5 DATA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In comparison with many remote parts of the Earth, the watershed Sibinacocha Lake is poorly studied region and the various types of life that habit this region are highly dependent on the waters of this glaciated basin. The present study evaluates the snow cover in this basin associated with changes in air temperatures and precipitation during the period 1984 to 2019. It used the ERA5 high-resolution reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and 35 images from the Landsat satellite. The results showed a statistically significant positive trend in maximum air temperatures whose signal is in agreement with previous studies. Seasonal analysis of maximum temperatures showed positive trends in all seasons, indicating that the highest trends occur during winter and the lowest trends during the southern fall. In addition, there was a 26% decrease in snow cover in general in the basin, and it was evidenced that the greater decreases (53%, approximately) occurred in regions below the altitude of 5300 m. In fact, from this contribution of the study comes the need to carry out more research in this region, especially to support decisions covering agriculture, water resources management and biodiversity studies.

TI  - Evaluation of merged multi-sensor ocean-color chlorophyll products in the Northern Persian Gulf
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Persian Gulf is a highly turbid and optically complex marginal sea. Satellite remotely sensed chlorophyll-a (Chla) products have been widely used in this marine area, despite uncertainties due to complex oceanic and atmospheric optical properties. In this study, accuracy of daily merged multi-sensor Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI), Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS) GlobColour, and OC5 single-sensor products of SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS, and VIIRS datasets were evaluated using in situ chlorophyll concentrations collected from 2008 to 2018 in the Iranian territorial waters. The results showed that the MAPE, RMSE, bias(delta) and R2 values between in situ and satellite-4 derived Chl-a vary in the range of 131-273%, 0.38-0.69, 0.27-0.43, and 0.27-0.44, respectively. Satellite-derived Chl-a concentrations overestimated the field observations by 131-232% in the northern parts of the middle deeper areas and up to 173-273% in Iranian coastal areas. The OC-CCI and GlobColour merged datasets overestimate the Chl-a concentrations by 19% more than the average of OC5 single-sensor products. Systematic errors were observed in the log-normal distributions of difference between in situ and satellite-derived Chl-a. A bootstrapping-like assessment was performed to eliminate the systematic errors, and to reduce the bias from satellite datasets. The results of statistical adjustment were applied on daily matchup data-pairs and time-series datasets. Furthermore, an inter-comparison was made between merged multi-sensor (OC-CCI, GlobColour CHL2) and OC5 single-sensor (SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS, and VIIRS) Chl-a products using 8-day time-series datasets during the years 2000-2020. The results showed that the OC5 single-sensor Chl-a datasets were more consistent with OC-CCI than GlobColour merged CHL2 in the deep and shallow regions of the study area. In contrast, the merged multi-sensor products were more similar to each other than the OC5 single-sensor datasets in the river plume zone. After performing statistical adjustment of timeseries datasets, the bias values between OC-CCI, GlobColour CHL2, and OC5 single-sensor datasets decreased by 14-22%, and the single-sensor datasets showed more similarity to OC-CCI datasets.

TI  - Bias correcting and extending the PM forecast by CMAQ up to 7 days using deep convolutional neural networks
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With rising levels of air-pollution, air-quality forecasting has become integral to the dissemination of human health advisories and the preparation of mitigation strategies. To achieve more accurate forecasts, researchers around the globe are developing mathematical modeling techniques to obtain more accurate forecasts. In this study, we explore the capabilities of a deep neural network (DNN) model in conjunction with conventional, more reliable chemical transport models i) to improve the performance of the chemical transport model (e.g., CMAQ) and; ii) to extend the forecast period to seven days. Using a generalized deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we forecast air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 up to seven days in advance. The CNN model bias-corrects hourly concentrations of air pollutants from the CMAQ model on the first-day and forecasts the remaining six days. Our results show improved performance of the average yearly index of agreement (IOA) from the CMAQ to the CNN model by 13% for PM2.5, 22% for PM10, and 43% for NO2 for the first-day bias correction; and the seventh-day forecast of NO2 by the CNN model was more accurate than the first-day forecast of the CMAQ model. The forecasts for PM2.5 and PM10, however, are reliable only up to two days in advance. The trained model is also capable of forecasting pollutants at stations not included in the training. The increase in the average yearly IOA at such stations is 13% for PM2.5, 22% for PM10, and 40% for NO2. Although the CNN model enhances the performance of the CMAQ model, it can be further improved by adding remote sensing data.

TI  - A coastal N<sub>2</sub> fixation hotspot at the Cape Hatteras front: Elucidating spatial heterogeneity in diazotroph activity via supervised machine learning
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the North Atlantic Ocean, dinitrogen (N-2) fixation on the western continental shelf represents a significant fraction of basin-wide nitrogen (N) inputs. However, the factors regulating coastal N-2 fixation remain poorly understood, in part due to sharp physico-chemical gradients and dynamic water mass interactions that are difficult to constrain via traditional oceanographic approaches. This study sought to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of N-2 fixation on the western North Atlantic shelf, at the confluence of Mid- and South Atlantic Bight shelf waters and the Gulf Stream, in August 2016. Rates were quantified using the N-15(2) bubble release method and used to build empirical models of regional N-2 fixation via a random forest machine learning approach. N-2 fixation rates were then predicted from high-resolution CTD and satellite data to infer the variability of its depth and surface distributions, respectively. Our findings suggest that the frontal mixing zone created conditions conducive to exceptionally high N-2 fixation rates (> 100 nmol N L-1 d(-1)), which were likely driven by the haptophyte-symbiont UCYN-A. Above and below this hotspot, N-2 fixation rates were highest on the shelf due to the high particulate N concentrations there. Conversely, specific N-2 uptake rates, a biomass-independent metric for diazotroph activity, were enhanced in the oligotrophic slope waters. Broadly, these observations suggest that N-2 fixation is favored offshore but occurs continuously across the shelf. Nevertheless, our model results indicate that there is a niche for diazotrophs along the coastline as phytoplankton populations begin to decline, likely due to exhaustion of coastal nutrients.

T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization in Pakistan is increasing at 3% annually, the highest in South Asia. 50% of the population is expected to urbanize by 2025. The capital city of Pakistan, Islamabad has experienced phenomenal increase in the urban population and extent in the last four decades. The aim of this research was to analyze the urban sprawl of Islamabad and changes in the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), with the help of satellite images. LULC statics were extracted from Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, for the years 1979, 1989, 1999, 2008 and 2019. There is an increase of 377 sq. km in built-up areas and slight increase of 47 sq km in the agriculture land. The forest cover has been reduced by 83 sq km and the water bodies have also reduced. The barren land has experienced an unprecedented decrease of 333 sq km in the meanwhile. The master plan is under revision to regularize such uncontrolled constructions and accommodate the increased demand. The city, as a result, has been facing issues of water supply, sanitation, transportation etc. This has seriously jeopardized the master plan of the city.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques including Convolutional neural network (CNN), Recurrent neural network (RNN), and Recurrent-Convolutional neural network (R-CNN) have been extensively used to classify the remotely sensed data. Out of various deep learning algorithms, CNN-based algorithms are most widely used for the satellite image classification. Despite the improved performance of CNN, it also requires various hyper-parameters for training the network architecture to achieve the desired classification accuracy. Keeping in view the fact that the accuracy achieved by any classification algorithms is influenced by a suitable choice and value of hyper-parameter, this paper discusses the influence of several hyper-parameters on the classification accuracy of CNN classifier using three remote sensing datasets. The aim of this study is not to propose a set of values of different hyper-parameters but to study their influence on land cover classification accuracy with remote sensing datasets. Experimental results from the study indicate that various hyper-parameters affect the performance of CNN classifier to different extent suggesting a need to select the optimal value of these hyper-parameters for land cover classification studies using considered datasets.

TI  - A phenological object-based approach for rice crop classification using time-series Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in Taiwan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial assessment of rice-cultivated areas is a crucial activity in Taiwan due to government initiatives to provide policymakers with reliable and timely information for devising successful rice grain import and export plans. The objective of this study is to develop a phenological object-based approach for collectively mapping patches of rice fields using the time-series Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. We processed the data for 2019 cropping seasons, following three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to construct the smooth twelve-day time-series composite vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH) polarized data, (2) object-based image classification of rice-cultivated areas using phenological metrics, and (3) accuracy assessment of the mapping results. The classification maps compared with the government's ground reference maps indicated satisfactory accuracies, with producer's accuracies of 84.2% and 82.6% and user's accuracies of 82.1% and 85.3% for the first and second crops, respectively. These results were reaffirmed by close agreement in area estimates between the satellite-derived rice area and government's reference data at township level, with coefficient of determination (R (2)) values of 0.96 and 0.94 for the first and second crops, respectively. In spite of some error sources, including mixed-pixel issues and edge effects, that lowered the mapping accuracy, the results of this study have demonstrated that our mapping approach using the time-series Sentinel-1 VH data and information of crop phenology could be potentially applied at a larger scale in Taiwan and transferable to other regions for updating rice crop maps on a timely and frequent basis.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a gaseous air pollutant which primarily gets in the air when fossil fuels such as coal, oil, gas or diesel are burned at high temperatures through industries, power plant, automobiles and locomotive. Continuous exposure to elevated concentration of NO2 may impose development of asthma and potentially increase in susceptibility to respiratory infections in humans. The present study examined impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 in terms of spatial and temporal variation of tropospheric NO2 in Indo-Gangetic plain. The results showed steep reduction in tropospheric NO2 as a result of ceased industrial and economic activities. Analysis of Sentinel-5P satellite data was carried out for specific period during 2019-2020 at a regional scale and for major industrial cities. Tremendous positive impact of lockdown in atmospheric condition is observed, wherein NO2 concentration has gone down by 20-40% in all major cities except few exceptions were noticed. The concomitant impact of Covid-19 has ensued pragmatic constructive impact on environment and climate, due to drop in NO2 emissions.

TI  - DAU-Net: a novel water areas segmentation structure for remote sensing image
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water information extraction is always an important aspect of remote sensing image analysis. However, in the actual water images of remote sensing, the backgrounds of water areas are mostly complex buildings and vegetation, which interferes with water detection. In addition, traditional water detection methods were not able to accurately identify small tributaries and edge information. In order to improve to the accuracy of water segmentation, a dense skip connections network with multi-scale features fusion and attention mechanism is proposed for water areas segmentation. The proposed method obtains water feature information by using U-shaped Network (U-Net) as the backbone network and performs dense skip connections between nested convolution modules to reduce the semantic gap between the feature maps of the codec sub-networks and reduce the gradient vanishing problem of network training. In the proposed model, deep feature information is fused with shallow feature information through multi-scale attention modules. The shallow features and large-scale attention modules are used to locate the main body of the water area, while the deep features and small-scale attention modules are used to fine segment the edge of the water area. Combined with the above features and attention modules, waters can be extracted from the backgrounds. Finally, the segmentation accuracy of edge regions is further improved by Conditional Random Field (CRF). The experimental results from China HJ-1A (HJ-1B) satellite imageries and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat-8) imageries show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods.

TI  - Impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on vegetation change: Evidence from typical areas in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the interactions of climate-vegetation and human-vegetation has been a critical issue and increasingly attracting attention from scientific community in the field of global change research. This study investigated the heterogeneous impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on vegetation change by applying the trend analysis and Geodetector approach. The spatial and temporal patterns of MODIS NDVI and LAI during 2003?2017 were firstly examined in China. We then quantified the contribution and interactions effects of climatic factors (temperature and precipitation) and anthropogenic factors (population, gross domestic product and other four categories of forestry investment) on vegetation change in five typical areas of China. Both NDVI and LAI across China demonstrated a significant increasing trend over the past two decades. However, the eastern developmental regions such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region and Yangtze River Delta exhibited a decreasing trend due to fast urbanization. Socio-economical inputs (the explanatory power of forestry investment > 40%, the range of explanatory power is 0 to 100%) were identified as the dominant driving forces of vegetation change for the most of study areas. Precipitation was the most important natural influencing factor of vegetation change. We also found that the interactions between forestry investment and other factors presented much greater explanatory power on vegetation change than a single factor. Our research highlights that the afforestation program in China during the past several decades plays an important role in contributing to vegetation greening across the country. Greening and degradation, however, are largely related to landscape context, which could be due to natural change and anthropogenic impact. To maintain high levels of forests, conserving the vegetation is more important than increasing the economic development.

TI  - Comparative performance of linear regression, polynomial regression and generalized additive model for canopy cover estimation in the dry deciduous forest of West Bengal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy cover is an important biophysical indicator of forested habitats, but quantifying and monitoring with the accurate and cost-efficient method is always difficult in fragmented canopy cover areas. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the comparative performance of linear regression, polynomial regression and generalized additive model (GAM), and assess the important predictors for canopy cover estimation in the dry deciduous forest of West Bengal. We used the Sentinel-2 based individual bands and spectral indices as predictor variables from the different composition of imagery in the growing season (June-September) between 2018 and 2020. Canopy cover of 667 plots were measured using collect earth online (CEO) from high resolution imagery. Univariate and multiple models were fitted and assessed by 10 fold cross-validation. Root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) was used for the evaluation of model performance. The result showed that univariate models using GAM were fitted better followed polynomial regression and linear regression model. SWIR bands and SWIR bands based indices were fitted well than other groups of variables. Individual bands based multiple prediction models performed better followed by NIR, SWIR, atmospheric and red edge indices based multiple prediction models for multiple linear regression, multiple polynomial regression and multiple GAM. Multiple GAM performed better (RMSE = 0.163, R-2 = 0.777) than multiple polynomial regression (RMSE = 0.167, R-2 = 0.772) and multiple linear regression model (RMSE = 0.182, R-2 = 0.721). Although, the difference of performance between multiple polynomial regression model and multiple GAM was negligible. But in respect to prediction range, and overestimation and underestimation multiple GAM was superior to multiple polynomial regression model. The study demonstrates that the potential utility of GAM for canopy cover estimation and GAM can be superior to linear and polynomial regression model using suitable predictor variables.

TI  - Abundance and Seasonality of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in Two Suburban Localities of South Mexico, With Implications for <i>Wolbachia</i> (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae)-Carrying Male Releases for Population Suppression
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a baseline characterization of the abundance and seasonality of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762)-a vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika-in two suburban localities of Yucatan, Mexico, as the first step in the implementation of an integrated vector management (IVM) plan combining 'traditional Aedes control' (source reduction/truck-mounted ultra-low volume [ULV] spraying) and incompatible insect technique/sterile insect technique for population suppression in Yucatan, Mexico. Weekly entomological collections with ovitraps and BG-sentinel traps were performed in 1-ha quadrants of both localities for 1 yr. Three distinct periods/phases were identified, closely associated with precipitation: 1) a phase of low population abundance during the dry season (weekly average of Aedes eggs per ovitrap and adults per BG trap = 15.51 +/- 0.71 and 10.07 +/- 0.88, respectively); 2) a phase of population growth and greatest abundance of Aedes (49.03 +/- 1.48 eggs and 25.69 +/- 1.31 adults) during the rainy season; and finally 3) a phase of decline among populations (20.91 +/- 0.97 eggs and 3.24 +/- 0.21 adults) after the peak of the rainy season. Seasonal abundance and dynamics of Ae. aegypti populations suggest that it is feasible to develop and implement time-specific actions as part of an IVM approach incorporating integrating novel technologies (such as rear-and-release of Wolbachia-infected males) with classic (insecticide-based) approaches implemented routinely for vector control. In agreement with the local vector control program, we propose a pilot IVM strategy structured in a preparation phase, an attack phase with traditional vector control, and a suppression phase with inundative releases, which are described in this paper.

TI  - Axillary staging in ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion: A meta-analysis
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCISM); arguably a more aggressive subtype of DCIS, currently has variable recommendations governing its staging and management in the UK. As a result, there is ongoing controversy surrounding the most appropriate management of DCISM, in particular the need of axillary staging.Method: A search was conducted on the databases MEDLINE and Embase using the keywords: breast, DCISM, microinvasion, "ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion", sentinel lymph node biopsy, SLNB, axillary staging was performed. 23 studies were selected for analysis. Primary outcome was the positivity of metastasis of lymph node; secondary outcome looked at characteristics of DCISM that may affect node positivity.Results: A total of 2959 patients were included. Significant heterogeneity was observed amongst the studies with regards to metastases (I2 = 61%; P < 0.01). Lymph node macrometastases was estimated to be 2%. Significant subgroup difference was not observed between SLNB technique and lymph node macrometastases (Q = 0.74; p = 0.69). Statistical significance was observed between the focality of the DCISM and lymph node macrometastases (Q = 8.71; p = 0.033).Conclusion: Although histologically more advanced than DCIS, DCISM is not linked with higher rates of clinically significant metastasis to axillary lymph nodes. Survival rates are very similar to those seen in cases of DCIS. Current evidence suggests that axillary staging in cases of DCISM will not change their overall management, thus may only be an unnecessary and inconvenient additional intervention considering the majority of DCISM diagnoses are made from post-operative pathology samples. A multidisciplinary team approach evaluating preoperative clinical and histological information to tailor the management specific to individual cases of DCISM would be a preferred approach than routine axillary staging.

TI  - Pueblo ethnography, Sopris archaeology, and the sacred geography of sopris rock art
T2  - TIME & MIND-THE JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY CONSCIOUSNESS AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sopris archaeological culture in southeastern Colorado was first identified as Puebloan and then later as local hunter-gatherers influenced by trade with the Northern Rio Grande area. By applying Eastern Pueblo ethnography, we show that the earlier interpretation is better. Physical emphases on such profound cultural features as dualism, cardinal directions, and kiva equivalents cannot be explained by trade, but instead point to Eastern Pueblo origins. Furthermore, a Tanoan model, incorporating a Tewa origin myth as well as Tiwa ethnography, provides a framework for understanding associated rock art. Concentric activity zones essential to a Tanoan worldview help to explain an agricultural shrine near fields (zone 2), hunting shrines in surrounding hills (zone 3), and a rain shrine in the headwaters of the Purgatoire valley (zone 4). The rain shrine included unusual and unique images.

TI  - Bottom-up evaluation of the regional methane budget of northern lands from 1980 to 2015
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study created a regional budget for methane (CH4) for Northern Europe, Siberia, and northern North America, based on a mission inventories, biogeochemical models, and land-surface satellite data. Natural sink and sources (wetlands, termites, wildfires, soil oxidation, and geological sources) and anthropogenic sources (fossil fuel extraction, industry and transportation, waste, agriculture, and livestock) were included. During 2000-2015, the region was estimated to be a net source of 57.2 Tg CH4 yr(-1), 40.8% of which was contributed by anthropogenic sources. Wetland emissions (33.9 Tg CH4 yr(-1)) were the largest sources in the region, followed by fossil fuel extraction, waste, and geological emissions. Comparisons with other estimates indicated an uncertainty of +/- 16.9 Tg CH4 yr(-1) for wetland emissions and +/- 6.9 Tg CH4 yr(-1) for anthropogenic emissions. Regional emissions reached a peak in 1988, troughs in 1996 and 2000, and then gradually increased to a maximum in 2015. The temporal patterns was attributable to variations of both anthropogenic and natural emissions. Spatial maps of CH4 sources, sinks, and net emissions were constructed to identify "hot spots" of emissions and their variations. Theanalyses revealed a need for further clarification of emissions from freshwater, permafrost thawing, biomass burning, and fossil fuel exploitation.

TI  - Improving regional wheat drought risk assessment for insurance application by integrating scenario-driven crop model, machine learning, and satellite data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Accurate estimation of yield losses from natural disasters on a regional scale can guide agronomic management and agricultural insurance, transfer disaster risk, and ensure food security. Conventional yield losses, however, mainly depend on historical events, for which detailed records of locations and losses are unavailable.OBJECTIVE: The development of a disaster vulnerability model has consequently been hindered by the lack of sufficient samples. To improve regional yield estimates, a novel method for estimating yield losses and the pure insurance rate is thus strongly needed.METHODS: Using 129 major wheat-producing counties on the North China Plain as an example, we developed a drought assessment system based on crop growth modeling, machine learning, and satellite data. The initial model used was the model to simulate the crop-weather relationship over a large area (MCWLA) applied to wheat (MCWLA-Wheat), which was then calibrated by multi-step-assimilation with multi-source data. We first established various drought scenarios to simulate the impacts of drought at different growth stages on wheat yield by driving the calibrated MCWLA-Wheat.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, drought-sensitive stages of wheat varied by drought severity, with insufficient water supply during the Greenup-Heading stage having the most significant impact on grain yields. Based on the outputs of the simulation and three drought indicators-standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil moisture index (SSMI), and relative leaf area index (RLAI), we then established vulnerability models coupling the MCWLA-Wheat with statistical models (random forest [RF] and multiple linear regression [MLR]). The vulnerability model MCWLA+RF showed higher accuracy, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6% (i.e., 365 kg ha-1), relative to that of the MCWLA+MLR (RMSE = 1175 kg ha-1). Ranked in descending order, the relative importance of drought indicators at Greenup-Heading was SPI, SMMI-20 cm, and RLAI. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study has highlighted a potential method for quantifying crop disaster risk-integration of a scenario-driven crop growth model, machine learning, and satellite data-that can be applied to other crops and regions.

TI  - Assimilation of soil moisture and canopy cover data improves maize simulation using an under-calibrated crop model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameter calibration is normally required prior to crop model simulation, which can be a time-consuming and data-intensive task. Meanwhile, the growth stages of different hybrids/cultivars of the same crop often show some similarities, which implies that phenological parameters calibrated for one hybrid/cultivar may be useful for the simulation of another. In this study, a data assimilation framework is proposed to reduce the requirement for parameter calibration for maize simulation using AquaCrop. The phenological parameters were uniformly scaled from previous research performed in a different location for a different maize hybrid, and other parameters were taken from default settings in the model documentation. To constrain simulation uncertainties, soil moisture and canopy cover observations were assimilated both separately and jointly in order to update model states. The methodology was tested across a rain-fed field in Nebraska for 6 growing seasons. The results suggested that the under-calibrated model with uniformly scaled phenological parameters captured the temporal dynamics of crop growth, but may lead to large estimation bias. Data assimilation effectively improved model performance, and the joint assimilation outperformed single-variable assimilation. When soil moisture and canopy cover were jointly assimilated, the overall yield estimates (RMSE = 1.24 t/ha, nRMSE = 11.48%, R2 = 0.695) were improved over the no-assimilation case (RMSE = 2.01 t/ha, nRMSE = 18.61%, R2 = 0.338). Sensitivity analyses suggested that the improvement was still evident with temporally sparse soil moisture observations and a small ensemble size. Further testing using observations within 90 days after planting demonstrated that the method was able to predict yield around 3 months before harvest (RMSE = 1.7 t/ha, nRMSE = 15.74%). This study indicated that maize yield can be estimated and predicted accurately by monitoring the soil moisture and canopy status, which has potential for regional applications using remote sensing data.

TI  - Preoperative evaluation and influencing factors of sentinel lymph node detection for early breast cancer with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography What matters
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) is important in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. We aimed to evaluate the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in the preoperative evaluation for SLN and potentially influencing factors, to provide evidence to the management of breast cancer. Patients with breast cancer who treated in our hospital from May 2018 to May 2020 were selected. All patients underwent CEUS examination to find SLN and judged whether the lymph node had cancer metastasis. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CEUS in predicting SLN, and its differences in pathological diagnosis results and related influencing factors were also analyzed. A total of 108 patients with breast cancer were included. And a total of 248 SLNs were detected. The sensitivity of CEUS to the preoperative evaluation of SLN was 84.67%, the specificity was 81.14%, the positive predictive value was 76.08%, and the negative predictive value was 89.27%, the positive likelihood ratio was 4.06, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.14. The area under the curve of the preoperative evaluation of SLN in CEUS examination was 0.813 (95% confidence interval: 0.765-0.911), and there was significant difference in the size of SLNs between SLN-negative and SLN-positive groups (P = .043). Preoperative CEUS has good predictive value for the SLN detection in patients with breast cancer, and it is worthy of clinical application.

TI  - Visit-to-visit blood pressure variability is common in primary care patients: Retrospective cohort study of 221,803 adults
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveAlthough high visit-to-visit blood pressure variability (BPV) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, the frequency of high BPV is unknown. We conducted this study to define the frequency of high BPV in primary care patients, clinical correlates, and association with antihypertensive therapies.MethodsRetrospective cohort study using electronic medical record data (with previously validated case definitions based on billing codes, free text analysis of progress notes, and prescribing data) from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network of 221,803 adults with multiple clinic visits over a 2-year period. We a priori defined a standard deviation>13.0 mm Hg in visit-to-visit systolic blood pressure (SBP) as "high BPV" based on prior literature.ResultsOverall, 85,455 (38.5%) patients had hypertension (mean 6.56 visits with SBP measurement, mean SBP 134.4 with Standard Deviation [SD] 11.3, 33.2% exhibited high BPV) and 136,348 did not (mean 3.96 visits with SBP measurement, mean SBP 120.9 with SD 8.2, 16.5% had high BPV). BPV increased with age regardless of whether individuals had hypertension or not; at all ages BPV varied across antihypertensive treatment regimens and was greater in those receiving renin angiotensin blockers or beta-blockers (p<0.001). High BPV was more frequent in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Parkinson's disease.ConclusionsHigh visit-to-visit BPV is present in one sixth of non-hypertensive adults and one third of hypertensive individuals and is more common in those with comorbidities. The frequency of high BPV varies across antihypertensive treatment regimens.

TI  - Elevation-dependent response of spring phenology to climate and its legacy effect on vegetation growth in the mountains of northwest Mongolia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation spring phenology in mountains has undergone profound changes due to climate change. In this paper, which made use of the Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) smoothing algorithm and logistic models, the start of the vegetation growing season (SOS) inferred from MODIS datasets with different spatial resolutions from 2001 to 2018 was extracted. The MODIS data closest to the ground-truth observation data were then selected to reflect spring phenology. Combined with temperature and precipitation data, the spatio-temporal patterns and elevation-dependent change mechanisms of the SOS and its legacy effect on vegetation growth in the mountains of northwest Mongolia was examined and the following results were obtained: (1) Compared with the MOD13A1 and MOD13A2 datasets, the high spatial resolution MOD13Q1 dataset provided stronger correlations and the lowest errors with ground-truth observation data. (2) In this study, the SOS usually occurred between 120 and 152 day-of-year (DOY) with the earlier SOS detected in the low-elevation areas. Later SOS occurred mostly in the higher elevation areas. (3) The spatio-temporal variations in the SOS are mainly influenced by both spring temperature and winter precipitation, with increasing precipitation in winter tending to delay the SOS, while increasing spring temperature tended to advance the SOS. (4) At elevation gradient, the spring temperature showed a significant negative effect on SOS at all elevations, except between 1037 m and 1137 m and 3337 m to 3437 m above sea level (ASL), with a significant positive correlation between SOS and winter precipitation between 1337 m and 2937 m ASL. It is expected that spring temperature is closely linked to the heat accumulation of plants, while winter precipitation indirectly affects the temperature in spring. (5) In lower elevation areas (below 1437 m ASL), the SOS was found to be negatively correlated with spring and summer growth, with advancing SOS leading to increased vegetation growth during spring and summer. In higher elevation areas (above 1437 m ASL), the SOS was significantly negatively correlated with spring growth and positively correlated with summer growth. Hence, delayed SOS leads to decreased spring growth and increased summer growth. Also, we found the effect of SOS on vegetation growth gradually weakened from spring to summer. These findings can help to determine the mechanisms and functional consequences of spring phenological changes in mountain regions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of bubonic plague in Pernambuco, northeast of Brazil: Case study in the municipality of Exu
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with other countries in America, plague reached Brazil through the sea routes during the third pandemic. A brief ports phase was followed by an urban phase that took place in smaller inland cities and finally, it attained the rural area and established several foci where the ecological conditions were suitable for its continued existence. However, the geographic dispersion of plague in Brazil is still poorly studied. To better understand the disease dynamics, we accessed satellite-based data to trace the spatial occurrence and distribution of human plague cases in Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil and using the municipality of Exu as study case area. Along with the satellite data, a historical survey using the Plague Control Program files was applied to characterize the spatial and temporal dispersion of cases in the period of 1945-1976. Kernel density estimation, spatial and temporal clusters with statistical significance and maximum entropy modeling were used for spatial data analysis, by means of the spatial analysis software packages. The use of geostatistical tools allowed evidencing the shift of the infection from the urban to the wild-sylvatic areas and the reemergence of cases after a period of quiescence, independent of the reintroduction from other plague areas.

TI  - Mapping quasi-circular vegetation patch dynamics in the Yellow River Delta, China, between 1994 and 2016
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of a decrease in water provision from the Yellow River and the influence of various human actions, the Shandong Yellow River Delta Wetland, selected a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2013, has undergone substantial degradation. Although some restoration work has been undertaken, more adaptive active restoration strategies should be developed based on researches on spontaneous revegetation in this region. In this regard, the quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs), characterized by a rapid rate of succession, are thus considered as ideal research targets. The spatial and temporal quantification of QVPs is not only fundamental to determining QVP formation mechanism but also contributes to the development of adaptive restoration strategies for the degraded ecosystems. Therefore, we examined QVP dynamics over seven time periods spanning 22 years using one aerial photograph and seven high-spatial resolution satellite images. We found that although the total number of QVPs remained almost unchanged, the total area had an increasing trend, and that the shape index (SIi = Peremeteri 2 ????????? ? ) of QVPs tended to initially increase and subsequently decrease, with QVPs finally attaining ?Areai an almost circular shape. Observations for the period between 2000 and 2016 indicated that the area and shape of QVPs could reach maximum extents within about three years. This knowledge could provide a valuable basis for studying the interactions of QVPs with environment, and the implications/consequences to ecosystems, e.g., mechanisms of the evolution of ecosystems, ecological services etc. We accordingly suggest that developing a long-term remote sensing monitoring and ground-based survey program would make a significant contribution to developing a nature-based solution for the degraded ecosystems in the Yellow River Delta, China.

TI  - Correcting solar radiation from reanalysis and analysis datasets with systematic and seasonal variations
T2  - CASE STUDIES IN THERMAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), a component of solar radiation, is used to assess potential and estimate power output of solar thermal and PV applications. The reanalysis or analysis data are alternative to satellite data for solar resource assessment in places where latter is not available or costly, so there is need to evaluate their performance. The evaluation of estimated GHI (six-hourly data) from five global reanalysis and analysis datasets (NCEP-NCAR, NCEP-DOE, CFSR, NCEPGFS and NCEP-FNL) is performed using annual, seasonal and monthly statistical analyses. The range of annual rMBE, rMAE, rRMSE and R is 13-41%, 23-41%, 44-66% and 0.938-0.965 respectively in the two inspected stations for all reanalysis and analysis datasets. Systematic errors were observed in estimated GHI which signifies need to apply bias correction to get data with acceptable uncertainty. Five bias correction methods based on Measure-Correlate-Predict, LinearAdaptation (LA1 and LA2), CDF and Model Output Statistics (MOS) were applied to correct original GHI. The range of rMAE and rRMSE after bias-correction is 12-19% and 23-37% respectively for six-hourly data. The overall results of MOS method are best, followed by the linear-adaptation method. The corrected GHI from CFSR and NCEP-GFS datasets can be used for preliminary solar resource assessment.

TI  - Linking urban tree inventories to remote sensing data for individual tree mapping
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees provide a range of vital social and environmental services. Currently, inventories of individual urban trees are conducted in-situ by professional arborists. Such an approach to urban tree inventories means they are challenging to maintain and only capture information describing trees on accessible land. Whilst remote sensing approaches have shown the potential to derive individual tree attributes, these studies rarely make use of existing inventory information. In this study, we present a method to parameterise an algorithm for individual tree detection and delineation from airborne remote sensing data. The approach uses existing inventory data as training information firstly for the detection of the canopy area and secondly to parameterise a marker-based watershed segmentation algorithm. In this parameterisation, crown segmentation shape, as well as features derived from the remote sensing data, are used to determine if a segment contains one or more trees. If a segment contains more than one tree, it is split with the number of markers increased until each segment includes only one tree. The approach was evaluated within three distinct urban areas: the central business district, an urban park and a residential area, to be determined. Commission and omission errors ranged between 11% and 27% across the three regions, with commission typically caused by land covers on private land that were unaccounted for in the training processes. In all areas the overall tree count was within two per cent of that defined by reference information. The accurate tree count produced by this approach suggests it has the potential to be adopted by government agencies for routine tree inventory maintenance.

TI  - Research on Surface Deformation of Ordos Coal Mining Area by Integrating Multitemporal D-InSAR and Offset Tracking Technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground mining in coal mining areas will induce large-scale, large-gradient surface deformation, threatening the safety of people's lives and property in nearby areas. Due to mining-related subsidence is characterized by fast displacement and high nonlinearity, monitoring this process by using traditional and single interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology is very challenging, and it cannot accurately and quantitatively calculate the deformation of the mining area. In this paper, we proposed a new method that combines both multitemporal consecutive D-InSAR and offset tracking technology to construct a complete deformation field of the coal mining area. Taking into account the accuracy of multitemporal consecutive D-InSAR in calculating small deformation areas and the ability of offset tracking to measure large deformation areas, we utilized their respective advantages to extract the surface influence range and applied an adaptive spatial filtering method to integrate their respective results for inversion of the deformation field. 12 ascending high-resolution TerraSAR-X images (2 m) from September 3, 2018, to October 26, 2019, and 39 descending Sentinel-1 TOPS SAR images from August 5, 2018, to November 4, 2019, in the Ordos Coalfield located at Inner Mongolia, China, were utilized to obtain the whole subsidence field of the working faces F6211 and F6207 during the 454-day mining period. The GPS monitoring station located in the direction of the mining surface is used to verify the accuracy of the above method; at the same time, to a certain extent, the difference between the unmanned aerial vehicle's DSM data acquired after coal mining and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (STRM) DEM can qualitatively verify the accuracy of the results. Our results show that the results of TerraSAR are basically consistent with the deformation trend of GPS data, and that of Sentinel-1 have large errors compared with GPS. The maximum central subsidence reaches similar to 12 m in the working face F6211 and similar to 4 m in the working face F6207. In the working face F6207, the good agreement between GPS and TerraSAR results indicated that the method above using high-resolution SAR data could be reliable for monitoring the large deformation area in the mining field.

TI  - Assessment of Land Use/Cover Change Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques: A Case of Osogbo and Its Peripheral Areas in Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of accurate and timely information describing the nature and extent of land resources and changes over time is increasing, especially in rapidly growing city areas. Landsat satellite imageries of three different time periods, i.e., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) of 1982, 2000 and 2018 were acquired by Global Land Cover Facility Site (GLCF) and earth explorer site, quantify the changes in the Osogbo and its peripheral areas from 1982 to 2018 over a period of 36 years. These data sets were imported in ArcGIS 10.3, ERDAS Imagine and IDRIS Selva, satellite image processing softwares to create a false colour composite (FCC), supervised classification methodology was employed using maximum likelihood technique. The images of the study area were categorized into four different classes namely Core-urban, Peri-urban, Vegetation, water body. The results indicate that during the last thirty-six (36) years, Core-Urban land and water body have been increased by 2.74% (38.20 km2) and 0.98% (13.69 km2) while Peri-Urban land, and vegetation cover have decreased by 0.35% (5.00 km2), and 3.36 % (46.87 km2), respectively. The results quantify the land cover change patterns in the city and its peripheral area and demonstrate the potential of multitemporal Landsat data to provide an accurate, economical means to map and analyse changes in land cover over time that can be used as inputs to land management and policy decisions.

TI  - Earth Observation and Biodiversity Big Data for Forest Habitat Types Classification and Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the light of the "Biological Diversity" concept, habitats are cardinal pieces for biodiversity quantitative estimation at a local and global scale. In Europe EUNIS (European Nature Information System) is a system tool for habitat identification and assessment. Earth Observation (EO) data, which are acquired by satellite sensors, offer new opportunities for environmental sciences and they are revolutionizing the methodologies applied. These are providing unprecedented insights for habitat monitoring and for evaluating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators. This paper shows the results of a novel approach for a spatially explicit habitat mapping in Italy at a national scale, using a supervised machine learning model (SMLM), through the combination of vegetation plot database (as response variable), and both spectral and environmental predictors. The procedure integrates forest habitat data in Italy from the European Vegetation Archive (EVA), with Sentinel-2 imagery processing (vegetation indices time series, spectral indices, and single bands spectral signals) and environmental data variables (i.e., climatic and topographic), to parameterize a Random Forests (RF) classifier. The obtained results classify 24 forest habitats according to the EUNIS III level: 12 broadleaved deciduous (T1), 4 broadleaved evergreen (T2) and eight needleleaved forest habitats (T3), and achieved an overall accuracy of 87% at the EUNIS II level classes (T1, T2, T3), and an overall accuracy of 76.14% at the EUNIS III level. The highest overall accuracy value was obtained for the broadleaved evergreen forest equal to 91%, followed by 76% and 68% for needleleaved and broadleaved deciduous habitat forests, respectively. The results of the proposed methodology open the way to increase the EUNIS habitat categories to be mapped together with their geographical extent, and to test different semi-supervised machine learning algorithms and ensemble modelling methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this research paper, change detection based methods were considered to find collapsed and intact buildings using radar remote sensing data or radar imageries. The main task of this research paper is the collection of most relevant scientific research in the field of building damage assessment using radar remote sensing data. Several methods are selected and presented as best methods in the present time, there are methods with using interferometric coherence, backscattering coefficients in different spatial resolution. In conclusion, methods are given in the end, which show, which methods and radar remote sensing data give more accuracy and more available for building damage assessment. Low-resolution Sentinel-1A/B radar remote sensing data are recommended as free available for monitoring of destruction on a degree microregion level. Change detection and texture-based methods are used together to increase overall accuracy. Homogeneity and Dissimilarity GLCM texture parameters found better for the separation of collapsed and intact buildings. Dual polarization (VV, VH) backscattering coefficients and coherence coefficients (before the earthquake and coseismic) were fully utilized for this study. There were defined the better multi variable for supervised classification of none building, damaged and intact buildings features in urban areas. In this work, we were achieved overall accuracy 0.77, producer's accuracy for none building is 0.84, for damaged building case 0.85, for intact building 0.64. Amatrice town was chosen as most damaged from the 2016 Central Italy Earthquake.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring the Canopy Cover and Greenness of Southern Yellow Pines (Loblolly, Shortleaf, and Virginia Pines) in Central-Eastern Tennessee Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Satellite Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern yellow pines such as loblolly, Virginia and shortleaf pines constitute forest products and contribute significantly to the economy of the United States (U.S.). However, little is understood about the temporal change in canopy cover and greenness of southern yellow pines, especially in Tennessee where they are used for timber and pulpwood. This study aims to map and monitor the canopy cover and greenness of southern yellow pines i.e., loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus echinata), and Virginia (Pinus Virginiana) pines in the years 1988, 1999 and 2016 in central-eastern Tennessee. Landsat time-series satellite data acquired in December 1988, November 1999 and February 2016 were used to map and monitor the canopy cover and greenness of loblolly, shortleaf and Virginia pines. The classification and mapping of the canopy cover of southern yellow pines were performed using a machine-learning random forest classification algorithm. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to monitor the temporal variation in canopy greenness. In total, the canopy cover of southern yellow pines decreased by about 35% between December 1988 and February 2016. This information could be used by foresters and forest managers to support forest inventory and management.

TI  - Drought trend analysis in a semi-arid area of Iraq based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index and Standardized Precipitation Index
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought was a severe recurring phenomenon in Iraq over the past two decades due to climate change despite the fact that Iraq has been one of the most water-rich countries in the Middle East in the past. The Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) is located in the north of Iraq, which has also suffered from extreme drought. In this study, the drought severity status in Sulaimaniyah Province, one of four provinces of the IKR, was investigated for the years from 1998 to 2017. Thus, Landsat time series dataset, including 40 images, were downloaded and used in this study. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were utilized as spectral-based drought indices and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was employed as a meteorological-based drought index, to assess the drought severity and analyse the changes of vegetative cover and water bodies. The study area experienced precipitation deficiency and severe drought in 1999, 2000, 2008, 2009, and 2012. Study findings also revealed a drop in the vegetative cover by 33.3% in the year 2000. Furthermore, the most significant shrinkage in water bodies was observed in the Lake Darbandikhan (LDK), which lost 40.5% of its total surface area in 2009. The statistical analyses revealed that precipitation was significantly positively correlated with the SPI and the surface area of the LDK (correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.72, respectively). The relationship between SPI and NDVI-based vegetation cover was positive but not significant. Low precipitation did not always correspond to vegetative drought; the delay of the effect of precipitation on NDVI was one year.

TI  - Automation of Pan-Sharpening Methods for Pleiades Images Using GIS Basic Functions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening methods allow the transfer of higher resolution panchromatic images to multispectral ones concerning the same scene. Different approaches are available in the literature, and only a part of these approaches is included in remote sensing software for automatic application. In addition, the quality of the results supplied by a specific method varies according to the characteristics of the scene; for consequence, different algorithms must be compared to find the best performing one. Nevertheless, pan-sharpening methods can be applied using GIS basic functions in the absence of specific pan-sharpening tools, but this operation is expensive and time-consuming. This paper aims to explain the approach implemented in Quantum GIS (QGIS) for automatic pan-sharpening of Pleiades images. The experiments are carried out on data concerning the Greek island named Lesbo. In total, 14 different pan-sharpening methods are applied to reduce pixel dimensions of the four multispectral bands from 2 m to 0.5 m. The automatic procedure involves basic functions already included in GIS software; it also permits the evaluation of the quality of the resulting images supplying the values of appropriate indices. The results demonstrate that the approach provides the user with the highest performing method every time, so the best possible fused products are obtained with minimal effort in a reduced timeframe.

TI  - National Mapping of New Zealand Pasture Productivity Using Temporal Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A national map of pasture productivity, in terms of mass of dry matter yield per unit area and time, enables evaluation of regional and local land-use suitability. Difficulty in measuring this quantity at scale directed this research, which utilises four years of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and collected pasture yield measurements to develop a model of pasture productivity. The model uses a Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), with spatio-temporal segmentation and averaging, to estimate mean annual pasture productivity across all of New Zealand's grasslands with a standard error of prediction of 2.2 t/ha/y. Regional aggregates of pasture yield demonstrate expected spatial variations. The pasture productivity map may be used to classify grasslands objectively into stratified levels of production on a national scale. Due to its ability to highlight areas of land use intensification suitability, the national map of pasture productivity is of value to landowners, land users, and environmental scientists.

TI  - The Conflict of Liberal and Conservative Values in the Media Discourse of the Federal and Dagestan Mass Media
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is aimed at studying the conflict between liberal and religious values in the Dagestani media discourse. The socio-political prerequisites for the emergence of the conflicting discursive practice are identified; concepts and strategies of cultural polemics, linguistic methods of constructing religious or political value systems, methods of constructing opportunistic images and ethically marked simulacra are analyzed. The empirical base of the study is over 100 publication from federal and regional media. The selection was determined by the keywords and thematic relevance. The content analysis showed that factual information, characters and cited comments were often repeated. Further, the content of ten publications from federal and ten from regional media was studied. The publications selected for the analysis use a wide variety of methods to construct conflict-generating situations, have a significant number of quoted comments and the maximum depth of the characters' discursive confrontation. The publications were analyzed according to the critical discourse analysis model. As a result of the study, the directions and consequences of the development of a conflict-generating media discourse were determined. In the publications of the federal media, the discursive conflict forms a stable sphere of concepts, generates relevant emotions and types of communication. Supporters of conservative norms refer to the totalitarian ethical discourse, in which the propaganda orientation, manipulative communication strategies, the suggestive format of communicative interaction play the role of discourse markers. Journalistic comments present an objective analysis of the situation, often with the use of irony. Irony-caused transformations of concepts lead to increased verbal aggression, enhance the discursive conflict and equalize opponents in their attempt to promote their point of view. The hypertext shell of the publications exacerbates the conflict by context inclusion. As a result, a simulacrum of a national community is formed in the discourse, as opposed to civilizational and world integration cultural processes. In the regional segment, two logics of the discursive conflict development are distinguished; they are based on two different strategies. The strategy of carnivalization changes value-based and cultural orientations, devalues personal freedom, and hinders the development of cultural integration. The purport of this strategy is the ideologization of religious values, their subordination to political force. The mythologization strategy creates a sacred space within media discourse; this space is necessary for the formation of a religiously conditioned worldview. In this case, religious values subjugate political and social interests, become the purpose of discursive processes' development.

TI  - Detecting Ground Deformation in the Built Environment Using Sparse Satellite InSAR Data With a Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The large volumes of Sentinel-1 data produced over Europe are being used to develop pan-national ground motion services. However, simple analysis techniques like thresholding cannot detect and classify complex deformation signals reliably making providing usable information to a broad range of nonexpert stakeholders a challenge. Here, we explore the applicability of deep learning approaches by adapting a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect deformation in a national-scale velocity field. For our proof-of-concept, we focus on the U.K. where previously identified deformation is associated with coal-mining, ground water withdrawal, landslides, and tunneling. The sparsity of measurement points and the presence of spike noise make this a challenging application for deep learning networks, which involve calculations of the spatial convolution between images. Moreover, insufficient ground truth data exist to construct a balanced training data set, and the deformation signals are slower and more localized than in previous applications. We propose three enhancement methods to tackle these problems: 1) spatial interpolation with modified matrix completion; 2) a synthetic training data set based on the characteristics of the real U.K. velocity map; and 3) enhanced overwrapping techniques. Using velocity maps spanning 20152019, our framework detects several areas of coal mining subsidence, uplift due to dewatering, slate quarries, landslides, and tunnel engineering works. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed framework to the development of automated ground motion analysis systems.

TI  - Mapping structural attributes of tropical dry forests by combining Synthetic Aperture Radar and high-resolution satellite imagery data
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Optical satellite imagery has been used for mapping the spatial distribution of vegetation structure attributes; however, obtaining accurate estimates with optical imagery can be difficult in tropical forests due to their dense canopy and multi-layered vegetation. Synthetic aperture radar imagery can be more suitable in this case, as the radar signal can penetrate the forest canopy and interact with stems, providing a better estimation of the vegetation structure. This study compared the accuracy of forest species richness, tree diameter, height, and basal area estimates obtained using Sentinel-2 and Advanced Land Observing Satellite -1 (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data, either combined or separately. Location The Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Methods Field data were collected in three 3600-km(2)-window areas with three different types of tropical dry forest. Three random forest regression models were fitted: one using explanatory variables derived from Sentinel-2 data, a second using predictor variables derived from ALOS PALSAR, and the third using a combination of explanatory variables from both sensors. A variance partitioning analysis was carried out to examine the percent variability of each vegetation attribute that was explained by the models combining the explanatory variables of the two sensors (ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-2). Results Vegetation attribute estimation errors ranged from 13% to 38.5% when using ALOS PALSAR variables and from 11% to 33% when using Sentinel-2 variables. Combining variables from both sensors provided more accurate estimates of vegetation attributes. A 5% reduction of the estimated error, and an increase from 0.50 to 0.63 of the percentage of variation explained by the models (R-2) were achieved. Conclusions Our results suggest that both ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-2 data provide accurate estimates of vegetation structure and species richness in tropical dry forests. However, combining explanatory variables from the two sensors improved the estimation accuracy of vegetation attributes.

TI  - Method for Most Appropriate Plucking Date Determination based on the Elapsed Days after Sprouting with NIR Reflection from Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Method for most appropriate plucking date determination based on the elapsed days after sprouting with Near Infrared: NIR reflection from Sentinel-2 data is proposed. Depending on the elapsed days after sprouting, tealeaf quality is decreasing. On the other hand, tealeaf yield is increasing with increasing of the days after sprouting. Therefore, there is most appropriate plucking date is very important. Usually, it is determined by the normalized Difference Vegetation Index: NDVI derived from handheld NDVI cameras, drone mounted NDVI cameras, and visible to NIR radiometer onboard satellites because NIR reflection and NDVI depend on tealeaf quality and yield. It, however, does not work well in terms of poor regression performance and species dependency. Moreover, it takes time consumable works for finding appropriate tealeaves from the acquired camera images. The proposed method uses only the days after sprouting. Next thing it has to do is to determination of sprouting date. In order to determine the date, optical sensor onboard Sentinel-2 data is used. Through experiment with the truth data taken at the intensive study area of the Oita Prefectural Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Research Guidance Center: OPAFFRGC, it is found that the proposed method is validated.

TI  - "I Don't See It That Way Anymore": A Qualitative Study of Significant Changes of Mind
T2  - QUALITATIVE REPORT
M3  - Article
AB  - The specific aim of the study is to explore the cognitive and emotional phenomena which accompany profound changes of perspective that people have. I would like to understand the change in a person's thinking and in what way the person experiences these changes, whether it is a change in belief or a worldview. I would also like to understand whether external factors such as that facilitate these profound changes. Using a phenomenological approach, I interviewed eight adult participants in depth regarding changes to their worldview. I examined three phases of change, namely pre-change phase, the change phase, and the post-change phase. The themes I identify and describe include: emotional comfort and quiescence, and the precipitating event in the pre-change phase; vacillation and emotional discomfort in the change phase; and a return to psychological comfort and resilience in the post-change phase. I discuss these changes using Terror Management Theory (TMT), the Meaning Making Model (MMM), and Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions as useful lenses through which one can view these individual changes.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Earth observation data provide useful information for the monitoring and management of vegetation- and land-related resources. The Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE) was used to download, process and composite Sentinel-2 data from 2018-2020 for Uganda. Over 16,500 Sentinel-2 data granules were downloaded and processed from top of the atmosphere reflectance to bottom of the atmosphere reflectance and higher-level products, totalling > 9 TB of input data. The output data include the number of clear sky observations per year, the best available pixel composite per year and vegetation indices (mean of EVI and NDVI) per quarter. The study intention was to provide analysis-ready data for all of Uganda from Sentinel-2 at 10 m spatial resolution, allowing users to bypass some basic processing and, hence, facilitate environmental monitoring.

TI  - Earth Observation as a Facilitator of Climate Change Education in Schools: The Teachers' Perspectives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change education (CCE) fosters the skills and behavioral patterns of students in regards to climate-related challenges and risks. Despite its importance, the integration of CCE in schools is challenging due to the interdisciplinary nature of climate science and the obstacles and demands of everyday school reality. Here, we examine the case of satellite Remote Sensing (RS) for Earth Observation (EO) as an innovative tool for facilitating CCE. We focus on Greece, a country that, despite being a hot spot for climate change, shows a low level of CCE integration in schools and awareness for EO-based educational resources. Based on interviews with in-service teachers, our research reveals the following: (a) there is a high interest in how satellites depict environmental phenomena; (b) EO is considered an efficient vehicle for promoting CCE in schools because it illustrates climate change impacts most effectively; (c) local natural disasters, such as intense forest fires and floods, are more familiar to students and, thus, preferable for teaching when compared to global issues, such as the greenhouse effect and sea level rise; and (d) educators are in favor of short, hands-on, EO-based activities (also known as "activity-shots"), as the most useful material format for integrating climate change topics in their everyday teaching practice.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Formation in Greater Cairo: Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Daytime and Nighttime Land Surface Temperatures along the Urban-Rural Gradient
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban heat island (UHI) is a significant anthropogenic modification of urban land surfaces, and its geospatial pattern can increase the intensity of the heatwave effects. The complex mechanisms and interactivity of the land surface temperature in urban areas are still being examined. The urban-rural gradient analysis serves as a unique natural opportunity to identify and mitigate ecological worsening. Using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Land Surface Temperature (LST) data in 2000, 2010, and 2019, we examined the spatial difference in daytime and nighttime LST trends along the urban-rural gradient in Greater Cairo, Egypt. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning techniques were employed to conduct the spatio-temporal analysis. The analysis results revealed that impervious surfaces (ISs) increased significantly from 564.14 km(2) in 2000 to 869.35 km(2) in 2019 in Greater Cairo. The size, aggregation, and complexity of patches of ISs, green space (GS), and bare land (BL) showed a strong correlation with the mean LST. The average urban-rural difference in mean LST was -3.59 degrees C in the daytime and 2.33 degrees C in the nighttime. In the daytime, Greater Cairo displayed the cool island effect, but in the nighttime, it showed the urban heat island effect. We estimated that dynamic human activities based on the urban structure are causing the spatial difference in the LST distribution between the day and night. The urban-rural gradient analysis indicated that this phenomenon became stronger from 2000 to 2019. Considering the drastic changes in the spatial patterns and the density of IS, GS, and BL, urban planners are urged to take immediate steps to mitigate increasing surface UHI; otherwise, urban dwellers might suffer from the severe effects of heatwaves.

TI  - Comparing scraping cytology with touch imprint cytology and frozen section analysis in the intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer is a common cancer in the female population. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) in breast cancer patients can be evaluated by different methods including intraoperative frozen section analysis (FSA), touch imprint cytology (TIC), and scraping cytology (SC). In this study, in addition to investigating TIC and FSA, we focused on SC to evaluate the diagnostic value of this almost new method.Materials and methods In this retrospective study, the quadrantectomy and sentinel lymph node resection of 150 specimens with mammography and core needle biopsy-confirmed breast cancer were examined. Of the 150 participants, 77 and 73 had negative and positive results for the permanent pathology of SLN metastasis, respectively. Intra-operative FSA, TIC, and SC for SLN were performed for the patients and all were confirmed by permanent pathology.Results All the specimens were taken from females aged between 25 and 82 years. The sensitivity and specificity of TIC, FS, and SC were 73% and 50%, 92.6% and 50%, and 92.1% and 50%, respectively. Among the three techniques, TIC had the lowest positive and negative predictive values. However, FS had the highest positive predictive value whereas SC had the highest negative predictive value.Conclusion In addition to FS and TIC as rapid, cost-effective, and reliable diagnostic methods in SLN metastasis, SC is an acceptable and highly sensitive method. A combination of these methods may provide a more favorable diagnostic value for SLN assessment in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Cereal Crops Soil Parameters Retrieval Using L-Band ALOS-2 and C-Band Sentinel-1 Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the potential of L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) and C-band Sentinel-1 radar data for retrieving soil parameters over cereal fields. For this purpose, multi-incidence, multi-polarization and dual-frequency satellite data were acquired simultaneously with in situ measurements collected over a semiarid area, the Merguellil Plain (central Tunisia). The L- and C-band signal sensitivity to soil roughness, moisture and vegetation was investigated. High correlation coefficients were observed between the radar signals and soil roughness values for all processed multi-configurations of ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 data. The sensitivity of SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data to soil moisture was investigated for three classes of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (low vegetation cover, medium cover and dense cover), illustrating a decreasing sensitivity with increasing NDVI values. The highest sensitivity to soil moisture under the dense cover class is observed in L-band data. For various vegetation properties (leaf area index (LAI), height of vegetation cover (H) and vegetation water content (VWC)), a strong correlation is observed with the ALOS-2 radar signals (in HH(Horizontal-Horizontal) and HV(Horizontal-Vertical) polarizations). Different empirical models that link radar signals (in the L- and C-bands) to soil moisture and roughness parameters, as well as the semi-empirical Dubois modified model (Dubois-B) and the modified integral equation model (IEM-B), over bare soils are proposed for all polarizations. The results reveal that IEM-B performed a better accuracy comparing to Dubois-B. This analysis is also proposed for covered surfaces using different options provided by the water cloud model (WCM) (with and without the soil-vegetation interaction scattering term) coupled with the best accuracy bare soil backscattering models: IEM-B for co-polarization and empirical models for the entire dataset. Based on the validated backscattering models, different options of coupled models are tested for soil moisture inversion. The integration of a soil-vegetation interaction component in the WCM illustrates a considerable contribution to soil moisture precision in the HV polarization mode in the L-band frequency and a neglected effect on C-band data inversion.

TI  - Assessment of MERRA-2 and ERA5 to Model the Snow Water Equivalent in the High Atlas (1981-2019)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt water runoff from seasonal snow in the High Atlas range is an essential water resource in Morocco. However, there are only few meteorological stations in the high elevation areas and therefore it is challenging to estimate the distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE) based only on in situ measurements. In this work we assessed the performance of ERA5 and MERRA-2 climate reanalysis to compute the spatial distribution of SWE in the High Atlas. We forced a distributed snowpack evolution model (SnowModel) with downscaled ERA5 and MERRA-2 data at 200 m spatial resolution. The model was run over the period 1981 to 2019 (37 water years). Model outputs were assessed using observations of river discharge, snow height and MODIS snow-covered area. The results show a good performance for both MERRA-2 and ERA5 in terms of reproducing the snowpack state for the majority of water years, with a lower bias using ERA5 forcing.

TI  - Performance of ICESat-2 Precision Pointing Determination
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global elevations are critical to understanding the Earth's dynamic processes and changing climate. These measurements are best acquired from a space-based vantage point and are most accurate using laser altimetry technology. However, the accuracy associated with the elevation retrievals from laser altimetry relies heavily on the ability to precisely determine the pointing angle of the laser beams from the satellite to the illuminated spot on the surface. The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) has a system consisting of instruments that support the determination of the laser pointing direction through a process called Precision Pointing Determination (PPD). In this paper, we describe the PPD conceptual implementation, instrument details, data processing approach, calibration/validation techniques, and performance assessment. We show that the PPD has successfully achieved the allocated accuracy goal essential to meeting the ICESat-2 geolocation mission requirement.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node in cervical cancer: time to move forward
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In early-stage cervical cancer, lymph node status is of paramount importance to determine the best therapeutic strategy and is one of the most important prognostic factors of survival. According to main international guidelines, pelvic full lymphadenectomy is recommended for lymph node staging. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is an accurate method for the assessment of lymph nodal involvement and has been suggested instead of systematic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). The SLN technique requires a learning-curve to be well performed. Combined detection with technetium-99 and blue dye has been widely used but the recent introduction of indocyanine green (ICG) is of growing interest since it could improve SLN detection. SLN biopsy offers a more accurate anatomical staging by finding potential metastatic nodes outside of usual lymphadenectomy areas. SLN biopsy improves the diagnostic value of lymph node staging with ultrastaging and detection of low-volume nodal metastases [isolated tumor cells (ITCs) and micrometastases]. Appropriate selection of patient and minimal training combined with some simple rules may guarantee a low false negative rate. Several studies have shown that SLN mapping in these patients is feasible, with excellent detection rates and sensitivity. Less-radical lymph node dissection decreases the associated morbidity of PLND, especially the risk of lower-limb lymphoedema, which severely affects patient quality of life. Some points are still subject to debate such as the low accuracy of intraoperative SLN status assessment by frozen section and the impact of micrometastasis on prognosis. Although international guidelines consider SLN biopsy as an alternative to PLND, SLN biopsy alone is not the gold-standard yet due to lack of prospective evidence on long-term oncological safety. The 3 ongoing prospective trials SENTIX, PHENIX and SENTICOL III will most probably give an answer to these issues.

TI  - Exploring Archetypes of Tropical Fire-Related Forest Disturbances Based on Dense Optical and Radar Satellite Data and Active Fire Alerts
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest disturbances linked to fire usage cause large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and environmental damages. Supporting precise GHG estimations and counteracting illegal fire usages in the tropics require timely and thematically detailed large-scale information on fire-related forest disturbances. Multi-sensor optical and radar detection and ranging (radar) remote sensing data combined with active fire alerts shows the potential for a more in-depth characterization of fire-related forest disturbances. We utilized dense optical (Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) time series to individually map forest disturbances in the province of Riau (Indonesia) for 2018-2019. We combined the sensor-specific optical and radar forest disturbance maps with daily active fire alerts and classified their temporal relationship (predating, coinciding, postdating) into seven so-called archetypes of fire-related forest disturbances. The archetypes reflect sensor-specific sensitives of optical (e.g., changes in tree foliage) and radar (e.g., changes in tree structure) data to detect varying types of forest disturbances, ranging from either a loss of tree foliage and/or structure predating, coinciding or postdating fires. These can be related to different magnitudes of fire-related forest disturbances and burn severities and can be associated with specific land management practices, such as slash-and-burn agriculture and salvage logging. This can support policy development, local and regional forest management and law enforcement to reduce illegal fire usage in the tropics. Results suggest that a delayed or opposing forest disturbance detection in the optical and radar signal is not only caused by environmental influences or different observation densities but, in some cases, such as fire-related forest disturbances, can be related to their different sensitives to detect changes in tree foliage and structure. Multi-sensor-based forest monitoring approaches should, therefore, not simply combine optical and radar time series on a data level, as it bears the risk of introducing artefacts.

TI  - Surgical Management of the Axilla in Clinically Node-Positive Breast Cancer Patients Converting to Clinical Node Negativity through Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Current Status, Knowledge Gaps, and Rationale for the EUBREAST-03 AXSANA Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryCurrently, it is unclear which kind of axillary staging surgery breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis should receive after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For decades, these patients have been treated with a full axillary lymph node dissection, even if they converted to clinical node negativity. However, the removal of a large number of lymph nodes during the procedure can increase arm morbidity and impact quality of life. Therefore, several studies investigated less radical surgical strategies in this setting, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy or targeted axillary dissection, i.e., removal of a previously marked node combined with sentinel node removal. In this review, we summarize current evidence on the different surgical techniques and compare national and international recommendations. We show that many questions regarding oncological safety of different surgery types and the optimal marking technique remain unanswered and present the multinational prospective cohort study AXSANA that will address these open issues.In the last two decades, surgical methods for axillary staging in breast cancer patients have become less extensive, and full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is confined to selected patients. In initially node-positive patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, however, the optimal management remains unclear. Current guidelines vary widely, endorsing different strategies. We performed a literature review on axillary staging strategies and their place in international recommendations. This overview defines knowledge gaps associated with specific procedures, summarizes currently ongoing clinical trials that address these unsolved issues, and provides the rationale for further research. While some guidelines have already implemented surgical de-escalation, replacing ALND with, e.g., sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or targeted axillary dissection (TAD) in cN+ patients converting to clinical node negativity, others recommend ALND. Numerous techniques are in use for tagging lymph node metastasis, but many questions regarding the marking technique, i.e., the optimal time for marker placement and the number of marked nodes, remain unanswered. The optimal number of SLNs to be excised also remains a matter of debate. Data on oncological safety and quality of life following different staging procedures are lacking. These results provide the rationale for the multinational prospective cohort study AXSANA initiated by EUBREAST, which started enrollment in June 2020 and aims at recruiting 3000 patients in 20 countries (NCT04373655; Funded by AGO-B, Claudia von Schilling Foundation for Breast Cancer Research, AWOgyn, EndoMag, Mammotome, and MeritMedical).

TI  - Systematic detection of local CH<sub>4</sub> anomalies by combining satellite measurements with high-resolution forecasts
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present a novel monitoring methodology that combines satellite retrievals and forecasts to detect local CH4 concentration anomalies worldwide. These anomalies are caused by rapidly changing anthropogenic emissions that significantly contribute to the CH4 atmospheric budget and by biases in the satellite retrieval data. The method uses high-resolution (7 km x 7 km) retrievals of total column CH4 from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite. Observations are combined with high-resolution CH4 forecasts (similar to 9 km) produced by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) to provide departures (observations minus forecasts) at close to the satellite's native resolution at appropriate time. Investigating these departures is an effective way to link satellite measurements and emission inventory data in a quantitative manner. We perform filtering on the departures to remove the synoptic-scale and meso-alpha-scale biases in both forecasts and satellite observations. We then apply a simple classification scheme to the filtered departures to detect anomalies and plumes that are missing (e.g. pipeline or facility leaks), underreported or overreported (e.g. depleted drilling fields) in the CAMS emissions. The classification method also shows some limitations to detect emission anomalies only due to local satellite retrieval biases linked to albedo and scattering issues.

TI  - Earth Observation-Based Detectability of the Effects of Land Management Programmes to Counter Land Degradation: A Case Study from the Highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ethiopia land degradation through soil erosion is of major concern. Land degradation mainly results from heavy rainfall events and droughts and is associated with a loss of vegetation and a reduction in soil fertility. To counteract land degradation in Ethiopia, initiatives such as the Sustainable Land Management Programme (SLMP) have been implemented. As vegetation condition is a key indicator of land degradation, this study used satellite remote sensing spatiotemporal trend analysis to examine patterns of vegetation between 2002 and 2018 in degraded land areas and studied the associated climate-related and human-induced factors, potentially through interventions of the SLMP. Due to the heterogeneity of the landscapes of the highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau and the small spatial scale at which human-induced changes take place, this study explored the value of using 30 m resolution Landsat data as the basis for time series analysis. The analysis combined Landsat derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data with Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) derived rainfall estimates and used Theil-Sen regression, Mann-Kendall trend test and LandTrendr to detect changes in NDVI, rainfall and rain-use efficiency. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis was used to relate changes in vegetation directly to SLMP infrastructure. The key findings of the study are a general trend shift from browning between 2002 and 2010 to greening between 2011 and 2018 along with an overall greening trend between 2002 and 2018. Significant improvements in vegetation condition due to human interventions were found only at a small scale, mainly on degraded hillside locations, along streams or in areas affected by gully erosion. Visual inspections (based on Google Earth) and OLS regression results provide evidence that these can partly be attributed to SLMP interventions. Even from the use of detailed Landsat time series analysis, this study underlines the challenge and limitations to remotely sensed detection of changes in vegetation condition caused by land management interventions aiming at countering land degradation.

TI  - Development of Novel Classification Algorithms for Detection of Floating Plastic Debris in Coastal Waterbodies Using Multispectral Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic pollution poses a significant environmental threat to the existence and health of biodiversity and the marine ecosystem. The intrusion of plastic to the food chain is a massive concern for human health. Urbanisation, population growth, and tourism have been identified as major contributors to the growing rate of plastic debris, particularly in waterbodies such as rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans. Over the past decade, many studies have focused on identifying the waterbodies near the coastal regions where a high level of accumulated plastics have been found. This research focused on using high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images to detect floating plastic debris in coastal waterbodies. Accurate detection of plastic debris can help in deploying appropriate measures to reduce plastics in oceans. Two unsupervised (K-means and fuzzy c-means (FCM)) and two supervised (support vector regression (SVR) and semi-supervised fuzzy c-means (SFCM)) classification algorithms were developed to identify floating plastics. The unsupervised classification algorithms consider the remote sensing data as the sole input to develop the models, while the supervised classifications require in situ information on the presence/absence of floating plastics in selected Sentinel-2 grids for modelling. Data from Cyprus and Greece were considered to calibrate the supervised models and to estimate model efficiency. Out of available multiple bands of Sentinel-2 data, a combination of 6 bands of reflectance data (blue, green, red, red edge 2, near infrared, and short wave infrared 1) and two indices (NDVI and FDI) were selected to develop the models, as they were found to be most efficient for detecting floating plastics. The SVR-based supervised classification has an accuracy in the range of 96.9-98.4%, while that for SFCM and FCM clustering are between 35.7 and 64.3% and 69.8 and 82.2%, respectively, and for K-means, the range varies from 69.8 to 81.4%. It needs to be noted that the total number of grids with floating plastics in real-world data considered in this study is 59, which needs to be increased considerably to improve model performance. Training data from other parts of the world needs to be collected to investigate the performance of the classification algorithms at a global scale.

TI  - The distribution of Duffy alleles and genotypes in a Western Saudi cohort
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective: The Duffy blood group is clinically significant in transfusion medicine, and is based on the presence of glycoproteins known as Fy antigens on the surface of red blood cells. In Saudi Arabia, serological studies on blood groups, including Fy antigens have been undertaken, however the population distribution of FY alleles and genotypes requires further elucidation. Therefore, we analysed samples from random Western Saudis blood donors to establish the frequency of FY alleles and genotypes in this cohort. Materials and Methods: Touchdown PCR and DNA sequencing was used to analyse the following single nucleotide polymorphisms, c.125G>A, c.1-67T>C and c.256C>T, in 349 random blood donors from Jeddah and Makkah. The c.298G>A polymorphism was used to determine the allele designation of weak FY alleles. Results: Our investigation showed no significant differences between Makkah and Jeddah blood donors, except for the c.125G>A polymorphism, where the A allele was significantly higher in Jeddah donors (odds ratio (OR) = 1.56 (1.09-2.24)). Most donors (39%) had the homozygous FY*02N.01/FY*02N.01 genotype, similar to African populations. Seven individuals had the FY*01N.01/FY*02N.01 genotype. Five had the predicted genotypes of FY*02/FY*02W.01, FY*01/FY*02W.01, FY*01/FY*01W.02 and FY*02W.01/FY*02N.01. The remaining donors had predicted genotypes that expressed Fy antigens on the erythrocyte surface. Conclusion: The molecular genetic background of Western Saudis is similar to African populations, however in terms of allele and genotype frequencies, Western Saudi Arabia contains a unique genetic pool, distinct to other populations.

TI  - Winter drainage of surface lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet play a key role in its surface mass balance, hydrology and biogeochemistry. They often drain rapidly in the summer via hydrofracture, which delivers lake water to the ice sheet base over timescales of hours to days and then can allow melt-water to reach the base for the rest of the summer. Rapid lake drainage, therefore, influences subglacial drainage evolution; water pressures; ice flow; biogeochemical activity; and ultimately the delivery of water, sediments and nutrients to the ocean. It has generally been assumed that rapid lake drainage events are confined to the summer, as this is typically when observations are made using satellite optical imagery. Here we develop a method to quantify backscatter changes in satellite radar imagery, which we use to document the drainage of six different lakes during three winters (2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17) in fast-flowing parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Analysis of optical imagery from before and after the three winters supports the radar-based evidence for winter lake drainage events and also provides estimates of lake drainage volumes, which range between 0.000046 +/- 0.000017 and 0.0200 +/- 0.002817 km(3). For three of the events, optical imagery allows repeat photoclinometry (shape from shading) calculations to be made showing mean vertical collapse of the lake surfaces ranging between 1.21 +/- 1.61 and 7.25 +/- 1.61m and drainage volumes of 0.002 +/- 0.002968 to 0.044 +/- 0.009858 km(3). For one of these three, time-stamped ArcticDEM strips allow for DEM differencing, which demonstrates a mean collapse depth of 2.17 +/- 0.28m across the lake area. The findings show that lake drainage can occur in the winter in the absence of active surface melt and notable ice flow acceleration, which may have important implications for subglacial hydrology and biogeochemical processes.

TI  - Mapping sentinel lymph nodes in cutaneous melanoma: a vast array of perioperative imaging modalities
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a decisive step in the staging process of melanoma, critically impacting patients' oncological outcome and driving the decision-making process. SLNB limits the extent of the dissection in cases where no metastases are found. Conversely, when metastases are detected, SLNB has the potential to improve regional control of the disease when complete lymphadenectomy or early administration of adjuvant treatment are indicated. Thus, accurately identifying sentinel lymph nodes represents an important prognostic factor. Several strategies have been studied, including novel procedures that are not commonly used in the clinical setting. This review highlights the different tracers, preoperative and intraoperative imaging modalities studied to perform SLNB in cutaneous melanoma. The development of innovative modalities has been fueled by a need to optimize current approaches, offering new alternatives that can overcome some of the limitations of the standard method.

TI  - Temperature Tuning Properties of 3.5-μm KTiOAsO<sub>4</sub> Optical Parametric Oscillator
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Lasers operated at 3.5 mu m stretch the absorption peaks in the C-H bonds and exhibit high transparency in the atmosphere windows, making the lasers that generate beams with frequencies of 3.5 mu m useful in applications using spectroscopy, remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and infrared (IR) countermeasures. Optical parametric oscillation (OPO) is an effective method to radiate mid-IR laser beams that can transform near-IR lasers into mid- and far-IR radiation. The KTiOAsO4 (KTA) crystal is a member of the KTiOPO4 (KTP) crystal family and an excellent nonlinear material. The spectroscopy transmittance range of KTA is 0.35-5.30 mu m. The absorption loss in KTA crystals in the 3-5 mu m bandwidth is much lower than that of the KTP crystal. The KTA crystal has a large nonlinear coefficient, a wide-angle and temperature-matching bandwidth, a high damage threshold, and stable physical and chemical properties. Experiments on noncritical phase matching (NCPM) demonstrated that the KTA optical parametric oscillator (OPO) pumped by a Nd:YAG 1064-nm laser can radiate a 3.5-mu m laser beam. Due to the influence of temperature dispersion, the wavelength value of KTA-OPO changes as a function of temperature. The detailed study of KTA-OPO temperature tuning properties presented herein can guide the application of KTA-OPO lasers. To date, there are few theoretical or experimental studies concerning the temperature tuning performance of KTA-OPO.Methods Temperature tuning properties of KTA-OPO are studied theoretically and experimentally. Based on the normal temperature dispersion equation and the temperature dispersion equation of the KTP crystal, the temperature tuning properties of KTA-OPO at different cutting angles (theta) are calculated. The wavelength of idle light (lambda(i)) at T=25 degrees C and the temperature tuning slope (Delta lambda(i)/Delta T) of KTA-OPO at different cutting angles are calculated with an accuracy of 1 degrees when the wavelength of the pump laser is set at 1064 nm. An experimental study using a 3.5-mu m NCPM KTA-OPO laser pumped by a Nd:YAG 1064 nm laser is conducted. The pump source is an SL800 series pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a pulse width of 13 ns, a spot diameter of 8 mm, and a repetition rate of 1 Hz. A small hole is placed behind the laser for dimming, and the spot diameter is compressed to 4 mm using a telescope system to increase the energy density of the pump laser. The temperature of the KTA crystal is controlled in a temperature-controlled furnace with an accuracy of 0.1 degrees C. The wavelengths of the KTA-OPO idlers at 30, 80, 130 and 180 degrees C are measured using an Omni-300 lambda spectrometer (Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd) with an accuracy of 1 nm. At the back end of the grating spectrometer, a DEC-M204-InSb detector and a ZAMP amplifier (Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd) are used to detect and amplified the laser signal at the specified transmission wavelength. A DSOX3054T oscilloscope is used to display and measure the signal amplitude from the ZAMP amplifier. The value of the maximum wavelength of the laser signal is set equal to the peak wavelength of the output idler by the grating spectrometer.Results and Discussions The temperature tuning properties of KTA at different theta angles and the OPO pumped by a 1064-nm laser are studied (Fig. 1). Comparison of the laser wavelength and Delta lambda(i)/Delta T of the idler at different theta angles revealed that the wavelength of the idler increased monotonically as the value of theta increased, while Delta lambda(i)/Delta T decreased monotonically (Fig. 2). When the temperature is 30, 80, 130, and 180 degrees C, the measured values of lambda(i) are 3463, 3466, 3469, and 3474 nm, respectively, and Delta lambda(i)/Delta T is 0.073 nm/degrees C. The experimental results show that the wavelength of the output idler of KTA-OPO (theta=90 degrees and phi=0 degrees) is less affected by changes in temperature under conditions of type II phase matching, which confirms the theoretical conclusions (Fig. 4). The results demonstrate that the temperature dispersion equation (Table 1) can be extended from near-IR to mid-IR band spectroscopy.Conclusions The laser wavelength value of KTA-OPO is relatively stable at different temperatures. In type I and II phase matching, with the increase of theta, the idler wavelength value increased monotonically, but Delta lambda(i)/Delta T decreased monotonically and ranged from to 0.0774 to 1.4968 nm/degrees C. The Delta lambda(i)/Delta T value of the type I phase matching KTA-OPO is generally larger than the Delta lambda(i)/Delta T value of the type II phase match. Among all phase matching points for angle theta, the temperature tuning range is smallest when theta=90 degrees under type II phase matching, and the theoretical value of Delta lambda(i)/Delta T is 0.0774 nm/degrees C. The experimental results are consistent with the theoretical calculations. Both theoretical and experimental studies show that the wavelength of the mid-IR laser beam of the NCPM KTA-OPO is less affected by temperature. This results of this study demonstrate the potential application of KTA-OPO pumped by a 1064-nm laser.

TI  - Development of the Informal Road Network and Its Impact on the Transformation of Taiga Geosystems in the North of Irkutsk Oblast
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the impact of roads on geosystems in territories of new development, where the extraction of hydrocarbons motivates especially intensive improvement of the infrastructure. In this study, we consider motor roads beyond the official network, which have been informally constructed, maintained, or used by various organizations or individuals. We represent types of roads with different forms and regimes of management schematically. As the model area for studying the impact of roads on taiga geosystems, we selected a territory in the north of Irkutsk oblast, in the interfluve of the Kirenga and Khanda rivers; field investigations of the transformation of geosystems were carried out along the informal road from the Vershina Khandy village to the Magistral'nyi settlement. Particular attention was paid to the possible intensification of geomorphological processes as one of the crucial factors for changes in geosystems. A comprehensive analysis of geological, geomorphological, and landscape factors using remote sensing data and field studies made it possible to compile a geomorphological map with identification of dangerous exogenous processes along these roads. Major causes for landscape disturbances were identified, namely degradation and transformation of vegetation cover and changes in the temperature regime of permafrost, which lead to waterlogging and subsidence of soils and, consequently, to the formation of multiple tracks along the roadside and intensified linear erosion.

TI  - Thirty-Year Dynamics of LULC at the Dong Thap Muoi Area, Southern Vietnam, Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to assess the land use and land cover (LULC) changes for thirty years, from 1990-2020, in the Dong Thap Muoi, a flooded land area of the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam using Google Earth Engine and random forest algorithm. The specific purposes are: (1) determine the main LULC classes and (2) compute and analyze the magnitude and rate of changes for these LULC classes. For the above purposes, 128 Landsat images, topographic maps, land use status maps, cadastral maps, and ancillary data were collected and utilized to derive the LULC maps using the random forest classification algorithm. The overall accuracy of the LULC maps for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 are 88.9, 83.5, 87.1, and 85.6%, respectively. The result showed that the unused land was dominant in 1990 with 28.9 % of the total area, but it was primarily converted to the paddy, a new dominant LULC class in 2020 (45.1%). The forest was reduced significantly from 14.4% in 1990 to only 5.5% of the total area in 2020. Whereas at the same time, the built-up increased from 0.3% to 6.2% of the total area. This research may help the authorities design exploitation policies for the Dong Thap Muoi's socio-economic development and develop a new, stable, and sustainable ecosystem, promoting the advantages of the region, early forming a diversified agricultural structure.

TI  - Towards a global Reservoir Assessment Tool for predicting hydrologic impacts and operating patterns of existing and planned reservoirs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dam construction in developing nations is on the rise. Monitoring these dams is essential to understanding downstream hydrologic impacts and for better planning and management of water resources. Satellite observations and advancements in information technology now present a unique opportunity to overcome the traditional limitations of reservoir monitoring. In this study, a global reservoir monitoring framework was developed as an online tool for near real-time monitoring and impact analysis of existing and planned reservoirs based on publicly available and global satellite observations. The framework used a mass balance approach to monitor 1598 reservoirs in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Simulated streamflow of the developed tool was validated in 25 river basins against a multidecadal record of in-situ discharge. The simulated storage change was validated against in-situ data from 77 reservoirs. The framework was able to capture reservoir state realistically for more than 75% of these reservoirs. At most in-situ gaging locations, the reservoir tool was able to capture streamflow with a correlation of more than 0.9 and a normalized root mean square error of 50% or less. The tool can now be used to study existing or planned reservoirs for short and long-term decision making and policy analysis.

TI  - Coseismic Ground Displacement after the M<i><sub>w</sub></i>6.2 Earthquake in NW Croatia Determined from Sentinel-1 and GNSS CORS Data
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - At the very end of the year 2020, on 29 December, a hazardous earthquake of M-w = 6.2 hit the area of Petrinja and its surroundings, in the NW of Croatia. The earthquake was felt across the area of 400 km, leaving an inconceivable damage in the vicinity of the epicenter, devastated towns and ruined lives. In order to map the spreading of earthquake waves and to determine the coseismic ground displacement after the mainshock, we have analyzed open satellite radar images of Sentinel-1 and the GNSS data from the nearest CORS station related to the epicenter, along with the seismic faults. In this paper, we addressed and mapped the displacement linear surface ruptures detected by the SAR interferometry. The results show the vertical ground displacement to the extent of -12 cm in the southern area and up to 22 cm in the north-western part of a wide area struck by the earthquake impact, related to the epicenter. Subsidence and uplift in a range of +/- 5 cm over a wider affected area indicate a spatial extent and hazardous impact made by the earthquake. The ground displacement of 30 cm to the West and 40 cm to the East has been identified considering the intersection of Pokupsko and Petrinja strike-slip fault system in the seismic zone of Pannonian basin. Accordingly, we obtained matching results of 5 cm south-easting shift and -3 cm subsidence on Sisak GNSS CROPOS station, addressing the tectonic blocks movement along the activated complex fault system. The results compared with the geology data confirm the existence of two main faults; the Pokupsko and the Petrinja strike-slip faults and interpret the occurrence of secondary post-seismic events over the observed area.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping for endometrial and cervical cancer in Denmark
T2  - DANISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This was a surgical pilot study to systematically introduce the technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in women with early-stage stage cervical cancer (CC) and endometrial cancer (EC) in Denmark. The study aimed to facilitate structured surgical training to ensure surgeon proficiency in SLN mapping. The study precedes two national prospective studies on the oncological safety and correct patient selection for SLN mapping in CC and EC.METHODS: The study was conducted at four gynaecological cancer centres at Odense and Aarhus University Hospital, Rigshospitalet and Herlev Hospital, between September 2016 and August 2019. All centres went through a protocolled introduction to the surgical technique, pelvic lymphatic drainage, pathological ultra-staging and data entry. A criterion of a total (uni-and bilateral) SLN detection of > 80%, based on 30 SLN mappings was set.RESULTS: The four centres performed 140 (range: 30-46) procedures. The total SLN detection rate was 91.3% with bilateral SLN detection in 68.8% and unilateral SLN detection in 22.5% of cases. The cumulated total SLN detection rate at three centres was above the pre-set 80% criterion from the beginning of inclusion, whereas one centre reached the criterion after 20 procedures.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, all centres demonstrated international-level SLN detection rates within 30 procedures. Hence, all centres met the study criterion regarding surgeon proficiency and were eligible for the national studies.

TI  - Clinical Significance of Tumor Microenvironment in Acral Melanoma: A Large Single-Institution Study of Caucasians
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in many studies is associated with a better prognosis in melanoma patients. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression has a significant value in predicting several cancers, but its role in melanoma remains ambiguous. The study aims to report a comprehensive analysis of TILs characteristics and their impact on survival in primary acral melanoma (AM). Methods: Clinical and pathological features and survival outcomes were investigated in 70 patients with AM. Immunohistochemical quantitative analysis of TILs, including expression of CD4, CD8, FOXP3, PD-1, and PD-L1, on melanoma cells was performed. Results: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in overall survival (OS) for CD4+ (p = 0.021), CD8+ (p = 0.037), FOXP3+ (p = 0.007), and TILs density (p = 0.043). In univariate analysis of immunohistochemical features, FOXP3, CD4, CD8, PD-1, and Melanoma Institute of Australia (MIA) grading TILs (grade, density, and distribution) were correlated with survival. The higher density of FOXP3-positive cells was an independent factor associated with better survival. Conclusions: High TILs content (classed as brisk Clark scale and marked/diffuse TILs MIA grade) regardless of its immunophenotype was associated with better survival outcomes in AM. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells did not influence OS and was independent of clinical and pathological characteristics. We demonstrated that TILs are significant biomarkers in sentinel lymph node status prediction.

TI  - Integrating Gravimetry Data With Thermal Infra-Red Data From Satellites to Improve Efficiency of Operational Irrigation Advisory in South Asia
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid decline of groundwater resources in South Asia due to excessive irrigation during dry season requires awareness of optimal on-field water requirements. Such information is currently provided on farmer cellphones through an operational Irrigation Advisory System (IAS). To minimize the cost of sending such irrigation advisory texts to farmers while maximizing impact of IAS on groundwater sustainability, we integrated Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data with Landsat Thermal Infrared (TIR) Imagery to target regions in greater need of the IAS service. We demonstrated the concept of an improved IAS over eight irrigation districts of the Ganges and Indus basins. The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used to monitor on-field water consumption (evapotranspiration-ET) over cropped areas using Landsat TIR data at plot-scale spatial resolution. Comparison of SEBAL ET with crop water demand from Penman-Monteith (FAO56) technique quantified the extent of overirrigation at the plot scale and provided a tangible pathway to microtarget the IAS service only to farmers with the largest groundwater use footprint, thereby improving the impact of the IAS service further. Our results suggested that an operational IAS that integrates GRACE and Landsat TIR data on average can save about 85% (80 million m(3)) of groundwater per dry season for irrigation districts of Northern India and 87% (or 150 million m(3)) per year for irrigation districts of Eastern Pakistan.

TI  - The Importance of Geotechnical Evaluation and Shoreline Evolution in Coastal Vulnerability Index Calculations
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this specific study is to present a new weighted Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVIWF), with an emphasis given to the geotechnical evaluation and shoreline evolution rate measured through high-resolution remote sensing, which seem to be the most interfering variables in CVI calculations. As a pilot area for the application of the new CVIWF, the Gulf of Patras in Western Greece was selected, which is suffering erosion problems due to climate change, the sea level rising and human intervention. The new CVIWF, which was applied in this research, includes the following innovations: (1) the use of geotechnical characterization instead of geological-geomorphological characterization, (2) the use of high-resolution remote sensing data for the detection of shoreline evolution rate and (3) the insertion of a specific weighted geotechnical factor in the CVIWF formula. The results from the application of the unweighted CVI show that percentages of 20.13%, 20.47%, 24.56%, 29.39% and 5.45% of the gulf's shoreline are under the regime of very low, low, moderate, high and very high vulnerability, respectively. On the other hand, the corresponding results from the application of the weighted CVIWF show a percentage of 14.59%, 25.91%, 20.04, 36.48% and 2.98, respectively.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-1 Interferometry and GNSS Networks for Derivation of 3-D Surface Changes
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new procedure and program system to integrate Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network observations to estimate 3-D surface changes caused by environmental processes. The procedure is based on the integrated geodetic/geodynamic benchmarks, which are equipped with both ascending (ASC) and descending (DSC) corner reflectors. The results of sparse GNSS observations are interpolated using the ASC and DSC line-of-sight changes provided by the Sentinel-1 mission every six days. The data integration is carried out using a Kalman filter where north, east, and up (vertical) coordinates and their instantaneous velocities are estimated and updated by the GNSS-derived data. The north components are essentially provided by the GNSS observations alone. The procedure was developed and successfully tested on landslide areas in Hungary.

TI  - Volumetric Quantification of Flash Flood Using Microwave Data on a Watershed Scale in Arid Environments, Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual flood mapping and quantification in an area provide valuable information for the stakeholder to prevent future losses. This study presents the actual flash flood quantification in Al-Lith Watershed, Saudi Arabia. The study is divided into two steps: first is actual flood mapping using remote sensing data, and the second is the flood volume calculation. Two Sentinel-1 images are processed to map the actual flood, i.e., image from 25 May 2018 (dry condition), and 24 November 2018 (peak flood condition). SNAP software is used for the flood mapping step. During SNAP processing, selecting the backscatter data representing the actual flood in an arid region is challenging. The dB range value from 7.23-14.22 is believed to represent the flood. In GIS software, the flood map result is converted into polygon to define the flood boundary. The flood boundary that is overlaid with Digital Elevation Map (DEM) is filled with the same elevation value. The Focal Statistics neighborhood method with three iterations is used to generate the flood surface elevation inside the flood boundary. The raster contains depth information is derived by subtraction of the flood surface elevation with DEM. Several steps are carried out to minimize the overcalculation outside the flood boundary. The flood volume can be derived by the multiplication of flood depth points with each cell size area. The flash flood volume in Al-Lith Watershed on 24 November 2018 is 155,507,439 m(3). Validity checks are performed by comparing it with other studies, and the result shows that the number is reliable.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Data for Precision Agriculture?-A UAV-Based Assessment
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - An approach of exploiting and assessing the potential of Sentinel-2 data in the context of precision agriculture by using data from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented based on a four-year dataset. An established model for the estimation of the green area index (GAI) of winter wheat from a UAV-based multispectral camera was used to calibrate the Sentinel-2 data. Large independent datasets were used for evaluation purposes. Furthermore, the potential of the satellite-based GAI-predictions for crop monitoring and yield prediction was tested. Therefore, the total absorbed photosynthetic radiation between spring and harvest was calculated with satellite and UAV data and correlated with the final grain yield. Yield maps at the same resolution were generated by combining yield data on a plot level with a UAV-based crop coverage map. The best tested model for satellite-based GAI-prediction was obtained by combining the near-, infrared- and Red Edge-waveband in a simple ratio (R-2 = 0.82, mean absolute error = 0.52 m(2)/m(2)). Yet, the Sentinel-2 data seem to depict average GAI-developments through the seasons, rather than to map site-specific variations at single acquisition dates. The results show that the lower information content of the satellite-based crop monitoring might be mainly traced back to its coarser Red Edge-band. Additionally, date-specific effects within the Sentinel-2 data were detected. Due to cloud coverage, the temporal resolution was found to be unsatisfactory as well. These results emphasize the need for further research on the applicability of the Sentinel-2 data and a cautious use in the context of precision agriculture.

TI  - The Concept Besovstvo at the Time and Space Level in Fyodor Dostoevsky's <i>The Devils</i>. Article 1
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article focuses on the representation of the core concept besovstvo at the level of space and time in Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Devils. In the work, the method of conceptological analysis of the literary text is used, whereby it was identified that the core plot- and sensemaking concept of the novel - besovstvo - is represented at the level of space and time. The features of the concept besovstvo elicited through the general review of the novel, which show themselves in spatial and temporal details of the novel's worldview, can be divided into three types: describing the characters' model of time (the end of time, extinction), the space (chaos), and the type of motion in space (spin, breakdown). The first article considers three of the five mentioned features: the end of time, extinction, and chaos. The feature of the end of time appears within the narration time in the dialogues of characters via clashes of their understandings of nature and the meaning of time as an existential substance. Different attitudes to the sacred idea of the end of time were identified in the devils-destructionists; the possessed; Dasha, aware of the approaching of the devastating end; and Stavrogin, still passionately seeking the truth, but having lost the ability to believe. The time of the devil characters is linear. The possessed characters perceive it through the distortion of the Orthodox values. Stavrogin's world perception is described by the position out of space and time, caused by his disbelief of the "moribund truths" of the fathers and the fruitlessness of the search for the new ideal, which generated the loss of the force and meaning of life. Introducing the feature of extinction that combines the spatial and temporal meanings, Dostoevsky points to the inevitability of the tragic outcome, as long as the linear time of the destructionists leads to the annihilation of life and at the same time designates the causes of what is happening, raises the question of the misfortune and blame of the young generation and the society as a whole. The significant role in the novel's worldview belongs to the feature of chaos, mainly represented in the words of the chronicler, describing the characters' motion in space. Via the feature of chaos, Dostoevsky reveals the scale of the consequences of the moral statute destruction and the besovstvo propagation mechanisms determined by the loss of traditional values and search for the new orienting points, which turn out to be false. The other aspect of the feature is connected with the fact that it is allusive to Pushkin's epigraph, in which the devils' sabbath serves as one of the symbolic features of the space of national existence, generating the contradictions of the national consciousness. The elicited features reveal metaphysical aspects of the author's understanding of the nature of besovstvo and its wide distribution. The study of the characters' temporal conceptualization and spatial features of their deeds clarifies their images revealed by research.

TI  - The saga of lymph node surgery in malignant melanoma: a history repeating itself in gynecologic oncology
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In view of the high morbidity to complete lymphadenectomy, the sentinel node procedure is currently being investigated in different cancers with the aim of reducing morbidity and of achieving oncological outcomes similar to complete lymphadenectomy. In this review, a parallel will be drawn between the evolutions of the place of lymph node surgery in the management of melanoma and gynecologic cancers. Currently, in the case of cutaneous melanoma, the indications of lymph node surgery are becoming increasingly rare. In contrast with the scarce available evidence in gynecologic cancer, this trend is supported by multicenter randomized studies with a large number of patients for cutaneous melanoma. The second difference is the demonstrated therapeutic benefit of immunotherapies and targeted therapies in cutaneous melanoma, which are less significant in gynecological cancers for which the mainstay of treatment is surgery. According to this review, it seems that in gynecologic oncology, we could in the next decades follow the same pathway currently taken in the management of lymph nodes in malignant melanoma.

TI  - Sacrifices to the Spirit Master of Water in the Religious and Mythological System of the Khakass (Late 19th- Mid-20th Centuries)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the work is to characterize the rite of sacrifice to the spirit master of water - sug eezi - in the traditional Khakass culture. The sources of the research are folklore and ethnographic materials, a significant part of which is introduced into academic discourse. Folklore works are epics and myths published in the Khakass language. Excerpts from some of them were first translated into Russian by the author. The chronological framework of the study covers the late 19th - mid-20th centuries, which is determined by the state and possibilities of the sources on the research topic. The study follows the principle of historicism, when any cultural phenomenon is considered in the development and with due account of the specific situation, and employs historical and ethnographic methods of relict and semantic analysis. The Khakass ritual associated with the worship of sug eezi is reconstructed and analyzed. It is proved that the water element and its specific personification - the water master - played one of the key roles in the Khakass culture. This realia was determined by the natural landscape of Khakassia itself: its territory is covered with a variety of water sources streams, rivers, lakes, etc. Everyday life, household and economic activities of the Khakass were closely associated with them. Moreover, in the traditional Khakass consciousness, the connection between a person and designated natural objects is not limited only to rational interaction. The Khakass deeply believed in the enormous mystical possibilities and powers of this natural genius. In this connection, they strove to establish harmonious relationships with sug eezi. Periodic disruptions of this interaction were believed to lead to an imbalance in the nature and in people's life. For the latter, this turned into various disasters and misfortunes. The ritual practice of the traditional society in this situation was aimed at restoring the disturbed balance and, as a result, resolving the emerging contradictions between the worlds and protecting the vital interests of people. A huge role in this process was assigned to the rites of sacrifice to the spirit master of water. They had various forms: from the simplest individual to complex collective ritual actions - sug taiyg.

TI  - On the Breaking of the Milankovitch Cycles Triggered by Temperature Increase: The Stochastic Resonance Response
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent decades have registered the hottest temperature variation in instrumentally recorded data history. The registered temperature rise is particularly significant in the so-called hot spot or sentinel regions, characterized by higher temperature increases in respect to the planet average value and by more marked connected effects. In this framework, in the present work, following the climate stochastic resonance model, the effects, due to a temperature increase independently from a specific trend, connected to the 10(5) year Milankovitch cycle were tested. As a result, a breaking scenario induced by global warming is forecasted. More specifically, a wavelet analysis, innovatively performed with different sampling times, allowed us, besides to fully characterize the cycles periodicities, to quantitatively determine the stochastic resonance conditions by optimizing the noise level. Starting from these system resonance conditions, numerical simulations for increasing planet temperatures have been performed. The obtained results show that an increase of the Earth temperature boosts a transition towards a chaotic regime where the Milankovitch cycle effects disappear. These results put into evidence the so-called threshold effect, namely the fact that also a small temperature increase can give rise to great effects above a given threshold, furnish a perspective point of view of a possible future climate scenario, and provide an account of the ongoing registered intensity increase of extreme meteorological events.

TI  - Assessment of Vineyard Canopy Characteristics from Vigour Maps Obtained Using UAV and Satellite Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy characterisation is a key factor for the success and efficiency of the pesticide application process in vineyards. Canopy measurements to determine the optimal volume rate are currently conducted manually, which is time-consuming and limits the adoption of precise methods for volume rate selection. Therefore, automated methods for canopy characterisation must be established using a rapid and reliable technology capable of providing precise information about crop structure. This research providedregression models for obtaining canopy characteristics of vineyards from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite images collected in three significant growth stages. Between 2018 and 2019, a total of 1400 vines were characterised manually and remotely using a UAV and a satellite-based technology. The information collected from the sampled vines was analysed by two different procedures. First, a linear relationship between the manual and remote sensing data was investigated considering every single vine as a data point. Second, the vines were clustered based on three vigour levels in the parcel, and regression models were fitted to the average values of the ground-based and remote sensing-estimated canopy parameters. Remote sensing could detect the changes in canopy characteristics associated with vegetation growth. The combination of normalised differential vegetation index (NDVI) and projected area extracted from the UAV images is correlated with the tree row volume (TRV) when raw point data were used. This relationship was improved and extended to canopy height, width, leaf wall area, and TRV when the data were clustered. Similarly, satellite-based NDVI yielded moderate coefficients of determination for canopy width with raw point data, and for canopy width, height, and TRV when the vines were clustered according to the vigour. The proposed approach should facilitate the estimation of canopy characteristics in each area of a field using a cost-effective, simple, and reliable technology, allowing variable rate application in vineyards.

TI  - 50 Shades of Green: Insights into Personal Values and Worldviews as Drivers of Green Purchasing Intention, Behaviour, and Experience
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the booming interest in determinants of green (i.e., sustainable) consumption, the psychological factors that influence pro-environmental consumption patterns are not yet fully understood. To answer this call, we developed and analysed a model that offers an integrative approach to sustainable consumption patterns by addressing the full palette of consumers' personal value orientations. Specifically, we linked consumers' egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric values at the personal level to pro-environmental purchasing intentions, behaviours, and experiences. Furthermore, we examined whether implicit beliefs about the balance between humanity and nature (i.e., worldviews) moderate these relationships. To support the theoretical propositions in our model, we drew on the key premises of the theory of planned behaviour. Data from 291 Polish respondents were analysed by using multiple linear regression analysis, and the moderating effect of worldviews was investigated with simple slope analysis. While controlling for cultural values, the findings show that personal values, specifically biospheric values, predict sustainable consumer patterns and that consumers' worldview moderates this relationship. Our study offers a novel holistic approach to analyse sustainable consumption patterns, which will assist environmental management scholars and practitioners who seek to understand and stimulate pro-environmental consumer behaviour. Our findings may help practitioners to develop strategies to influence consumer intentions and behaviours concerning green products.

TI  - Capturing dissolved organic carbon dynamics with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in tidally influenced wetland-estuarine systems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine and coastal wetlands are among the most productive, ecologically valuable, and economically important ecosystems on Earth. Through tidal inundation and lateral export, estuarine marshes exert a strong influence on the amount and quality of carbon and nutrients exchanged between the land and the ocean. Yet, current understanding of the role of these "blue carbon" ecosystems on estuarine optics, biogeochemistry, and ecology is largely based on limited field observations at point locations, due to the coarse resolution of existing and heritage satellite ocean color sensors. Here, for the first time, we merged high resolution data from the constellation of Landsat-8/ Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A/B MultiSpectral Instruments (MSI) to examine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in a tidally influenced marsh-estuarine system. Often referred to as the "Everglades of the North", the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is the largest marsh system in the Chesapeake Bay and one of the most ecologically important areas in the United States. A multiple linear regression approach linking DOC to the spectral shape of water remote sensing reflectance was used to capture marsh DOC export and examine spatial features and temporal changes in DOC over a broad range of conditions (DOC in the range of 2.32-19.9 mg/L), across multiple years, different seasons, and tidal regimes, with a relative error (mean average percent difference) of 23%. Data consistency between satellite sensors was evaluated, followed by the generation of a long term, multi-sensor DOC data record that provided more frequent observations. Combining data from the three satellites revealed the strong impact of marsh outwelling at the larger ecosystem scale, its seasonal variability, and the importance of other environmental factors, including wind conditions, river discharge, and extreme weather events, in shaping DOC dynamics along complex, tidally influenced terrestrial-aquatic interfaces.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Of social movements, human rights and electricity access: Exploring an indigenous civil resistance in Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Alongside Sustainable Development Goal 7 and related policies, another potential strategy for enhancing access to energy services that are reliable, high quality, affordable, sufficient, sustainable and modern consists in theorizing and establishing "energy rights". In critical dialogue with other attempts to theorize and implement a right to energy, we propose that it is possible to theorize a human right to electricity access from the perspective of social groups, experiences, and worldviews from the Global South. To support this claim, we present the case study of Luz y Fuerza del Pueblo, a social movement operating in the state of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico. We show that this organization's understanding of and approach to electricity depends on the convergence of Mayan cosmovisiones (worldviews) and Christian views mediated by Liberation Theology. Members conceive electricity as both a part of the whole and a fundamental entitlement that should not become marketable or be linked to capital accumulation. Moreover, the movement presents a non-hierarchical structure, has a strong commitment to territory control, an anti-capitalist attitude, a keen focus on cooperation, and implements "politics of place". We argue that both the worldview and the type of socio-political arrangement of Luz y Fuerza del Pueblo as well as the lived experience of its members suggest the possibility of theorizing a specific right to electricity access. Overall, our findings and proposal can benefit energy scholars and practitioners who are interested in exploring, defining, implementing and enforcing a specific right to electricity in more pluralistic and inclusive ways.

TI  - Urban Land Mapping Based on Remote Sensing Time Series in the Google Earth Engine Platform: A Case Study of the Teresina-Timon Conurbation Area in Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Teresina-Timon conurbation (TTC) area is an example of urban agglomeration, situated in the semiarid environment of the northeast region of Brazil, which has shown an accelerated process of urban development over the last four decades (1985-2019). In this study, we developed a semi-automatic urban land mapping framework at the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to (a) evaluate spatiotemporal sprawl of the TTC area (1985-2018); and (b) quantify current urban fabric structures of TTC area (2019). The main empirical results demonstrate that the use of the Landsat historical dataset is a suitable option for generating consistent urban land maps across the years in semiarid environments. Teresina and Timon expanded, respectively, from 70.34 km(2) and 12.20 km(2) in 1985 to 159.02 km(2) and 30.68 km(2) in 2018, increasing annually at 3.05% and 3.69% averaged rate, showing an underlying tendency of continuous growth, and magnitude similar to Asian cities. The results of the urban fabric (UF) structures mapping demonstrates a high complexity of the urbanized surfaces, characterized by irregular shapes and variability of urban coverage. In 2019, the TTC metropolitan area was covered by urban land use classes as ceramic roofs, other types of roofs, and impervious surface, in the proportions of 28.02%, 11.97%, and 5.67%, respectively.

TI  - From Standard Weather Stations to Virtual Micro-Meteorological Towers in Ungauged Sites: Modeling Tool for Surface Energy Fluxes, Evapotranspiration, Soil Temperature, and Soil Moisture Estimations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the benefits of training a process-based, land surface model is the capacity to use it in ungauged sites as a complement to standard weather stations for predicting energy fluxes, evapotranspiration, and surface and root-zone soil temperature and moisture. In this study, dynamic (i.e., time-evolving) vegetation parameters were derived from remotely sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and coupled with a physics-based land surface model (tin-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS)) at four eddy covariance (EC) sites in south-central U.S. to test the predictability of micro-meteorological, soil-related, and energy flux-related variables. One cropland and one grassland EC site in northern Oklahoma, USA, were used to tune the model with respect to energy fluxes, soil temperature, and moisture. Calibrated model parameters, mostly related to the soil, were then transferred to two other EC sites in Oklahoma with similar soil and vegetation types. New dynamic vegetation parameter time series were updated according to MODIS imagery at each site. Overall, the tRIBS model captured both seasonal and diurnal cycles of the energy partitioning and soil temperatures across all four stations, as indicated by the model assessment metrics, although large uncertainties appeared in the prediction of ground heat flux, surface, and root-zone soil moisture at some stations. The transferability of previously calibrated model parameters and the use of MODIS to derive dynamic vegetation parameters enabled rapid yet reasonable predictions. The model was proven to be a convenient complement to standard weather stations particularly for sites where eddy covariance or similar equipment is not available.

TI  - Presenting a Semi-Automatic, Statistically-Based Approach to Assess the Sharpness Level of Optical Images from Natural Targets via the Edge Method. Case Study: The Landsat 8 OLI-L1T Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing reliable methodologies of data quality assessment is of paramount importance for maximizing the exploitation of Earth observation (EO) products. Among the different factors influencing EO optical image quality, sharpness has a relevant role. When implementing on-orbit approaches of sharpness assessment, such as the edge method, a crucial step that strongly affects the final results is the selection of suitable edges to use for the analysis. Within this context, this paper aims at proposing a semi-automatic, statistically-based edge method (SaSbEM) that exploits edges extracted from natural targets easily and largely available on Earth: agricultural fields. For each image that is analyzed, SaSbEM detects numerous suitable edges (e.g., dozens-hundreds) characterized by specific geometrical and statistical criteria. This guarantees the repeatability and reliability of the analysis. Then, it implements a standard edge method to assess the sharpness level of each edge. Finally, it performs a statistical analysis of the results to have a robust characterization of the image sharpness level and its uncertainty. The method was validated by using Landsat 8 L1T products. Results proved that: SaSbEM is capable of performing a reliable and repeatable sharpness assessment; Landsat 8 L1T data are characterized by very good sharpness performance.

TI  - Landscape fragmentation in a buffer zone and the Nascentes das Geraizeiras Sustainable Development Reserve, Minas Gerais
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of pastures and cropping fields was responsible for most deforestation in Northern Minas Gerais state. In this study, we assessed the dynamics of land use and cover that occurred in recent decades (1986 to 2015) in the Sustainable Development Reserve Nascentes das Geraizeiras (SDR-NG) and a 10 km buffer zone in the state of Minas Gerais. The effects of deforestation on native vegetation fragmentation were also evaluated using remotely sensed data and landscape analysis. This study indicates that deforestation affected more than half of the native vegetation by 2015, which affected the integrity of native vegetation fragments in the entire study area. The SDR-NG contributed to mitigating the fragmentation of natural vegetation that occurred around that Reserve because of a secondary regrowth observed in some previously degraded areas. It was observed that the most significant environmental threat to that Reserve is fire events, which vary annually in extent and socio-environmental damages. The land sustained use in the SDR-NG could be improved by expanding sustainable economic activities, such as using non-timber forest products, the implementation of agroforestry systems, and other economic activities moderately. These practices will ensure the maintenance of natural resources, economic production, increase income and labor opportunities to local communities, and include all social segments and populations living within and around that Reserve.

TI  - Hyperspectral Empirical Absolute Calibration Model Using Libya 4 Pseudo Invariant Calibration Site
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to find an empirical hyperspectral absolute calibration model using Libya 4 pseudo invariant calibration site (PICS). The approach involves using the Landsat 8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) as the reference radiometer and using Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion, with a spectral resolution of 10 nm as a hyperspectral source. This model utilizes data from a region of interest (ROI) in an "optimal region" of 3% temporal, spatial, and spectral stability within the Libya 4 PICS. It uses an improved, simple, empirical, hyperspectral Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution function (BRDF) model accounting for four angles: solar zenith and azimuth, and view zenith and azimuth angles. This model can perform absolute calibration in 1 nm spectral resolution by predicting TOA reflectance in all existing spectral bands of the sensors. The resultant model was validated with image data acquired from satellite sensors such as Landsat 7, Sentinel 2A, and Sentinel 2B, Terra MODIS, Aqua MODIS, from their launch date to 2020. These satellite sensors differ in terms of the width of their spectral bandpass, overpass time, off-nadir viewing capabilities, spatial resolution, and temporal revisit time, etc. The result demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model has an accuracy of the order of 3% with a precision of about 3% for the nadir viewing sensors (with view zenith angle up to 5 degrees) used in the study. For the off-nadir viewing satellites with view zenith angle up to 20 degrees, it can have an estimated accuracy of 6% and precision of 4%.

TI  - Direct radiative forcing of biomass burning aerosols from the extensive Australian wildfires in 2019-2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2019, an unusually strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole spawned hot and dry weather in southeastern Australia, which promoted devastating wildfires in the period from September 2019 to February 2020. The fires produced large plumes of biomass burning aerosols that prevented sunlight from reaching the Earth's surface, and in this way elicited regional radiative cooling. We estimated the direct aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) resulting from these wildfires, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer space-based data and an empirical relationship from AErosol RObotic NETwork ground-based data collected in biomass-burning regions. The wildfire-derived air pollution was associated with an aerosol optical thickness of >0.3 in Victoria and a strongly negative ARF of between -14.8 and -17.7 W m(-2), which decreased the surface air temperature by about 3.7 degrees C-4.4 degrees C. This is of the same order of magnitude as the radiative cooling from volcanic eruptions. Although the atmospheric lifetime of biomass-burning aerosols is relatively short (about a week), the Australian wildfire pollution plumes extended across the Pacific Ocean to South America. Since climate change is expected to lead to more frequent and increasingly intense fires in many regions worldwide, the consequent biomass burning aerosols may become a significant radiative forcing factor, which will need to be accounted for in climate model projections for the future.

TI  - Exploring diurnal cycles of surface urban heat island intensity in Boston with land surface temperature data derived from GOES-R geostationary satellites
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface urban heat island (SUHI) is one of the most significant human-induced alterations to the Earth's surface climate and can aggravate health risks for city dwellers during heat waves. Although the SUHI effect has received growing attention, its diurnal cycles (i.e., the variations over the full 24 h within the did cycle) are poorly understood because polar-orbiting satellites (e.g., Landsat Series, Sentinel, Terra, Aqua) only provide one or two observations over each repeat cycle (e.g., 16 days) with constant overpass time for the same area. Geostationary satellites provide high-frequency land surface temperature (LST) observations throughout the day and the night, and thereby offer unprecedented opportunities for exploring the diurnal cycles of SUHL Here we examined how the SUHI intensity varied over the course of the diurnal cycle in the Boston Metropolitan Area using LST observations from the NOAA's latest generation of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-R). GOES-R LST was strongly correlated with MODIS LST (R-2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001) across urban core, suburban, and rural areas. We calculated the SUHI intensiy at an hourly time step for both the urban core and suburban areas using GOES-R LST data. The maximum SUER intensity for the urban core occurred near noon, and was +3.0 degrees C (12:00), +5.4 degrees C (12:00), +4.9 degrees C (11:00), and +3.7 degrees C (12:00) in winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. The maximum intensity for the suburban area was about 3.0 degrees C lower in spring and summer and 2.0 degrees C lower in autumn and winter than that of the urban-core area. The minimum SUHI intensity occurred at nighttime, and ranged from -1.0 degrees C to +1.0 degrees C. The difference in the nighttime SUHI intensity between urban core and suburban area was insignificant for all seasons except the summer. The SUHI intensity showed similar diurnal variations across the seasons. Throughout the year, the maximum SUHI intensity (+2.7-+ 5.8 degrees C) at the urban core occurred at 11:00-14:00 (local Lime), while the minimum SUHI intensity (0.6-+0.9 degrees C) was commonly observed at 00:00-07:00 and 17:00-23:00. We also found different relationships between SUHI intensity and potential drivers within a diurnal cycle, characterized by the strongest correlation with impervious surface area and population size during the middle of the day, and with tree canopy cover at night. Our research highlights the great potential of the new-generation geostationary satellites in revealing the detailed diurnal variations of SUHI. Our findings have implications for informing urban planning and public health risk management. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Time Evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wastewater during the First Pandemic Wave of COVID-19 in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, Spain
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two large wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), covering around 2.7 million inhabitants, which represents around 85% of the metropolitan area of Barcelona, were sampled before, during, and after the implementation of a complete lockdown. Five one-step reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope (E), and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41 days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology (WBE) to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures, and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic, and undiagnosed cases. For the latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0 to 6.5% was figured. On the other hand, proportions of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population were determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs. At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers. Sewer monitoring allowed for location of specific hot spots of COVID-19, enabling the rapid adoption of appropriate mitigation measures.IMPORTANCE Water-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable early warning tool for tracking the circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among the population, including not only symptomatic patients but also asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and misdiagnosed carriers, which represent a high proportion of the infected population. In the specific case of Barcelona, wastewater surveillance anticipated by several weeks not only the original COVID-19 pandemic wave but also the onset of the second wave. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in wastewater evidenced the efficacy of the adopted lockdown measures on the circulation of the virus. Health authorities profited from WBE to complement other inputs and adopt rapid and adequate measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. For example, sentinel surveillance of specific sewers helped to locate COVID-19 hot spots and to conduct massive numbers of RT-PCR tests among the population.

TI  - New HIV Infection Estimation from Program Data of Key Populations
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, HIV sentinel surveillance is carried out to estimate the prevalence of HIV for calibrating the response. However, estimate of new HIV infections is also needed to monitor the effectiveness of prevention strategies. We used Targeted Intervention Program data of Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) and Female Sex Workers (FSWs) enrolled in Targeted Intervention (TI) programme in Aizawl district of Mizoram state to estimate the trend in new HIV infection rate. Those who had tested HIV positive in a particular year but were negative in the previous HIV test were considered to be newly infected. New HIV infections were found to have a rising trend from 2010 to 2019 (p<0.01). The new infection rate of HIV was 6.73% among IDUs and 1.94% among FSWs in 2019. This analysis, which requires minimal resources, may be undertaken at regular interval in all Targeted Intervention Programs to monitor the effect of preventive strategies at local level.

TI  - Investigating land subsidence and its causes along Beijing high-speed railway using multi-platform InSAR and a maximum entropy model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing-Tianjin High Speed Railway is the first high-speed railway in China. The Beijing section of it runs through areas affected by subsidence which threaten its safe operation. This study develops a new time series fusion method based on the minimum gradient difference of a fitting curve to produce time series subsidence along this section. Through blending Envisat ASAR and TerrSAR-X time series, the InSAR-derived subsidence and its spatial-temporal development was analyzed along the railway. The relationship between subsidence and its causes was then explored using a maximum entropy model. The study reveals that: (1) The subsidence dynamics identified using the new fusion method agrees with the ground deformation measurements; (2) The sections of most severe subsidence occur between kilometer point KP 11 and KP 21; and (3) The main hydrogeological factors affecting subsidence are the compressible deposit thickness and the groundwater level in the second confined aquifer. The new fusion method proposed improves the accuracy and reliability of subsidence time series. It extends the time span of subsidence monitoring. The approach is mainly applicable to areas with significant vertical deformation, and is particularly suitable for integrating multi-platform data with overlapping in time or with a short time gap.

TI  - Inconsistency among Landsat Sensors in Land Surface Mapping: A Comprehensive Investigation Based on Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive investigations on the between-sensor comparability among Landsat sensors have been relatively limited compared with the increasing use of multi-temporal Landsat records in time series analyses. More seriously, the sensor-related difference has not always been considered in applications. Accordingly, comparisons were conducted among all Landsat sensors available currently, including Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mappers (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mappers (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI)) in land cover mapping, based on a collection of synthesized, multispectral data. Compared to TM, OLI showed obvious between-sensor differences in channel reflectance, especially over the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) channels, and presented positive bias in vegetation spectral indices. OLI did not always outperform TM and ETM+ in classification, which related to the methods used. Furthermore, the channels over SWIR of TM and its successors contributed largely to enhancement of inter-class separability and to improvement of classification. Currently, the inclusion of MSS data is confronted with significant challenges regarding the consistency of surface mapping. Considering the inconsistency among the Landsat sensors, it is applicable to generate a consistent time series of spectral indices through proper transformation models. Meanwhile, it suggests the generation of specific class(es) based on interest instead of including all classes simultaneously.

TI  - Detection of the Minute Variations of Total Suspended Matter in Strong Tidal Waters Based on GaoFen-4 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hangzhou Bay (HZB) is the largest macro-tidal bay in China, where suspended sediment concentrations are significantly modulated by tidal oscillations. This makes it an ideal area for the study of the impact of tide on temporal-spatial variation in suspended sediment. The GaoFen-4 (GF-4) satellite is the first high-resolution geosynchronous orbiting satellite of China. It exhibits the unique advantages of capturing minute variations and finer details of total suspended matter (TSM) due to the enhancement in spatial resolution (50 m) and observation time interval (20 s). In this study, TSM concentration of the HZB was retrieved based on the GF-4 satellite. The spatial distribution and minute variations of TSM concentration under the ebb tide from 7:30 to 7:40 a.m. on 28 August 2017, were analyzed. The results showed that the average TSM concentration inside HZB was (371.8 +/- 1.8) mg/L. There was a linearly increasing trend of TSM concentration at ebb tide, with an increment of (3.96 +/- 0.31) (mg/L)/min, and a more significant increase was observed in the high TSM areas. This increase in TSM concentration was associated with both the bottom topography and tide processes. The tidal potential energy generated by the tidal range and the strong shear stress generated by the high current velocity both led to the re-suspension of the sedimentary particles, which affected the variation of TSM concentration. In addition, the influence of bottom topography changed the intensity of re-suspension and also affected the distribution of TSM concentration in HZB.

TI  - Polarimetric SAR Speckle Filtering Based on Similarity Test and Adaptive Clustering
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Speckle filtering of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data is a necessary preprocessing step for many subsequent applications. The performances of speckle reduction and details preservation are primarily determined by the scheme of similar pixel selection. This letter mainly contributes to establish a novel approach for adaptive and efficient selection of similar pixels. The core idea is to introduce the clustering concept to collect similar samples during the similarity test of polarimetric matrices which is functioned to be a distance measure. Adaptive clustering based on fast finding of density peaks of the data elements is adapted and an automatic determination strategy of cluster numbers is developed. Then the proposed speckle filter is established based on the distance measure and the adaptive clustering. Both unmanned aerial vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) and Radarsat-2 data sets are used for experimental studies. The demonstrations of similar pixel selection for several typical scattering patterns are carried out. The similar samples have been adaptively and precisely identified by the proposed scheme. Furthermore, the comparisons of speckle filtering performances with several advanced speckle filters clearly demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature from GOES-East and GOES-West
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important climate parameter that controls the surface energy budget. For climate applications, information is needed at the global scale with representation of the diurnal cycle. To achieve global coverage there is a need to merge about five independent geostationary (GEO) satellites that have different observing capabilities. An issue of practical importance is the merging of independent satellite observations in areas of overlap. An optimal approach in such areas could eliminate the need for redundant computations by differently viewing satellites. We use a previously developed approach to derive information on LST from GOES-East (GOES-E), modify it for application to GOES-West (GOES-W) and implement it simultaneously across areas of overlap at 5-km spatial resolution. We evaluate the GOES-based LST against in situ observations and an independent MODIS product for the period of 2004-09. The methodology proposed minimizes differences between satellites in areas of overlap. The mean and median values of the differences in monthly mean LST retrieved from GOES-E and GOES-W at 0600 UTC for July are 0.01 and 0.11 K, respectively. Similarly, at 1800 UTC the respective mean and median value of the differences were 0.15 and 1.33 K. These findings can provide guidelines for potential users to decide whether the reported accuracy based on one satellite alone, meets their needs in area of overlap. Since the 6 yr record of LST was produced at hourly time scale, the data are well suited to address scientific issues that require the representation of LST diurnal cycle or the diurnal temperature range (DTR).

TI  - Vicarious Calibration of FengYun-3D MERSI-II at Railroad Valley Playa Site: A Case for Sensors with Large View Angles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vicarious calibration, as one on-orbit calibration method, is a supplement to onboard calibration of sensors. The application of vicarious calibration, however, is greatly limited due to the time- and effort-consuming field measurements of atmosphere and surface. Fortunately, the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) provides automated in situ data at multiple sites, thus increasing the opportunities to achieve ongoing ground-reference calibration of in-orbit instruments. The MEdium Resolution Spectrum Imager-II (MERSI-II) onboard FengYun-3D (FY) has the temporal, spectral, spatial, and radiometric capacity for image capture at a level on par with other sensors used worldwide, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Its on-orbit radiometric performance, however, is assessed in a limited manner. In this study, the reflectance-based vicarious calibration method was employed to calibrate the MERSI-II sensor using ground measurements from RadCalNet at the Railroad Valley Playa site. The calibration of the MERSI-II sensor with large view angles presents difficulties due to the uncertainties introduced by surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects. Thus, we performed BRDF correction to harmonize the sensor and ground measurements to consistent observation geometries, before the in-situ measurements were taken as inputs for the 6SV radiative transfer model to predict at-sensor radiance. The calibration results were comprehensively validated with ground data and MODIS benchmark datasets. The results show that accounting for BRDF correction could improve the accuracy of vicarious calibration and ensure inter-consistency between different sensors. An analysis of the vicarious calibration of FY-3D MERSI-II yielded uncertainties of <5% for solar reflective bands, which meets the radiometric accuracy requirements typical for land-monitoring space missions. The proposed approach is also applicable to the calibration of other large footprint sensors.

TI  - A Novel Tensor Network for Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclone (TC) intensity estimation is an important task in meteorological research. Meanwhile, TC intensity estimation performance can be improved by developing advanced machine learning techniques using the newly emerged high-quality multispectral images (MSIs) acquired by FY-4 meteorological satellite of China. To this end, this article proposes a novel model, tensor-based convolutional neural network (TCNN). Not only being a deep network entirely formulated in tensor algebra, but TCNN also establishes the mathematical connections between tensor decomposition and CNN operations with tensor contraction. Moreover, TCNN adopts a multitask structure, which consists of a classification network for intensity categorization and a regression network for wind speed estimation. It allows the regression network to leverage the outcome of the classification network, thus ensuring intensity estimation accuracy. In addition, two alternative TCNN models, coupled TCNN (C-TCNN) and Tucker TCNN (T-TCNN), are designed to automatically deal with invalid band data in the FY-4 MSIs, which has been a practical issue with the data. Experimental results prove that the proposed network is accurate and functional. They also demonstrate the advantages of TCNN over other TC intensity estimation methods, showing that C-TCNN and T-TCNN outperform several classic models and the state-of-the-art models based on CNN.

TI  - Calving Front Machine (CALFIN): glacial termini dataset and automated deep learning extraction method for Greenland, 1972-2019
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level contributions from the Greenland Ice Sheet are influenced by the rapid changes in glacial terminus positions. The documentation of these evolving calving front positions, for which satellite imagery forms the basis, is therefore important. However, the manual delineation of these calving fronts is time consuming, which limits the availability of these data across a wide spatial and temporal range. Automated methods face challenges that include the handling of clouds, illumination differences, sea ice melange, and Landsat 7 scan line corrector errors. To address these needs, we develop the Calving Front Machine (CALFIN), an automated method for extracting calving fronts from satellite images of marine-terminating glaciers, using neural networks. The results are often indistinguishable from manually curated fronts, deviating by on average 86.76 +/- 1.43m from the measured front. Landsat imagery from 1972 to 2019 is used to generate 22 678 calving front lines across 66 Green-landic glaciers. This improves on the state of the art in terms of the spatiotemporal coverage and accuracy of its outputs and is validated through a comprehensive intercomparison with existing studies. The current implementation offers a new opportunity to explore subseasonal and regional trends on the extent of Greenland's margins and supplies new constraints for simulations of the evolution of the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its contributions to future sea level rise.

TI  - Evaluation of eco-environmental quality in Mentougou District of Beijing based on improved remote sensing ecological index
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on data derived from Landsat images in 2001, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018, we calculated the weight of selected indices using the entropy weight method and the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) using the index weighted sum method. Combined with GM (1,1) model, we analyzed the dynamics of eco-environmental quality and its causes in Mentougou District of Beijing and predicted the future trend. The results showed that the RSEI of Mentougou in 2001, 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 were 0.5993, 0.5451, 0.5592, 0.6113 and 0.716, respectively, displaying a trend of " decline first and then rise". The areas with " excellent" and good" eco-environmental quality were mainly forestland and shrub land. "Inferior" and "poor" areas were dominated by bare land, urban land use and roads. Mining activity was the main cause for the decline of RSEI from 2001 to 2006. Since 2006, urbanization had negative impacts on the eco-environmental quality of Mentougou District. Some key projects had improved the eco-environmental quality. The Beijing -Tianjin sandstorm source control project had a remarkable positive effect on the eco-environmental quality of Mentougou. The visual expression of eco-environmental quality can better reflect the changes of eco-environmental quality and provide better support for the maintenance of ecological balance.

TI  - UAV-based high-throughput phenotyping to increase prediction and selection accuracy in maize varieties under artificial MSV inoculation
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of unmanned aerial vehicles? (UAV) remotely sensed data in crop evaluation is revolutionizing the field of plant phenotyping. This study was conducted to (1) develop protocol to predict maize streak virus (MSV) and grain yield using UAV-derived multispectral data; and (2) identify the suitable predictor variables and ideal phenological stages for MSV and grain yield prediction. Twenty-five maize varieties were evaluated under artificial MSV inoculation. Manual scoring and multispectral imaging measurements were performed at midvegetative, flowering and mid-grain filling stages. UAV-derived data were acquired in the multispectral bands of Green (0.53?0.57 ?m), Red (0.64?0.68 ?m), Red-edge (0.73?0.74 ?m) and Near-Infrared (0.77?0.81 ?m). Eight vegetation indices were determined: NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), NDVIred-edge, GNDVI (green normalized difference vegetation index), SR (simple ratio), CIgreen (green chlorophyll index), CIred-edge (red-edge chlorophyll index), SAVI (soil-adjusted vegetation index) and OSAVI (optimized SAVI). Finally, predictions of MSV and grain yield were performed with 36 models using multiple regression, decision trees and linear regression. Frequently selected variables for MSV prediction were Green band at vegetative (61.5%), Red band at vegetative (68.4%) and flowering (80.4%), and GNDVI at mid-vegetative (88.7%). The best MSV predictors were GNDVI (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.85), CIgreen (r = 0.83; RMSE = 0.86) and Red band (r = 0.77; RMSE = 0.99) measured at mid-vegetative stage. Six out of 36 models were selected as ideal for predicting maize grain yield: RF-REF-NIRF (r = 0.69; RMSE = 0.65); NDVIREG-GNDVIG (r = 0.74; RMSE = 0.56); RV-NIRV (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.37); and the tree with the largest correlations are RV-NIRV-RF (r = 0.86; RMSE = 0.32); GNDVIVOSAVIV (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.36); GV-RV-NIRV (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.35); the last two of which were at midvegetative stage. We conclude that UAV-based multispectral remote sensing is a reliable tool for phenotyping MSV disease and grain yield prediction, and mid-vegetative appear to be the most ideal phenological stage for MSV and grain yield prediction.

TI  - Estimation of TROPOMI-derived Ground-level SO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations Using Machine Learning Over East Asia
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere is mainly generated from anthropogenic emission sources. It forms ultra-fine particulate matter through chemical reaction and has harmful effect on both the environment and human health. In particular, ground-level SO2 concentrations are closely related to human activities. Satellite observations such as TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument)derived column density data can provide spatially continuous monitoring of ground-level SO2 concentrations. This study aims to propose a 2-step residual corrected model to estimate ground-level SO2 concentrations through the synergistic use of satellite data and numerical model output. Random forest machine learning was adopted in the 2-step residual corrected model. The proposed model was evaluated through three cross-validations (i.e., random, spatial and temporal). The results showed that the model produced slopes of 1.14-1.25, R values of 0.55-0.65, and relative root-mean-square-error of 58-63%, which were improved by 10% for slopes and 3% for R and rRMSE when compared to the model without residual correction. The model performance by country was slightly reduced in Japan, often resulting in overestimation, where the sample size was small, and the concentration level was relatively low. The spatial and temporal distributions of SO2 produced by the model agreed with those of the in-situmeasurements, especially over Yangtze River Delta in China and Seoul Metropolitan Area in South Korea, which are highly dependent on the characteristics of anthropogenic emission sources. The model proposed in this study can be used for long-term monitoring of ground-level SO2 concentrations on both the spatial and temporal domains.

TI  - Improving Spatial Coverage of Satellite Aerosol Classification Using a Random Forest Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial coverage of satellite aerosol classification was improved using a random forest (RF) model trained with observational data including target (aerosol type) and input (satellite measurement) variables. The AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) aerosol-type dataset was used for the target variables. Satellite input variables with many missing data or low mean-decrease accuracy were excluded from the final input variable set, and good performance in aerosol-type classification was achieved. The performance of the RF-based model was evaluated on the basis of the wavelength dependence of single-scattering albedo (SSA) and fine-mode-fraction values from AERONET. Typical SSA wavelength dependence for individual aerosol types was consistent with that obtained for aerosol types by the RF-based model. The spatial coverage of the RF-based model was also compared with that of previously developed models in a global-scale case study. The study demonstrates that the RF-based model allows satellite aerosol classification with improved spatial coverage, with a performance similar to that of previously developed models.

TI  - Refining the 2018 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.5 Papua New Guinea Earthquake Fault-Slip Model Using Subpixel Offset
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The M-w 7.5 earthquake that struck central Papua New Guinea in 2018 was the largest event ever recorded in the region with modern seismic instruments. The ground motions associated with this event also triggered widespread landslides and affected more than 500,000 people. However, due to the absence of a local seismic and Global Positioning System network in the vicinity, the fault location, system, and slip distribution of this earthquake are not well documented. In this study, we use the subpixel offset method on the Copernicus Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to calculate the 3D coseismic displacement of the 2018 Papua New Guinea earthquake. The results show clear fault traces that suggest coseismic slip on the Mubi fault and the Mananda fault that triggered landslides that spread out in a more than 260 km(2) region. Finite-source inversions based on the subpixel offset measurements show up to 4.1 and 6.5 m coseismic slip on the Mubi and Mananda faults, respectively. Despite higher data uncertainty (similar to 0.4-0.8 m) of the subpixel offset data, synthetic resolution tests show resolvable slip above 8 km in depth. The lack of shallower slip on the west side of the Mananda fault could be due to an inflated geothermal gradient near the dormant volcano, Mount Sisa, as a slip barrier. The result of the coulomb stress change suggests possible southeastward slip propagation from the Mananda fault to the Mubi fault. Our work successfully resolves 3D coseismic displacement in highly vegetated terrains and demonstrates the feasibility of using the subpixel offset on SAR images to help our understanding of regional active tectonic systems.

TI  - Empirical Mode Decomposition-Derived Entropy Features Are Beneficial to Distinguish Elderly People with a Falling History on a Force Plate Signal
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fall risk prediction is an important issue for the elderly. A center of pressure signal, derived from a force plate, is useful for the estimation of body calibration. However, it is still difficult to distinguish elderly people's fall history by using a force plate signal. In this study, older adults with and without a history of falls were recruited to stand still for 60 s on a force plate. Forces in the x, y and z directions (Fx, Fy, and Fz) and center of pressure in the anteroposterior (COPx) and mediolateral directions (COPy) were derived. There were 49 subjects in the non-fall group, with an average age of 71.67 (standard derivation: 6.56). There were also 27 subjects in the fall group, with an average age of 70.66 (standard derivation: 6.38). Five signal series-forces in x, y, z (Fx, Fy, Fz), COPX, and COPy directions-were used. These five signals were further decomposed with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with seven intrinsic mode functions. Time domain features (mean, standard derivation and coefficient of variations) and entropy features (approximate entropy and sample entropy) of the original signals and EMD-derived signals were extracted. Results showed that features extracted from the raw COP data did not differ significantly between the fall and non-fall groups. There were 10 features extracted using EMD, with significant differences observed among fall and non-fall groups. These included four features from COPx and two features from COPy, Fx and Fz.

TI  - Associate Degree Sociology Education in Hong Kong: An Exploratory Study Based on Student Focus Groups
T2  - TEACHING SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study adopted a case-study approach to examine how associate degree sociology graduates evaluate their learning in a Hong Kong community college. Through focus group interviews, the learning experiences of sociology graduates were examined, specifically paying attention to their identification of enhancements in learning. The results of this examination indicate that the delivery of sociology education requires a strong emphasis on the integration of acquisition of sociology knowledge with social practice. It is important to consider how the curriculum engages the worldview of students beyond the personal and allows them to directly experience the social in a way that reflects what is going on around them. This study contributes to the discussion on the quality of associate degree education in Hong Kong and highlights the centrality of examining the issue from the point of view of students, particularly in the context of outcome-based education.

TI  - Deformation Detection in Cyclic Landslides Prior to Their Reactivation Using Two-Pass Satellite Interferometry
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are widespread geological features in Italy's Northern Apennines, with slow-moving earthflows among the most common types. They develop in fine-grained rocks and are subject to periodic rainfall-induced reactivations alternating to phases of dormancy. In this paper, we use radar interferometry (InSAR) and information about landslide activity to investigate deformation signals on an areal basis and to assess the dynamics of recently reactivated earthflows. We use traditional two-pass interferometry by taking advantage of the short revisit time of the Sentinel 1 satellite to characterize 4 years of slope deformations over the 60 km(2) study area, where 186 landslides are mapped. Our results show that most intense and sustained deformation signals are associated with phenomena on the verge of reactivation, indicating that radar interferometry may have a potential for early warning purposes. By focusing on three specific earthflow reactivations, we analyze their dynamics through the years that preceded their failure. Despite inherent uncertainties, it was possible to retrieve the deformation signal's temporal evolution, which displayed seasonally recurring accelerations, peaking during the major precipitation episodes in the area.

TI  - Economic Crisis in Portugal: Trajectory of the Incidence of Depression and Correlation With Unemployment
T2  - ACTA MEDICA PORTUGUESA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Previous studies have found an increase in the incidence rate of depression between 2007 - 2013 in Portugal, with a positive correlation with the unemployment rate, namely, in men. So, it was hypothesized that this increase is related with the situation of economic crisis. This study aimed to investigate if the correlation between unemployment rates and the incidence of depression is maintained in the post-crisis period of economic recovery in Portugal (2016 - 2018).Material and Methods: An ecological study was carried out, using data from the General Practitioners Sentinel Network concerning depression incidence (first episodes and relapses) and data from the National Statistics Institute on unemployment rates in the Portuguese population. The correlation coefficient was estimated using linear regression and the results were disaggregated by sex.Results: Between 2016 and 2018, there was a consistent decrease in the incidence of depression in both sexes. During the 1995 2018 period, a positive correlation was observed between unemployment and depression, with a coefficient of 0.833 (p = 0.005) in males and of 0.742 (p = 0.022) in females.Discussion: The reduction in the incidence of depression in both sexes observed between 2016 - 2018 corroborates a positive correlation between unemployment and depression in the Portuguese population, previously observed between 2007 - 2013.Conclusion: This study highlights the need to monitor the occurrence of mental illness in the Portuguese population, especially in moments of greatest social vulnerability in order to establish preventive measures, as a way to mitigate the impact of future economic crises.

TI  - Lymphatic Drainage Mapping with Indirect Lymphography for Canine Mammary Tumors
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryMammary gland tumours are the most common canine neoplasms. They account for 25-50% of all tumors diagnosed in bitches. Metastases and recurrences develop in about 35-70% of bitches following excision. The presence of regional lymph node metastases is a relevant factor affecting prognosis and treatment in cases of mammary gland tumors. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node (or nodes) in the regional lymphatic basin that receives lymphatic flow from the primary neoplasm. As mammary gland tumors mainly spread by lymphatic vessels invasion, conceptually, distant metastasis should not be present if the SLN does not have evidence of a tumor burden. In the present study, an indirect lymphography was used for sentinel lymph node mapping in a cohort of 14 adult female dogs with 24 mammary tumors involving the third to the fifth mammary gland. Contrast was injected around the mammary tumor, and lymph nodes that picked up the contrast were visible after 24 h. The results of this study indicate that the lymph drainage pattern of the neoplastic mammary gland may be different for each tumor. The knowledge of the SLN of the neoplastic mammary glands should be of high importance for the surgeon not only for performing the most adequate surgical excision but also for determining an accurate post-surgical prognosis.Mammary gland tumors are the most common canine neoplasms.

TI  - Quantifying the Impact of Evapotranspiration at the Aquifer Scale via Groundwater Modelling and MODIS Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In shallow alluvial aquifers characterized by coarse sediments, the evapotranspiration rates from groundwater are often not accounted for due to their low capillarity. Nevertheless, this assumption can lead to errors in the hydrogeological balance estimation. To quantify such impacts, a numerical flow model using MODFLOW was set up for the Tronto river alluvial aquifer (Italy). Different estimates of evapotranspiration rates were retrieved from the online Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) database and used as input values. The numerical model was calibrated against piezometric heads collected in two snapshots (mid-January 2007 and mid-June 2007) in monitoring wells distributed along the whole alluvial aquifer. The model performance was excellent, with all the statistical parameters indicating very good agreement between calculated and observed heads. The model validation was performed using baseflow data of the Tronto river compared with the calculated aquifer-river exchanges in both of the simulated periods. Then, a series of numerical scenarios indicated that, although the model performance did not vary appreciably regardless of whether it included evapotranspiration from groundwater, the aquifer-river exchanges were influenced significantly. This study showed that evapotranspiration from shallow groundwater accounts for up to 21% of the hydrogeological balance at the aquifer scale and that baseflow observations are pivotal in quantifying the evapotranspiration impact.

TI  - First report of tilapia lake virus emergence in fish farms in the department of Cordoba, Colombia
T2  - VETERINARY WORLD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aim: In 2016, the tilapia-producing farms in the department of Cordoba, Colombia, had witnessed outbreaks of disease with clinical signs compatible with those caused by the tilapia lake virus (TiLV). This study was conducted to confirm the presence of TiLV in some fish farms in the department of Cordoba.Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in seven farms using a non-random sampling method from July 2016 to December 2017. A total of 66 fish, including 33 healthy fish and 33 fish with clinical signs, were caught, from which 178 tissue samples of spleen, liver, and brain were collected. RNA was extracted from each organ using TRIzol (R). cDNA was synthesized using a retrotranscriptase and a universal amplification primer. The polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers specific to TiLV, in which the primers were amplified in a 491 bp region in segment 3 of TiLV, and the amplicons were sequenced using the Sanger method.Results: Of the seven farms surveyed, 3 (42.85%) had TiLV in the collected fish. Of the 66 collected fish, 18 (27.27%) were infected with TiLV. The virus was detected in the brain (64.3%, 18/28), spleen (61.9%, 13/21), and liver (35.7%, 10/28). The sequences were recorded in GenBank with the codes MH338228, MH350845, and MH350846. Nucleotide homology analyses revealed that this study's circulating strains exhibited 97% identity with the Israeli strain (GenBank KU751816.1).Conclusion: This is the first official report of TiLV in the department of Cordoba, Colombia. The circulating strains detected in this study exhibited 97% identity with the Israeli strain.

TI  - Anatomical basis of lymph node detection in gynecologic cancers: a review from a surgical perspective
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy are associated with increased risk of complications and are responsible for a significant proportion of morbidity and impaired quality of life following surgical management of pelvic malignancies. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) was developed as a trade-off between systematic and no lymphadenectomy to limit morbidity while conserving good oncological staging and outcomes. In this comprehensive review, we aimed to synthetize the anatomical basis of the SLN procedure in patients with pelvic malignancies from a surgical perspective. The reliability of the SLN procedure is based on the knowledge of the dissemination pathways for each type of tumors. The most recent understanding of the uterine lymphatic anatomy defined three consistent channels: an upper paracervical pathway (UPP) with draining medial external and/or obturator lymph nodes; a lower paracervical pathway (LPP) with draining internal iliac and/or presacral lymph nodes and the infundibulo-pelvic pathway (IPP) with a course along the fallopian tube and upper broad ligament via the infundibulo-pelvic ligament to its origin. In patients with endometrial cancer, most SLNs are located on the UPP pathway: obturator and external iliac whereas 80% of the SLNs in patients with cervical cancer are located in the external iliac, interiliac and obturator area. Surgical training is a key step toward improving detection rates and exhaustiveness of SLN research while reducing overall morbidity. This is all the more important that the indications for performing complete lymphadenectomy are becoming increasingly rare.

AB  - Writing Studying the Qur'an in the Muslim Academy emerged out of my personal and academic concerns, which have not been relieved since its publication. Now, my trepidations have become more serious and I am becoming more disappointed about the future of religious and Islamic studies. Such concerns have not disappeared, and all we can do is remind the next generation that their field of study as well as their worldview was shaped in accordance with the proclivity of seniors, superiors, job-givers and policy-makers. The current symposium dedicated to my book, to which this is a response, includes essays by well-versed scholars with Muslim backgrounds. They all draw my attention to the diversity, complexity and importance of the notions we use regularly in the study of Islam. Each of the essays suggests how the discourse on method and theory in the study of Islam has changed within the last decade.

TI  - Erosion and progradation in the Atrato River delta: A spatiotemporal analysis with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REVISTA FACULTAD DE INGENIERIA-UNIVERSIDAD DE ANTIOQUIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atrato River Delta in Northwestern Colombia has experienced notable geomorphological changes in its shoreline in recent years. We analyze these changes, associated with erosion and progradation, using Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine (GEE) algorithms to automatically identify the changes in an annual basis over 33 years (1986-2019). We compare the results with manual delineations on the same imagery using ArcGIS, obtaining similar outcomes, although GEE is much more efficient in processing large amounts of imagery compared with handmade procedures. We identify with good accuracy trends in erosion and progradation areas along the mouths and sides of the delta. Our algorithm performs well at delineating the shorelines, although special care must be taken to clean the images from clouds and shadows that may alter the definition of the shoreline. Results show that the Atrato delta has lost around 10 km(2) due to erosion and has gained around 18 km(2) in progradation during the period of assessment. Overall, progradation is the dominant process at the delta's mouths, while erosion is dominant only in areas far from the mouths, which agrees with a river-dominated environment of high sediment loads and is coherent with other studies made in the region. The algorithm in GEE is a versatile tool, appropriate to assess short and long-term changes of coastal areas that do not count with land-based information.

TI  - Influenza epidemiology and burden of disease in Mongolia, 2013-2014 to 2017-2018
T2  - WESTERN PACIFIC SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mongolia is a vast, sparsely populated country in central Asia. Its harsh climate and nomadic lifestyle make the population vulnerable to acute respiratory infections, particularly influenza. Evidence on the morbidity, mortality and socioeconomic impact of influenza in Mongolia is scarce; however, routine surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and laboratory-detected influenza is conducted. This paper describes the epidemiology of influenza and the estimated burden of influenza-associated illness in Mongolia in the five influenza seasons between 2013-2014 and 2017-2018.Methods: Demographic and laboratory data from 152 sentinel surveillance sites on all patients who met the case definitions of ILI and SARI between October 2013 and May 2018 were extracted and analysed as described in A Manual for Estimating Disease Burden Associated with Seasonal Influenza.Results: The estimated annual influenza-associated ILI and SARI rates, presented as ranges, were 1279-2798 and 81-666 cases per 100 000 population, respectively. Children aged <5 years accounted for 67% of all ILI cases and 79% of all SARI cases. The annual specimen positivity for influenza was highest (11-30% for ILI and 8-31% for SARI) for children aged 5-<15 years and children <2 years old, respectively. The annual mortality rate due to pneumonia and SARI was highest among children aged <2 years (15.8-54.0 per 100 000 population). Although the incidence of influenza-associated ILI and SARI was lowest for people aged =65 years, the mortality rate due to pneumonia and SARI (1.2-5.1 per 100 000) was higher than that for those aged 15-64 years.Conclusion: The estimated influenza-associated ILI and SARI incidence rates are high in Mongolia, and children, especially those aged <5 years, have the highest influenza-associated burden in Mongolia. These findings provide evidence for decision-makers in Mongolia to consider targeted influenza vaccination, particularly for children.

TI  - Remote and Proximal Sensing-Derived Spectral Indices and Biophysical Variables for Spatial Variation Determination in Vineyards
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing measurements are crucial for smart-farming applications, crop monitoring, and yield forecasting, especially in fields characterized by high heterogeneity. Therefore, in this study, Precision Viticulture (PV) methods using proximal- and remote-sensing technologies were exploited and compared in a table grape vineyard to monitor and evaluate the spatial variation of selected vegetation indices and biophysical variables throughout selected phenological stages (multi-seasonal data), from veraison to harvest. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Normalized Difference Red-Edge Index were calculated by utilizing satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) and proximal sensing (active crop canopy sensor Crop Circle ACS-470) to assess the correlation between the outputs of the different sensing methods. Moreover, numerous vegetation indices and vegetation biophysical variables (VBVs), such as the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, the Normalized Difference Water Index, the Fraction of Vegetation Cover, and the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, were calculated, using the satellite data. The vegetation indices analysis revealed different degrees of correlation when using diverse sensing methods, various measurement dates, and different parts of the cultivation. The results revealed the usefulness of proximal- and remote-sensing-derived vegetation indices and variables and especially of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation in the monitoring of vineyard condition and yield examining, since they were demonstrated to have a very high degree of correlation (coefficient of determination was 0.87). The adequate correlation of the vegetation indices with the yield during the latter part of the veraison stage provides valuable information for the future estimation of production in broader areas.

T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was the generation of trade volume models with bark (VB) in Eucalyptus dunnii and urograndis stands at different growth site conditions, using reflectance data from different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and vegetation indices. The multiple linear regressions generated, resulting in three predictive models, being the most significant ones, in decreasing order were for the species of Eucalyptus dunnii and Eucalyptus urograndis of 50 and 59 months of age, respectively, followed by the model for 25-month old Eucalyptus urograndis. Although, the regression equation for 34-month old Eucalyptus dunnii was not significant. The vegetation index adjusted to the soil (SAVI 0.5) was relevant in the construction of the three models dueto the different degrees of contribution of the soil component, as a result the non-closure of the crowns in young stands at different ages. The short wave-infrared region (SWIR 1 - TM5) also composed the models of Eucalyptus dunnii and Eucalyptus urograndis, analyzed together and the predictive model for Eucalyptus dunnii, demonstrating the importance of the forest canopy structure because this region of the electromagnetic spectrum is related to increased lignin content and because of the evolution of its productive capacity.

TI  - Retrieving and Validating Leaf and Canopy Chlorophyll Content at Moderate Resolution: A Multiscale Analysis with the Sentinel-3 OLCI Sensor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - ESA's Eighth Earth Explorer mission "FLuorescence EXplorer" (FLEX) will be dedicated to the global monitoring of the chlorophyll fluorescence emitted by vegetation. In order to properly interpret the measured fluorescence signal, essential vegetation variables need to be retrieved concomitantly. FLEX will fly in tandem formation with Sentinel-3 (S3), which conveys the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) that is designed to characterize the atmosphere and the terrestrial vegetation at a spatial resolution of 300 m. In support of FLEX's preparatory activities, this paper presents a first validation exercise of OLCI vegetation products against in situ data coming from the 2018 FLEXSense campaign. During this campaign, leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and leaf area index (LAI) measurements were collected over croplands, while HyPlant DUAL images of the area were acquired at a 3 m spatial resolution. A multiscale validation strategy was pursued. First, estimates of these two variables, together with the combined canopy chlorophyll content (CCC = LCC x LAI), were obtained at the HyPlant spatial resolution and were compared against the in situ measurements. Second, the fine-scale retrieval maps from HyPlant were coarsened to the S3 spatial scale as a reference to assess the quality of the OLCI vegetation products. As an intermediary step, vegetation products extracted from Sentinel-2 data were used to compare retrievals at the in-between spatial resolution of 20 m. For all spatial scales, CCC delivered the most accurate estimates with the smallest prediction error obtained at the 300 m resolution (R2 of 0.74 and RMSE = 26.8 mu g cm-2). Results of a scaling analysis suggest that CCC performs well at the different tested spatial resolutions since it presents a linear behavior across scales. LCC, on the other hand, was poorly retrieved at the 300 m scale, showing overestimated values over heterogeneous pixels. The introduction of a new LCC model integrating mixed reflectance spectra in its training enabled to improve by 16% the retrieval accuracy for this variable (RMSE = 10 mu g cm-2 for the new model versus RMSE = 11.9 mu g cm-2 for the former model).

TI  - Habitat Suitability Assessment of Wintering Herbivorous Anseriformes in Poyang Lake, China
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - To design a good conservation strategy for herbivorous Anseriformes wintering in Poyang Lake, knowledge of habitat suitability is essential. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the habitat suitability of herbivorous Anseriformes of China's Poyang Lake. Landsat images with a resolution of 30 m downloaded from the United States Geological Survey, and other ancillary data were used. The ENVI 5.3 software and ArcGIS 10.2 software were used for preprocessing, classifying the satellite image, and mapping habitat suitability. The study reveals that land cover types were divided into vegetation, mudflats, water, and sand. Similarly, the study area's habitats were also divided into unsuitable, fair, good, and best grades. However, the distribution of the habitat suitability for each grade reveals significant spatial variations. For instance, vegetation indicated the areas with the best habitat grade, followed by mudflats, and these areas cover (47.93%, 2015 and 55.78%, 2019) the majority of the study area. The unsuitable grades cover the smallest areas (0.48%) of the lake. Similarly, this study results showed a slight change in habitat suitability areas. Therefore, this study highlighted that Poyang Lake has valuable importance for the conservation of herbivorous Anseriformes. Extending the years of study and including some ecological variables from different stopovers could improve the results.

TI  - Stage IIIa Melanoma and Impact of Multiple Positive Lymph Nodes on Survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - If we were in West Palm Beach and it were not for the pandemic, this commentary would be posed in a series of questions to which the authors would have the opportunity to respond. Because the current situation of our world does not allow for us to get together in our traditional manner, I will do my best to provide the discourse that our members and the readership of this Journal have come to expect of the work that is presented at the Southern Surgical Association annual meeting. In this current study,1 the group from Louisville continues to demonstrate their insightful perspective on the decision-making around patients with melanoma. The analysis helps clinicians consider the nuances of microscopic nodal disease by stratifying patients into the most common scenario-a single positive lymph node-and a less common but significant occurrence-the patient with 2 or 3 positive sentinel lymph nodes. The analysis is enhanced by some additional subset analyses and a validation of some of the results by comparison with the always reliable, Sunbelt Melanoma Trial data set. The greatest limitation of the current study is the inherent flaws of the National Cancer Database (NCDB), which include the way data are recorded and updated, and a limitation of fields for analysis. In addition, it is a retrospective analysis,

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Snowline Altitude and Their Responses to Climate Change in the Tienshan Mountains, Central Asia, during 2001-2019
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important water resource in arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, and is related to agricultural and livestock production, ecosystems, and socio-economic development. The snowline altitude (SLA) is a significant indicator for monitoring the changes in snow cover in mountainous regions under the changing climate. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal variation of SLA in the Tienshan Mountains (TS) during 2001-2019 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products on a grid-by-grid basis. The potential influence of topographic factors (slope gradient and aspect) on SLA and the correlation between SLA, temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation are also investigated. The results are as follows: (1) The annual cycle of SLA shows strong seasonal fluctuations (from about 2000 m in late December to 4100 m in early August). The SLA over the TS exhibits a large spatiotemporal heterogeneity. (2) SLA increases with a steeper slope gradient. The SLA of the northerly aspect is generally less than the southerly. (3) The SLA over the TS generally shows an increasing trend in the recent years (2001-2019). The change trend of SLA varies in different months. Except for a slight decrease in June, the SLA increased in almost all months, especially at the start of the melt season (March and April) and the end of melting season (July and August). (4) The SLA increases with increased temperature/radiation in the TS, and decreases with increased precipitation. Solar radiation is the dominant climatic factor affecting the changes of SLA in the TS. Compared with precipitation, temperature is more correlated to SLA dynamics.

TI  - Landsat 8 Lake Water Clarity Empirical Algorithms: Large-Scale Calibration and Validation Using Government and Citizen Science Data from across Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity has been extensively assessed in Landsat-based remote sensing studies of inland waters, regularly relying on locally calibrated empirical algorithms, and close temporal matching between field data and satellite overpass. As more satellite data and faster data processing systems become readily accessible, new opportunities are emerging to revisit traditional assumptions concerning empirical calibration methodologies. Using Landsat 8 images with large water clarity datasets from southern Canada, we assess: (1) whether clear regional differences in water clarity algorithm coefficients exist and (2) whether model fit can be improved by expanding temporal matching windows. We found that a single global algorithm effectively represents the empirical relationship between in situ Secchi disk depth (SDD) and the Landsat 8 Blue/Red band ratio across diverse lake types in Canada. We also found that the model fit improved significantly when applying a median filter on data from ever-wider time windows between the date of in situ SDD sample and the date of satellite overpass. The median filter effectively removed the outliers that were likely caused by atmospheric artifacts in the available imagery. Our findings open new discussions on the ability of large datasets and temporal averaging methods to better elucidate the true relationships between in situ water clarity and satellite reflectance data.

TI  - Alkyphenol Exposure Alters Steroidogenesis in Male Lizard <i>Podarcis siculus</i>
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryThe non-stop release and increase in the ecosystem of toxic and polluting substances such as endocrine disrupting chemicals pose a threat to the survival of wildlife. Nonylphenol and Octylphenol are well known xenobiotics, with estrogen-like properties, widely used to optimize the manufacturing of different products, and due to their hydrophobicity and low solubility, they are persistent and ubiquitous in many environmental matrices. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of these compounds on the testis of the lizard Podarcis siculus during the reproductive period, focusing our attention on the steroidogenesis process. The lizard P. siculus has been chosen as animal model as it is usually used as a sentinel species and because the morphology and physiology of testis between lizards and mammals do not change, allowing a fine correlation of observed effects to human health. Obtained results showed that both substances used in this study, are able to alter testis histology and localization of key steroidogenic enzymes such as 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and P450 aromatase, which represents the major target of these two alkylphenols. In conclusion, Nonylphenol and Octylphenol inhibit steroidogenesis, interfering with the reproductive capacity of the lizard Podarcis siculus.Background: Nonylphenol (NP) and Octylphenol (OP) are persistent and non-biodegradable environmental contaminants classified as endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs). These compounds are widely used in several industrial applications and present estrogen-like properties, which have extensively been studied in aquatic organisms. The present study aimed to verify the interference of these compounds alone, and in mixture, on the reproductive cycle of the male terrestrial vertebrate Podarcis siculus, focusing mainly on the steroidogenesis process. Methods: Male lizards have been treated with different injections of both NP and OP alone and in mixture, and evaluation has been carried out using a histological approach. Results: Results obtained showed that both substances are able to alter both testis histology and localization of key steroidogenic enzymes, such as 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), 17 beta- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) and P450 aromatase. Moreover, OP exerts a preponderant effect, and the P450 aromatase represents the major target of both chemicals. Conclusions: In conclusion, NP and OP inhibit steroidogenesis, which in turn may reduce the reproductive capacity of the specimens.

TI  - A Large-Scale Deep-Learning Approach for Multi-Temporal Aqua and Salt-Culture Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture and salt-culture are relevant economic activities in the Brazilian Coastal Zone (BCZ). However, automatic discrimination of such activities from other water-related covers/uses is not an easy task. In this sense, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have the advantage of predicting a given pixel's class label by providing as input a local region (named patches or chips) around that pixel. Both the convolutional nature and the semantic segmentation capability provide the U-Net classifier with the ability to access the "context domain" instead of solely isolated pixel values. Backed by the context domain, the results obtained show that the BCZ aquaculture/saline ponds occupied similar to 356 km(2) in 1985 and similar to 544 km(2) in 2019, reflecting an area expansion of similar to 51%, a rise of 1.5x in 34 years. From 1997 to 2015, the aqua-salt-culture area grew by a factor of similar to 1.7, jumping from 349 km(2) to 583 km(2), a 67% increase. In 2019, the Northeast sector concentrated 93% of the coastal aquaculture/salt-culture surface, while the Southeast and South sectors contained 6% and 1%, respectively. Interestingly, despite presenting extensive coastal zones and suitable conditions for developing different aqua-salt-culture products, the North coast shows no relevant aqua or salt-culture infrastructure sign.

TI  - Modeling Mean Radiant Temperature Distribution in Urban Landscapes Using DART
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The microclimatic conditions of the urban environment influence significantly the thermal comfort of human beings. One of the main human biometeorology parameters of thermal comfort is the Mean Radiant Temperature (Tmrt), which quantifies effective radiative flux reaching a human body. Simulation tools have proven useful to analyze the radiative behavior of an urban space and its impact on the inhabitants. We present a new method to produce detailed modeling of Tmrt spatial distribution using the 3-D Discrete Anisotropic Radiation Transfer model (DART). Our approach is capable to simulate Tmrt at different scales and under a range of parameters including the urban pattern, surface material of ground, walls, roofs, and properties of the vegetation (coverage, shape, spectral signature, Leaf Area Index and Leaf Area Density). The main advantages of our method are found in (1) the fine treatment of radiation in both short-wave and long-wave domains, (2) detailed specification of optical properties of urban surface materials and of vegetation, (3) precise representation of the vegetation component, and (4) capability to assimilate 3-D inputs derived from multisource remote sensing data. We illustrate and provide a first evaluation of the method in Singapore, a tropical city experiencing strong Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) and seeking to enhance the outdoor thermal comfort. The comparison between DART modelled and field estimated Tmrt shows good agreement in our study site under clear-sky condition over a time period from 10:00 to 19:00 (R-2 = 0.9697, RMSE = 3.3249). The use of a 3-D radiative transfer model shows promising capability to study urban microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort with increasing landscape details, and to build linkage to remote sensing data. Our methodology has the potential to contribute towards optimizing climate-sensitive urban design when combined with the appropriate tools.

TI  - Drought Extent and Severity on Arable Lands in Romania Derived from Normalized Difference Drought Index (2001-2020)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of drought over the arable lands of Romania using the Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI). This index was obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MODIS) sensor of the Terra satellite. The interval between March and September was investigated to study the drought occurrence from the early stage of crop growth to its harvest time. The study covered a long period (2001-2020), hence it is able to provide a sound climatological image of crop vegetation conditions. Corine Land Cover 2018 (CLC) was used to extract the arable land surfaces. According to this index, the driest year was 2003 with 25.6% of arable land affected by drought. On the contrary, the wettest year was 2016, with only 10.8% of arable land affected by drought. Regarding the multiannual average of the period 2001-2020, it can be seen that drought is not a phenomenon that occurs consistently each year, therefore only 11.7% of arable land was affected constantly by severe and extreme drought. The correlation between NDDI and precipitation amount was also investigated. Although the correlations at weekly or monthly levels are more complicated, the annual regional mean NDDI is overall negatively correlated with annual rainfall. Thus, from a climatic perspective, we consider that NDDI is a reliable and valuable tool for the assessment of droughts over the arable lands in Romania.

TI  - Municipality and Adjusted Gross Income Influence Outcome of Patients Diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer in a Newly Developed Cancer Center in Mercer County New Jersey, USA, a Single Center Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryIn the study we used a patient registry and associated its data with geography and tax returns to assess the impact of socioeconomic status and race on clinical outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer. Our findings indicate that African Americans and patients who live in an area with low socioeconomic status have significantly lower overall survival and lower utilization of specialty services. Our premise is that these patients encounter barriers when accessing specialty services at larger academic medical centers and that regional medical centers have a critical role to play in providing specialty services to the community.Socioeconomic status (SES) correlates directly to ZIP code. Mercer County is not atypical as a collection of a dozen municipalities with a suburban/metropolitan population of 370,430 in the immediate vicinity of a major medical center. The purpose of this study for Mercer County, New Jersey, USA is to determine whether a patient's ZIP code is related to the outlook of pancreatic cancer defined as staging at diagnosis, prevalence, overall survival, type of insurance, and recurrence. Our hypothesis was that specific variables such as socio-economic status or race could be linked to the outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer. We interrogated a convenience sample from our cancer center registry and obtained 479 subjects diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 1998-2018. We selected 339 subjects by ZIP code, representing the plurality of the cases in our catchment area. The outcome variable was overall survival; predictor variables were socio-economic status (SES), recurrence, insurance, type of treatment, gender, cancer stage, age, and race. We converted ZIP code to municipality and culled data using adjusted gross income (AGI, FY 2017). Comparative statistical analysis was performed using chi-square tests for nominal and ordinal variables, and a two-way ANOVA test was used for continuous variables; the p-value was set at 0.05. Our analysis confirmed that overall survival was significantly higher for Whites and for individuals who live in a municipality with a high SES. Tumor stage at the time of diagnosis was not different among race and SES; however, statistically significant differences for race or SES existed in the type of treatment received, with disparities found in those who received radiation therapy and surgery but not chemotherapy. The data may point to a lack of access to specific care modalities that subsequently may lead to lower survival in an underserved population. Access to care, optimal nutritional status, overall fitness, and co-morbidities could play a major role and confound the results. Our study suggests that low SES has a negative impact on overall pancreatic cancer survival. Surgery for pancreatic cancer should be appropriately decentralized to those community cancer centers that possess the expertise and the infrastructure to carry out specialized treatments regardless of race, ethnicity, SES, and insurance.

TI  - Comparing sterile male releases and other methods for integrated control of the tiger mosquito in temperate and tropical climates
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of mosquito species worldwide is creating a powerful network for the spread of arboviruses. In addition to the destruction of breeding sites (prevention) and mass trapping, methods based on the sterile insect technique (SIT), the autodissemination of pyriproxyfen (ADT), and a fusion of elements from both of these known as boosted SIT (BSIT), are being developed to meet the urgent need for effective vector control. However, the comparative potential of these methods has yet to be explored in different environments. This is needed to propose and integrate informed guidelines into sustainable mosquito management plans. We extended a weather-dependent model of Aedes albopictus population dynamics to assess the effectiveness of these different vector control methods, alone or in combination, in a tropical (Reunion island, southwest Indian Ocean) and a temperate (Montpellier area, southern France) climate. Our results confirm the potential efficiency of SIT in temperate climates when performed early in the year (mid-March for northern hemisphere). In such a climate, the timing of the vector control action was the key factor in its success. In tropical climates, the potential of the combination of methods becomes more relevant. BSIT and the combination of ADT with SIT were twice as effective compared to the use of SIT alone.

TI  - 'Cultural Revolution' of Early 1920s as a Technology for Soviet Mentality Formation
T2  - EMINAK
M3  - Article
AB  - The change of social and cultural environment by the Bolshevik regime in Ukraine in the early 1920s and the formation of the Soviet mentality are studied in the paper. Getting rid of the psychology of the social and cultural worldview model imposed by the Bilshovyk `ideological managers', which is even nowadays supported by post-communist ideologues both inside and outside this country, is essential not only for establishing real democratic political institutions, economic growth, integration into European and world community, but also for the existence of statehood. The goal of the paper is to reveal the ideological methods and techniques used by the Bilshovyk power in the early 1920s in order to create a new worldview as well as a new social and cultural environment in order to rule the society's life.It is proved that in Ukraine in the early 1920s, Bilshovyk ideology replaced traditional notions and imposed new ones, whereas the struggle against dissenting views was conducted by applying red terror, distortion of facts, and outright manipulation. In particular, the belief in paradise was replaced by the belief in communism in order to deprive the population of reality for the sake of illusory happiness in the future. At the same time, the idea of Christian equality was understood as everybody's poverty. The notion `working class' was replaced by the `proletariat', as the latter was easier to manipulate, making people fanatical supporters. The communist worldview was also implanted in the ideas of international education, and such thinking is, as a rule, indifferent to national and state interests. It should be noted that personally, the communist leaders lived a luxurious life, had huge collections, palaces, millions of wealth in American and European banks, and their descendants still live in the United States and European countries. Therefore, it gives rise to doubt about the `ideology' of the Bilshovyk leaders, their `devotion' to the world revolution, the proletariat, communism, and so on. It was a matter of plundering the country on an unprecedented scale, and it was not enough just to seize political power and run the security forces. It was necessary to change the worldview of the population, its mentality, which was characterized by: irresponsibility, fear, vulnerability to government officials, bureaucracy, inertia, unwillingness to work, underestimation of labor costs, ignorance of personal constitutional rights, and misunderstanding that the state exists for people and officials got salaries from taxes. And this is exactly what the current generation of Ukrainians should think about.

TI  - The Inner Solar System Chronology (ISOCHRON) Lunar Sample Return Mission Concept: Revealing Two Billion Years of History
T2  - PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the Inner SOlar System CHRONology (ISOCHRON) concept to return samples of the youngest extensive mare basalt for age-dating and geochemical analysis. The young basalt is exposed at a site southwest of Aristarchus Plateau, for which complete remote-sensing data are available for thorough landing site analysis. Data from these samples would revolutionize the ability to assign exposure ages to rocky planetary surfaces based on the samples returned by Apollo and Luna. Their petrology and geochemistry will enable assessment of the most recent voluminous lunar magmatism. Regolith evolution and mixing models such as ballistic sedimentation would be directly testable to provide crucial ground truth that would enhance the science value of current and future remotely sensed data sets. ISOCHRON's science goals support NASA's Artemis program to return to the Moon and its related robotic programs currently in planning.

TI  - Estimating ambiguity fixed satellite orbit, integer clock and daily bias products for GPS L1/L2, L1/L5 and Galileo E1/E5a, E1/E5b signals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambiguity resolution of a single receiver is becoming more and more popular for precise GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) applications. To serve such an approach, dedicated satellite orbit, clock and bias products are needed. However, we need to be sure whether products based on specific frequencies and signals can be used when processing measurements of other frequencies and signals. For instance, for Galileo E5a frequency, some receivers track only the pilot signal (C5Q) while some track only the pilot-data signal (C5X). We cannot compute the differences between C5Q and C5X directly since these two signals are not tracked concurrently by any common receiver. As code measurements contribute equally as phase in the Melbourne-Wuebbena (MelWub) linear combination it is important to investigate whether C5Q and C5X can be mixed in a network to compute a common satellite MelWub bias product. By forming two network clusters tracking Q and X signals, respectively, we confirm that GPS C5Q and C5X signals cannot be mixed together. Because the bias differences between GPS C5Q and C5X can be more than half of one wide-lane cycle. Whereas, mixing of C5Q and C5X signals for Galileo satellites is possible. The RMS of satellite MelWub bias differences between Q and X cluster is about 0.01 wide-lane cycles for both E1/E5a and E1/E5b frequencies. Furthermore, we develop procedures to compute satellite integer clock and narrow-lane bias products using individual dual-frequency types. Same as the finding from previous studies, GPS satellite clock differences between L1/L2 and L1/L5 estimates exist and show a periodical behavior, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.7 ns after removing the daily mean difference of each satellite. For Galileo satellites, the maximum clock difference between E1/E5a and E1/E5b estimates after removing the mean value is 0.04 ns and the mean RMS of differences is 0.015 ns. This is at the same level as the noise of the carrier phase measurement in the ionosphere-free linear combination. Finally, we introduce all the estimated GPS and Galileo satellite products into PPP-AR (precise point positioning, ambiguity resolution) and Sentinel-3A satellite orbit determination. Ambiguity fixed solutions show clear improvement over float solutions. The repeatability of five ground-station coordinates show an improvement of more than 30% in the east direction when using both GPS and Galileo products. The Sentinel-3A satellite tracks only GPS L1/L2 measurements. The standard deviation (STD) of satellite laser ranging (SLR) residuals is reduced by about 10% when fixing ambiguity parameters to integer values.

TI  - Modelling the productivity of Siberian larch forests from Landsat NDVI time series in fragmented forest stands of the Mongolian forest-steppe
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of the spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation productivity is important in the context of carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems from the atmosphere. The accessibility of the full archive of medium-resolution earth observation data for multiple decades dramatically improved the potential of remote sensing to support global climate change and terrestrial carbon cycle studies. We investigated a dense time series of multi-sensor Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data at the southern fringe of the boreal forests in the Mongolian forest-steppe with regard to the ability to capture the annual variability in radial stemwood increment and thus forest productivity. Forest productivity was assessed from dendrochronological series of Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) from 15 plots in forest patches of different ages and stand sizes. The results revealed a strong correlation between the maximum growing season NDVI of forest sites and tree ring width over an observation period of 20 years. This relationship was independent of the forest stand size and of the landscape's forest-to-grassland ratio. We conclude from the consistent findings of our case study that the maximum growing season NDVI can be used for retrospective modelling of forest productivity over larger areas. The usefulness of grassland NDVI as a proxy for forest NDVI to monitor forest productivity in semi-arid areas could only partially be confirmed. Spatial and temporal inconsistencies between forest and grassland NDVI are a consequence of different physiological and ecological vegetation properties. Due to coarse spatial resolution of available satellite data, previous studies were not able to account for small-scaled land-cover patches like fragmented forest in the forest-steppe. Landsat satellite-time series were able to separate those effects and thus may contribute to a better understanding of the impact of global climate change on natural ecosystems.

TI  - Top-of-Atmosphere Retrieval of Multiple Crop Traits Using Variational Heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes within a Hybrid Workflow
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In support of cropland monitoring, operational Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) data became available globally and can be explored for the retrieval of important crop traits. Based on a hybrid workflow, retrieval models for six essential biochemical and biophysical crop traits were developed for both S2 bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) L2A and S2 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) L1C data. A variational heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression (VHGPR) algorithm was trained with simulations generated by the combined leaf-canopy reflectance model PROSAILat the BOA scale and further combined with the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6SV) atmosphere model at the TOA scale. Established VHGPR models were then applied to S2 L1C and L2A reflectance data for mapping: leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), leaf water content (Cw), fractional vegetation coverage (FVC), leaf area index (LAI), and upscaled leaf biochemical compounds, i.e., LAI * Cab (laiCab) and LAI * Cw (laiCw). Estimated variables were validated using in situ reference data collected during the Munich-North-Isar field campaigns within growing seasons of maize and winter wheat in the years 2017 and 2018. For leaf biochemicals, retrieval from BOA reflectance slightly outperformed results from TOA reflectance, e.g., obtaining a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.5 mu g/cm2 (BOA) vs. 8 mu g/cm2 (TOA) in the case of Cab. For the majority of canopy-level variables, instead, estimation accuracy was higher when using TOA reflectance data, e.g., with an RMSE of 139 g/m2 (BOA) vs. 113 g/m2 (TOA) for laiCw. Derived maps were further compared against reference products obtained from the ESA Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) Biophysical Processor. Altogether, the consistency between L1C and L2A retrievals confirmed that crop traits can potentially be estimated directly from TOA reflectance data. Successful mapping of canopy-level crop traits including information about prediction confidence suggests that the models can be transferred over spatial and temporal scales and, therefore, can contribute to decision-making processes for cropland management.

TI  - Tree extraction and estimation of walnut structure parameters using airborne LiDAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of new tools based on remote sensing data in agriculture contributes to cost reduction, increased production, and greater profitability. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data show a significant potential for geometrically characterizing tree plantations. This study aims to develop a methodology to extract walnut (Juglans regia L.) crowns under leafless conditions using airborne LiDAR data. An original approach based on the alpha-shape algorithm, identification of local maxima, and k-means algorithms is developed to extract the crowns of walnut trees in a plot located in Viver (Eastern Spain) with 192 trees. In addition, stem diameter and volume, crown diameter, total height, and crown height were estimated from cloud metrics and other 2D parameters such as crown area, and diameter derived from LiDAR data. A correct identification was made of 178 trees (92.7%). For structure parameters, the most accurate results were obtained for crown diameter, stem diameter, and stem volume with coefficient of determination values (R-2) equal to 0.95, 0.87 and 0.83; and RMSE values of 0.43 m (5.70%), 0.02 m (9.35%) and 0.016 m(3) (21.55%), respectively. The models that gave the lowest R-2 values were 0.69 for total height and 0.70 for crown height, with RMSE values of 0.84 m (12.4%) and 0.83 m (14.5%), respectively. A suitable definition of the central and lower parts of tree canopies was observed. Results of this study generate valuable information, which can be applied for improving the management of walnut plantations.

TI  - Coinfection With SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A(H1N1) in a Patient Seen at an Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Site in Egypt: Case Report
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Egypt started in 2000 at 8 sentinel sites geographically distributed all over the country. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was added to the panel of viral testing by polymerase chain reaction for the first 2 patients with ILI seen at one of the sentinel sites. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus co-infection with mild symptoms detected through routine ILI surveillance in Egypt.Objective: This report aims to describe how the case was identified and the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patient.Methods: The case was identified by Central Public Health Laboratory staff, who contacted the ILI sentinel surveillance officer at the Ministry of Health. The case patient was contacted through a telephone call. Detailed information about the patient's clinical picture, course of disease, and outcome was obtained. The contacts of the patient were investigated for acute respiratory symptoms, disease confirmation, and outcomes.Results: Among 510 specimens collected from patients with ILI symptoms from October 2019 to August 2020, 61 (12.0%) were COVID-19-positive and 29 (5.7%) tested positive for influenza, including 15 (51.7%) A(H1N1), 11 (38.0%) A(H3N2), and 3 (10.3%) influenza B specimens. A 21-year-old woman was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus coinfection. She had a high fever of 40.2 degrees C and mild respiratory symptoms that resolved within 2 days with symptomatic treatment. All five of her family contacts had mild respiratory symptoms 2-3 days after exposure to the confirmed case, and their symptoms resolved without treatment or investigation.Conclusions: This case highlights the possible occurrence of SARS-CoV-2/influenza A(H1N1) coinfection in younger and healthy people, who may resolve the infection rapidly. We emphasize the usefulness of the surveillance system for detection of viral causative agents of ILI and recommend broadening of the testing panel, especially if it can guide case management.

TI  - Challenges in Reconciling Satellite-Based and Locally Reported Estimates of Wetland Change: A Case of Topographically Constrained Wetlands on the Eastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coupling of rapid warming and wetland degradation on the Tibetan Plateau has motivated studies of climate influence on wetland change in the region. These studies typically examine large, topographically homogeneous regions, whereas conservation efforts sometimes require fine-grained information in rugged terrain. This study addresses topographically constrained wetlands on the Eastern Tibetan, where herders report significant wetland degradation. We used Landsat images to examine changes in wetland areas and Sentinel-1 SAR images to investigate water level and vegetation structure. We also analyzed trends in precipitation, growing season length, and reference evapotranspiration in weather station records. Snow cover and the vegetation growing season were quantified using MODIS observations. We analyzed estimates of actual evapotranspiration using the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse model (ALEXI) and the Simplified Surface Energy Balance model (SSEBop). Satellite-informed analyses failed to confirm herders' accounts of reduced wetland function, as no coherent trends were found in wetland area, water content, or vegetation structure. An analysis of meteorological records did indicate a warming-induced increase in reference evapotranspiration, and both meteorological records and satellites suggest that the growing season had lengthened, potentially increasing water demand and driving wetland change. The discrepancies between the satellite data and local observations pointed to temporal, spatial, and epistemological gaps in combining scientific data with empirical evidence in understanding wetland change on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Characterising industrial thermal plumes in coastal regions using 3-D numerical simulations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal power stations use sea water as a coolant, releasing it back into coastal environments at a higher-than-ambient temperature. Due to the possible ecological impacts on sensitive coastal zones, thermal plume formed by warmer coolant waters needs to be monitored, which is typically done through field campaigns. This paper assesses the use of simulations and remotely sensed observations as complimentary methods to characterise plume behaviour for a chosen coastal power station located within an inter-tidal embayment. Simulations of the thermal plume for two main tide phases and associated sea current conditions are validated against the high-resolution satellite observations. Simulated plume temperatures are higher than the observed values, with the biggest difference of 2 degrees C. The direction of the simulated plume dispersion is in agreement with observations and depends on the strength and direction of sea currents associated with the phase of the tide. The plume stretches most at the surface with limited impact on the benthic temperatures.

TI  - Region-by-Region Registration Combining Feature-Based and Optical Flow Methods for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While geometric registration has been studied in remote sensing community for many decades, successful cases are rare, which register images allowing for local inconsistency deformation caused by topographic relief. Toward this end, a region-by-region registration combining the feature-based and optical flow methods is proposed. The proposed framework establishes on the calculation of pixel-wise displacement and mosaic of displacement fields. Concretely, the initial displacement fields for a pair of images are calculated by the block-weighted projective model and Brox optical flow estimation, respectively in the flat- and complex-terrain regions. The abnormal displacements resulting from the sensitivity of optical flow in the land use or land cover changes, are adaptively detected and corrected by the weighted Taylor expansion. Subsequently, the displacement fields are mosaicked seamlessly for subsequent steps. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms comparative algorithms, achieving the highest registration accuracy qualitatively and quantitatively.

TI  - Rice-Yield Prediction with Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data and 3D CNN: A Case Study in Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation is a major issue of crop monitoring which remains particularly challenging in developing countries due to the problem of timely and adequate data availability. Whereas traditional agricultural systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freely available multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent tools to support these vulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and estimating crop yields before harvest. In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation. Thirdly, we study the effect of considering different temporal, climate and soil data configurations in terms of the performance achieved by the proposed approach and several state-of-the-art regression and CNN-based yield estimation methods. The extensive experiments conducted in this work demonstrate the suitability of the proposed CNN-based framework for rice crop yield estimation in the developing country of Nepal using S2 data.

TI  - Retrieval of Volcanic Ash Parameters from Satellite Data
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for retrieving volcanic ash parameters from satellite data is presented. The fundamental difference between the presented methodology and classical algorithms for the retrieval of volcanic ash parameters is the simultaneous use of various optical models of volcanic clouds. The models contain information not only about volcanic rocks (andesite or basalt) but also about their combinations with water drops and the aqueous solution of sulfuric acid. The volcanic ash parameters are determined by the characteristics of solar radiation reflected from a volcanic cloud and the cloud's self-radiation in the infrared atmospheric window. The volcanic ash parameters are retrieved according to the Meteosat-9 SEVIRI satellite radiometer for the case of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano eruption (Iceland, May 2010). The results are compared with data of aircraft lidar measurements and show a good qualitative and quantitative agreement.

TI  - Dermoscopic Features as Predictors of <i>BRAF</i> Mutational Status and Sentinel Lymph Node Positivity in Primary Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - DERMATOLOGY PRACTICAL & CONCEPTUAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Dermoscopy is a diagnostic tool widely used in clinical practice for the detection of skin tumors, especially early stages of melanoma. Recent studies have shown that different dermoscopic features are associated with important prognostic parameters of melanoma, such as BRAF mutational status and sentinel lymph node status. More than half of all melanomas harbor a mutation in the BRAF oncogene. The current management of advanced-stage melanomas is greatly determined by the presence or absence of a mutation in this gene, as targeted therapy with BRAF kinase inhibitors is one of the first therapeutic choices for these patients. Sentinel lymph node status is one of the most significant predictors of a melanoma patient's survival. Recent studies have shown that different dermoscopic patterns are also associated with sentinel lymph node status. This short article reviews studies that investigated correlations between dermoscopic features, BRAF mutation status and sentinel lymph node status.

TI  - Predictive mapping to identify refuges for plant communities threatened by earthworm invasion
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasions by cryptic ecosystem engineers can alter the ecological and socio-economic values of ecosystems in ways that may take decades to detect. The invasion of North American glacial refuges by non-native earthworms offers a prominent but understudied example of a cryptic invasion. Non-native earthworms are known to alter carbon sequestration, disrupt mycorrhizal networks and homogenize plant communities, but natural resource managers still lack robust protocols to identify and safeguard high conservation value communities (HCVCs) from such invasions. In the absence of such protocols, or reliable methods to eradicate non-native earthworm populations once established, there is an urgent need for methods to identify HCVCs at risk of or potentially shielded from earthworm invasion by the existence of abiotic barriers to their dispersal or persistence in such sites. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) using in situ field surveys and remotely sensed data to (1) identify factors limiting the occurrence of non-native Lumbricus earthworms in imperilled coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest and Garry oak (Quercus garryana) and maritime meadow ecosystems endemic to glacial refugia of the Pacific Northwest of North America and to (2) evaluate their influence on plant species diversity and identify abiotic factors capable of preventing their dispersal or persistence at a site. As predicted, shallow, drier soils and steeper terrain limited earthworm occurrence and abundance in our highly heterogeneous study area, and earthworm presence appeared to reduce plant species richness. Our results indicated that HCVCs endemic to shallow-soil (< 12 +/- 3 cm) sites that experience regular summer drought appear to act as refuges from invasion by non-native earthworms. Our results also elevate concerns for the conservation of deep-soil habitats not isolated from earthworm invasions by shallow soil, saltwater or other barriers to earthworm dispersal. The SDMs developed here offer guidance to the identification of potential refuges for the conservation of imperilled native species and communities from the detrimental effects non-native earthworms in glacial refugia of western North America and should thereby facilitate proactive planning by conservation practitioners.

M3  - Article
AB  - ZusammenfassungEinleitung Die COVID-19-Pandemie stellt weltweit die Gesundheitssysteme vor eine in ihrem Ausma ss nicht zu erahnende Herausforderung. Diese Online-Umfrage erfasste die Auswirkungen der COVID-19-Pandemie auf die Leistungszahlen der Nuklearmedizin in Deutschland im Jahresvergleich 2020 zu 2019.Materialien und Methoden Ein webbasierter Fragebogen wurde entwickelt, um die Leistungszahlen 2020 und insbesondere die Veranderungen im Jahresvergleich zu 2019 zu erfassen. Abgefragt wurden die Veranderungen in der nuklearmedizinischen Diagnostik und Therapie sowie inwieweit die Handlungsempfehlungen Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2" umgesetzt wurden.Ergebnisse 91 vollstandige Antworten wurden erfasst und ausgewertet, was rund 20% aller deutschen nuklearmedizinischen Einrichtungen entspricht. In der Diagnostik zeigte sich im Vergleich zu 2019 eine Abnahme der Szintigrafien der Schilddruse (15,9%), der Knochen (8,8%), der Lunge (7,6%), der Sentinel-Lymphknoten (5,5%) und des Myokards (1,4%) bei geringem Anstieg der PET/CT-Untersuchungen (1,2%). Bei den nuklearmedizinischen Therapien war die Reduktion bei den benignen Erkrankungen am hochsten (benigne Schilddruse 13,3%, RSO 7,7%), wahrend die Veranderungen zu 2019 bei den malignen Indikationen weniger ausgepragt waren (PRRT +2,2%, PSMA +7,4%, SIRT -5,9% und RJT bei Schilddrusenkarzinom -2,4%). Die Handlungsempfehlungen der DGN wurden zu 90% ganz oder teilweise angewendet.Schlussfolgerungen Die initial deutliche Reduktion der nuklearmedizinischen Leistungen in den ersten 3 Wochen der COVID-19-Pandemie hat sich im weiteren Verlauf nicht fortgesetzt, ein Nachholen der nicht durchgefuhrten Untersuchungen hat allerdings nicht stattgefunden. Besonders schwerwiegend war der Ruckgang bei Diagnostik und Therapie der benignen Erkrankungen.AbstractIntroduction The COVID-19 pandemic imposed an unimaginable challenge to the healthcare systems worldwide. This online survey captured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nuclear medicine services in Germany comparing 2020 to 2019.Materials and Methods A web-based questionnaire was developed to record the 2020 numbers of nuclear medicine procedures and, in particular, the change compared with 2019. The changes in nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy were queried, as well as the extent to which "Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2" recommendations provided by the DGN were implemented.Results 91 complete responses were recorded and evaluated. This corresponds to about 20% of all German nuclear medicine facilities. Nuclear medicine diagnostic tests showed a decrease in scintigraphies for thyroid (15.9%), bone (8.8%), lung (7.6%), sentinel lymph nodes (5.5%), and myocardium (1.4%) with small increases in PET/CT examinations (1.2%) compared with 2019. Among nuclear medicine therapies, reductions were highest for benign indications (benign thyroid 13.3%, RSO 7.7%), while changes from 2019 were less pronounced for malignant indications (PRRT: +2.2%, PSMA: +7.4%, SIRT: -5.9%, and RJT for thyroid carcinoma -2.4%). The DGN recommendations for action were fully or partially applied in 90%.Conclusions The initial significant reduction in nuclear medicine procedures in the first three weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic did not continue, but there was no compensation of the previously not performed services. The decrease in diagnostics and therapy procedures of benign diseases was particularly severe.

TI  - Characteristics of Atmospheric Rivers over the East Asia in Middle Summers from 2001 to 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are narrow and elongated water vapor belts in troposphere with meridional transport across the mid-latitudes towards high-latitudes. Compared with ARs occurred over the northeastern Pacific, the western coast of North America and Europe, the ARs over the East Asia have received less attention. In this paper, the characteristics of ARs which affected China in the area 20 degrees-60 degrees N, 95 degrees-165 degrees E in the middle summer season from 2001 to 2016 were investigated by using European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis data and Multi-functional Transport Satellites-1R (MTSAT-1R) infrared data. Totally, 134 ARs occurred during that period, and averagely 8.4 ARs occurred per year. Statistically, 101 ARs were in east-west orientation, and 33 ARs were in north-south orientation, which accounts for about 75% and 25%, respectively. Herein we report the occurrence number, duration time, intensity, length, width, ratio of length to width, and extension orientation of these ARs, which provide the basic information for those who have interest in ARs over the East Asia.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Sprawl Using Time-Series Data: Famagusta Region of Northern Cyprus
T2  - SAGE OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring urban sprawl is a controversial topic among scholars. Many studies have tried to employ various methods for monitoring urban sprawl in cases of North American and Northern and Western European cities. Although numerous methods have been applied with great success in various developed countries, they are predominantly impractical for cases of developing Mediterranean European cities that lack reliable census data. Besides, the complexity of the methods made them difficult to perform in underfunded situations. Therefore, this study aims to develop a new multidimensional method that researchers and planners can apply readily in developing Mediterranean European cities. The new method was tested in the Famagusta region of Northern Cyprus, which has been experiencing unplanned growth for the past half-century. In support of this proposal, a detailed review of the existing literature is presented with an emphasis on urban sprawl characteristics. Four characteristics were chosen to monitor urban sprawl's development in the Famagusta region. The method was structured based on a time-series (2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016) dataset that used remote sensing data and geographical information systems to monitor the urban sprawl. Based on the findings, the Famagusta region experienced rapid growth during the last 15 years. The lack of a masterplan resulted in the uncontrolled expansion of the city in the exurban areas. The development configuration was polycentric and linear in form with single-use composition. Together, the expansion and configuration manifested as more built-up area, scattered development, and increased automobile dependency.

TI  - A Synergic Integration of AIS Data and SAR Imagery to Monitor Fisheries and Detect Suspicious Activities
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maritime traffic and fishing activities have accelerated considerably over the last decade, with a consequent impact on the environment and marine resources. Meanwhile, a growing number of ship-reporting technologies and remote-sensing systems are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to large-scale vessels and their movements. Individual technologies have distinct limitations but, when combined, can provide a better view of what is happening at sea, lead to effectively monitor fishing activities, and help tackle the investigations of suspicious behaviors in close proximity of managed areas. The paper integrates non-cooperative Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 images and cooperative Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, by proposing two types of associations: (i) point-to-point and (ii) point-to-line. They allow the fusion of ship positions and highlight "suspicious" AIS data gaps in close proximity of managed areas that can be further investigated only once the vessel-and the gear it adopts-is known. This is addressed by a machine-learning approach based on the Fast Fourier Transform that classifies single sea trips. The approach is tested on a case study in the central Adriatic Sea, automatically reporting AIS-SAR associations and seeking ships that are not broadcasting their positions (intentionally or not). Results allow the discrimination of collaborative and non-collaborative ships, playing a key role in detecting potential suspect behaviors especially in close proximity of managed areas.

TI  - When the COVID-19 Pandemic Surges during Influenza Season: Lessons Learnt from the Sentinel Laboratory-Based Surveillance of Influenza-Like Illness in Lombardy during the 2019-2020 Season
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper outlines the role of Lombardy's regional influenza reference laboratory (Northern Italy) in the surveillance of influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 circulation by analyzing 631 consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) collected from ILI outpatients by sentinel physicians during the 2019-2020 season. The samples were tested by specific real-time RT-PCRs targeting SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and RSVs. Results: Of these NPSs, 31% tested positive for influenza viruses, 10% for SARS-CoV-2, and 7% for RSV. No coinfections were detected. Influenza viruses and RSVs circulated throughout the surveillance period until the end of February (week 9-2020), when they suddenly ceased to circulate seven weeks earlier than during the previous five influenza seasons. After the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in our ILI outpatients at the beginning of March (week 10-2020), SARS-CoV-2 remained the only virus identified throughout the surveillance period. Patients >= 65 years had a 3.2-fold greater risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, while school-age children (5-14 years) and children < 5 years proved to be the age groups most at risk of contracting influenza viruses and RSV, respectively. Our experience demonstrates that laboratory-based ILI surveillance networks are essential for identifying SARS-CoV-2 cases that would otherwise remain undetected, in order to stop their spread within our communities.

TI  - Fine scale mapping of fractional tree canopy cover to support river basin management
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of water, regionally, nationally and globally will continue to be a priority and complex undertaking. In riverine systems, biotic components like flora and fauna play critical roles in filtering water so it is available for human use and consumption. Preservation of ecosystems and associated ecosystem functions is therefore vital. In highly regulated large river basins, natural ecosystems are often supported through provision of environmental flows. Flow delivery, however, should be underpinned by rigorous monitoring to identify and prioritise biotic water requirements. Currently, large-scale monitoring solutions are scaled from remote sensing data via measurement of field evapotranspiration for woody tree vegetation species. However, as there is generally a mismatch between field data collection area and remote sensing pixel size, new methods are required to proportion tree evapotranspiration based on tree fractional canopy area per pixel. We present a novel method to derive tree fractional canopy cover (FTCC) at 20 m resolution in semi-arid and arid floodplain areas. The method employs LiDAR as a canopy area field measurement proxy (10 m resolution). We used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (radar and multispectral imagery) in a Random Forest analysis, undertaken to develop a predictive FTCC model trained using LiDAR for two regions in the Murray-Darling Basin. A predictor model combining the results of both regions was able to explain between 71%-85% of FTCC variation when compared to LiDAR FTCC when output in 10% increments. Development of this method underpins the advancement of woody vegetation monitoring to inform environmental flow management in the Murray-Darling Basin. The method and fine scale outputs will also be of value to other catchment management concerns such as altered catchment water yields related to bushfires and as such has application to water management worldwide.

TI  - Statistically Determining the Spatial Extent of Relativistic Electron Precipitation Events Using 2-s Polar-Orbiting Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Relativistic electron precipitation (REP) from the outer radiation belt into Earth's atmosphere poses risks for satellites and affects Earth's climate, producing ozone-destroying compounds. Characterizing the spatial extent of REP events, which are periods of precipitation localized in space and time, is important for quantifying these effects and improving understanding of outer radiation belt dynamics, allowing quantification of the relative roles of atmospheric and magnetopause particle loss. Following Shekhar et al. (2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024716), who used 16 s resolution data from particle detectors onboard NOAA's Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) and the ESA's Meterological Operational (MetOp) Satellites, we work to more precisely determine the spatial extent of REP events using higher-resolution (2 s) data from the same instruments. We algorithmically search through 6 years of data (October 2012 to December 2018) from a maximum of seven simultaneously orbiting satellites, identifying REP events and determining their start and end times and locations. We find that the majority of events are highly localized spatially and, unlike Shekhar et al. (2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024716), we do not observe a cluster of broad events around midnight magnetic local time (MLT). Based on case studies, we suggest that this discrepancy results from the differences in data resolution, indicating that the broad regions of precipitation around midnight MLT identified by Shekhar et al. (2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JA024716) may be composed of several adjacent but narrowly confined regions of precipitation, potentially with independent causes. Additional work is necessary to further classify events and identify their likely mechanisms.

T2  - ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground subsidence is an emerging geological hazard in Baotou, Inner Mongolia. Four areas of Baotou with relatively large subsidence range and rate were selected for analysis. Focusing on investigation of ground subsidence using PS-InSAR technology, a total of 43 frames of ALOS PALSAR images yielded a SAR data span from December 2006 to January 2011, allowing ground subsidence scope, subsidence velocity, time-series deformation to be obtained. Major causes and influencing factors of the ground subsidence are closely related to soft soil consolidation and compaction and the decrease in the level of groundwater caused by increased development and utilization of groundwater.

TI  - Detecting geothermal anomalies using Landsat 8 thermal infrared remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential to map geothermal anomalies using remote sensing information has attracted recently much research, reflecting thus the increasing interest for renewable energy resources. Aim of the present work is to highlight areas with geothermal anomalies, as demonstrated by increased Land Surface Temperature (LST) values, that could potentially indicate possible locations for geothermal field development. We hypothesized that an area with increased geothermal potential can possibly have a surface expression through increased LST, that discriminates it from other areas of low geothermal interest. LST is known to be affected by increased heat flow but also from other parameters such as altitude, land cover and meteorological conditions. Therefore, there is need to develop a methodology capable to extract LST signals corresponding to the geothermal component. To delineate areas with constantly higher LST values from surrounding locations, we analyzed Landsat 8 derived LST time series, and accounted for different land cover types and altitudes. To test our hypothesis, we used a well-known geothermal field in Aristino-Alexandroupolis, NE Greece, where it was shown that spatial means of winter LST were significantly greater within geothermal zones. Furthermore, our results indicated that areas within geothermal fields demonstrate winter LST values greater than a certain threshold value for each different land cover type. Therefore, we developed a logical operator algorithm and applied our methodology to Thrace basin - NE Greece. The produced geothermal potential map depicted correctly spot areas, which make part of the known geothermal fields in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace Tertiary sedimentary basins, but also indicated other possible sites with increased potential for future research.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI Data for Land Cover/Use Classification Using a Comparison between Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of remote sensing algorithms and increased access to satellite data, generating up-to-date, accurate land use/land cover (LULC) maps has become increasingly feasible for evaluating and managing changes in land cover as created by changes to ecosystem and land use. The main objective of our study is to evaluate the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Minimum Distance (MD), and Mahalanobis (MH) algorithms and compare them in order to generate a LULC map using data from Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 satellites. Further, we also investigate the effect of a penalty parameter on SVM results. Our study uses different kernel functions and hidden layers for SVM and ANN algorithms, respectively. We generated the training and validation datasets from Google Earth images and GPS data prior to pre-processing satellite data. In the next phase, we classified the images using training data and algorithms. Ultimately, to evaluate outcomes, we used the validation data to generate a confusion matrix of the classified images. Our results showed that with optimal tuning parameters, the SVM classifier yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 94%, performing better for both satellite data compared to other methods. In addition, for our scenes, Sentinel 2 date was slightly more accurate compared to Landsat 8. The parametric algorithms MD and MLC provided the lowest accuracy of 80.85% and 74.68% for the data from Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8. In contrast, our evaluation using the SVM tuning parameters showed that the linear kernel with the penalty parameter 150 for Sentinel 2 and the penalty parameter 200 for Landsat 8 yielded the highest accuracies. Further, ANN classification showed that increasing the hidden layers drastically reduces classification accuracy for both datasets, reducing zero for three hidden layers.

TI  - Evaluation of Late Postural Complications in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Breast-Conserving Therapy in Relation to the Type of Axillary Intervention-Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate posture in patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) in relation to the type of surgical intervention to the axilla. Methods: The study was conducted on patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgical treatment for breast cancer 5-6 years earlier. In 54 patients, BCT+ALND (axillary lymph node dissection) was performed, while 63 patients were subjected to BCT+SLND (sentinel lymph node dissection). The control group consisted of 54 females. The study was conducted using digital postural assessment. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed with respect to the parameters between the BCT+SLNB and BCT+ALND groups (p > 0.05). However, the differences were highly significant between the CG (control group) and the studied groups (BCT+ALND, BCT+SLNB) for the following parameters: BETA angle of thoracolumbar spine inclination (p = 0.002), GAMMA angle of thoracic spine inclination (p = 0.0044), TKA (thoracic kyphosis angle) (p < 0.0001) and shoulder level inclination (p = 0.0004). The BCT+ALND patients were characterized by higher dependency of raised shoulder (p = 0.0028) and inferior angle of the scapula (p = 0.00018) on the operated side compared to BCT+SLNB patients. Conclusions: Postural imbalance occurs independent of the type of axillary intervention. Disturbances within the upper torso (abnormal position of shoulders and inferior angles of scapulae) are more pronounced in patients after ALND.

TI  - TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> in the United States: A Detailed Look at the Annual Averages, Weekly Cycles, Effects of Temperature, and Correlation With Surface NO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing the spatial heterogeneities of NO2 air pollution is an important first step in quantifying NOX emissions and exposures. This study investigates the capabilities of the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) in observing the spatial and temporal patterns of NO2 pollution in the continental United States. The unprecedented sensitivity of the sensor can differentiate the fine-scale spatial heterogeneities in urban areas, such as emissions related to airport/shipping operations and high traffic, and the relatively small emission sources in rural areas, such as power plants and mining operations. We then examine NO2 columns by day-of-the-week and find that Saturday and Sunday concentrations are 16% and 24% lower respectively, than during weekdays. We also analyze the correlation of daily maximum 2-m temperatures and NO2 column amounts and find that NO2 is larger on the hottest days (>32 degrees C) as compared to warm days (26 degrees C-32 degrees C), which is in contrast to a general decrease in NO2 with increasing temperature at moderate temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that a linear regression fit of 2019 annual TROPOMI NO2 data to annual surface-level concentrations yields relatively strong correlation (R-2 = 0.66). These new developments make TROPOMI NO2 satellite data advantageous for policymakers and public health officials, who request information at high spatial resolution and short timescales, in order to assess, devise, and evaluate regulations.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) as a Proxy for Air Temperature and Thermal Comfort at a Small Geographical Scale
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) and Urban Cool Islands (UCIs) can be measured by means of in situ measurements and interpolation methods, which often require densely distributed networks of sensors and can be time-consuming, expensive and in many cases infeasible. The use of satellite data to estimate Land Surface Temperature (LST) and spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has emerged in the last decade as a promising technique to map Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHIs), primarily at large geographical scales. Furthermore, thermal comfort, the subjective perception and experience of humans of micro-climates, is also an important component of UHIs. It remains unanswered whether LST can be used to predict thermal comfort. The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of remotely sensed data, including a derived LST, at a small geographical scale, in the case study of King Abdulaziz University (KAU) campus (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia) and four surrounding neighborhoods. We evaluate the potential use of LST estimates as proxy for air temperature (T-air) and thermal comfort. We estimate LST based on Landsat-8 measurements, T-air and other climatological parameters by means of in situ measurements and subjective thermal comfort by means of a Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) model. We find a significant correlation (r = 0.45, p < 0.001) between LST and mean T-air and the compatibility of LST and T-air as equivalent measures using Bland-Altman analysis. We evaluate several models with LST, NDVI, and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) as data inputs to proxy T-air and find that they achieve error rates across metrics that are two orders of magnitude below that of a comparison with LST and T-air alone. We also find that, using only remotely sensed data, including LST, NDVI, and NDBI, random forest classifiers can detect sites with "very hot" classification of thermal comfort nearly as effectively as estimates using in situ data, with one such model attaining an F1 score of 0.65. This study demonstrates the potential use of remotely sensed measurements to infer the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) and subjective thermal comfort at small geographical scales as well as the impacts of land cover and land use characteristics on UHI and UCI. Such insights are fundamental for sustainable urban planning and would contribute enormously to urban planning that considers people's well-being and comfort.

TI  - A convolutional neural network approach to predict non-permissive environments from moderate-resolution imagery
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with satellite imagery have been successfully used to generate measures of development indicators, such as poverty, in developing nations. This article explores a CNN-based approach leveraging Landsat 8 imagery to predict locations of conflict-related deaths. Using Nigeria as a case study, we use the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) dataset to identify locations of conflict events that did or did not result in a death. Imagery for each location is used as an input to train a CNN to distinguish fatal from non-fatal events. Using 2014 imagery, we are able to predict the result of conflict events in the following year (2015) with 80% accuracy. While our approach does not replace the need for causal studies into the drivers of conflict death, it provides a low-cost solution to prediction that requires only publicly available imagery to implement. Findings suggest that the information contained in moderate-resolution imagery can be used to predict the likelihood of a death due to conflict at a given location in Nigeria the following year, and that CNN-based methods of estimating development-related indicators may be effective in applications beyond those explored in the literature.

TI  - Carbonates in Irrigated Soils of the Caspian Depression
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the distribution and content of carbonates (CaCO3) in upper horizons of irrigated soils in the Sarpa Hollow of the Caspian Depression on the example of the Duboovrazhnyi irrigated land mass in Volgograd oblast. At the peak of irrigation activities (1985-1990), this area was used to cultivate forage grasses. Sprinkling irrigation techniques were used, the groundwater level remained satisfactory, and no secondary salinization foci were noted. The area currently belongs to a private farm that uses drip irrigation to cultivate cucurbits and vegetable crops. The groundwater level remains satisfactory, and secondary salinization occurs in individual soil horizons. Some fields within the irrigated land mass feature a spotty pattern that can be identified under winter grain crops both in field conditions and on satellite imagery. It is established that the spotty pattern is not related to soil salinization; instead, it is due to differences in the concentrations of carbonates in the surface soil layer. The combined use of remote sensing data and field-survey data collected for areas featuring different degrees of spottiness and spectral brightness in space images makes it possible to distinguish soils with different carbonate concentrations in the arable horizon, which is of utmost importance for their amelioration and reclamation.

TI  - Mapping the fractional coverage of the invasive shrub Ulex europaeus with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery utilizing UAV orthoimages and a new spatial optimization approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the occurrence patterns of invasive plant species and understanding their invasion dynamics is a crucial requirement for preventing further spread to so far unaffected regions. An established approach to map invasive species across large areas is based on the combination of satellite or aerial remote sensing data with ground truth data from fieldwork. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, also referred to as unmanned aerial systems (UAS)) may represent an interesting and low-cost alternative to labor-intensive fieldwork. Despite the increasing use of UAVs in the field of remote sensing in the last years, operational methods to combine UAV and satellite data are still sparse. Here, we present a new methodological framework to estimate the fractional coverage (FC%) of the invasive shrub species Ulex europaeus (common gorse) on Chiloe ' Island (south-central Chile), based on ultrahigh-resolution UAV images and a medium resolution intra-annual time-series of Sentinel-2. Our framework is based on three steps: 1) Land cover classification of the UAV orthoimages, 2) reduce the spatial shift between UAV-based land cover classification maps and Sentinel-2 imagery and 3) identify optimal satellite acquisition dates for estimating the actual distribution of Ulex europaeus.In Step 2 we translate the challenging co-registration task between two datasets with very different spatial resolutions into an (machine learning) optimization problem where the UAV-based land cover classification maps obtained in Step 1 are systematically shifted against the satellite images. Based on several Random Forest (RF) models, an optimal fit between varying land cover fractions and the spectral information of Sentinel-2 is identified to correct the spatial offset between both datasets.Considering the spatial shifts of the UAV orthoimages and using optimally timed Sentinel-2 acquisitions led to a significant improvement for the estimation of the current distribution of Ulex europaeus. Furthermore, we found that the Sentinel-2 acquisition from November (flowering time of Ulex europaeus) was particularly important in distinguishing Ulex europaeus from other plant species. Our mapping results could support local efforts in controlling Ulex europaeus. Furthermore, the proposed workflow should be transferable to other use cases where individual target species that are visually detectable in UAV imagery are considered. These findings confirm and underline the great potential of UAV-based groundtruth data for detecting invasive species.

TI  - The contribution of different permanent tooth types to untreated caries Implications for public health surveillance and prevention
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Untreated caries (UC), although highly prevalent, is largely preventable. Information on the contribution of different teeth to UC prevalence and severity could be helpful in evaluating UC surveillance protocols and the relative benefits of caries prevention interventions.Methods. The authors combined data from 3 cycles (2011-2016) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for participants aged 6 through 11 years, 12 through 19 years, 20 through 34 years, 35 through 49 years, 50 through 64 years, 65 through 74 years, and 75 years and older. For each age group the authors calculated the contribution of successive permanent tooth types (for example, first molars and second molars) to UC prevalence and severity.Results. UC prevalence and the percentage of prevalence detected by means of screening molars were, respectively, 5% and 95% among participants aged 6 through 11 years; 16% and 92% among participants aged 12 through 19 years; 29% and 86% among participants aged 20 through 34 years; 26% and 70% among participants aged 35 through 49 years; 21% and 48% among participants aged 50 through 64 years; 16% and 36% among participants aged 65 through 74 years; and 17% and 25% among participants 75 years and older. Among adults aged 50 years and older, no teeth appeared to capture a disproportionate share of UC prevalence. Molars accounted for 87%, 79%, and 56% of severity among participants aged 6 through 11 years, 12 through 19 years, and 20 through 34 years, respectively. After age 34 years, molars accounted for less than 50% of severity.Conclusions. Molars are the tooth type most susceptible to UC well into adulthood.Practical Implications. Molars could be used as sentinel teeth for surveillance of UC and adults could benefit from caries prevention that targets molars.

TI  - ME-Net: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Extracting Mangrove Using Sentinel-2A Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangroves play an important role in many aspects of ecosystem services. Mangroves should be accurately extracted from remote sensing imagery to dynamically map and monitor the mangrove distribution area. However, popular mangrove extraction methods, such as the object-oriented method, still have some defects for remote sensing imagery, such as being low-intelligence, time-consuming, and laborious. A pixel classification model inspired by deep learning technology was proposed to solve these problems. Three modules in the proposed model were designed to improve the model performance. A multiscale context embedding module was designed to extract multiscale context information. Location information was restored by the global attention module, and the boundary of the feature map was optimized by the boundary fitting unit. Remote sensing imagery and mangrove distribution ground truth labels obtained through visual interpretation were applied to build the dataset. Then, the dataset was used to train deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for extracting the mangrove. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted to prove the potential for mangrove extraction. We selected the Sentinel-2A remote sensing data acquired on 13 April 2018 in Hainan Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve in China to conduct a group of experiments. After processing, the data exhibited 2093 x 2214 pixels, and a mangrove extraction dataset was generated. The dataset was made from Sentinel-2A satellite, which includes five original bands, namely R, G, B, NIR, and SWIR-1, and six multispectral indices, namely normalization difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), forest discrimination index (FDI), wetland forest index (WFI), mangrove discrimination index (MDI), and the first principal component (PCA1). The dataset has a total of 6400 images. Experimental results based on datasets show that the overall accuracy of the trained mangrove extraction network reaches 97.48%. Our method benefits from CNN and achieves a more accurate intersection and union ratio than other machine learning and pixel classification methods by analysis. The designed model global attention module, multiscale context embedding, and boundary fitting unit are helpful for mangrove extraction.

TI  - The Response of Cloud-Precipitation Recycling in China to Global Warming
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud water is an important geophysical quantity that connects the hydrological and radiation characteristics of climate systems and plays an essential role in the global circulation of the atmosphere, water, and energy. However, compared to the contribution of water vapor to precipitation, the understanding of cloud-precipitation transformation and its climate feedback mechanism remains limited. Based on precipitation and temperature datasets of the National Meteorological Observatory and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite remote sensing products, the evolution characteristics of cloud water resources in China over the last twenty years of the 21st century were evaluated. Significant decreasing trends of -3.3 and -4.89 g/m(2) decade(-1) were found for both the liquid and ice water path. In humid areas with high precipitation, the cloud water path decreased fast. In semiarid areas with an annual precipitation ranging from 500-800 mm, the decreasing trend of the cloud water path was the lowest. The cloud-water period was calculated to represent the relative changes in clouds and precipitation. The national average cloud-water period in China is approximately 12.4 h, with obvious seasonal changes. Over the last 20 years, the cloud water path in dry regions decreased more slowly than that in wet regions, and the cloud-precipitation efficiency significantly increased, which narrowed the climate difference between the dry and wet regions. Finally, the mechanism of the cloud-water period evolution in the different regions were examined from the perspectives of the dynamic and thermal contributions, respectively. Due to the overall low upward moisture flux (UMF) in the dry region, the response of the cloud-water period to the lower tropospheric stability (LTS) mainly first increased and then decreased, which was the opposite in the wet region. The increase in cloud-precipitation efficiency in the dry region of Northwest China is accompanied by a continuous decrease in LTS. The different configurations of regional UMF and LTS play a crucial role in the evolution of cloud-precipitation, which can be used as a diagnostic basis to predict changes in the precipitation intensity to a certain extent.

TI  - Estimation of Photosynthetic and Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation Coverage in the Lower Reaches of Tarim River Based on Sentinel-2A Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the fractional coverage of the photosynthetic vegetation (f(PV)) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (f(NPV)) is essential for assessing the growth conditions of vegetation growth in arid areas and for monitoring environmental changes and desertification. The aim of this study was to estimate the f(PV), f(NPV) and the fractional coverage of the bare soil (f(BS)) in the lower reaches of Tarim River quantitatively. The study acquired field data during September 2020 for obtaining the f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS). Firstly, six photosynthetic vegetation indices (PVIs) and six non-photosynthetic vegetation indices (NPVIs) were calculated from Sentinel-2A image data. The PVIs include normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), reduced simple ratio index (RSR) and global environment monitoring index (GEMI). Meanwhile, normalized difference index (NDI), normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NDSVI), soil tillage index (STI), shortwave infrared ratio (SWIR32) and dead fuel index (DFI) constitutes the NPVIs. We then established linear regression model of different PVIs and f(PV), and NPVIs and f(NPV), respectively. Finally, we applied the GEMI-DFI model to analyze the spatial and seasonal variation of f(PV) and f(NPV) in the study area in 2020. The results showed that the GEMI and f(PV) revealed the best correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.59, while DFI and f(NPV) had the best correlation of R-2 = 0.45. The accuracy of f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS) based on the determined PVIs and NPVIs as calculated by GEMI-DFI model are 0.69, 0.58 and 0.43, respectively. The f(PV) and f(NPV) are consistent with the vegetation phonological development characteristics in the study area. The study concluded that the application of the GEMI-DFI model in the f(PV) and f(NPV) estimation was sufficiently significant for monitoring the spatial and seasonal variation of vegetation and its ecological functions in arid areas.

TI  - Change Detection in Landsat Images Using Unsupervised Learning and RBF-Based Clustering
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection is one of the extensively investigated problems in the field of remote sensing. Generally, it involves the analysis of multitemporal remote sensing images of the same sensor or different sensors. The nonnormalizable radiometric differences, which are added due to environmental interferences, could lead to increase the intra-class variability in multitemporal images, and hence, the change detection problem would be nonlinear. To cope with these issues, a novel unsupervised manifold learning based change detection technique is proposed, which discovers the nonlinear structure of data hidden in original space. The proposed framework consists of two processing stages. In the first stage, a novel orthogonal unsupervised discriminant projection (OUDP) based technique is proposed for feature extraction. The orthogonal basis vectors, obtained from OUDP, are able to provide discriminant features. In addition, in the second stage, a novel radial-basis function based clustering is presented, which yields the better clustering than the single clustering approach. Moreover, an extended kernel-weighted OUDP technique is also presented, which improves the performance of OUDP technique. Particularity of the proposed framework resides on following three things. First one is the creation of eigenvector space by using the nonoverlapping blocks of the image. Second one is the extraction of features by exploiting the local neighborhood information around each pixel, this generates clear or spot free change maps. The last one is the RBF stage of clustering technique, which greatly improves the classification of the unchanged and changed pixels. Experimental results on multispectral images of different sensors validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

T2  - ONKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma is an aggressive skin tumor of the elderly with neuroendocrine features. The pathogenesis is associated with chronic ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (generally older patients) and the Merkel cell polyomavirus (generally younger patients). The clinical presentation of Merkel cell carcinoma is nonspecific with a solitary, cutaneous or subcutaneous, red to bluish node, the diagnosis is made histologically. Due to early lymphoid metastasis, locoregional metastases are already present in approximately 30% of cases at the time of diagnosis. Local recurrences as well as regional and distant metastases usually appear within the first 2-3 years after initial diagnosis. After diagnosis, staging procedures should rule out metastases. Then complete surgical removal of the primary with wide safety margins as well as a sentinel lymph node biopsy is advised. Adjuvant radiation of the primary site should be performed. In case of a positive sentinel lymph node additional completion lymph node dissection and/or irradiation of the regional lymph node basin can be discussed. For systemic therapy of advanced Merkel cell carcinoma, PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) are standard due to their superior duration of response compared to chemotherapy. Ongoing studies are investigating the use of CPIs in the adjuvant setting and the use of CPIs with other drug combinations in the metastatic setting.

TI  - Glioblastoma Shortly after a Normal Conventional Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Report of Two Cases and Review of the Literature.
T2  - Asian journal of neurosurgery
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common malignant tumor of the brain. Most of these tumors are primary or de novo GBs that manifest rapidly with initial presentations such as headache, new-onset epileptic seizure, focal neurological deficits, and altered mental status. The typical radiological features of GB include strong contrast enhancement, central necrosis, and edema with mass effect. Herein, we describe two cases of primary GB - two women aged 60 and 51 years who were diagnosed with GB 3.5 and 4 months, respectively, after their initial admission. These patients presented with right-sided headaches, and their neurological examination was within the normal limits. Their initial radiological investigations revealed no suspicious lesions, either on T1-weighted or T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. The 60-year-old patient was readmitted with persistent headache, and her T1-weighted MR images revealed a well-demarcated mass lesion in the right temporal lobe with strong contrast enhancement. Moreover, the T2-weighted MR images revealed closed sulci and swollen midline structures because of edema. The 51-year-old patient was readmitted with persistent headache, and her MR image revealed a mass lesion with heterogeneous contrast enhancement and necrosis on T1-weighted images and hyperintense areas with severe edema on T2-weighted images. The patients underwent craniotomy and gross total tumor resection. Notably, in both cases, the lesions were pathologically diagnosed as GB. Therefore, it should be borne in mind that only persistent headache could be a sentinel sign of GB before it becomes radiologically visible, thereby emphasizing the need for follow-up imaging studies at short intervals.

AB  - Earthquake activities in and around the Korean Peninsula are relatively low in number and intensity compared with neighboring countries such as Japan and China. However, recent seismic activity caused great alarm and concern among citizens and government authorities, and uncovered the level of preparedness toward earthquake disasters. A survey has been conducted on 1256 participants to investigate the seismic literacy of Korean citizens, including seismic knowledge, awareness and management using a questionnaire of citizen earthquake literacy (CEL). The results declared that the citizens had low awareness and literacy, which means that they are not properly prepared for earthquake hazards. To develop an earthquake risk reduction plan and program efficiently and effectively, not only must it appropriately characterize the target audience, but also indicate high potential earthquake zones and potential earthquake damage. Therefore, this study mapped and analyzed the seismic vulnerability in southeast Korea using LogitBoost, logistic model tree (LMT), and logistic regression (LR) machine learning algorithms based on a building damage inventory map. The damaged buildings' locations were generated after the 2017 Pohang earthquake using the damage proxy map (DPM) method from the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. DPMs detected coherence loss, which indicates damaged buildings in urban areas in the Pohang earthquake and shows a good correlation with the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) report with modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) scale values of more than VII (seven). The damage locations were randomly divided into two datasets: 50% for training the vulnerability models and 50% for validating the models in terms of accuracy and reliability. Fifteen seismic-related factors were used to construct a model of each algorithm. Model validation based on the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was used to determine model accuracy. The AUC values of seismic vulnerability maps using the LogitBoost, LMT, and LR algorithms were 0.769, 0.851, and 0.749, respectively. We suggest that earthquake preparedness efforts should focus on reconstruction, retrofitting, renovation, and seismic education in areas with high seismic vulnerability in South Korea. The results of this study are expected to be beneficial for engineers and policymakers aiming at developing disaster risk reduction plans, policies, and programs due to future seismic activity in South Korea.

TI  - Evaluating and improving the sand storm numerical simulation performance in Northwestern China using WRF-Chem and remote sensing soil moisture data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to test the ability of the WRF-Chem model to simulate sand storms in Northwest China and improve the simulation results by introducing remote sensing soil moisture data into WRF-Chem. We conducted sensitivity tests, including parameterization scheme tests and soil moisture tests using WRF-Chem. By comparing various combinations of parameterization schemes, which have considerable impacts on sand emissions, the most suitable parameterization scheme for WRF-Chem to simulate sand storms in Northwest China was selected for establishing models in future research. Based on the optimal combination of parameterization schemes, the sensitivity of sand emissions to soil moisture was tested, indicating that soil moisture has a substantial influence on sand emissions and revealing a nonlinear relationship between sand emissions and soil moisture. Although sand simulations are sensitive to soil moisture, the sand emission volume does not always increase with decreasing soil moisture content. Moreover, the soil moisture content simulated by WRF-Chem is quite different from that observed by satellites. Therefore, we selected ten sand storms that occurred in Northwest China in 2009-2018, including weak, moderate and strong sand storms, to explore the responses of sand storms of different intensities to soil moisture. Some experiments were conducted in two scenarios: scenario A was simulated only by WRF-Chem, and scenario B was designed by replacing the initial soil moisture field in WRF-Chem with soil moisture satellite data from AMSR2 and AMSR-E. Comparing the simulation results with in-situ ground-based and satellite-based measurements indicates that WRF-Chem can capture strong sand storms and some moderate sand storms, but the ability to simulate weak sand storms needs to be greatly improved. After introducing remote sensing soil moisture data into WRF-Chem, the simulation of sand emissions becomes more accurate, substantially improving the simulation results. Among the ten simulated sand storms, the AOD (aerosol optical depth) and PM10 simulation accuracies are improved for five and seven sand storms, respectively. After this improvement, the AOD correlation coefficient can reach 0.63, and the PM10 correlation coefficient can reach 0.60.

TI  - Retrieval of Oceanic Total Precipitable Water Vapor and Cloud Liquid Water from <i>Fengyun-3D</i> Microwave Sounding Instruments
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite is the latest polar-orbiting meteorological satellite launched by China and carries 10 instruments onboard. Its microwave temperature sounder (MWTS) and microwave humidity sounder (MWHS) can acquire a total of 28 channels of brightness temperatures, providing rich information for profiling atmospheric temperature and moisture. However, due to a lack of two important frequencies at 23.8 and 31.4 GHz, it is difficult to retrieve the total precipitable water vapor (TPW) and cloud liquid water path (CLW) from FY-3D microwave sounder data as commonly done for other microwave sounding instruments. Using the channel similarity between Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) advanced technology microwave sounder (ATMS) and FY-3D microwave sounding instruments, a machine learning (ML) technique is used to generate the two missing low-frequency channels of MWTS and MWHS. Then, a new dataset named as combined microwave sounder (CMWS) is obtained, which has the same channel setting as ATMS but the spatial resolution is consistent with MWTS. A statistical inversion method is adopted to retrieve TPW and CLW over oceans from the FY-3D CMWS. The intercomparison between different satellites shows that the inversion products of FY-3D CMWS and Suomi NPP ATMS have good consistency in magnitude and distribution. The correlation coefficients of retrieved TPW and CLW between CMWS and ATMS can reach 0.95 and 0.85, respectively.

TI  - Monitoring scheme for early detection of coronavirus and other respiratory virus outbreaks
T2  - COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) began in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 exhibited efficient person-to-person transmission of what became labeled as COVID-19. It has spread worldwide with over 83,000,000 infected cases and more than 1,800,000 deaths to date (December 31, 2020). This research proposes a statistical monitoring scheme in which an optimized np control chart is utilized by sentinel metropolitan airports worldwide for early detection of coronavirus and other respiratory virus outbreaks. The sample size of this chart is optimized to ensure the best overall performance for detecting a wide range of shifts in the infection rate, based on the available resources, such as the inspection rate and the allowable false alarm rate. The effectiveness of the proposed optimized np chart is compared with that of the traditional np chart with a predetermined sample size under both sampling inspection and 100% inspection. For a variety of scenarios including a real case, the optimized np control chart is found to substantially outperform its traditional counterpart in terms of the average number of infections. Therefore, this control chart has potential to be an effective tool for early detection of respiratory virus outbreaks, promoting early outbreak investigation and mitigation.

AB  - To date, little has been shared of nurses' perception of their experiences after participating in faith-based, short-term medical mission trips. This qualitative research study, guided by Leininger's transcultural nursing theory and the Sunrise Model, explored this topic. The results illuminated seven themes and pointed to the importance of pretrip planning. The value for Christian nurses in engaging in international medical missions encompasses reflection and growth of one's worldview and experience in providing spiritual care cross-culturally.

TI  - Semiempirical Calibration of the WCM for Estimating Maize Biomass in Northeast China
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water cloud model (WCM) has been widely used to retrieve vegetation parameters, such as biomass and soil moisture. To address difficulties in the measurement of soil moisture data and inaccurate estimation of soil scattering in the original model, a semiempirical calibration of the WCM for maize biomass retrieval is proposed in this letter. In it, a change detection approach is used to estimate soil moisture and the effect of surface roughness, calculated from the polarization difference, is added to the soil layer scattering. By combining the two polarization retrieval results and setting the weight coefficient of the VV polarization to a value greater than that of the VH polarization, the optimal retrieval results for maize biomass are obtained for the study area. The accuracy of the calibration of the WCM is verified using the backscatter coefficients from Sentinel-1 data and ground-based maize biomass measurements. It is found that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) are 1.642 kg/m(2) and 0.803, respectively, between the calibration of the WCM results and the measurements. These results demonstrate the application potential of the C-band synthetic aperture radar data using the semiempirical calibration of the WCM for retrieving maize biomass over large-scale areas.

TI  - Ship Classification in Medium-Resolution SAR Images via Densely Connected Triplet CNNs Integrating Fisher Discrimination Regularized Metric Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thanks to the medium-to-high resolution and wide coverage imaging ability, satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems are momentously developed for intelligent maritime surveillance, especially for ship classification in SAR images. Previous researchers mostly utilized the geometric, radiometric, and structural features combined with the traditional machine-learning (ML) methods to conduct ship classification in high-resolution (HR) SAR images. However, the handcrafted features showed weak representation for the medium-resolution (MR) SAR images, and the normal ML methods are less powerful to deal with the intraclass diversity and interclass similarity in the MR SAR ship images. To address these issues, this article extends the dense convolutional networks to the MR SAR ship classification for better deep features extraction and proposes a multitask learning framework within which the softmax log-loss and the triplet loss are jointly minimized for more effective ship classification in MR SAR images. The triplet loss is computed by imposing a similarity constraint on the deep embeddings via the deep metric learning (DML) scheme such that the deep representations of the same class are pulled much closer to each other and those from different classes are pushed as farther apart as possible. However, the triplet loss in the usual DML utilizes the triplets mined in a training batch independently, which ignores the contextual information. So, we propose to impose a Fisher discrimination regularization term on the deep embeddings to explore the global information of learned embeddings, and hence the designed task-specific networks will be trained to have more robust and better recognition performance. Extensive experiments on the MR SAR ship data set collected from the Sentinel-1 SAR images demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance for the 3- and 5-class recognition tasks with regard to the comparing CNN models.

TI  - Machine Learning Improvement of Streamflow Simulation by Utilizing Remote Sensing Data and Potential Application in Guiding Reservoir Operation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-meteorological datasets are key components for understanding physical hydrological processes, but the scarcity of observational data hinders their potential application in poorly gauged regions. Satellite-retrieved and atmospheric reanalysis products exhibit considerable advantages in filling the spatial gaps in in-situ gauging networks and are thus forced to drive the physically lumped hydrological models for long-term streamflow simulation in data-sparse regions. As machine learning (ML)-based techniques can capture the relationship between different elements, they may have potential in further exploring meteorological predictors and hydrological responses. To examine the application prospects of a physically constrained ML algorithm using earth observation data, we used a short-series hydrological observation of the Hanjiang River basin in China as a case study. In this study, the prevalent modele du Genie Rural a 9 parametres Journalier (GR4J-9) hydrological model was used to initially simulate streamflow, and then, the simulated series and remote sensing data were used to train the long short-term memory (LSTM) method. The results demonstrated that the advanced GR4J9-LSTM model chain effectively improves the performance of the streamflow simulation by using more remote sensing data related to the hydrological response variables. Additionally, we derived a reservoir operation model by feeding the LSTM-based simulation outputs, which further revealed the potential application of our proposed technique.

TI  - A Multiscale Method for Road Network Extraction from High-Resolution SAR Images Based on Directional Decomposition and Regional Quality Evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Road network is an important part of modern transportation. For the demands of accurate road information in practical applications such as urban planning and disaster assessment, we propose a multiscale method to extract road network from high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which consists of three stages: potential road area segmentation, preliminary network generation, and road network refinement. Multiscale analysis is implemented using an image pyramid framework together with a fixed-size filter. First, a directional road detector is designed to highlight road targets in feature response maps. Subsequently, adaptive fusion is performed independently at each image scale, followed by a threshold method to produce potential road maps. Then, binary maps are decomposed according to the obtained direction information. For each connected component (CC), quality evaluation is conducted to further distinguish road segments and polynomial curve fitting is adopted as a thinning method. Multiscale information fusion is realized through the weighted sum of road curves. Finally, tensor voting and spatial regularization are employed to generate the final road network. Experiments on three TerraSAR images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to extract road network completely and correctly.

TI  - Globally deployed COVID-19 fever screening devices using infrared thermographs consistently normalize high readings to afebrile range
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance: The need for regulatory review of infrared thermographs (IRTs) used on humans was removed in response to the unique circumstances of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (a.k.a., COVID-19). The market for these devices has since expanded considerably. This evaluation of IRT performance may have significant implications for febrility screening worldwide.Aim: Perform controlled nonhuman trials of IRT devices to identify and quantify deviations in the human temperature range.Approach: We compared IRT readings of a temperature-controlled non-human subject with one FDA-cleared IRT and one FDA-cleared handheld NCIT. In individual trials for each device, the subject was measured between 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C at 0.25 degrees C increments.Results: The IRT device measurements were consistently normalized around the human mean (similar to 37 degrees C). Temperatures were decremented as they approached the febrile range, and systematically reported as normal across all seven devices. This effect does not appear to be explained by a fixed offset or any known approach to estimating body temperature, or by random error.Conclusion: The IRTs in this study generated human temperature measurements that were systematically biased to the mean human temperature. Given that these devices are utilized for sentinel detection of possible infectious disease transmission, and are now globally employed, the implications for reduced detection of febrility are a widespread false sense of security. This vulnerability must be considered with respect to facility access control, clinical applications, and travel screening in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Evaluating Convective Initiation in High-Resolution Numerical Weather Prediction Models Using <i>GOES-16</i> Infrared Brightness Temperatures
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Several studies have used weather satellites to examine storm properties; however, they do not provide information about processes occurring within clouds. To address this limitation, we used numerical weather prediction model simulations and an object-based analysis method to learn more about in-cloud processes that influence the evolution of thunderstorms in the southeastern United States. The model and satellite comparison helped demonstrate that differences in the timing of rainfall formation can impact the amount of ice reaching the upper portion of the cloud. When ice forms, the cloud begins to grow rapidly and is more likely to become a long-lived thunderstorm. The results highlight the importance of using satellite data sensitive to clouds to evaluate the conditions under which cumulus clouds transition into severe storms.The evolution of model-based cloud-top brightness temperatures (BT) associated with convective initiation (CI) is assessed for three bulk cloud microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting Model. Using a composite-based analysis, cloud objects derived from high-resolution (500 m) model simulations are compared to 5-min GOES-16 imagery for a case study day located near the Alabama-Mississippi border. Observed and simulated cloud characteristics for clouds reaching CI are examined by utilizing infrared BTs commonly used in satellite-based CI nowcasting methods. The results demonstrate the ability of object-based verification methods with satellite observations to evaluate the evolution of model cloud characteristics, and the BT comparison provides insight into a known issue of model simulations producing too many convective cells reaching CI. The timing of CI from the different microphysical schemes is dependent on the production of ice in the upper levels of the cloud, which typically occurs near the time of maximum cloud growth. In particular, large differences in precipitation formation drive differences in the amount of cloud water able to reach upper layers of the cloud, which impacts cloud-top glaciation. Larger cloud mixing ratios are found in clouds with sustained growth leading to more cloud water lofted to the upper levels of the cloud and the formation of ice. Clouds unable to sustain growth lack the necessary cloud water needed to form ice and grow into cumulonimbus. Clouds with slower growth rates display similar BT trends as clouds exhibiting growth, which suggests that forecasting CI using geostationary satellites might require additional information beyond those derived at cloud top.

TI  - Design of a Local Nested Grid for the Optimal Combined Use of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) imagery is difficult to find and access for the intermediate user, requiring advanced skills and tools to transform it into useful information. Currently, remote sensing data is increasingly freely and openly available from different satellite platforms. However, the variety of images in terms of different types of sensors, spatial and spectral resolutions generates limitations due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the data, making it difficult to exploit the full potential of satellite imagery. Addressing this issue requires new approaches to organize, manage, and analyse remote-sensing imagery. This paper focuses on the growing trend based on satellite EO and the analysis-ready data (ARD) to integrate two public optical satellite missions: Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel 2 (S2). This paper proposes a new way to combine S2 and L8 imagery based on a Local Nested Grid (LNG). The LNG designed plays a key role in the development of new products within the European EO downstream sector, which must incorporate assimilation techniques and interoperability best practices, automatization, systemization, and integrated web-based services that will potentially lead to pre-operational downstream services. The approach was tested in the Duero river basin (78,859 km(2)) and in the groundwater Mancha Oriental (7279 km(2)) in the Jucar river basin, Spain. In addition, a viewer based on Geoserver was prepared for visualizing the LNG of S2 and L8, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values in points. Thanks to the LNG presented in this paper, the processing, storage, and publication tasks are optimal for the combined use of images from two different satellite sensors when the relationship between spatial resolutions is an integer (3 in the case of L8 and S2).

TI  - The Summer 2019-2020 Wildfires in East Coast Australia and Their Impacts on Air Quality and Health in New South Wales, Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019-2020 summer wildfire event on the east coast of Australia was a series of major wildfires occurring from November 2019 to end of January 2020 across the states of Queensland, New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and South Australia. The wildfires were unprecedent in scope and the extensive character of the wildfires caused smoke pollutants to be transported not only to New Zealand, but also across the Pacific Ocean to South America. At the peak of the wildfires, smoke plumes were injected into the stratosphere at a height of up to 25 km and hence transported across the globe. The meteorological and air quality Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model is used together with the air quality monitoring data collected during the bushfire period and remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellites to determine the extent of the wildfires, the pollutant transport and their impacts on air quality and health of the exposed population in NSW. The results showed that the WRF-Chem model using Fire Emission Inventory (FINN) from National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to simulate the dispersion and transport of pollutants from wildfires predicted the daily concentration of PM2.5 having the correlation (R-2) and index of agreement (IOA) from 0.6 to 0.75 and 0.61 to 0.86, respectively, when compared with the ground-based data. The impact on health endpoints such as mortality and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases hospitalizations across the modelling domain was then estimated. The estimated health impact on each of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census districts (SA4) of New South Wales was calculated based on epidemiological assumptions of the impact function and incidence rate data from the 2016 ABS and NSW Department of Health statistical health records. Summing up all SA4 census district results over NSW, we estimated that there were 247 (CI: 89, 409) premature deaths, 437 (CI: 81, 984) cardiovascular diseases hospitalizations and 1535 (CI: 493, 2087) respiratory diseases hospitalizations in NSW over the period from 1 November 2019 to 8 January 2020. The results are comparable with a previous study based only on observation data, but the results in this study provide much more spatially and temporally detailed data with regard to the health impact from the summer 2019-2020 wildfires.

TI  - Toward More Integrated Utilizations of Geostationary Satellite Data for Disaster Management and Risk Mitigation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Third-generation geostationary meteorological satellites (GEOs), such as Himawari-8/9 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-R Series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), and Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) Flexible Combined Imager (FCI), provide advanced imagery and atmospheric measurements of the Earth's weather, oceans, and terrestrial environments at high-frequency intervals. Third-generation GEOs also significantly improve capabilities by increasing the number of observation bands suitable for environmental change detection. This review focuses on the significantly enhanced contribution of third-generation GEOs for disaster monitoring and risk mitigation, focusing on atmospheric and terrestrial environment monitoring. In addition, to demonstrate the collaboration between GEOs and Low Earth orbit satellites (LEOs) as supporting information for fine-spatial-resolution observations required in the event of a disaster, the landfall of Typhoon No. 19 Hagibis in 2019, which caused tremendous damage to Japan, is used as a case study.

TI  - Application of an improved surface energy balance model to two large valley glaciers in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surficial melt rates are commonly modelled using surface energy balance (SEB) models, with outputs applied to extend point-based mass-balance measurements to regional scales, assess water resource availability, examine supraglacial hydrology and to investigate the relationship between surface melt and ice dynamics. We present an improved SEB model that addresses the primary limitations of existing models by: (1) deriving high-resolution (30 m) surface albedo from Landsat 8 imagery, (2) calculating shadows cast onto the glacier surface by high-relief topography to model incident shortwave radiation, (3) developing an algorithm to map debris sufficiently thick to insulate the glacier surface and (4) presenting a formulation of the SEB model coupled to a subsurface heat conduction model. We drive the model with 6 years of in situ meteorological data from Kaskawulsh Glacier and Naluday (Lowell) Glacier in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada, and validate outputs against in situ measurements. Modelled seasonal melt agrees with observations within 9% across a range of elevations on both glaciers in years with high-quality in situ observations. We recommend applying the model to investigate the impacts of surface melt for individual glaciers when sufficient input data are available.

TI  - Eritrea's Chosen Trauma and the Legacy of the Martyrs: The Impact of Postmemory on Political Identity Formation of Second-Generation Diaspora Eritreans
T2  - AFRICA SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - In the collective memory of Eritreans, the liberation struggle against Ethiopia symbolises the heroic fight of their fallen martyrs against oppression. After independence, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front created an autocratic regime, which is adored by many second-generation diaspora Eritreans living in democracies. I engage with bodies of literature exploring the political importance of collective trauma in post-conflict societies and apply two theoretical notions, "postmemory" and "chosen trauma," to explain how the government's narrative of Eritrean history produced a culture of nationalism through the glorification of the martyrs. This narrative and the trauma experienced by their parents created experiences of postmemory among the second-generation diaspora that have influenced their worldview. I demonstrate how Eritrean pro-government activists utilise US-born artists who recently discovered their Eritreanness, such as Tiffany Haddish, to instil long-distance nationalism. The article is based on a social media analysis, long-term observation of Eritrean diaspora communities, and recent fieldwork.

TI  - Calving at Ryder Glacier, Northern Greenland
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent evidence has shown increasing mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet, with a general trend of accelerated mass losses extending northwards. However, different glaciers have been shown to respond differently to similar external forcings, constituting a problem for extrapolating and upscaling data. Specifically, whilst some outlet glaciers have accelerated, thinned, and retreated in response to atmospheric and oceanic warming, the behavior of other marine terminating glaciers appears to be less sensitive to climate forcing. Ryder glacier, for which only a few studies have been conducted, is located in North Greenland and terminates with a floating ice tongue in Sherard Osborn Fjord. The persistence or disintegration of floating ice tongues has impacts on glacier dynamics and stability, with ramifications beyond, including sea level rise. This study focuses on understanding the controls on calving and frontal ablation of the Ryder glacier through the use of time-lapse imagery and satellite data. The results suggest that Ryder glacier has behaved independently of climate forcing during recent decades, with fjord geometry exerting a first order control on its calving.

TI  - A Comparison between Support Vector Machine and Water Cloud Model for Estimating Crop Leaf Area Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The water cloud model (WCM) can be inverted to estimate leaf area index (LAI) using the intensity of backscatter from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors. Published studies have demonstrated that the WCM can accurately estimate LAI if the model is effectively calibrated. However, calibration of this model requires access to field measures of LAI as well as soil moisture. In contrast, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be trained to estimate LAI from satellite data, even if field moisture measures are not available. In this study, a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to estimate the LAI for corn, soybeans, rice, and wheat crops. These results were compared to LAI estimates from the WCM. To complete this comparison, in situ and satellite data were collected from seven Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) sites located in Argentina, Canada, Germany, India, Poland, Ukraine and the United States of America (U.S.A.). The models used C-Band backscatter intensity for two polarizations (like-polarization (VV) and cross-polarization (VH)) acquired by the RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR satellites. Both the WCM and SVM models performed well in estimating the LAI of corn. For the SVM, the correlation (R) between estimated LAI for corn and LAI measured in situ was reported as 0.93, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.64 m(2)m(-2) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.51 m(2)m(-2). The WCM produced an R-value of 0.89, with only slightly higher errors (RMSE of 0.75 m(2)m(-2) and MAE of 0.61 m(2)m(-2)) when estimating corn LAI. For rice, only the SVM model was tested, given the lack of soil moisture measures for this crop. In this case, both high correlations and low errors were observed in estimating the LAI of rice using SVM (R of 0.96, RMSE of 0.41 m(2)m(-2) and MAE of 0.30 m(2)m(-2)). However, the results demonstrated that when the calibration points were limited (in this case for soybeans), the WCM outperformed the SVM model. This study demonstrates the importance of testing different modeling approaches over diverse agro-ecosystems to increase confidence in model performance.

TI  - Influence of plot and sample sizes on aboveground biomass estimations in plantation forests using very high resolution stereo satellite imagery
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regular biomass estimations for natural and plantation forests are important to support sustainable forestry and to calculate carbon-related statistics. The application of remote sensing data to estimate biomass of forests has been amply demonstrated but there is still space for increasing the efficiency of current approaches. Here, we investigated the influence of field plot and sample sizes on the accuracy of random forest models trained with information derived from Pleiades very high resolution (VHR) stereo images applied to plantation forests in an arid environment. We collected field data at 311 Locations with three different plot area sizes (100, 300 and 500 m(2)). In two experiments, we demonstrate how plot and sample sizes influence the accuracy of biomass estimation models. In the first experiment, we compared model accuracies obtained with varying plot sizes but constant number of samples. In the second experiment, we fixed the total area to be sampled to account for the additional effort to collect Large field plots. Our results for the first experiment show that model performance metrics Spearman's r, RMSErel and RMSEnor improve from 0.61, 0.70 and 0.36 at a sample size of 24-0.79, 0.51 and 0.15 at a sample size of 192, respectively. In the second experiment, highest accuracies were obtained with a plot size of 100 m(2) (most samples) with Spearman's r = 0.77, RMSErel = 0.59 and RMSEnor = 0.15. Results from an analysis of variance type-II suggest that the overall most important factors to explain model performance metrics for our biomass models is sample size. Our results suggest no clear advantage for any plot size to reach accurate biomass estimates using VHR stereo imagery in plantations. This is an important finding, which partly contradicts the suggestions of earlier studies but requires validation for other forest types and remote sensing data types (e.g. LiDAR).

TI  - Uni-Temporal Multispectral Imagery for Burned Area Mapping with Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate burned area information is needed to assess the impacts of wildfires on people, communities, and natural ecosystems. Various burned area detection methods have been developed using satellite remote sensing measurements with wide coverage and frequent revisits. Our study aims to expound on the capability of deep learning (DL) models for automatically mapping burned areas from uni-temporal multispectral imagery. Specifically, several semantic segmentation network architectures, i.e., U-Net, HRNet, Fast-SCNN, and DeepLabv3+, and machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to Sentinel-2 imagery and Landsat-8 imagery in three wildfire sites in two different local climate zones. The validation results show that the DL algorithms outperform the ML methods in two of the three cases with the compact burned scars, while ML methods seem to be more suitable for mapping dispersed burn in boreal forests. Using Sentinel-2 images, U-Net and HRNet exhibit comparatively identical performance with higher kappa (around 0.9) in one heterogeneous Mediterranean fire site in Greece; Fast-SCNN performs better than others with kappa over 0.79 in one compact boreal forest fire with various burn severity in Sweden. Furthermore, directly transferring the trained models to corresponding Landsat-8 data, HRNet dominates in the three test sites among DL models and can preserve the high accuracy. The results demonstrated that DL models can make full use of contextual information and capture spatial details in multiple scales from fire-sensitive spectral bands to map burned areas. Using only a post-fire image, the DL methods not only provide automatic, accurate, and bias-free large-scale mapping option with cross-sensor applicability, but also have potential to be used for onboard processing in the next Earth observation satellites.

TI  - Temperature decadal trends, and their relation to diurnal variations in the lower thermosphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, based on measurements from SABER on TIMED
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - We have derived the behavior of decadal temperature trends over the 24 h of local time, based on zonal averages of SABER data, for the years 2012 to 2014, from 20 to 100 km, within 48 degrees of the Equator. Similar results have not been available previously. We find that the temperature trends, based on zonal mean measurements at a fixed local time, can be different from those based on measurements made at a different fixed local time. The trends can vary significantly in local time, even from hour to hour. This agrees with some findings based on nighttime lidar measurements. This knowledge is relevant because the large majority of temperature measurements, especially in the stratosphere, are made by instruments on sun-synchronous operational satellites which measure at only one or two fixed local times, for the duration of their missions. In these cases, the zonal mean trends derived from various satellite data are tied to the specific local times at which each instrument samples the data, and the trends are then also biased by the local time. Consequently, care is needed in comparing trends based on various measurements with each other, unless the data are all measured at the same local time. Similar caution is needed when comparing with models, since the zonal means from 3D models reflect averages over both longitude and the 24 h of local time. Consideration is also needed in merging data from various sources to produce generic, continuous, longer-term records. Diurnal variations of temperature themselves, in the form of thermal tides, are well known and are due to absorption of solar radiation. We find that at least part of the reason that temperature trends are different for different local times is that the amplitudes and phases of the tides themselves follow trends over the same time span of the data. Many of the past efforts have focused on the temperature values with local time when merging data from various sources and on the effect of unintended satellite orbital drifts, which result in drifting local times at which the temperatures are measured. However, the effect of local time on trends has not been well researched. We also derive estimates of trends by simulating the drift of local time due to drifting orbits. Our comparisons with results found by others (Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, AMSU; lidar) are favorable and informative. They may explain, at least in part, the bridge between results based on daytime AMSU data and nighttime lidar measurements. However, these examples do not form a pattern, and more comparisons and study are needed.

TI  - Estimating Forest Canopy Cover by Multiscale Remote Sensing in Northeast Jiangxi, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This research was focused on estimation of tree canopy cover (CC) by multiscale remote sensing in south China. The key aim is to establish the relationship between CC and woody NDVI (NDVIW) or to build a CC-NDVIW model taking northeast Jiangxi as an example. Based on field CC measurements, this research used Google Earth as a complementary source to measure CC. In total, 63 sample plots of CC were created, among which 45 were applied for modeling and the remaining 18 were employed for verification. In order to ascertain the ratio R of NDVIW to the satellite observed NDVI, a 20-year time-series MODIS NDVI dataset was utilized for decomposition to obtain the NDVIW component, and then the ratio R was calculated with the equation R = (NDVIW/NDVI) *100%, respectively, for forest (CC > 60%), medium woodland (CC = 25-60%) and sparse woodland (CC 1-25%). Landsat TM and OLI images that had been orthorectified by the provider USGS were atmospherically corrected using the COST model and used to derive NDVIL. R was multiplied for the NDVIL image to extract the woody NDVI (NDVIWL) from Landsat data for each of these plots. The 45 plots of CC data were linearly fitted to the NDVIWL, and a model with CC = 103.843 NDVIW + 6.157 (R-2 = 0.881) was obtained. This equation was applied to predict CC at the 18 verification plots and a good agreement was found (R-2 = 0.897). This validated CC-NDVIW model was further applied to the woody NDVI of forest, medium woodland and sparse woodland derived from Landsat data for regional CC estimation. An independent group of 24 measured plots was utilized for validation of the results, and an accuracy of 83.0% was obtained. Thence, the developed model has high predictivity and is suitable for large-scale estimation of CC using high-resolution data.

TI  - HDEC-TFA: An Unsupervised Learning Approach for Discovering Physical Scattering Properties of Single-Polarized SAR Image
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the physical properties and scattering mechanisms contributes to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image interpretation. For single-polarized SAR data, however, it is difficult to extract the physical scattering mechanisms due to lack of polarimetric information. Time frequency analysis (TFA) on complex-valued SAR image provides extra information in frequency perspective beyond the mage domain. Based on TFA theory, we propose to generate the <italic>subband scattering pattern</italic> for every object in complex-valued SAR image as the physical property representation, which reveals backscattering variations along slant-range and azimuth directions. In order to discover the inherent patterns and generate a scattering classification map from single-polarized SAR image, an unsupervised hierarchical deep embedding clustering (HDEC) algorithm based on TFA (HDEC-TFA) is proposed to learn the embedded features and cluster centers simultaneously and hierarchically. The polarimetric analysis result for quad-pol SAR images is applied as reference data of physical scattering mechanisms. In order to compare the scattering classification map obtained from single-polarized SAR data with the physical scattering mechanism result from full-polarized SAR, and to explore the relationship and similarity between them in a quantitative way, an information theory based evaluation method is proposed. We take Gaofen-3 quad-polarized SAR data for experiments, and the results and discussions demonstrate that the proposed method is able to learn valuable scattering properties from single-polarization complex-valued SAR data, and to extract some specific targets as well as polarimetric analysis. At last, we give a promising prospect to future applications.

TI  - Pericyte-like cells undergo transcriptional reprogramming and distinct functional adaptations in acute lung injury
T2  - FASEB JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We previously reported on the role of pericyte-like cells as functional sentinel immune cells in lung injury. However, much about the biological role of pericytes in lung injury remains unknown. Lung pericyte-like cells are well-positioned to sense disruption to the epithelial barrier and coordinate local inflammatory responses due to their anatomic niche within the alveoli. In this report, we characterized transcriptional responses and functional changes in pericyte-like cells following activation by alveolar components from injured and uninjured lungs in a mouse model of acute lung injury (ALI). Purified pericyte-like cells from lung digests using PDGFR beta as a selection marker were expanded in culture as previously described (1). We induced sterile acute lung injury in mice with recombinant human Fas ligand (rhFasL) instillation followed by mechanical ventilation (1). We then collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from injured and uninjured mice. Purified pericyte-like cells in culture were exposed to growth media only (control), BALF from uninjured mice, and BALF from injured mice for 6 and 24 hours. RNA collected from these treatment conditions were processed for RNAseq. Targets of interest identified by pathway analysis were validated using in vitro and in vivo assays. We observed robust global transcriptional changes in pericyte-like cells following treatment with uninjured and injured BALF at 6 hours, but this response persisted for 24 hours only after exposure to injured BALF. Functional enrichment analysis of pericytes treated with injured BALF revealed the activation of pro-inflammatory, cell migration, and angiogenesis-related pathways, whereas processes associated with tissue development and cell differentiation were down-regulated. We validated select upregulated targets in the inflammatory, angiogenic, and cell migratory pathways using functional biological assays in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that lung pericyte-like cells are highly responsive to alveolar compartment content from both uninjured and injured lungs, but injured BALF elicits a more sustained response. The inflammatory, angiogenic, and migratory changes exhibited by activated pericyte-like cells underscore the phenotypic plasticity of these specialized stromal cells in the setting of acute lung injury.

TI  - Topdressing Nitrogen Demand Prediction in Rice Crop Using Machine Learning Systems
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research is an outcome of the R&D activities of Ecodevelopment S.A. (steadily supported by the Hellenic Agricultural Organization-Demeter) towards offering precision farming services to rice growers. Within this framework, a new methodology for topdressing nitrogen prediction was developed based on machine learning. Nitrogen is a key element in rice culture and its rational management can increase productivity, reduce costs, and prevent environmental impacts. A multi-source, multi-temporal, and multi-scale dataset was collected, including optical and radar imagery, soil data, and yield maps by monitoring a 110 ha pilot rice farm in Thessaloniki Plain, Greece, for four consecutive years. RapidEye imagery underwent image segmentation to delineate management zones (ancillary, visual interpretation of unmanned aerial system scenes was employed, too); Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery was modelled with Computer Vision to detect inundated fields and (through this) indicate the exact growth stage of the crop; and Sentinel-2 image data were used to map leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) exactly before topdressing applications. Several machine learning algorithms were configured to predict yield for various nitrogen levels, with the XGBoost model resulting in the highest accuracy. Finally, yield curves were used to select the nitrogen dose maximizing yield, which was thus recommended to the grower. Inundation mapping proved to be critical in the prediction process. Currently, Ecodevelopment S.A. is expanding the application of the new method in different study areas, with a view to further empower its generality and operationality.

TI  - Incidence of Kawasaki disease before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study in Japan
T2  - BMJ PAEDIATRICS OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Epidemiological studies in Kawasaki disease (KD) have suggested infectious aetiology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission also suppress the circulation of other contagious microorganisms. The primary objective is to compare the number and incidence of KD before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, and the secondary objective is to investigate temporal association between the KD epidemiology and activities of SARS-CoV-2 and other viral and bacterial infections. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2016 and 2020 in Kobe, Japan. We collected information of hospitalised KD children in Kobe. Child population was identified through the resident registry system. Activity of COVID-19 and 11 other infectious diseases was derived from a public health monitoring system. Monthly change of KD incidence was analysed using a difference-in-difference regression model. Results Throughout the study period, 1027 KD children were identified. KD had begun to decline in April 2020, coinciding with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of KD cases (n=66) between April and December 2020 was 40% of the average in the same period in 2016-2019 (165/year). Annual KD incidence was 315, 300, 353, 347 and 188/100 000 children aged 0-4 years in 2016-2020, respectively. The difference-in-difference value of KD incidence was significantly reduced in the fourth quarter in 2020 (-15.8, 95% CI -28.0 to -3.5), compared with that in 2016-2019. Sentinel surveillance showed a marked decrease of all infectious diseases except exanthema subitum after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. There were 86 COVID-19 cases aged Conclusion This study showed that the number and incidence of KD was dramatically reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. This change was temporally associated with decreased activities of various infectious diseases other than COVID-19, supporting the hypothesis of infection-triggered pathogenesis in KD.

TI  - Drygalski Ice Tongue stability influenced by rift formation and ice morphology
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Drygalski Ice Tongue in East Antarctica stretches 90 km into the Ross Sea and influences the local ocean circulation, and persistence of the Terra Nova Bay Polynya. We examine the controls on the size of this floating ice body by comparing the propagation of six large fractures on the ice tongue's northern side using 21 years of Landsat imagery with hydrostatic ice thickness maps and strain rate calculations. We also apply a subglacial hydrology model to estimate the location and discharge from subglacial channels over the grounding line and compare these with basal channels identified along the ice tongue using remote sensing and airborne radar data. Our results suggest that large fractures are inhibited from full-width propagation by thicker ice between basal channels. We hypothesize that only once the ice tongue thins towards the terminus, can fractures propagate and cause large calving events. This suggests an important relationship between the melting of floating ice from subglacial and ocean sources and the expansion of fractures that lead to ice tongue calving.

TI  - Geospatial analysis of wetlands based on land use/land cover dynamics using remote sensing and GIS in Sindh, Pakistan
T2  - SCIENCE PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change has been observed in wetlands comprises of Manchar Lake, Keenjhar Lake, and Chotiari Reservoir in Pakistan over the last four decades from 1972 to 2020. Each wetland has been categorized into four LULC classes; water, natural vegetation, agriculture land, and dry land. Multitemporal Landsat satellite data including; Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used for LULC changes evaluation. The Supervised Maximum-likelihood classifier method is used to acquire satellite imagery for detecting the LULC changes during the whole study period. Soil adjusted vegetation index technique (SAVI) was also used to reduce the effects of soil brightness values for estimating the actual vegetation cover of each study site. Results have shown the significant impact of human activities on freshwater resources by changing the natural ecosystem of wetlands. Change detection analysis showed that the impacts on the land cover affect the landscape of the study area by about 40% from 1972 to 2020. The vegetation cover of Manchar Lake and Keenjhar Lake has been decreased by 6,337.17 and 558.18 ha, respectively. SAVI analysis showed that soil profile is continuously degrading which vigorously affects vegetation cover within the study area. The overall classification accuracy and Kappa statistics showed an accuracy of >90% for all LULC mapping studies. This work demonstrates the LULC changes as a critical monitoring basis for ongoing analyses of changes in land management to enable decision-makers to establish strategies for effectively using land resources.

TI  - Improving CERES-Wheat Yield Forecasts by Assimilating Dynamic Landsat-Based Leaf Area Index: A Case Study in Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we tried to address the applicability of using dynamic remotely sensed data into a static crop model to capture the yield spatiotemporal variability at the field scale. Taking the example of the crop environment resource synthesis for wheat (CERES-wheat), the model was calibrated, improved, and validated using three years of winter wheat field measurement data (growing seasons of 2017-2019). We assimilated the Landsat-based leaf area index (LAI) into the model using the particle filter approach. Four vegetation indices, including NDVI, SAVI, EVI, and EVI-2, were evaluated to identify winter wheat LAI's best estimator. A linear regression of Landsat-EVI-2 was found to be the most accurate representation of LAI (LAI = 10.08 x EVI-2 - 0.53) with R-2 = 0.87, and mean bias error = - 2.04. The higher LAI accuracy from EVI-2 was attributed to the soil and canopy background noise reduction and accounting for certain atmospheric conditions. Assimilating the LAI based on Landsat-EVI-2 into the CERES model improved the model's overall performance, particularly for grain yield and biomass simulations. The default model predicted LAI(max), grain yield, and biomass at 5.1 cm(2) cm(-2), 8.3 Mg ha(-1), and 14.9 Mg ha(-1) with RMSE of 1.44, 0.91 Mg ha(-1), and 1.2 Mg ha(-1), respectively, while the modified model (using the Landsat-EVI-2 data) predicated these values at 6.6 cm(2) cm(-2), 9.9 Mg ha(-1), and 16.6 Mg ha(-1) with RMSE of 0.81, 0.54 Mg ha(-1), and 0.62 Mg ha(-1), respectively.

TI  - Retrieval of suspended sediment concentration of the Chilika Lake, India using Landsat-8 OLI satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To monitor sediment variations in the Chilika Lake, the Landsat-8 OLI data was used to calibrate suspended sediment concentration (SSC) model. The relationship between remote sensing reflectance of OLI bands and in-situ measured SSC were used to develop new site-specific algorithms. Four different models were calibrated in this study for retrieval of SSC using in-situ observation and remote sensing reflectance of OLI data. The multiband linear regression model provided better result (R-2=0.6) as compared to the single-band regression model (R-2=0.45, polynomial; R-2=0.38, exponential and R-2=0.39, linear). The Landsat-8 OLI image shows spatiotemporal variations of SSC during pre and post-monsoon season (2013-15) in the lake. It is observed that the SSC variation is predominantly influenced by three factors: monsoon effect, wind-induced re-suspension of bottom sediments and influx of river water into the lake. It is also observed that due to the impact of severe tropical cyclone Phailin, there was a rapid increase of SSC in the lake.

TI  - Analyzing the Suitability of Remotely Sensed ET for Calibrating a Watershed Model of a Mediterranean Montane Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to spatially characterize runoff generation and forest health depends partly on the accuracy and resolution of evapotranspiration (ET) simulated by numerical models. A possible strategy to increase the accuracy and resolution of numerically modeled ET is the use of remotely sensed ET products as an observational basis for parameter estimation (model calibration) of those numerical models. However, the extent to which that calibration strategy leads to a realistic representation of ET, relative to ground conditions, is not well understood. We examined this by comparing the spatiotemporal accuracy of ET from a remote sensing product, MODIS MOD16A2, to that from a watershed model (SWAT) calibrated to flow measured at an outlet streamgage. We examined this in the upper Kings River watershed (3999 km(2)) of California's Sierra Nevada, a snow-influenced watershed in a Mediterranean climate. We assessed ET accuracies against observations from three eddy-covariance flux towers at elevations of 1160-2700 m. The accuracy of ET from the stream-calibrated watershed model surpassed that of MODIS in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (+0.36 versus -0.43) and error in elevational trend (+7.7% versus +81%). These results indicate that for this particular experiment, an outlet streamgage would provide a more effective observational basis than remotely sensed ET product for watershed-model parameter estimation. Based on analysis of ET-weather relationships, the relatively large errors we found in MODIS ET may be related to weather-based corrections to water limitation not representative of the hydrology of this snow-influenced, Mediterranean-climate area.

TI  - Spectroscopic analysis of allophane and imogolite samples with variable Fe abundance for characterizing the poorly crystalline components on Mars
T2  - AMERICAN MINERALOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Nanophase materials including silicates, aluminosilicates, and iron oxides are widespread on Mars. These minerals are important because they likely represent a solid-phase record of ancient climatic conditions on the martian surface. Identification and characterization of nanophase compounds is technically challenging due to the small size and poorly ordered nature of these materials, particularly because their chemical compositions can vary widely.This study presents spectra of several synthetic allophane and imogolite samples with a range of chemical compositions that are typical of the natural variability of allophanic materials. These samples were formed under controlled conditions and have been thoroughly characterized in terms of chemical composition and short-range structure.Analyses confirmed that the synthetic materials were allophane and imogolite and were structurally similar to previously studied natural and synthetic examples of these phases. NMR and XAFS data indicated that high-Al proto-imogolite allophanes were similar in structure to imogolite but were less well ordered, and supported the proposed nanoball structures based on rolled octahedral Al sheets. Increasing Si content in allophane produced increasing tetrahedral Al substitution as well as polymerized Si chain structures at Al-Si mole ratios of 1:1, and sheets and possible framework structures at Al-Si mole ratios of 1:2. Fe in allophanes and imogolites substituted exclusively for octahedral Al.Reflectance spectra of the synthetic allophanes and imogolites were comparable to previously analyzed samples. Variations in Fe content of allophane and imogolite resulted in some observable changes in visible/near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra, but these changes were not detectable in emission spectra. Emission spectra of the samples suggest that variations in Al-Si ratio of allophanes should be detectable using remotely sensed data. Because allophanes with different Al-Si ratios typically form in very different environments, this could be significant for interpretation of formation conditions on Mars, with high-Al compositions suggesting possible tephra weathering and high-Si compositions indicating possible formation from thermal waters.

TI  - Mapping Land Use/Cover Dynamics of the Yellow River Basin from 1986 to 2018 Supported by Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the land use/cover alter the Earth system processes and affect the provision of ecosystem services, posing a challenge to achieve sustainable development. In the past few decades, the Yellow River (YR) basin faced enormous social and environmental sustainability challenges associated with environmental degradation, soil erosion, vegetation restoration, and economic development, which makes it important to understand the long-term land use/cover dynamics of this region. Here, using three decades of Landsat imagery (17,080 images) and incorporating physiography data, we developed an effective annual land use/cover mapping framework and provided a set of 90 m resolution continuous annual land use/cover maps of the YR basin from 1986 to 2018 based on the Google Earth Engine and the Classification and Regression Trees algorithm. The independent random sampling validations based on the field surveys (640 points) and Google Earth (3456 points) indicated that the overall accuracy of these maps is 78.3% and 80.0%, respectively. The analysis of the land system of the YR basin showed that this region presents complex temporal and spatial changes, and the main change patterns include no change or little change, cropland loss and urban expansion, grassland restoration, increase in orchard and terrace, and increase in forest during the entire study period. The major land use/cover change has occurred in the transitions from forests, grasslands, and croplands to the class of orchard and terrace (19.8% of all change area), which not only increase the greenness but also raised the income, suggesting that YR progress towards sustainable development goals for livelihood security, economic growth, and ecological protection. Based on these data and analysis, we can further understand the role of the land system in the mutual feedback between society and the environment, and provide support for ecological conservation, high-quality development, and the formulation of sustainable management policies in this basin, highlighting the importance of continuous land use/cover information for understanding the interactions between the human and natural systems.

TI  - GAN-Based One-Class Classification for Remote-Sensing Image Change Detection
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, most of the supervised change detection approaches require a training data set that contains samples from both the changed and the unchanged data. However, under certain condition, such as natural disaster and military attack, the changed data samples are very few or even not available but the unchanged data are abundant. In this letter, we develop a generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based one-class classification (OCC) technique for time series remote-sensing image change detection. The proposed method is only trained with the unchanged data instead of both the changed and unchanged data. To achieve this purpose, first, spatial-spectral features are extracted from the time series remote-sensing images. Second, a GAN model is trained to detect the changes only with the extracted features of unchanged data. Remarkably, to offset the outlier errors caused by the incomplete supervision information provided by unchanged data alone, changed data, instead of unchanged data, are generated to improve power of discriminator. Finally, testing data are classified by the trained discriminator of GAN to produce a binary change map. Experimental results obtained on two optical time series remote-sensing data sets confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TI  - Mapping the Forest Canopy Height in Northern China by Synergizing ICESat-2 with Sentinel-2 Using a Stacking Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest canopy height (FCH) plays a critical role in forest quality evaluation and resource management. The accurate and rapid estimation and mapping of the regional forest canopy height is crucial for understanding vegetation growth processes and the internal structure of the ecosystem. A stacking algorithm consisting of multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and random forest (RF) was used in this paper and demonstrated optimal performance in predicting the forest canopy height by synergizing Sentinel-2 images acquired from the cloud-based computation platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) with data from ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2). This research was conducted to achieve continuous mapping of the canopy height of plantations in Saihanba Mechanical Forest Plantation, which is located in Chengde City, northern Hebei province, China. The results show that stacking achieved the best prediction accuracy for the forest canopy height, with an R-2 of 0.77 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.96 m. Compared with MLR, SVM, kNN, and RF, the RMSE obtained by stacking was reduced by 25.2%, 24.9%, 22.8%, and 18.7%, respectively. Since Sentinel-2 images and ICESat-2 data are publicly available, this opens the door for the accurate mapping of the continuous distribution of the forest canopy height globally in the future.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2 in Small Waterbody Mapping over Urban and Mountainous Regions
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate waterbody mapping can support water-related environment monitoring and resource management. The Sentinel series satellites provide high-quality Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical observations that are commonly used in waterbody mapping. However, owing to the 10-m spatial resolution of Sentinel data, previous studies mostly focused on the mapping of large waterbodies. In this work, we evaluated the performance of small waterbody mapping over urban and mountainous regions with two datasets, the average annual VH backscatter coefficients (VHavg), derived from the Sentinel-1A series, and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), derived from cloud-free Sentinel-2. A proven framework of waterbody mapping based on watershed segmentation and noise reduction was employed to assess the performance of the two datasets in waterbody identification. The validation was performed by comparing their results with 1-m spatial resolution reference waterbody data. Assessment metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F-measure, were employed. Results showed that: (1) the MNDWI outperformed the VHavg by 9 percentage points of the F-measure; (2) there was more room for results of VHavg to improve the accuracy through a combination with noise reduction; and (3) the potential smallest identifiable waterbody area (recall rate larger than 0.8) was larger than 10(4) m(2).

TI  - Land Subsidence in Wuhan Revealed Using a Non-Linear PSInSAR Approach with Long Time Series of COSMO-SkyMed SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wuhan is an important city in central China, with a rapid development that has led to increasingly serious land subsidence over the last decades. Most of the existing Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) subsidence monitoring studies in Wuhan are either short-term investigations-and thus can only detect this process within limited time periods-or combinations of different Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets with temporal gaps in between. To overcome these constraints, we exploited nearly 300 high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed StripMap HIMAGE scenes acquired between 2012 and 2019 to monitor the long-term subsidence process affecting Wuhan and to reveal its spatiotemporal variations. The results from the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric SAR (PSInSAR) processing highlight several clearly observable subsidence zones. Three of them (i.e., Houhu, Xinrong, and Guanggu) are affected by serious subsidence rates and non-linear temporal behavior, and are investigated in this paper in more detail. The subsidence in Houhu is caused by soft soil consolidation and compression. Soil mechanics are therefore used to estimate when the subsidence is expected to finish and to calculate the degree of consolidation for each year. The COSMO-SkyMed PSInSAR results indicate that the area has entered the late stage of consolidation and compression and is gradually stabilizing. The subsidence curve found for the area around Xinrong shows that the construction of an underground tract of the subway Line 21 caused large-scale settlement in this area. The temporal granularity of the PSInSAR time series also allows precise detection of a rebound phase following a major flooding event in 2016. In the southern industrial park of Guanggu, newly detected subsidence was found. The combination of the subsidence curve with an optical time-series image analysis indicates that urban construction is the main trigger of deformation in this area. While this study unveils previously unknown characters of land subsidence in Wuhan and clarifies the relationship with the urban causative factors, it also proves the benefits of non-linear PSInSAR in the analysis of the temporal evolution of such processes in dynamic and expanding cities.

TI  - High-Resolution Mangrove Forests Classification with Machine Learning Using Worldview and UAV Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests, as important ecological and economic resources, have suffered a loss in the area due to natural and human activities. Monitoring the distribution of and obtaining accurate information on mangrove species is necessary for ameliorating the damage and protecting and restoring mangrove forests. In this study, we compared the performance of UAV Rikola hyperspectral images, WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite-based multispectral images, and a fusion of data from both in the classification of mangrove species. We first used recursive feature elimination-random forest (RFE-RF) to select the vegetation's spectral and texture feature variables, and then implemented random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms as classifiers. The results showed that the accuracy of the combined data was higher than that of UAV and WV-2 data; the vegetation index features of UAV hyperspectral data and texture index of WV-2 data played dominant roles; the overall accuracy of the RF algorithm was 95.89% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.95, which is more accurate and efficient than SVM. The use of combined data and RF methods for the classification of mangrove species could be useful in biomass estimation and breeding cultivation.

TI  - Introducing the Time Series Change Visualization and Interpretation (TSCVI) method for the interpretation of global NDVI changes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel method for the visualization of changes in vegetation related variables. This method, termed Time Series Change Visualization and Interpretation (TSCVI), allows to summarize changes associated to both vegetation productivity and phenology in a single map. To that end, three metrics are retrieved on an annual basis from plotting NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values on a polar plot. Changes in these metrics are then analyzed and mapped in an IHS (Intensity Hue Saturation) image, where colors indicate changes regarding the growing-season (earlier or later occurrence, stronger or weaker seasonality), while changes associated to productivity are evidenced by the image intensity. TSCVI metrics are presented for 445 sites corresponding to different land covers, and their sensitivity to dataset characteristics (temporal compositing, presence of clouds) is analyzed. We also applied the TSCVI method to GIMMS NDVI3g data, by analyzing the changes in the TSCVI annual metrics for the periods 1982-1986 and 2009-2013: the resulting map captures well-known changes evidenced in previous studies. Finally, we applied the proposed approach to Sentinel 2 data to visualize charges in the province of Valencia (Spain) between 2018 and 2019. The TSCVI approach can be used for a wide range of remotely-sensed variables in addition to NDVI. All the TSCVI routines used in this work are available freely for download at https://www.uv.es/juy/resources.htm.

TI  - Estimates of temporal-spatial variability of wildfire danger across the Pan-Arctic and extra-tropics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based hot-spot analysis for the Pan-Arctic, shows that Asia experiences a greater number of fires compared to North America and Europe. While hot spots are prevalent through the year in Asia, Europe (North America) exhibits marked annual (semi-annual) variability. The Potential Fire Danger index (PFIv2) demonstrates increased fire incidence vulnerability across the Arctic and extra-tropics. Though not significant in northwestern North America and eastern Asia, significant-positive trends across the mid-latitudes of Eurasia and Siberia are clear. PFIv2 accurately matches the regional distribution of observed fires, while the worldwide used Fire Weather Index does not. Fire danger has evolved as distributions of short-interval precipitation events and background vegetation characteristics change. In conjunction with increased population and expanded infrastructure, frequent extreme events may increase pressure for new settlements that lead to greater fire exposure across the Pan-Arctic. Thus, PFIv2 may be useful for decision planners and danger managers to anticipate and minimize the adverse effects of indiscriminate fire use.

TI  - Laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer: Current status and future direction
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Gastric cancer is still a major cause of death worldwide. While laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) has gained evidence as a standard treatment for early gastric cancer in the distal stomach, there are still concerns regarding its application for gastric cancer in the upper stomach and advanced gastric cancer. Nevertheless, LG has shown to have faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, less pain, and less blood loss in many retrospective and prospective studies. The application of LG has now extended from conventional radical gastrectomy to novel approaches such as function-preserving gastrectomy and sentinel-node navigated surgery. Studies on the use of laparoscopy in treatment for stage IV gastric cancer are rare, but show that there may be some roles of LG in selected cases. With the development of new laparoscopic tools that augment human ability, the future of LG should move on from proving non-inferiority to demonstrating superiority compared to the traditional open gastrectomy.

TI  - Remote Sensing to Study Mangrove Fragmentation and Its Impacts on Leaf Area Index and Gross Primary Productivity in the South of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove is classified as an important ecosystem along the shorelines of tropical and subtropical landmasses, which are being degraded at an alarming rate despite numerous international treaties having been agreed. Iskandar Malaysia (IM) is a fast-growing economic region in southern Peninsular Malaysia, where three Ramsar Sites are located. Since the beginning of the 21st century (2000-2019), a total loss of 2907.29 ha of mangrove area has been estimated based on medium-high resolution remote sensing data. This corresponds to an annual loss rate of 1.12%, which is higher than the world mangrove depletion rate. The causes of mangrove loss were identified as land conversion to urban, plantations, and aquaculture activities, where large mangrove areas were shattered into many smaller patches. Fragmentation analysis over the mangrove area shows a reduction in the mean patch size (from 105 ha to 27 ha) and an increase in the number of mangrove patches (130 to 402), edge, and shape complexity, where smaller and isolated mangrove patches were found to be related to the rapid development of IM region. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) products were used to inspect the impact of fragmentation on the mangrove ecosystem process. The mean LAI and GPP of mangrove areas that had not undergone any land cover changes over the years showed an increase from 3.03 to 3.55 (LAI) and 5.81 g C m(-2) to 6.73 g C m(-2) (GPP), highlighting the ability of the mangrove forest to assimilate CO2 when it is not disturbed. Similarly, GPP also increased over the gained areas (from 1.88 g C m(-2) to 2.78 g C m(-2)). Meanwhile, areas that lost mangroves, but replaced them with oil palm, had decreased mean LAI from 2.99 to 2.62. In fragmented mangrove patches an increase in GPP was recorded, and this could be due to the smaller patches (<9 ha) and their edge effects where abundance of solar radiation along the edges of the patches may increase productivity. The impact on GPP due to fragmentation is found to rely on the type of land transformation and patch characteristics (size, edge, and shape complexity). The preservation of mangrove forests in a rapidly developing region such as IM is vital to ensure ecosystem, ecology, environment, and biodiversity conservation, in addition to providing economical revenue and supporting human activities.

TI  - YIELD FORECASTING AND ASSESSMENT OF INTERANNUAL WHEAT YIELD VARIABILITY USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH IN SEMI-ARID ENVIRONMENT
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information about production estimates of wheat is useful for policymakers and government planners. The traditional methods for yield forecasting are labor insensitive and time-consuming therefore remote sensing is an effective approach for precise yield forecasting. The study was planned to develop a comprehensive framework for yield forecasting and to assess interannual yield variability in semi-arid regions. For wheat area classification, the peak season Landsat-8 satellite images were acquired, and Top of Atmospheric (TOA) correction was performed. The ground-truthing points of 100 farms were collected from the study area for the training of algorithms. The eight machine learning algorithms were used tune and tested using 10-k fold cross-validation and the best model was used for land cover classification of wheat. For yield forecasting, the temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) were derived for the wheat-growing season from November to April. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to variable selection and then Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator (LASSO) analysis was performed to develop coefficients of the yield forecasting model. The developed model was further used in yield forecasting of 10 years (2008-2018) in four semi-arid regions. The predicted yield was compared with Crop Reporting Service (CRS), Pakistan department. The results of all machine learning algorithms showed an accuracy of 88% to 96%, however, the Random forest algorithm showed higher accuracy, which was further used for classification. The wheat estimated area of 6.9% was less than reported by CRS. For interannual variability, the relationship of observed (CRS) and predicted yield of 10 years showed a close relation with R-2 ranged from 0.69 to 0.75 in the semi-arid region of Punjab, Pakistan. It was concluded that machine learning algorithms can be used as novel tools for yield forecasting and assessment of interannual yield variability.

TI  - Mapping of Aluminum Concentration in Bauxite Mining Residues Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing interest in the characterization of mining residues, both for environmental assessments and critical raw materials recovery. The lack of sufficient in situ samples hampers an effective geostatistical modelling of material concentrations variability. This paper proposes a method to characterize the aluminum spatial variability in a mine residue from remote sensing data and imprecise information from daily dumping procedures. The method is proposed for the mapping of aluminum within a Greek bauxite residue, using Sentinel-2 imagery. The spatial correlation between metal concentrations and remote sensing indicators (e.g., spectral band ratios) is the premise for mapping aluminum varieties. The proposed method is based on Conditional Gaussian Co-Simulation, where Sentinel-2 images can be used as auxiliary variables. Simulation results are compared with the Co-kriging estimation method. To perform the Co-kriging estimation, the same conditions as simulation are used (same inputs, models, and neighborhoods). Simulation results quantified the metals variability in mining residues, presenting the metal concentration of piled materials in two time periods. For results validation and selecting the best map, fourteen validation samples were used. For the best representative maps of aluminum concentration, a correlation coefficient of about 0.7 between the validation data and obtained aluminum concentration map was obtained.

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of the effectiveness of indoor residual spray with pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic) on malaria transmission in Zambia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Widespread insecticide resistance to pyrethroids could thwart progress towards elimination. Recently, the World Health Organization has encouraged the use of non-pyrethroid insecticides to reduce the spread of insecticide resistance. An electronic tool for implementing and tracking coverage of IRS campaigns has recently been tested (mSpray), using satellite imagery to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the enumeration process. The purpose of this paper is to retrospectively analyse cross-sectional observational data to provide evidence of the epidemiological effectiveness of having introduced Actellic 300CS and the mSpray platform into IRS programmes across Zambia. Methods Health facility catchment areas in 40 high burden districts in 5 selected provinces were initially targeted for spraying. The mSpray platform was used in 7 districts in Luapula Province. An observational study design was used to assess the relationship between IRS exposure and confirmed malaria case incidence. A random effects Poisson model was used to quantify the effect of IRS (with and without use of the mSpray platform) on confirmed malaria case incidence over the period 2013-2017; analysis was restricted to the 4 provinces where IRS was conducted in each year 2014-2016. Results IRS was conducted in 283 health facility catchment areas from 2014 to 2016; 198 health facilities from the same provinces, that received no IRS during this period, served as a comparison. IRS appears to be associated with reduced confirmed malaria incidence; the incidence rate ratio (IRR) was lower in areas with IRS but without mSpray, compared to areas with no IRS (IRR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98). Receiving IRS with mSpray significantly lowered confirmed case incidence (IRR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.86) compared to no IRS. IRS with mSpray resulted in lower incidence compared to IRS without mSpray (IRR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.95). Conclusions IRS using Actellic-CS appears to substantially reduce malaria incidence in Zambia. The use of the mSpray tool appears to improve the effectiveness of the IRS programme, possibly through improved population level coverage. The results of this study lend credence to the anecdotal evidence of the effectiveness of 3GIRS using Actellic, and the importance of exploring new platforms for improving effective population coverage of areas targeted for spraying.

TI  - A machine-learning approach to human footprint index estimation with applications to sustainable development
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The human footprint index (HFI) is an extensively used tool for interpreting the accelerating pressure of humanity on Earth. Up to now, the process of creating the HFI has required significant data and modeling, and updated versions of the index often lag the present day by many years. Here we introduce a near-present, global-scale machine learning-based HFI (ml-HFI) which is capable of routine update using satellite imagery alone. We present the most up-to-date map of the HFI, and document changes in human pressure during the past 20 years (2000-2019). Moreover, we demonstrate its utility as a monitoring tool for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15), 'Life on Land', which aims to foster sustainable development while conserving biodiversity. We identify 43 countries that are making progress toward SDG15 while also experiencing increases in their ml-HFI. We examine a subset of these in the context of conservation policies that may or may not enable continued progress toward SDG15. This has immediate policy relevance, since the majority of countries globally are not on track to achieve Goal 15 by the declared deadline of 2030. Moving forward, the ml-HFI may be used for ongoing monitoring and evaluation support toward the twin goals of fostering a thriving society and global Earth system.Video AbstractVideo Abstract: A machine-learning approach to human footprint index estimation with applications to sustainable development

TI  - Did COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions have an Impact on Biomass Burning Emissions in Sub-Saharan Africa?
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), biomass burning for land clearance, grazing management, and eradication of invasive plant species emit various pollutants into the atmosphere and thus affect air quality, human health, and microclimates. The seasonality of fire events generally follows that of rainfall. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Africa in February 2020, several countries have implemented lockdown regulations that restrict mobility, trade, and other socio-economic activities. It is not clear how the lockdown restrictions would affect wildfire spread, density, and emissions. This study sought to address this gap by analysing changes in Black Carbon (BC), smoke+polluted dust AOD, and Carbon monoxide (CO), as well as the burned area (BA) and fire density using multi-source data at periods consistent with lockdown restrictions. Generally, the results indicated an increase in emissions (CO, BC, smoke+polluted dust AOD) due to COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, increases of 0.008 mol m(-2) in CO and 20% in smoke+polluted dust AOD were observed in the SSA region during COVID-19 lockdown. The majority of emissions resulted from the burning of forest cover (FC), cultivated lands (CL), and shrublands (SL) due to escaped fires from agricultural activities. The BA and fire density were also higher in the COVID-19 year (2020) than the previous year (2019), which was suspected to be caused by the closure of or not fully operated fire authorities due to the COVID-19 lockdown. The increasing biomass burning emissions, as shown here, have important implications for air quality and public health.

TI  - Extended Pseudo Invariant Calibration Site-Based Trend-to-Trend Cross-Calibration of Optical Satellite Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite sensors have been extremely useful and are in massive demand in the understanding of the Earth's surface and monitoring of changes. For quantitative analysis and acquiring consistent measurements, absolute radiometric calibration is necessary. The most common vicarious approach of radiometric calibration is cross-calibration, which helps to tie all the sensors to a common radiometric scale for consistent measurement. One of the traditional methods of cross-calibration is performed using temporally and spectrally stable pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS). This technique is limited by adequate cloud-free acquisitions for cross-calibration which would require a longer time to study the differences in sensor measurements. To address the limitation of traditional PICS-based approaches and to increase the cross-calibration opportunity for quickly achieving high-quality results, the approach presented here is based on using extended pseudo invariant calibration sites (EPICS) over North Africa. With the EPICS-based approach, the area of extent of the cross-calibration site covers a large portion of the North African continent. With targets this large, many sensors should image some portion of EPICS nearlydaily, allowing for evaluation of performance with much greater frequency. By using these near-daily measurements, trends of the sensor's performance are then used to evaluate sensor-to-sensor daily cross-calibration. With the use of the proposed methodology, the dataset for cross-calibration is increased by an order of magnitude compared to traditional approaches, resulting in the differences between any two sensors being detected within a much shorter time. Using this new trend in trend cross-calibration approaches, gains were evaluated for Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel 2A/B, with the results showing that the sensors are calibrated within 2.5% (within less than 8% uncertainty) or better for all sensor pairs, which is consistent with what the traditional PICS-based approach detects. The proposed cross-calibration technique is useful to cross-calibrate any two sensors without the requirement of any coincident or near-coincident scene pairs, while still achieving results similar to traditional approaches in a short time.

TI  - Estimating the national burden of hospitalizations for influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infection in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, 2016
T2  - WESTERN PACIFIC SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Estimates of the burden of influenza are needed to inform prevention and control activities for seasonal influenza, including to support the development of appropriate vaccination policies. We used sentinel surveillance data on severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) to estimate the burden of influenza-associated hospitalizations in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.Methods: Using methods developed by the World Health Organization, we combined data from hospital logbook reviews with epidemiological and virological data from influenza surveillance from 1 January to 31 December 2016 in defined catchment areas for two sentinel sites (Champasack and Luang Prabang provincial hospitals) to derive population-based estimates of influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates. Hospitalization rates by age group were then applied to national age-specific population estimates using 2015 census data.Results: We estimated the overall influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rate to be 48/100 000 population (95% confidence interval [CI]: 44-51) or 3097 admissions (95% CI: 2881-3313). SARI hospitalization rates were estimated to be as low as 40/100 000 population (95% CI: 37-43) and as high as 92/100 000 population (95% CI: 87-98) after accounting for SARI patient underascertainment in hospital logbooks. Influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates were highest in children aged <5 years (219; 95% CI: 198-241) and persons aged >= 65 years (106; 95% CI: 91-121).Discussion: Our findings have identified age groups at higher risk for influenza-associated SARI hospitalization, which will support policy decisions for influenza prevention and control strategies, including for vaccination. Further work is needed to estimate the burdens of outpatient influenza and influenza in specific high-risk subpopulations.

TI  - Use of GIS and Remote Sensing Data to Understand the Impacts of Land Use/Land Cover Changes (LULCC) on Snow Leopard (<i>Panthera uncia</i>) Habitat in Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat degradation and species range contraction due to land use/land cover changes (LULCC) is a major threat to global biodiversity. The ever-growing human population has trespassed deep into the natural habitat of many species via the expansion of agricultural lands and infrastructural development. Carnivore species are particularly at risk, as they demand conserved and well-connected habitat with minimum to no anthropogenic disturbance. In Pakistan, the snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is found in three mountain ranges-the Himalayas, Hindukush, and Karakoram. Despite this being one of the harshest environments on the planet, a large population of humans reside here and exploit surrounding natural resources to meet their needs. Keeping in view this exponentially growing population and its potential impacts on at-risk species like the snow leopard, we used geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing with the aim of identifying and quantifying LULCC across snow leopard range in Pakistan for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020. A massive expansion of 1804.13 km(2) (163%) was observed in the built-up area during the study period. Similarly, an increase of 3177.74 km(2) (153%) was observed in agricultural land. Barren mountain land increased by 12,368.39 km(2) (28%) while forest land decreased by 2478.43 km(2) (28%) and area with snow cover decreased by 14,799.83 km(2) (52%). Drivers of these large-scale changes are likely the expanding human population and climate change. The overall quality and quantity of snow leopard habitat in Pakistan has drastically changed in the last 20 years and could be compromised. Swift and direct conservation actions to monitor LULCC are recommended to reduce any associated negative impacts on species preservation efforts. In the future, a series of extensive field surveys and studies should be carried out to monitor key drivers of LULCC across the observed area.

TI  - Long-Time Interval Satellite Image Analysis on Forest-Cover Changes and Disturbances around Protected Area, Zeya State Nature Reserve, in the Russian Far East
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal forest areas in the Russian Far East contained very large intact forests. This particular area is considered one of the most productive and diverse forests in the boreal biome of the world, and it is also home to many endangered species. Zeya State Nature Reserve is located at the southern margin of the boreal forest area in the Russian Far East and has rich fauna and flora. However, the forest in the region faced large-scale forest fires and clearcutting for timber recently. The information of disturbances is rarely understood. This study aimed to explore the effects of disturbance and forest dynamics around the reserve. Our study used two-year overlaid Landsat images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), to generate forest-cover-change maps of 1988-1999, 1999-2010, and 2010-2016. In this paper, we analyze the direction of forest successional stages, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this protected area in terms of preventing human-based deforestation on the vegetation indices. The vegetation indices included the normalized burn ratio (NBR), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the normalized difference water index (NDWI). The study provided information on the pattern of forest-cover change and disturbance area around the reserve. The NDWI was used to differentiate between water and non-water areas. The mean values of NBR and NDVI were calculated and determine the forest successional stages between burn, vegetation recovery, grass, mixed forest, oak forest, and birch and larch forest. The accuracy was assessed by using field measurements, field photos, and high-resolution images as references. Overall, our classification results have high accuracy for all three periods. The most disturbed area occurred during 2010-2016. The reserve was highly protected, with no human-disturbance activity. However, large areas from fire disturbance were found (137 km(2)) during 1999-2010. The findings also show a large area of disturbance, mostly located outside of the reserve. Mixed disturbance increased to almost 50 km(2) during 2010-2016, in the buffer zone and outside of the reserve. We recommend future works to apply our methods to other ecosystems, to compare the forest dynamics and disturbance inside and outside the protected area.

TI  - Particulate Scattering and Backscattering in Relation to the Nature of Particles in the Red Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of light scattering can be used to quantify the concentration and composition of oceanic particles, and resolve biogeochemical processes spanning different time and space scales. In this paper, we analyze the first dataset, collected over wide spatial scales in the Red Sea, of particulate scattering (b(p)(lambda)), particulate backscattering (b(bp)(lambda)), particulate absorption and chlorophyll-a concentration [Chl_a]. We fit a three-component conceptual model relating b(bp)(lambda) to [Chl_a], assuming a fixed background component (b(bp)(k)(lambda)), and two additional components driven by small (mu m) and large phytoplankton (>2 mu m) (b(bp,1)(lambda) and b(bp,2)(lambda), respectively). We extend the approach, for the first time, to the modeling of total particulate scattering (b(p)(lambda)), allowing us to retrieve the backscattering ratio for each component in the model. We observe a high backscattering ratio for the background component which, when analyzed alongside measurements of particulate absorption, suggests it is likely dominated by non-algal (rather than algal) particles. The high contribution of non-algal particles to b(bp)(lambda) at low [Chl_a] may be related to the unique conditions in the Red Sea, or more broadly, characteristic of other oceanic conditions. The work illustrates how we can combine optical measurements with conceptual models, to understand better the composition of oceanic particles and ultimately, improve monitoring of marine biogeochemical processes. Our work will also be useful for developing regional ocean-color models for the Red Sea.Plain Language Summary The ocean contains a large variety of suspended particles that cover a broad size range, from 0.1 nm to 1 mm, and vary in origin, shape and internal composition. The pool of suspended particles is often divided into non-algal particles and phytoplankton. Most particles play an important role in ocean processes like primary production that modulate the biological carbon pump in the ocean. Concentration and various type of marine particles can be estimated and studied from measurements of light scattering (i.e., particulate backscattering and scattering), and help study and understand biogeochemical processes in aquatic environments. However, separating the contribution from non-algal particles and phytoplankton to scattering properties is challenging given they often covary with phytoplankton biomass in open ocean waters. The particulate backscattering and scattering coefficients were fit to a chlorophyll-a dependent conceptual model that assumed three components: A background component, and small and large phytoplankton populations. We found that the background population is likely dominated by non-algal, rather than algal, particles, which has a major impact on backscattering in Red Sea waters. Our results will help interpret ocean-color remote sensing data to help study marine biogeochemical processes in the Red Sea.

TI  - Satellite Imagery for Monitoring and Mapping Soil Chromium Pollution in a Mine Waste Dump
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Weathering and oxidation of sulphide minerals in mine wastes release toxic elements in surrounding environments. As an alternative to traditional sampling and chemical analysis methods, the capability of proximal and remote sensing techniques was investigated in this study to predict Chromium (Cr) concentration in 120 soil samples collected from a dumpsite in Sarcheshmeh copper mine, Iran. The samples' mineralogy and Cr concentration were determined and were then subjected to laboratory reflectance spectroscopy in the range of Visible-Near Infrared-Shortwave Infrared (VNIR-SWIR: 350-2500 nm). The raw spectra were pre-processed using Savitzky-Golay First-Derivative (SG-FD) and Savitzky-Golay Second-Derivative (SG-SD) algorithms. The important wavelengths were determined using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) coefficients and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR) and PLSR data mining methods were applied to the selected spectral variables to assess Cr concentration. The developed models were then applied to the selected bands of Aster, Hyperion, Sentinel-2A, and Landsat 8-OLI satellite images of the area. Afterwards, rasters obtained from the best prediction model were segmented using a binary fitness function. According to the outputs of the laboratory reflectance spectroscopy, the highest prediction accuracy was obtained using ANN applied to the SD pre-processed spectra with R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 8.73 mg/kg and RPD = 2.76. SD-ANN also showed an acceptable performance on mapping the spatial distribution of Cr using the ordinary kriging technique. Using satellite images, SD-SMLR provided the best prediction models with R2 values of 0.61 and 0.53 for Hyperion and Sentinel-2A, respectively. This led to the higher visual similarity of the segmented Hyperion and Sentinel-2A images with the Cr distribution map. This study's findings indicated that applying the best prediction models obtained by spectroscopy to the selected wavebands of Hyperion and Sentinel-2A satellite imagery could be considered a promising technique for rapid, cost-effective and eco-friendly assessment of Cr concentration in highly heterogeneous mining areas.

TI  - The COVID-19 Vaccine Is Here-Now Who Is Willing to Get It?
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. vaccine campaign against COVID-19 began in December 2020, but many individuals seem reluctant to get vaccinated. During the first week of the vaccination campaign, we collected data from 1017 individuals with an online survey to identify factors that were associated with willingness to get the vaccine once it is available. Most participants (55.3%) were willing to get the vaccine, although 46.2% also expressed some fear of the vaccine. Political ideology was by far the most consistent predictor of both willingness to be vaccinated and fear of the vaccine, followed by participant sex, education level, income, and race/ethnicity. Our findings suggest that, for the vaccine campaign to be broadly supported and successful, it will be important for frontline healthcare workers to discuss the role of inoculation for COVID-19 in a manner consistent with each individual patient's political and sociological worldview.

TI  - Evaluation of Total Ozone Column from Multiple Satellite Measurements in the Antarctic Using the Brewer Spectrophotometer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ground-based ozone observation instrument, Brewer spectrophotometer (Brewer), was used to evaluate the quality of the total ozone column (TOC) produced by multiple polar-orbit satellite measurements at three stations in Antarctica (King Sejong, Jang Bogo, and Zhongshan stations). While all satellite TOCs showed high correlations with Brewer TOCs (R = similar to 0.8 to 0.9), there are some TOC differences among satellite data in austral spring, which is mainly attributed to the bias of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) TOC. The quality of satellite TOCs is consistent between Level 2 and 3 data, implying that "which satellite TOC is used" can induce larger uncertainty than "which spatial resolution is used" for the investigation of the Antarctic TOC pattern. Additionally, the quality of satellite TOC is regionally different (e.g., OMI TOC is a little higher at the King Sejong station, but lower at the Zhongshan station than the Brewer TOC). Thus, it seems necessary to consider the difference of multiple satellite data for better assessing the spatiotemporal pattern of Antarctic TOC.

TI  - Recent updates and current issues of sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - With the increase in the incidence of early gastric cancer (EGC), several endoscopic and laparoscopic approaches, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection and function-preserving gastrectomy, have been accepted as standard treatments. Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) is an ideal surgical option for preservation of most parts of the stomach and consequent maintenance of normal gastric function to improve quality of life in patients with EGC. Although many previous studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the sentinel node concept in gastric cancer, the clinical application of SNNS is debatable. Several issues regarding technical standardization and oncological safety need to be resolved. Recently several studies to resolve these problems are being actively performed, and SNNS might be an important surgical option in the treatment of gastric cancer in the future.

TI  - The Nature of the Eccentric Double-lined Eclipsing Binary System KIC 2306740 with Kepler Space Photometry
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a detailed study of KIC 2306740, an eccentric double-lined eclipsing binary system. Kepler satellite data were combined with spectroscopic data obtained with the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT). This allowed us to determine precise orbital and physical parameters of this relatively long period (P = 10(d).3) and slightly eccentric (e = 0.3) binary system. The physical parameters have been determined to be M-1 = 1.194 +/- 0.008 M-circle dot, M-2 = 1.078 +/- 0.007 M-circle dot, R-1 = 1.682 +/- 0.004 R-circle dot, R-2 = 1.226 +/- 0.005 R-circle dot, L-1 = 2.8 +/- 0.4 L-circle dot, L-2 = 1.8 +/- 0.2 L-circle dot, and orbital separation a = 26.20 +/- 0.04 R-circle dot through simultaneous solutions of the Kepler light curves and WHT radial velocity data. Binarity effects were extracted from the light curve in order to study intrinsic variations in the residuals. Five significant and more than 100 combination frequencies were detected. We modeled the binary system assuming nonconservative evolution models with the Cambridge STARS (TWIN) code, and we show the evolutionary tracks of the components in the log L-logT plane, the log R-log M plane, and the log P-age plane for both spin and orbital periods together with eccentricity e and log R-1. The model of the nonconservative processes in the code led the system to evolve to the observed system parameters in roughly 5.1 Gyr.

TI  - Daytime Sea Surface Temperature Retrieval Incorporating Mid-Wave Imager Measurements: Algorithm Development and Validation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Incorporation of mid-wave infrared (MWIR) channel/s into the prevalent regression-based split-window technique (SWT) for operational daytime sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval is challenging. However, the MWIR channels are highly desirable to obtain unambiguous information from the surface since these channels offer high transparency with respect to the earths atmosphere and are very sensitive to the thermal emission from the surface. On the other hand, the MWIR channel/s can be easily incorporated into any physical-based SST retrieval scheme. Daytime SST retrieval using various physical-based methods is studied and it is found that the physical deterministic sea surface temperature (PDSST) retrieval scheme is the best choice. This article discusses various scientific aspects of the daytime PDSST retrieval including MWIR channels from a theoretical point of view and its application on real data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua. Daytime SST retrievals from PDSST, including MWIR channels, are also compared with the currently operational SWT-based SSTs from MODIS-Aqua and MODIS-Terra by NASA, without MWIR channels. The root-mean-square differences in PDSST from the <italic>in situ</italic> buoys using the global matchup data for daytime MODIS-Aqua SSTs is 0.28 K for complete cloud-free set and is 0.38 K for MODIS-Aqua and MODIS-Terra when quasi-deterministic cloud and error masking algorithm is applied for cloud detection. The information gain is defined by combining the two metrics, quality improvement and the increase in cloud-free data. The PDSST suite rendered two to three times as much information as the NASA-produced daytime regression-based SST.

TI  - Assessing Land Use and Land Cover Change and Farmers' Perceptions of Deforestation and Land Degradation in South-West Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and land degradation remain two major economic and environmental threats in Cote d'Ivoire. This study assessed land use and land cover (LULC) change and farmers' perceptions of the drivers and effects of deforestation and land degradation in south-western Cote d'Ivoire. We used remotely sensed data to determine LULC change trends, and a household survey to collect farmers' perceptions of deforestation and land degradation. A total of 411 households were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and the focus group discussions involved 25 farmers. Landsat image analysis reported a drastic LULC change and a conversion of forestlands into agriculture from 1987 to 2015 at a rate of 1.44%/year and 3.44%/year for dense forests and degraded forests, respectively. The household survey revealed that the major causes of deforestation perceived by farmers included population growth (79.3%), extensive agriculture (72.9%), migration (54.2%) and logging (47.7%). Land degradation evolved, from a shortened fallow period (46.7%) and an inappropriate application of inputs (31.4%). The perceived major effects linked to deforestation encompassed land degradation (70.6%), loss of biodiversity (63.8%), global warming (56.9%) and loss of livelihood assets (54.3%). Therefore, this study recommends participatory landscape planning, reforestation and capacity building of stakeholders for sustainable intensification of the production systems to reduce LULC challenges for enhanced productive and protective functions of remaining forests.

TI  - Impact of Intraseasonal Waves on Angolan Warm and Cold Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The intraseasonal variability of the tropical eastern boundary upwelling region in the Atlantic Ocean is investigated using multiyear mooring and satellite data. Pronounced oscillations of alongshore velocity and sea level off Angola at periods of about 90 and 120 days are observed. Similar spectral peaks are detected along the equator suggesting an equatorial forcing via equatorial and coastally trapped waves. Equatorial variability at 90 days is enhanced only in the eastern Atlantic likely forced by local zonal wind fluctuations. Variability at 120 days is generally stronger and linked to a second equatorial basin mode covering the whole equatorial basin. Besides forcing of the 120-day variability by equatorial zonal winds, additional forcing of the resonant basin mode likely originates in the central and western tropical North Atlantic. The coastally trapped waves generated at the eastern boundary by the impinging equatorial Kelvin waves that are detected through their variations in sea level anomaly are associated with corresponding sea surface temperature anomalies delayed by about 14 days. Off Angola, those intraseasonal waves interfere with major coastal warm and cold events that occur every few years by either enhancing them as for the Benguela Nino in 1995 or damping them as for the warm event in 2001.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring the Multi-Decadal Dynamics of Australia's Open Waterbodies Using Landsat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water detection algorithms are now being routinely applied to continental and global archives of satellite imagery. However, water resource management decisions typically take place at the waterbody rather than pixel scale. Here, we present a workflow for generating polygons of persistent waterbodies from Landsat observations, enabling improved monitoring and management of water assets across Australia. We use Digital Earth Australia's (DEA) Water Observations from Space (WOfS) product, which provides a water classified output for every available Landsat scene, to determine the spatial locations and extents of waterbodies across Australia. We generated a polygon set of waterbodies that identified 295,906 waterbodies ranging in size from 3125 m(2) to 4820 km(2). Each polygon was used to generate a time series of WOfS, providing a history of the change in surface area of each waterbody every similar to 16 days since 1987. We demonstrate the applications of this new dataset, DEA Waterbodies, to understanding local through to national-scale surface water spatio-temporal dynamics. DEA Waterbodies provides new insights into Australia's water availability and enables the monitoring of important landscape features such as lakes and dams, improving our ability to use earth observation data to make meaningful decisions.

TI  - Transmitting Device Identifiers of Implants From the Point of Care to Insurers: A Demonstration Project
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundFor implanted devices, an effective postmarket surveillance system does not exist. For medications, the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel Initiative plays that role, relying mainly on drug codes in insurance claims. Unique device identifiers (UDIs) could play an analogous role for implants, but there is no mandate for providers to include UDIs in claims or for payers to record them. Objections have been raised to incorporating UDIs into claims based on a potential burden on providers. MethodsTo assess this purported barrier, we modified information systems at 2 provider-payer dyads to allow for the transmission of UDI data from provider to payer. In addition, to illustrate the potential benefit of including device data in claims, we used our data to compare rates of 90-day adverse events after implantation using the electronic health record (EHR) alone with the EHR plus claims. ResultsThe software system modifications were modest and performed as designed. Moreover, the level of difficulty of their development and implementation was comparable to that associated with a typical new release of an existing system. In addition, our data demonstrated the ability of claims-based data plus EHR data to reveal a larger percentage of postprocedure adverse events than data from EHRs alone. ConclusionsModifying information systems to allow for the transmission of UDI data from providers to payers should not impose a substantial burden on either. Implementation of a postmarket surveillance system based on such data in claims will require, however, the development of a system analogous to Sentinel.

TI  - Application of Satellite Sentinel-2 Images to Study Alternate Sandbars Movement at Lower Vistula River (Poland)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lower Vistula River was regulated in the years 1856-1878, at a distance of 718-939 km. The regulation plan did not take into consideration the large transport of the bed load. The channel was shaped using simplified geometry-too wide for the low flow and overly straight for the stabilization of the sandbar movement. The hydraulic parameters of the lower Vistula River show high velocities of flow and high shear stress. The movement of the alternate sandbars can be traced on the optical satellite images of Sentinel-2. In this study, a method of sandbar detection through the remote sensing indices, Sentinel Water Mask (SWM) and Automated Water Extraction Index no shadow (AWEInsh), and the manual delineation with visual interpretation (MD) was used on satellite images of the lower Vistula River, recorded at the time of low flows (20 August 2015, 4 September 2016, 30 July 2017, 20 September 2018, and 29 August 2019). The comparison of 32 alternate sandbar areas obtained by SWM, AWEInsh, and MD manual delineation methods on the Sentinel-2 images, recorded on 20 August 2015, was performed by the statistical analysis of the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The distance of the shift in the analyzed time intervals between the image registration dates depends on the value of the mean discharge (MQ). The period from 30 July 2017 to 20 September 2018 was wet (MQ = 1140 m(3) x s(-1)) and created conditions for the largest average distance of the alternate sandbar shift, from 509 to 548 m. The velocity of movement, calculated as an average shift for one day, was between 1.2 and 1.3 m x day(-1). The smallest shift of alternate sandbars was characteristic of the low flow period from 20 August 2015 to 4 September 2016 (MQ = 306 m(3) x s(-1)), from 279 to 310 m, with an average velocity from 0.7 to 0.8 m x day(-1).

TI  - Perceptual Images in the Poetry of Slovak Symbolists (Based on the Original and Translated Poems by Ivan Krasko)
T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides an analysis of perceptual images in the aspect of text-related activities based on the poems by the Slovak symbolist poet Ivan Krasko. The focus is placed on the linguistic means of expressing perceptual semantics which allow exploring the artistic picture of the author's world within the given literary direction. The problem of artistic perception is examined in the context of current research in the field of linguistic semantics and philological analysis of literary texts. In the first part of the article, the authors give a definition of a perceptual image, understood as one of the forms of an artistic image that is filled with a specific lexical and semantic content in the author's individual worldview. A review of the works of Slovak researchers who discuss the features of the symbolist poetry of Ivan Krasko is given. It is emphasized that the creativity of the Slovak symbolist is characterized by poetic parallelism between the internal state of the lyrical hero and their surrounding nature. Sensory perception in the poetry of Ivan Krasko is focused on the awareness and classification of "perceived" objects and phenomena. The second (main) part of the article deals with a comparative linguistic analysis of the original poem "My Songs" and its poetic translation by Anna Akhmatova. The most significant artistic image in the original and translated text is vsednost/ordinariness (everydayness), which reflects the internal state of the lyrical hero and is represented by a wide range of linguistic units with perceptual semantics. The analyzed perceptual images are fog, haze, poplar, mountains, flowers, etc. At the lexical level, there are similar features in the description of the landscape: nouns and adjectives with semantics of visual perception are used - greenness, whiteness, blueness. The differences at the formal-syntactic level are due to the peculiarities of the syntactic structure of the Slovak language and the Russian language, while the propositional semantics generally corresponds. At the stylistic level, minor differences are explained by the author's worldview: in case of Krasko, it is a symbolist worldview; in case of Akhmatova, it is the acmeist worldview. In the original text, the main images are represented by expressions with an abstract meaning: bozie muky dole v cintorine, striebro riavy, v dolinu, vzkvetlu tisicerym kvetom; in translation, the images are more specific: crucifixion, a rose hip, a crest, a cliff. As a result of the comparative analysis of the original and translated texts, the peculiarities of the representation of the perceptual picture of the world of the author and the translator, realized at different text levels, were revealed. Poetic transformations testify to the "special type of perception" characteristic of the Slovak poet as a representative of the symbolist trend.

TI  - A Sentinel Serological Study in Selected Zoo Animals to Assess Early Detection of West Nile and Usutu Virus Circulation in Slovenia
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring infectious diseases is a crucial part of preventive veterinary medicine in zoological collections. This zoo environment contains a great variety of animal species that are in contact with wildlife species as a potential source of infectious diseases. Wild birds may be a source of West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu (USUV) virus, which are both emerging pathogens of rising concern. The aim of this study was to use zoo animals as sentinels for the early detection of WNV and USUV in Slovenia. In total, 501 sera from 261 animals of 84 animal species (including birds, rodents, lagomorphs, carnivores, ungulates, reptiles, equids, and primates) collected for 17 years (2002-2018) were tested for antibodies to WNV and USUV. Antibodies to WNV were detected by indirect immunofluorescence tests in 16 (6.1%) of 261 animals representing 10 species, which were sampled prior to the first active cases of WNV described in 2018 in Slovenia in humans, a horse, and a hooded crow (Corvus cornix). Antibodies to USUV were detected in 14 out of 261 animals tested (5.4%) that were positive prior to the first positive cases of USUV infection in common blackbirds (Turdus merula) in Slovenia. The study illustrates the value of zoological collections as a predictor of future emerging diseases.

TI  - Lower Crustal Earthquakes in the March 2018 Sequence Along the Western Margin of Afar
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the evolution of continental rift systems, extension is thought to progressively focus in-rift to the future breakup boundary while faults along the rift margins progressively deactivate. However, observational constraints on how strain is partitioned between rift axis and rift margins are still lacking. The Afar rift records the latest stages of rifting and incipient continental breakup. Here, we analyzed the recent M-W 5.2 earthquake on the Western Afar Margin on March 24, 2018 and the associated seismic sequence of >500 earthquakes using 24 temporary seismic stations deployed during 2017-2018. We show seismicity occurring at lower crustal depths, from similar to 15 to similar to 30 km, with focal mechanisms and relocated earthquakes highlighting both west-dipping and east-dipping normal faults. We tested earthquake depth using InSAR by processing six independent interferograms using Sentinel-1 data acquired from both ascending and descending tracks. None of them shows evidence of surface deformation. We tested possible ranges of depth by producing forward models for a fault located at progressively increasing depths. Models show that surface deformation is not significant for fault slip at depths greater than 15 km, in agreement with the hypocentral depth of 19 km derived from seismic data for the largest earthquake. Due to the localized nature of deep earthquakes near hot springs coupled with subsurface evidence for magmatism, we favor an interpretation of seismicity induced by migrating fluids such as magma or CO2. We suggest that deep fluid migration can occur at the rifted-margin influencing seismicity during incipient continental rupture.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node processing in gynecological cancer histopathology and molecular biology
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - As sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are the first nodes receiving drainage from primary tumors, they provide important prognostic information about the nodal status of a tumor. SLN biopsy has modified the lymph node assessment by pathologists. This review highlights the different ways of histopathological and molecular SLN assessment according to the different gynecological cancers. Other than in breast cancer and melanoma, frozen section (FS) analysis of SLN in gynecological malignancies is still considered an important diagnostic tool. Intraoperative evaluation of the SLN allows to determine the need of completing lymph node dissection in case of metastasis. Intraoperative FS has a high negative predictive value (NPV) and is more sensitive than imprint cytology (IC) alone. If on intraoperative examination on FS the SLN is negative, subsequent analysis of the entire lymph node and histological ultrastadification has the potential to detect occult low volume metastases or to ascertain that a SLN is really negative. This reduces the morbidity compared to systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection. Inclusion of the entire lymph node tissue in paraffin blocks after cutting it in 2 mm thick slices and histopathological ultrastaging with serial sections provides important prognostic information about the need of adjuvant treatment. Three sections at 200-250 mu m seem to identify the majority of micrometastases. This review discusses different histopathological protocols and molecular [qRT-PCR and one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA (R))] aspects of SLN evaluation in gynecological cancer.

TI  - The InflateSAR Campaign: Testing SAR Vessel Detection Systems for Refugee Rubber Inflatables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Countless numbers of people lost their lives at Europe's southern borders in recent years in the attempt to cross to Europe in small rubber inflatables. This work examines satellite-based approaches to build up future systems that can automatically detect those boats. We compare the performance of several automatic vessel detectors using real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from X-band and C-band sensors on TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1. The data was collected in an experimental campaign where an empty boat lies on a lake's surface to analyse the influence of main sensor parameters (incidence angle, polarization mode, spatial resolution) on the detectability of our inflatable. All detectors are implemented with a moving window and use local clutter statistics from the adjacent water surface. Among tested detectors are well-known intensity-based (CA-CFAR), sublook-based (sublook correlation) and polarimetric-based (PWF, PMF, PNF, entropy, symmetry and iDPolRAD) approaches. Additionally, we introduced a new version of the volume detecting iDPolRAD aimed at detecting surface anomalies and compare two approaches to combine the volume and the surface in one algorithm, producing two new highly performing detectors. The results are compared with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, enabling us to compare detectors independently of threshold selection.

TI  - Deep Learning Classification of Cheatgrass Invasion in the Western United States Using Biophysical and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invasion is driving an emerging cycle of increased fire frequency and irreversible loss of wildlife habitat in the western US. Yet, detailed spatial information about its occurrence is still lacking for much of its presumably invaded range. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated success for remote sensing applications but is less tested on more challenging tasks like identifying biological invasions using sub-pixel phenomena. We compare two DL architectures and the more conventional Random Forest and Logistic Regression methods to improve upon a previous effort to map cheatgrass occurrence at >2% canopy cover. High-dimensional sets of biophysical, MODIS, and Landsat-7 ETM+ predictor variables are also compared to evaluate different multi-modal data strategies. All model configurations improved results relative to the case study and accuracy generally improved by combining data from both sensors with biophysical data. Cheatgrass occurrence is mapped at 30 m ground sample distance (GSD) with an estimated 78.1% accuracy, compared to 250-m GSD and 71% map accuracy in the case study. Furthermore, DL is shown to be competitive with well-established machine learning methods in a limited data regime, suggesting it can be an effective tool for mapping biological invasions and more broadly for multi-modal remote sensing applications.

TI  - Testing and Validating the Suitability of Geospatially Informed Proxies on Land Tenure in North Korea for Korean (Re-)Unification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of remote sensing data in detecting, estimating, and monitoring socioeconomic status (SES) such as quality of life dimensions and sustainable development prospects has received increased attention. Geospatial data has emerged as powerful source of information for enabling both socio-technical assessment and socio-legal analysis in land administration domain. In the context of Korean (re-)unification, there is a notable paucity of evidence how to identify unknowns in North Korea. The main challenge is the lack of complete and adequate information when it comes to clarifying unknown land tenure relations and land governance arrangements. Deriving informative land tenure relations from geospatial data in line with socio-economic land attributes is currently the most innovative approach. In-close and in-depth investigations of validating the suitability of a set of geospatially informed proxies combining multiple values were taken into consideration, as were the forms of knowledge co-production. Thus, the primary aim is to provide empirical evidence of whether proposed proxies are scientifically valid, policy-relevant, and socially robust. We revealed differences in the distributions of agreements relating to land ownership and land transfer rights identification among scientists, bureaucrats, and stakeholders. Moreover, we were able to measure intrinsic, contextual, representational, and accessibility attributes of information quality regarding the associations between earth observation (EO) data and land tenure relations in North Korea from a number of different viewpoints. This paper offers valuable insights into new techniques for validating suitability of EO data proxies in the land administration domain off the reliance on conventional practices formed and customized to the specific artefacts and guidelines of the remote sensing community.

TI  - Role of cultural worldview in predicting heritage tourists' behavioural intention
T2  - LEISURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited attention has been given to the investigation of how cultural worldview (CW) affects tourists' behavioural intention in heritage tourism sites. Thus, this study aims to examine the role of CW in predicting heritage tourists' behavioural intention by employing two seminal behaviour models, the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB). The data were collected from 323 heritage travellers who visited Hanok Village in South Korea, where approximately 735 Hanoks (traditional Korean house) were preserved as a popular tourist attraction. The study's findings demonstrate that tourists' CW can be an important variable in the prediction and understanding of behavioural intention among heritage tourists and may serve as a proxy for perceived behavioural control. This study also identified that subjective norm was the strongest predictor of behavioural intention among heritage travellers. The overall results support that a positive attitude towards visiting a heritage village, which features Hanoks, strong normative support in their visit intention, and strong CW was positively associated with the behavioural intention of the heritage travellers. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed to enhance the heritage visitors' attitude, perception, and behavioural intention.

TI  - Reduction of False Alarm Rate in SAR-MTI Based on Weighted Kurtosis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moving target indication (MTI) is considered one of the most important applications of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in military operations and traffic monitoring. Although many studies have focused on detectors based on the statistical clutter models, a mismatch between the measured data and the applied statistical model often leads to unreliable MTI results, particularly in terms of false alarm rates. To reduce the number of false alarms, we propose an efficient MTI scheme consisting of conventional MTI techniques (the displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) and the interferogram s magnitude and phase (IMP) methods), which operate in dual-receive antenna (DRA) mode in an SAR system. These techniques are coupled with a new discrimination stage based on a new detection metric weighted kurtosis. Using simulated and real measured data from TerraSAR-X, the proposed MTI scheme demonstrates robust performance in the reduction of false alarm rates with only a slight increase in the computation time compared with conventional schemes.

TI  - Modeling and Prediction of Land Use Land Cover Change Dynamics Based on Land Change Modeler (LCM) in Nashe Watershed, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Change of land use land cover (LULC) has been known globally as an essential driver of environmental change. Assessment of LULC change is the most precise method to comprehend the past land use, types of changes to be estimated, the forces and developments behind the changes. The aim of the study was to assess the temporal and spatial LULC dynamics of the past and to predict the future using Landsat images and LCM (Land Change Modeler) by considering the drivers of LULC dynamics. The research was conducted in Nashe watershed (Ethiopia) which is the main tributary of the Upper Blue Nile basin. The total watershed area is 94,578 ha. The Landsat imagery from 2019, 2005, and 1990 was used for evaluating and predicting the spatiotemporal distributions of LULC changes. The future LULC image prediction has been generated depending on the historical trends of LULC changes for the years 2035 and 2050. LCM integrated in TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling System assimilated with MLP and CA-Markov chain have been used for monitoring, assessment of change, and future projections. Markov chain was used to generate transition probability matrices between LULC classes and cellular automata were used to predict the LULC map. Validation of the predicted LULC map of 2019 was conducted successfully with the actual LULC map. The validation accuracy was determined using the Kappa statistics and agreement/disagreement marks. The results of the historical LULC depicted that forest land, grass land, and range land are the most affected types of land use. The agricultural land in 1990 was 41,587.21 ha which increased to 57,868.95 ha in 2019 with an average growth rate of 39.15%. The forest land, range land, and grass land declined annually with rates of 48.38%, 19.58%, and 26.23%, respectively. The predicted LULC map shows that the forest cover will further degrade from 16.94% in 2019 to 8.07% in 2050, while agricultural land would be expanded to 69,021.20 ha and 69,264.44 ha in 2035 and 2050 from 57,868.95 ha in 2019. The findings of this investigation indicate an expected rapid change in LULC for the coming years. Converting the forest area, range land, and grass land into other land uses, especially to agricultural land, is the main LULC change in the future. Measures should be implemented to achieve rational use of agricultural land and the forest conversion needs to be well managed.

Here, we examined the utility of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) observations from NASA's L-band Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission for the prediction of leaf area index (LAI), a common metric of canopy phenology. We leveraged mutual information theory to determine whether SM and VOD contain information about the temporal dynamics of LAI that is not contained in traditional LAI predictors (i.e., precipitation, temperature, and radiation) and known LAI climatology. We found that adding SMAP SM and VOD to multivariate non-linear empirical models to predict daily LAI anomalies improved model fit and reduced error by 5.2% compared with models including only traditional LAI predictors and LAI climatology (average R-2 = 0.22 vs. 0.15 and unbiased root mean square error [ubRMSE] = 0.130 vs. 0.137 for cross-validated models with and without SM and VOD, respectively). SMAP SM and VOD made the more improvement in model fit in grasslands (R-2 = 0.24 vs. 0.16 and ubRMSE = 0.118 vs. 0.126 [5.7% reduction] for models with and without SM and VOD, respectively); model predictions were least improved in shrublands. Analysis of feature importance indicates that LAI climatology and temperature were overall the two most informative variables for LAI anomaly prediction. SM was more important in drier regions, whereas VOD was consistently the second least important factor. Variations in total LAI were mostly explained by local daily LAI climatology. On average, the R(2)s and ubRMSE of total LAI predictions by the traditional drivers and its climatology are 0.81 and 0.137, respectively. Adding SMAP SM and VOD to these existing predictors improved the R(2)s to 0.83 (0.02 improvement in R(2)s) and reduced the ubRMSE to 0.13 (5.2% reduction). Though these improvements were modest on average, in locations where LAI climatology is not reflective of LAI dynamics and anomalies are larger, we find SM and VOD to be considerably more useful for LAI prediction. Overall, we find that L-band SM and VOD observations can be useful for prediction of LAI, though the informational contribution varies with land cover and environmental conditions.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass Using Sentinel-2 MSI Data and Ensemble Algorithms for Grassland in the Shengjin Lake Wetland, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland vegetation aboveground biomass (AGB) directly indicates wetland ecosystem health and is critical for water purification, carbon cycle, and biodiversity conservation. Accurate AGB estimation is essential for the monitoring and supervision of ecosystems, especially in seasonal floodplain wetlands. This paper explored the capability of spectral and texture features from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) for modeling grassland AGB using random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms in Shengjin Lake wetland (a Ramsar site). We use five-fold cross-validation to verify the model effectiveness. The results indicated that the RF and XGBoost models had a robust and efficient performance (with root mean square error (RMSE) of 126.571 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.844 for RF, RMSE of 112.425 g center dot m(-2) and R-2 of 0.869 for XGBoost), and the XGBoost models, by contrast, performed better. Both traditional and red-edge vegetation indices (VIs) obtained satisfactory results of AGB estimation (RMSE = 127.936 g center dot m(-2), RMSE = 125.879 g center dot m(-2) in XGBoost models, respectively), with the red-edge VIs contributed more to the AGB models. Moreover, we selected eight gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures calculated by four processing window sizes using the mean value of four offsets, and further analyzed the results of three analysis sets. Textures derived from traditional and red-edge bands using a 7 x 7 window size performed better in biomass estimation. This finding suggested that textures derived from the traditional bands were as important as the red-edge bands. The introduction of textures moderately improved the accuracy of modeling AGB, whereas the use of textures alo ne was not satisfactory. This research demonstrated that using the Sentinel-2 MSI and the two ensemble algorithms is an effective method for long-term dynamic monitoring and assessment of grass AGB in seasonal floodplain wetlands, which can support sustainable management and carbon accounting of wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Automated Global Shallow Water Bathymetry Mapping Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global shallow water bathymetry maps offer critical information to inform activities such as scientific research, environment protection, and marine transportation. Methods that employ satellite-based bathymetric modeling provide an alternative to conventional shipborne measurements, offering high spatial resolution combined with extensive coverage. We developed an automated bathymetry mapping approach based on the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance dataset in Google Earth Engine. We created a new method for generating a clean-water mosaic and a tailored automatic bathymetric estimation algorithm. We then evaluated the performance of the models at six globally diverse sites (Heron Island, Australia; West Coast of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai Island, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai; Saona Island, Dominican Republic; Punta Cana, Dominican Republic; St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands; and The Grenadines) using 113,520 field bathymetry sampling points. Our approach derived accurate bathymetry maps in shallow waters, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values ranging from 1.2 to 1.9 m. This automatic, efficient, and robust method was applied to map shallow water bathymetry at the global scale, especially in areas which have high biodiversity (i.e., coral reefs).

TI  - Retrieval of Snow Depth on Arctic Sea Ice from the FY3B/MWRI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given their high albedo and low thermal conductivity, snow and sea ice are considered key reasons for amplified warming in the Arctic. Snow-covered sea ice is a more effective insulator, which greatly limits the energy and momentum exchange between the atmosphere and surface, and further controls the thermal dynamic processes of snow and ice. In this study, using the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS), the sensitivities of the brightness temperatures (TBs) from the FengYun-3B/MicroWave Radiometer Imager (FY3B/MWRI) to changes in snow depth were simulated, on both first-year and multiyear ice in the Arctic. Further, the correlation coefficients between the TBs and snow depths in different atmospheric and sea ice environments were investigated. Based on the simulation results, the most sensitive factors to snow depth, including channels of MWRI and their combination form, were determined for snow depth retrieval. Finally, using the 2012-2013 Operational IceBridge (OIB) snow depth data, retrieval algorithms of snow depth were developed for the Arctic on first-year and multiyear ice, separately. Validation using the 2011 OIB data indicates that the bias and standard deviation (Std) of the algorithm are 2.89 cm and 2.6 cm on first-year ice (FYI), respectively, and 1.44 cm and 4.53 cm on multiyear ice (MYI), respectively.

TI  - Urban Thermal Characteristics of Local Climate Zones and Their Mitigation Measures across Cities in Different Climate Zones of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the urban thermal environment is vital for improving urban planning and strategy development when mitigating urban heat islands. However, urban thermal characteristics of local climate zones (LCZ) are different within cities and most studies lack regional perspective. This study explored surface thermal performances of cities in three urban agglomerations (Jing-Jin-Ji, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta) in China using MODIS land surface temperature (LST). Besides that, the diurnal and seasonal LST variations of LCZs are also studied. Moreover, the optimal LCZs for better urban cooling are also investigated in this study. Although the thermal distributions of LCZs are different in China, there are still some similar features. Our four key findings were as follows. (1) LCZs in China are well classified, with average overall accuracy of 82% being higher than that in some previous studies. (2) The LST of mid-rise (LCZ 2, 5) is higher than that of high- and low-rise buildings (LCZ 1, 3, 4, 6); and compact buildings are warmer than open buildings (LCZ 1-3 > LST 4-6) in summer of China. That shows both mid-rise and compact buildings are not beneficial to cool urban. In addition, LST variations at daytime and in summer are more significant than nighttime and other seasons. (3) LST differences within LCZs are significant at p < 0.05, and are most significant in Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ). The LST difference within built types (LCZ 1-10) is more significant than within natural types (LCZ A-G), showing that built types alteration will be more effective for thermal environmental improvement. (4) Under the current population and urban area, increasing greenness and water area in compact high-rise buildings are the most effective strategies for urban cooling in all three urban agglomerations, with the largest reduction in LST of 4.11 K in JJJ. These findings will provide support for thermal environment mitigation, urban planning and sustainable urban development.

TI  - Assessment on IMERG V06 Precipitation Products Using Rain Gauge Data in Jinan City, Shandong Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a comprehensive assessment on precipitation estimation from the latest Version 06 release of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) algorithm is conducted by using 24 rain gauge observations at daily scale from 2001 to 2016. The IMERG V06 dataset fuses Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data (2000-2015) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite data (2014-present), enabling the use of IMERG data for long-term study. Correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), relative bias (RB), probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), and critical success index (CSI) were used to assess the accuracy of satellite-derived precipitation estimation and measure the correspondence between satellite-derived and observed occurrence of precipitation events. The probability density distributions of precipitation intensity and influence of elevation on precipitation estimation were also examined. Results showed that, with high CC and low RMSE and RB, the IMERG Final Run product (IMERG-F) performs better than two other IMERG products at daily, monthly, and yearly scales. At daily scale, the ability of satellite products to detect general precipitation is clearly superior to the ability to detect heavy and extreme precipitation. In addition, CC and RMSE of IMERG products are high in Southeastern Jinan City, while RMSE is relatively low in Southwestern Jinan City. Considering the fact that the IMERG estimation of extreme precipitation indices showed an acceptable level of accuracy, IMERG products can be used to derive extreme precipitation indices in areas without gauged data. At all elevations, IMERG-F exhibits a better performance than the other two IMERG products. However, POD and FAR decrease and CSI increase with the increase of elevation, indicating the need for improvement. This study will provide valuable information for the application of IMERG products at the scale of a large city.

TI  - Estimating the Impact of COVID-19 on the PM<sub>2.5</sub> Levels in China with a Satellite-Driven Machine Learning Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China implemented an aggressive nationwide lockdown procedure immediately after the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020. As China emerges from the impact of COVID-19 on national economic and industrial activities, it has become the site of a large-scale natural experiment to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on regional air quality. However, ground measurements of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) concentrations do not offer comprehensive spatial coverage, especially in suburban and rural regions. In this study, we developed a machine learning method with satellite aerosol remote sensing data, meteorological fields and land use parameters as major predictor variables to estimate spatiotemporally resolved daily PM2.5 concentrations in China. Our study period consists of a reference semester (1 November 2018-30 April 2019) and a pandemic semester (1 November 2019-30 April 2020), with six modeling months in each semester. Each period was then divided into subperiod 1 (November and December), subperiod 2 (January and February) and subperiod 3 (March and April). The reference semester model obtained a 10-fold cross-validated R-2 (RMSE) of 0.79 (17.55 mu g/m(3)) and the pandemic semester model obtained a 10-fold cross-validated R-2 (RMSE) of 0.83 (13.48 mu g/m(3)) for daily PM2.5 predictions. Our prediction results showed high PM2.5 concentrations in the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, Sichuan Basin and Xinjiang Autonomous Region during the reference semester. PM2.5 levels were lowered by 4.8 mu g/m(3) during the pandemic semester compared to the reference semester and PM2.5 levels during subperiod 2 decreased most, by 18%. The southeast region was affected most by the COVID-19 outbreak with PM2.5 levels during subperiod 2 decreasing by 31%, followed by the Northern Yangtze River Delta (29%) and Pearl River Delta (24%).

TI  - A Preliminary Investigation of Arctic Sea Ice Negative Freeboard from <i>in-situ</i> Observations and Radar Altimetry
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The negative freeboard of sea ice (i.e., the height of ice surface below sea level) with subsequent flooding is widespread in the Southern Ocean, as opposed to the Arctic, due to the relatively thicker ice and thinner snow. In this study, we used the observations of snow and ice thickness from 103 ice mass balance buoys (IMBs) and NASA Operation IceBridge Aircraft Missions to investigate the spatial distribution of negative freeboard of Arctic sea ice. The Result showed that seven IMBs recorded negative freeboards, which were sporadically located in the seas around Northeast Greenland, the Central Arctic Ocean, and the marginal areas of the Chukchi-Beaufort Sea. The observed maximum values of negative freeboard could reach -0.12 m in the seas around Northeast Greenland. The observations from IceBridge campaigns also revealed negative freeboard comparable to those of IMBs in the seas around North Greenland and the Beaufort Sea. We further investigated the large-scale distribution of negative freeboard using NASA CryoSat-2 radar altimeter data, and the result indicates that except for the negative freeboard areas observed by IMBs and IceBridge, there are negative freeboards in other marginal seas of the Arctic Ocean. However, the comparison of the satellite data with the IMB data and IceBridge data shows that the Cryosat-2 data generally overestimate the extent and magnitude of the negative freeboard in the Arctic.

TI  - Ecological quality evaluation and influencing factors analysis of Helan Mountain based on RSEI
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the relationship between ecological quality change and climate and topography in Helan Mountain from 1989 to 2017, with multi -temporal Landsat data, RSEI ( remote sensing ecological index), SRTM DEM data, Chinese meteorological data and spatial distribution data of vegetation types. The RSEI obtained by coupling WET, NDVI, SI and LST could comprehensively reflect ecological quality, with the load value of NDVI being the highest. From 1989 to 2017, the average value of RSEI in the study area showed an uptrend, with a range of 0.28490.3671 and an annual growth rate of 0.0058. The RSEI-improved area was 14.6 times of the RSEI-degraded area. The excellent and good levels of RSEI were mainly distributed in forest areas, while the variation coefficient of eco-environment in these regions was small. The moderate, low and poor grades of RSEI were mainly distributed in desert and grassland covered areas, which were mainly the areas of eco-environment improvement. A total of 9.29% areas with correlation between RSEI and temperature passed the significance test (P<0.05), and 12.51% of the areas with correlation between RSEI and precipitation passed the significance test ( P <0.05). The response of RSEI to precipitation was stronger than that to temperature. The best ecological quali- ty area of Helan Mountain was located in altitude 2500-3000 m and slope 35 -40. Although the ecological environment of Helan Mountain is slowly getting better, the overall ecological quality is still extremely fragile. There is still a long way to go for ecological protection in this area.

TI  - Extraction of Sea Ice Cover by Sentinel-1 SAR Based on Support Vector Machine With Unsupervised Generation of Training Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we focus on developing a novel method to extract sea ice cover (i.e., discrimination/classification of sea ice and open water) using Sentinel-1 (S1) cross-polarization [vertical horizontal (VH) or horizontal vertical (HV)] data in extra-wide (EW) swath mode based on the support vector machine (SVM) method. The classification basis includes the S1 radar backscatter and texture features, which are calculated from S1 data using the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Different from previous methods where appropriate samples are manually selected to train the SVM to classify sea ice and open water, we proposed a method of unsupervised generation of the training samples based on two GLCM texture features, i.e., entropy and homogeneity, that have contrasting characteristics on sea ice and open water. We eliminate the most uncertainty of selecting training samples in machine learning and achieve automatic classification of sea ice and open water by using S1 EW data. The comparisons based on a few cases show good agreements between the synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived sea ice cover using the proposed method and visual inspections, of which the accuracy reaches approximately 90 5. Besides this, compared with the analyzed sea ice cover data Ice Mapping System (IMS) based on 728 S1 EW images, the accuracy of the extracted sea ice cover by using S1 data is more than 80.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics in assimilated-LAI phenology and its impact on subtropical bamboo forest productivity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology has a significant effect on forest growth and directly affects the forest ecosystem carbon cycle. Bamboo forests possess strong carbon sequestration capacities. However, it is not clear whether variations in phenology increase or decrease carbon uptake and storage in subtropical bamboo forests. We first extracted the length of the growing season (LOS) by coupling a data assimilation algorithm and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) data, and then the LOS was used to drive the integrated terrestrial ecosystem carbon-budget (InTEC) model to simulate gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in Zhejiang Province from 2001 to 2017. Our results showed that the LOS estimation using the assimilated LAI time series was more reliable than that of the MODIS LAI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The annual average LOS increased on average by 0.76 day yr(-1) from 2001 to 2017. The GPP and NEP simulations based on the LAI assimilation-based phenology indicated that bamboo forest ecosystems possess strong carbon sequestration capacities and act as carbon sinks, with mean annual GPP and NEP values of 434.74 +/- 257.93 g C m(-2) 2 yr(-1) and 141.42 +/- 82.54 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, during 2001-2017. An increase of one day in the regional annual LOS increases the annual average GPP and NEP by 1.34 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.75 g C m(-2) yr(-1,) respectively. Moreover, the interannual variation of NEP was significantly correlated with precipitation and temperature, whereas GPP was not. Our results demonstrated that phenology extraction based on LAI data assimilation should play an important role in the simulation of bamboo forest productivity with ecological process models. The variation in phenology induced by climate change can strengthen the bamboo forest carbon sink, which is of great significance for subtropical forests coping with climate change in the future.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Spatial Scales on Regional Evapotranspiration Estimation by the SEBAL Model and Multiple Satellite Datasets: A Case Study in the Agro-Pastoral Ecotone, Northwestern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is important for understanding energy exchanges and water cycles. Remote sensing (RS) is the main method used to obtain ET data over large scales. However, owing to surface heterogeneities and different model algorithms, ET estimated from RS products with different spatial resolutions can cause significant uncertainties, whose causes need to be thoroughly analyzed. In this study, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model was selected to explore spatial resolution influences on ET simulations. Three satellite datasets (Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) were selected to independently estimate ET in SEBAL model to identify the influence of the spatial scale on ET estimation, and analyze the effects and causes of scale aggregation. Results indicated that: (1) the spatial distributions of ET estimated from the three satellite datasets were similar, with the MODIS-based ET having the largest uncertainty; and (2) aggregating input parameters had limited changes in the net radiation and soil heat fluxes. However, errors in the sensible heat and latent heat fluxes were relatively larger, which were caused by changes in the selection of hot and cold pixels and the NDVI and surface albedo parameters during scale aggregation. The scale errors caused by the model mechanisms were larger than those caused by the land use/cover pattern in the SEBAL model. Overall, this study highlights the impact of spatial scale on ET and provides a better understanding of the scale aggregation effect on ET estimation by RS.

TI  - Cropland Abandonment in Slovakia: Analysis and Comparison of Different Data Sources
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - d This study compares different nationwide multi-temporal spatial data sources and analyzes the cropland area, cropland abandonment rates and transformation of cropland to other land cover/land use categories in Slovakia. Four multi-temporal land cover/land use data sources were used: The Historic Land Dynamics Assessment (HILDA), the Carpathian Historical Land Use Dataset (CHLUD), CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data and Landsat images classification. We hypothesized that because of the different spatial, temporal and thematic resolution of the datasets, there would be differences in the resulting cropland abandonment rates. We validated the datasets, compared the differences, interpreted the results and combined the information from the different datasets to form an overall picture of long-term cropland abandonment in Slovakia. The cropland area increased until the Second World War, but then decreased after transition to the communist regime and sharply declined following the 1989 transition to an open market economy. A total of 49% of cropland area has been transformed to grassland, 34% to forest and 15% to urban areas. The Historical Carpathian dataset is the more reliable long-term dataset, and it records 19.65 km(2)/year average cropland abandonment for 1836-1937, 154.44 km(2)/year for 1938-1955 and 140.21 km(2)/year for 1956-2012. In comparison, the Landsat, as a recent data source, records 142.02 km(2)/year abandonment for 1985-2000 and 89.42 km(2)/year for 2000-2010. These rates, however, would be higher if the dataset contained urbanisation data and more precise information on afforestation. The CORINE Land Cover reflects changes larger than 5 ha, and therefore the reported cropland abandonment rates are lower.

TI  - Research on spatial expansion mode of laver farming area in Jiangsu Province
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to accurately implement the dynamic monitoring and effective management of the use of sea areas, the spatial expansion model of Jiangsu offshore laver cultivation area was studied. Four phase Landsat remote sensing image of 1990, 2000, 2013 and 2018 were selected as data sources, using object oriented classification method to extract offshore of Jiangsu laver culture zones. Then the spatial distributions of Jiangsu coastal laver farming area are calculated respectively for 1990, 2000, 2013 and 2018. The change trend analysis reveals the space distribution characteristics and the spatial expansion of Jiangsu coastal laver culture zones. The results show that: 1) In 1990, 2000, 2013 and 2018, the areas of coastal laver farming in Jiangsu are 804.69 hm2, 6 097.95 hm(2), 29 453.29 hm(2) and 42 316.98 hm(2) respectively, showing a trend of increasing year by year. 2) Jiangsu offshore laver breeding areas are mainly distributed in the sea area of Lianyungang and the junction of Yancheng and Nantong. 3) Based on the spatial distribution pattern of laver cultivation areas in 2018, there are unreasonable sea use behaviors of laver cultivation in some shipping areas and special utilization areas of Jiangsu offshore ports. 4) The expansion mode of laver cultivation in Lianyungang sea area is mainly filled type with increased density, while the expansion mode of laver cultivation in Yancheng Nantong sea area is mainly extended type with increased density. This study can provide the basic data of spatial distribution and expansion mode of Jiangsu offshore laver cultivation area for relevant marine administrative departments, and also provide decision support for controlling the scale of Jiangsu offshore laver cultivation and optimizing the layout of marine industry.

TI  - Rapid Mapping of Large-Scale Greenhouse Based on Integrated Learning Algorithm and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A greenhouse is an important land-use type, which can effectively improve agricultural production conditions and increase crop yields. It is of great significance to obtain the spatial distribution data of greenhouses quickly and accurately for regional agricultural production and food security. Based on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform and Landsat 8 images, this study selected a total of 18 indicators from three aspects of spectral features, texture features and terrain features to construct greenhouse identification features. From a variety of classification algorithms for remote-sensing recognition of greenhouses, this study selected three classifiers with higher accuracy (classification and regression trees (CART), random forest model (randomForest) and maximum entropy model (gmoMaxEnt)) to construct an integrated classification algorithm, and then extracted the spatial distribution data of greenhouses in Jiangsu Province. The results show that: (1) Google Earth Engine with its own massive data and cloud computing capabilities, combined with integrated classification algorithms, can achieve rapid remote-sensing mapping of large-scale greenhouses under complex terrain, and the classification accuracy is higher than that of a single classification algorithm. (2) The combination of different spectral, texture and terrain features has a greater impact on the extraction of regional greenhouses, the combination of all three aspects of features has the highest accuracy. Spectral features are the key factors for greenhouse remote-sensing mapping, but terrain and texture features can also enhance classification accuracy. (3) The greenhouse in Jiangsu Province has significant spatial differentiation and spatial agglomeration characteristics. The most widely distributed greenhouses are mainly concentrated in the agriculturally developed areas such as Dongtai City, Hai'an County, Rudong County and Pizhou City.

TI  - Long-term cross calibration of HJ-1A CCD1 and Terra MODIS reflective solar bands
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its launch on September 6, 2008, HJ-1A has been in the orbit for 13 years. The CCD1 sensor on the HJ-1A has four reflected solar bands. Since the calibration frequency is limited to the annual site calibration, cross-calibration is an effective method to improve the calibration frequency. In this paper, we use 420 image pairs of HJ-1A CCD1 and Terra MODIS over the Dunhuang test site for gains calculation, where we take MODIS as the reference sensor. The spectral band adjustment factors (SBAFs) for cross-calibration are then calculated to compensate for the spectral mismatch. The cross-calibration results are also validated by the field calibration results. From 2008 to 2019, a total of six campaigns have been cross-calibrated on the same day. The gain difference between the site calibration and cross-calibration is less than 3%. The long-term cross-calibration results further indicate that due to the adjustment of HJ-1A CCD gain state in October 2009, an abrupt change occurred 405 days after launch. After 12 years of on-orbit operation, the attenuation rate has reached 23.51%, 21.89%, 8.11%, and 13.37%, respectively by the end of 2019 based on the cross-calibration results.

TI  - Global search for temporal shifts in fire activity: potential human influence on southwest Russia and north Australia fire seasons
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Decadal trends in fire activity can reveal important human and climate-driven influences across a multitude of landscapes from croplands to savannas. We use 16 years of daily satellite observations from 2003 to 2018 to search globally for stationary temporal shifts in fire activity during the primary burning season. We focus on southwest Russia and north Australia as case study regions; both regions experienced nearly 40 d shifts over a 16 year period but in opposite directions. In southwest Russia, a major wheat-growing region, we trace the delay in post-harvest fires to several potential drivers: modernization in the agricultural system and recent droughts, followed by government restrictions on wheat exports. In north Australia, prescribed burns in the early dry season are a key practice in Aboriginal fire management of savannas, and the increasing trend of such fires has limited the size and extent of fast-spreading late dry season fires, thereby shifting overall fire activity earlier. In both regions, human action, through controlling fire ignition and extent, is an important driver of the temporal shifts in fire activity with climate as both a harbinger and an amplifier of human-induced changes.

TI  - Assessment of Annual Physico-Chemical Variability via High-Temporal Resolution Monitoring in an Antarctic Shallow Coastal Site (Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea)
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean is an important atmospheric carbon sink, and potential changes in the carbon flux in this region will affect the ocean as a whole. Thus, to monitor the variability of its physico-chemical parameters is becoming a priority. This study provides the first high-resolution all-year-round record of observed and computed physico-chemical data from a shallow coastal site in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea). From November 2018 to November 2019, an underwater observatory deployed at a 25 m depth under an ice pack recorded pressure (p), temperature (t), electrical conductivity (C), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH in total scale (pH(T)), and illuminance (E-v). Practical salinity (S-P), density (rho), tidal constituents, carbonate system parameters (total alkalinity (TA), carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)), calcite, and aragonite (omega(Ca), omega(Ar))), together with sea ice concentration (SIC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), were derived from measured and satellite data. t, DO, and pH(T) displayed the lowest values between July and November (-1.95 degrees C, 6.61 mL L-1, 7.97) whereas the highest in January (+1.08 degrees C, 10.61 mL L-1, 8.35). S-P had the lowest values (33.72 PSU) in February and the highest (34.87 PSU) in September. E-v peaked in March (201 lux), with the highest values (>50 lux) in correspondence to the lowest values of SIC and a delayed trend, between December and March, with respect to Chl-a values (0.2-1.1 mg m(-3)). omega(Ca) and omega(Ar) showed their highest average monthly values (+/- s.d.) in January (omega(Ca): 3.41 +/- 0.27; omega(Ar): 2.14 +/- 0.17), when DO had maximum values. The lowest omega occurred in September (omega(Ca): 2.11 +/- 0.02; omega(Ar): 1.32 +/- 0.02), at the end of phytoplankton activity. No undersaturation for both calcite and aragonite was recorded during the study period. This study highlights that biological activities and physico-chemical variables of the investigated shallow coastal site are coupled and, in many cases, influence each other.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Images and Machine Learning as Tool for Monitoring of the Common Agricultural Policy: Calasparra Rice as a Case Study
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Commission introduces the Control by Monitoring through new technologies to manage Common Agricultural Policy funds through the Regulation 2018/746. The advances in remote sensing have been considered one of these new technologies, mainly since the European Space Agency designed the Copernicus Programme. The Sentinel-1 (radar range) and Sentinel-2 (optical range) satellites have been designed for monitoring agricultural problems based on the characteristics they provide. The data provided by the Sentinel 2 missions, together with the emergence of different scientific disciplines in artificial intelligence -especially machine learning- offer the perfect basis for identifying and classifying any crop and its phenological state. Our research is based on developing and evaluating a pixel-based supervised classification scheme to produce accurate rice crop mapping in a smallholder agricultural zone in Calasparra, Murcia, Spain. Several models are considered to obtain the most suitable model for each element of the time series used; pixel-based classification is performed and finished with a statistical treatment. The highly accurate results obtained, especially across the most significant vegetative development dates, indicate the benefits of using Sentinel-2 data combined with Machine Learning techniques to identify rice crops. It should be noted that it was possible to locate rice crop areas with an overall accuracy of 94% and standard deviation of 1%, which could be increased to 96% (+/- 1%) if we focus on the months of the crop's highest development state. Thanks to the proposed methodology, the on-site inspections carried out, 5% of the files, have been replaced by remote sensing evaluations of 100% of the analyzed season files. Besides, by adjusting the model input data, it is possible to detect unproductive or abandoned plots.

TI  - Multi-Year NDVI Values as Indicator of the Relationship between Spatiotemporal Vegetation Dynamics and Environmental Factors in the Qaidam Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qaidam Basin is a unique and complex ecosystem, wherein elevation gradients lead to high spatial heterogeneity in vegetation dynamics and responses to environmental factors. Based on the remote sensing data of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation dynamics and responses to precipitation, accumulative temperature (AT) and soil moisture (SM) in the Qaidam Basin from 2001 to 2016. Moreover, the contribution of those factors to vegetation dynamics at different altitudes was analyzed via an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The results indicated that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values in the growing season showed an overall upward trend, with an increased rate of 0.001/year. The values of NDVI in low-altitude areas were higher than that in high-altitude areas, and the peak values of NDVI appeared along the elevation gradient at 4400-4600 m. Thanks to the use of ANN, we were able to detect the relative contribution of various environmental factors; the relative contribution rate of AT to the NDVI dynamic was the most significant (35.17%) in the low-elevation region (<2900 m). In the mid-elevation area (2900-3900 m), precipitation contributed 44.76% of the NDVI dynamics. When the altitude was higher than 3900 m, the relative contribution rates of AT (39.50%) and SM (38.53%) had no significant difference but were significantly higher than that of precipitation (21.97%). The results highlight that the different environmental factors have various contributions to vegetation dynamics at different altitudes, which has important theoretical and practical significance for regulating ecological processes.

TI  - Multiple Pathways: The Influence Mechanism of Greenspace Exposure on Mental Health-A Case Study of Hangzhou, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenspace exposure (GSE) may have a positive impact on mental health. However, existing research lacks a classification analysis of the influence pathways of different GSE on mental health. Meanwhile, the research method is limited to the measurement of the green space ratio (GSR) based on remote sensing data, which ignores people's real perception of greenspace. This paper aims to further expand the measurement method of GSE, taking Hangzhou, China as an example, and to reveal the influence mechanism of different GSE modes on mental health. We obtained the personal information, mental health, physical activity, and other data of the interviewees through a questionnaire (n = 461). Combined with a remote sensing satellite and the Baidu Street view database, the method of image interpretation and deep learning was used to obtain the GSR, green visual ratio (GVR), and green visual exposure (GVE). The structural equation model is used to analyze the relationship between different variables. The results showed that: (1) GSE has a certain positive effect on mental health; (2) there are differences in the influence mechanism of multiple measures of GSE on mental health-the GVR and GVE measures based on the interaction perspective between human and greenspace make the influence mechanism more complicated, and produce direct and indirect influence paths; and (3) greenspace perception, sense of community, and physical activity can act as mediators, and have indirect effects. Finally, we call for expanding the measurement index and methods of GSE and integrating them into the management and control practices of urban planning to promote the healthy development of communities and even cities.

TI  - Lithology Discrimination Using Sentinel-1 Dual-Pol Data and SRTM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to various optical remote sensing data, studies on the performance of dual-pol Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on lithology discrimination are scarce. This study aimed at using Sentinel-1 data to distinguish dolomite, andesite, limestone, sandstone, and granite rock types. The backscatter coefficients VV and VH, the ratio VV-VH; the decomposition parameters Entropy, Anisotropy, and Alpha were firstly derived and the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was then applied to these polarimetric derived matrices to assess the significance of statistical differences among different rocks. Further, the corresponding gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) features were calculated. To reduce the redundancy and data dimension, the principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out on the GLCM features. Due to the limited rock samples, before the lithology discrimination, the input variables were selected. Several classifiers were then used for lithology discrimination. The discrimination models were evaluated by overall accuracy, confusion matrices, and the area under the curve-receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC). Results show that (1) the statistical differences of the polarimetric derived matrices (backscatter coefficients, ratio, and decomposition parameters) among different rocks was insignificant; (2) texture information derived from Sentinel-1 had great potential for lithology discrimination; (3) partial least square discrimination analysis (PLSDA) had the highest overall accuracy (0.444) among the classification models; (4) though the overall accuracy is unsatisfactory, according to the AUC-ROC and confusion matrices, the predictive ability of PLSDA model for limestone is high with an AUC value of 0.8017, followed by dolomite with an AUC value of 0.7204. From the results, we suggest that the dual-pol Sentinel-1 data are able to correctly distinguish specific rocks and has the potential to capture the variation of different rocks.

TI  - Mapping Public Urban Green Spaces Based on OpenStreetMap and Sentinel-2 Imagery Using Belief Functions
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Public urban green spaces are important for the urban quality of life. Still, comprehensive open data sets on urban green spaces are not available for most cities. As open and globally available data sets, the potential of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for urban green space mapping is high but limited due to their respective uncertainties. Sentinel-2 imagery cannot distinguish public from private green spaces and its spatial resolution of 10 m fails to capture fine-grained urban structures, while in OSM green spaces are not mapped consistently and with the same level of completeness everywhere. To address these limitations, we propose to fuse these data sets under explicit consideration of their uncertainties. The Sentinel-2 derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was fused with OSM data using the Dempster-Shafer theory to enhance the detection of small vegetated areas. The distinction between public and private green spaces was achieved using a Bayesian hierarchical model and OSM data. The analysis was performed based on land use parcels derived from OSM data and tested for the city of Dresden, Germany. The overall accuracy of the final map of public urban green spaces was 95% and was mainly influenced by the uncertainty of the public accessibility model.

TI  - Managing Agricultural Water Considering Water Allocation Priority Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To fairly distribute limited irrigation water resources in arid regions, a water allocation priority evaluation method based on remote sensing data was proposed and integrated with an optimization model. First, the water supply response unit was divided according to canal system conditions. Then, a spatialization method was used for generating spatial agricultural output value (income from planting industry) and grain yield (yield of food crops) with the help of NDVI and the potential yield of farmland. Third, the AHP-TOPSIS method was employed to calculate the water allocation priority based on the above information. Finally, the evaluation results were integrated with a nonlinear multiobjective model to optimally allocate agricultural land and water resources, considering the combined objective of minimum envy and proportional fairness. The method was applied to Hetao irrigation area, an arid agriculture-dominant region in Northwest China. After solving the model, optimization alternatives were obtained, which indicate that: (1) the spatial method of agricultural output value can improve the accuracy by around 16% compared with the traditional method, and the spatial method of grain yield also have good accuracy (MAPE = 14.66%); (2) the rank of water allocation priority can reflect more spatial information, and provide practical decision support for the distribution of water resources; (3) the envy index can better improve the efficiency of an allocation system compared to the Gini coefficient method.

TI  - Land Consumption Monitoring with SAR Data and Multispectral Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land consumption is the increase in artificial land cover, which is a major issue for environmental sustainability. In Italy, the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) and National System for Environmental Protection (SNPA) have the institutional duty to monitor land consumption yearly, through the photointerpretation of high-resolution images. This study intends to develop a methodology in order to produce maps of land consumption, by the use of the semi-automatic classification of multitemporal images, to reduce the effort of photointerpretation in detecting real changes. The developed methodology uses vegetation indices calculated over time series of images and decision rules. Three variants of the methodology were applied to detect the changes that occurred in Italy between the years 2018 and 2019, and the results were validated using ISPRA official data. The results show that the produced maps include large commission errors, but thanks to the developed methodology, the area to be photointerpreted was reduced to 7300 km(2) (2.4% of Italian surface). The third variant of the methodology provided the highest detection of changes: 70.4% of the changes larger than 100 m(2) (the pixel size) and over 84.0% of changes above 500 m(2). Omissions are mainly related to single pixel changes, while larger changes are detected by at least one pixel in most of the cases. In conclusion, the developed methodology can improve the detection of land consumption, focusing photointerpretation work over selected areas detected automatically.

TI  - A Neural-Network Based Spatial Resolution Downscaling Method for Soil Moisture: Case Study of Qinghai Province
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, soil-moisture data extracted from microwave data suffer from poor spatial resolution. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a method to downscale the soil moisture spatial resolution. The proposed method establishes a statistical relationship between low-spatial-resolution input data and soil-moisture data from a land-surface model based on a neural network (NN). This statistical relationship is then applied to high-spatial-resolution input data to obtain high-spatial-resolution soil-moisture data. The input data include passive microwave data (SMAP, AMSR2), active microwave data (ASCAT), MODIS data, and terrain data. The target soil moisture data were collected from CLDAS dataset. The results show that the addition of data such as the land-surface temperature (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized shortwave-infrared difference bare soil moisture indices (NSDSI), the digital elevation model (DEM), and calculated slope data (SLOPE) to active and passive microwave data improves the retrieval accuracy of the model. Taking the CLDAS soil moisture data as a benchmark, the spatial correlation increases from 0.597 to 0.669, the temporal correlation increases from 0.401 to 0.475, the root mean square error decreases from 0.051 to 0.046, and the mean absolute error decreases from 0.041 to 0.036. Triple collocation was applied in the form of [NN, FY3C, GEOS-5] based on the extracted retrieved soil-moisture data to obtain the error variance and correlation coefficient between each product and the actual soil-moisture data. Therefore, we conclude that NN data, which have the lowest error variance (0.00003) and the highest correlation coefficient (0.811), are the most applicable to Qinghai Province. The high-spatial-resolution data obtained from the NN, CLDAS data, SMAP data, and AMSR2 data were correlated with the ground-station data respectively, and the result of better NN data quality was obtained. This analysis demonstrates that the NN-based method is a promising approach for obtaining high-spatial-resolution soil-moisture data.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil salinization based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data combined with machine learning algorithms
T2  - REGIONAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the most important causes of land degradation and desertification, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. The dynamic monitoring of soil salinization is of great significance to land management, agricultural activities, water quality, and sustainable development. The remote sensing images taken by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 and the multispectral satellite Sentinel-2 with high resolution and short revisit period have the potential to monitor the spatial distribution of soil attribute information on a large area; however, there are limited studies on the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for digital mapping of soil salinization. Therefore, in this study, we used topography indices derived from digital elevation model (DEM), SAR indices generated by Sentinel-1, and vegetation indices generated by Sentinel-2 to map soil salinization in the Ogan-Kuqa River Oasis located in the central and northern Tarim Basin in Xinjiang of China, and evaluated the potential of multi-source sensors to predict soil salinity. Using the soil electrical conductivity (EC) values of 70 ground sampling sites as the target variable and the optimal environmental factors as the predictive variable, we constructed three soil salinity inversion models based on classification and regression tree (CART), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Then, we evaluated the prediction ability of different models through the five-fold cross validation. The prediction accuracy of XGBoost model is better than those of CART and RF, and soil salinity predicted by the three models has similar spatial distribution characteristics. Compared with the combination of topography indices and vegetation indices, the addition of SAR indices effectively improves the prediction accuracy of the model. In general, the method of soil salinity prediction based on multi-source sensor combination is better than that based on a single sensor. In addition, SAR indices, vegetation indices, and topography indices are all effective variables for soil salinity prediction. Weighted Difference Vegetation Index (WDVI) is designated as the most important variable in these variables, followed by DEM. The results showed that the high-resolution radar Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 have the potential to develop soil salinity prediction model.

TI  - An Optimization Approach for Estimating Multiple Land Surface and Atmospheric Variables From the Geostationary Advanced Himawari Imager Top-of-Atmosphere Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since a new generation of geostationary satellite data has incredibly high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions, new methodologies are now needed to take advantage of both the temporal and spectral signatures of them for accurate estimation of Earth's environmental variables. This article describes a novel optimization method to estimate a suite of 11 physically consistent land surface and atmospheric variables under all-sky conditions from the geostationary advanced Himawari imager (AHI) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations. This method is based on a coupled soil, snow, vegetation, and atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) model from 0.28 to 14 mu m. The inversion algorithm consists of three major steps. First, the "clearest" observations at each moment during a temporal window were determined and then the essential variables that characterize surface RT models, such as leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll concentration, and soil parameters were estimated. Second, the atmospheric variables, including aerosol optical depth (AOD) under clear-sky conditions, and cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective particle radius (CER) under cloudy-sky conditions, were inverted given surface reflectance calculated by the surface RT models. Finally, the inverted atmospheric and land surface variables were fed into the coupled RT model to calculate the remaining set of variables, including spectral directional reflectance, surface broadband albedo, thermal emissivity, incident shortwave radiation (ISR), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), fraction of absorbed PAR by green vegetation (FAPAR), and TOA shortwave albedo. The retrieved variables were validated using in-situ measurements from Ozflux network sites and compared with the other existing satellite products. Intercomparisons demonstrate that the AHI-retrieved atmospheric variables (AOD, CER, and COT) and surface variables (surface reflectance, LAI, FAPAR, PAR, and surface emissivity) are well correlated with the corresponding JAXA released AHI, NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), and the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products. Direct validation using in-situ measurements indicates that the retrieved ISR achieves higher accuracy than the CERES ISR product (with R-2 values of 0.95 and 0.89, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 203 and 29.6 W/m(2) for the AHI-retrieved and CERES daily ISR, respectively). Validation also shows that the estimated daily surface albedo has an accuracy comparable to the MODIS daily albedo product (RMSE = 0.03). Both the direct validation and product comparisons have demonstrated that this proposed inversion framework works very well for the AHI data. Unlike other algorithms that are usually used for estimating an individual parameter and rely heavily on a separate atmospheric correction, this inversion framework can effectively estimate a group of atmospheric and land surface variables and be easily applied to other similar multispectral geostationary satellite data. A comprehensive sensitivity and validation study is still needed to quantify the uncertainties of the retrieval variables.

TI  - Projections of desertification trends in Central Asia under global warming scenarios
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Asia (CA) is a core area of global desertification, but the effect of the intensifying "global greening" policy on the desertification process under global warming scenarios in CA remains unclear. Based on multi-source remote sensing data and Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) 2b dimate data, this study investigated desertification in CA using actual evapotranspiration (ETa), temperature and precipitation as driving factors. Coupling with the CA-Markov model, the inversion method of desertification was improved, and the evolution normal form of desertification in CA was proposed. Finally, spatio-temporal variations of desertification in CA were quantified. The results indicate that temperature, precipitation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in CA increased during the historical period (1980-2015), with sudden changes in 1994. In contrast, although ETa exhibited fluctuating inaeases (7.41 mm/10 yr) during this period, no sudden changes were observed in 1994. In the future (2006-2099), the climate of CA will become warmer and wetter. With reference to 1980-2005, precipitation under global warming of 2.0 degrees C (GW2.0) will be higher than that under global warming of 1.5 degrees C (GW1.5) by 10.3 mm, and ETa will increase by 20.88 mm and 27.54 mm under GW1.5 and GW2.0, respectively. Although the area of desert lands has decreased (5.94 x 10(4) km(2) / 10 yr). the area of potential desert lands has increased (0.17 x 10(4) km(2)/ 10 yr). With global warming, this situation will continue to intensify, mainly in Xinjiang of China, and Kazakhstan. The Aral Sea plays an important role in the desertification of CA. The potential increase in desert land under GW2.0 is equivalent to the current water area of the Aral Sea. The findings could provide policy support for combating desertification in CA and promoting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED LOGICS-IFCOLOG JOURNAL OF LOGICS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Given any Euclidean ordered field, Q, and any 'reasonable' group, G, of (1+3)-dimensional spacetime symmetries, we show how to construct a model M-G of kinematics for which the set W of worldview transformations between inertial observers satisfies W = G. This holds in particular for all relevant subgroups of Gal, cPoi, and cEucl (the groups of Galilean, Poincare and Euclidean transformations, respectively, where c is an element of Q is a model-specific parameter corresponding to the speed of light in the case of Poincare transformations).In doing so, by an elementary geometrical proof, we demonstrate our main contribution: spatial isotropy is enough to entail that the set W of worldview transformations satisfies either W subset of Gal, W subset of cPoi, or W subset of cEucl for some c > 0. So assuming spatial isotropy is enough to prove that there are only 3 possible cases: either the world is classical (the worldview transformations between inertial observers are Galilean transformations); the world is relativistic (the worldview transformations are Poincare transformations); or the world is Euclidean (which gives a nonstandard kinematical interpretation to Euclidean geometry). This result considerably extends previous results in this field, which assume a priori the (strictly stronger) special principle of relativity, while also restricting the choice of Q to the field R of reals.As part of this work, we also prove the rather surprising result that, for any G containing translations and rotations fixing the time-axis t, the requirement that G be a subgroup of one of the groups Gal, cPoi or cEucl is logically equivalent to the somewhat simpler requirement that, for all g is an element of G: g[t] is a line, and if g[t] = t then g is a trivial transformation (i.e. g is a linear transformation that preserves Euclidean length and fixes the time-axis setwise).

TI  - Populism versus the people: How citizen's social representations of home destabilize national populism's territorial vision
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Can understanding social representations of home unpack the central empty signifier of populism-the "true people"? Nationalist exclusionary forms of populism use home, birthplace, and born and bred narratives to frame sections of the population as Other. "Go Home" vans in the United Kingdom, Donald Trump's use of birther rhetoric during his previous presidential candidacy and the Sweden Democrats mobilization of folkhemmet (people's home) to question migrant welfare contributions together illustrate how nationalist populism works. Populism uses threat and insecurity, related to home, to make hegemonic a protectionist and reified worldview of home as stable, bounded and historically continuous. This article examines how populist rhetoric of home compares to people's actual social representations of home. Using cross-European interviews (N = 76) we find the dynamics of home relate to three social representations-home as a threatened space, home as birthplace, and home as a lifespan journey. These are articulated through a dialogical self engaged in transnational and intergenerational dialogue. The evidence of dynamic, dialogical, and relationally continuous representations of home points to the value of further examination of alternative social representations of home. This articulation could counter protectionist rhetoric associated with both vertical (ordinary/elite) and horizontal (people/migrant) dimensions of nationalist populism.

TI  - Is the annual maximum leaf area index an important driver of water fluxes simulated by a land surface model in temperate forests?
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In land surface models, vegetation is often described using plant functional types (PFTs), a classification that aggregates plant species into a few groups based on similar characteristics. Within-PFT variability of these characteristics can introduce considerable uncertainty in the simulation of water fluxes in forests. Our objectives were to (i) compare the variability of the annual maximum leaf area index (LAI(max)) within and between PFTs and (ii) assess whether this variability leads to significant differences in simulated water fluxes at a regional scale. We classified our study region in southwestern Quebec (Canada) into three PFTs (evergreen needleleaf, deciduous broadleaf, and mixed forests) and characterized LAI(max) using remotely sensed MODIS-LAI data. We simulated water fluxes with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) and performed a sensitivity analysis. We found that within-PFT variability of LAI(max) was 1.7 times more important than variability between PFTs, with similar mean values for the two dominant PFTs, deciduous broadleaf forests (6.6 m(2).m(-2)) and mixed forests (6.3 m(2).m(-2)). In CLASS, varying LAI(max) within the observed range of values (4.0-7.5 m(2).m(-2)) led to changes of less than 2% in mean evapotranspiration. Overall, LAI(max) is likely not an important driver of the spatial variability of water fluxes at the regional level.

TI  - The Influence of Forest Conditions on the Formation of the Summer Flash Floods in Irkutsk Oblast in 2019: A Case Study of the Iya River Basin
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an analysis of the current forest conditions and their water-regulating effect on the development of flash flood events using the Iya river basin as an example, where a catastrophic flash flood occurred in June and July 2019, which resulted in great damage and fatalities in the Tulunskii district of Irkutsk oblast. The methods include spatial-temporal analogies, mathematical-statistical analysis, aerospace monitoring and field geobotanical interpretation, and cartographic modeling. The main indicators that reflect the water-regulating functions of the forest, such as forest cover, bonitet, degree of crowding, and the species and age composition of woody stands are considered in terms of their dynamics for 2008-2018. We examine the main factors that lead to impairment of the water-regulating functions of the forest, including fires, clear-cutting, and damage caused by pest insects and diseases. Results of the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 image analysis and from field work were used to compile a map showing areas with primary and disturbed vegetation communities, as well as other artificially transformed territories (agricultural land, spoil tips, and other accumulated spoil, settlements, etc.). It was determined that the most disturbed communities are located in the plain and most developed subtaiga forest vegetation provinces are represented by secondary small-leaved stands with a significant inclusion of large-contour agricultural land (primarily, arable). The main conclusion of the study suggests that the considered forests are in satisfactory condition in terms of their quality characteristics and adequately fulfill their water-regulating functions. The existing degree of disturbance of the forests did not contribute to an increase in the flash flood, since the latter was determined by the abnormally heavy and long-lasting precipitation and orographic features of the watershed. The part of the area located in the subtaiga province, however, requires reforestation on unused agricultural land due to its lower forest cover and large-scale human activity.

TI  - Concentrations of cadmium, lead, arsenic, and some essential metals in wild boar from Sweden
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa) is becoming more common in Europe and has potential to be used as sentinel species for local contamination of heavy metals. Concentrations of nine trace elements (arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn)) were examined in kidney tissue of 104 female wild boars hunted at three sites in Sweden. The interrelationships between the trace elements and age dependency were investigated. Reproductive health was previously known to differ among animals at the different study sites, but could not be explained by heavy metal concentrations and no associations were found between heavy metals and reproductive parameters. Kidney concentrations of Cd (mean 4.16 mg/kg wet weight (w.w.), range 0.16-12.8) were higher than the permissible level for human consumption in 99.9% of the samples. Pb concentrations were generally intermediate or low (mean 0.14 mg/kg w.w., range 0.03-1.01) and exceeded the levels accepted for human consumption in 0.02% of the samples. Age class was significantly associated with the concentrations of Cd, Mg, and Mn. Concentrations of As were low (mean 0.02 mg/kg w.w., range <0.0001-0.08) and Cu and Se concentrations were within the ranges of suspected deficiency for 10% and 4% of the wild boars, respectively.

TI  - Toward a Comprehensive Dam Monitoring: On-Site and Remote-Retrieved Forcing Factors and Resulting Displacements (GNSS and PS-InSAR)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many factors can influence the displacements of a dam, including water level variability and environmental temperatures, in addition to the dam composition. In this work, optical-based classification, thermal diachronic analysis, and a quasi-PS (Persistent Scatter) Interferometric SAR technique have been applied to determine both forcing factors and resulting displacements of the crest of the Castello dam (South Italy) over a one-year time period. The dataset includes Sentinel-1A images acquired in Interferometric Wide swath mode using the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR (TOPSAR); Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) thermal images, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for interpreting the motion of the top of the dam retrieved via interferometry. Results suggest that it is possible to monitor both dam water level and temperature periodic forcing factors and resulting displacements via a synergistic use of different satellite images.

TI  - Novel Experience in Hybrid Tracers Clinical Evaluation of Feasibility and Efficacy in Using ICG-<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc Nanotop for Sentinel Node Procedure in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe clinical introduction of a radioactive and fluorescent hybrid tracer allowed for preoperative lymphatic mapping and intraoperative real-time fluorescence tracing of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) by a single injection. The aim of this feasibility study is to evaluate the first-in-human use of the hybrid tracer by combining indocyanine green (ICG) and radiocolloid based on Nanotop compound (Tc-99m Nanotop) for SLN biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients. MethodsThe day before surgery, ICG-Tc-99m Nanotop was injected periareolarly in breast cancer patients scheduled for SLNB. Planar lymphoscintigraphic (PL) and SPECT/CT images were then acquired. An intraoperative optonuclear probe was used to detect SLN gamma and fluorescent signals. The harvested SLNs were examined by hematoxylin-eosin staining, and patients were clinically evaluated 1 month after surgery. ResultsTwenty-one consecutive patients were enrolled. The PL and SPECT/CT techniques identified at least 1 SLN in all patients for a preoperative sentinel detection rate of 100%. SPECT/CT revealed 3 additional lymph nodes in the same nodal basin, which had not been visualized on conventional PL (kappa = 0.747; P < 0.005). All 30 preoperative SLNs were localized and excised up to 16 hours after injection. The counts measured via gamma tracing showed a very strong correlation with those measured via near-infrared fluorescent tracing (P < 0.005, r = 0.964). No adverse reactions were observed. ConclusionsThe SLNB technique used with the ICG-Tc-99m Nanotop tracer resulted to be feasible, reliable, and safe. This hybrid compound allowed us to obtain excellent performance in terms of both preoperative lymphatic mapping and intraoperative SLN detection in breast cancer patients.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dunes and sand sheets motion natural hazard affect many desertic areas worldwide and require careful assessment to develop effective mitigation plans to protect populated sites, infrastructure, and human activities. The study explores the suitability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) coherent methods to detect desert area instabilities and estimate sand accumulations displacements. The SAR methods have been applied to long time series of images provided by Sentinel-1. Moreover, the research introduces a novel robust index, named Temporal Stability Index, able to characterize the percentage of stability of a target with time. The work reports the experiments performed on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt desertic areas and proves the usefulness of SAR coherent methods to support sand mitigation measures.

TI  - Machine Learning Optimised Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Retrieves Cotton Nitrogen Status
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral imaging spectrometers mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can capture high spatial and spectral resolution to provide cotton crop nitrogen status for precision agriculture. The aim of this research was to explore machine learning use with hyperspectral datacubes over agricultural fields. Hyperspectral imagery was collected over a mature cotton crop, which had high spatial (similar to 5.2 cm) and spectral (5 nm) resolution over the spectral range 475-925 nm that allowed discrimination of individual crop rows and field features as well as a continuous spectral range for calculating derivative spectra. The nominal reflectance and its derivatives clearly highlighted the different treatment blocks and were strongly related to N concentration in leaf and petiole samples, both in traditional vegetation indices (e.g., Vogelman 1, R-2 = 0.8) and novel combinations of spectra (R-2 = 0.85). The key hyperspectral bands identified were at the red-edge inflection point (695-715 nm). Satellite multispectral was compared against the UAV hyperspectral remote sensing's performance by testing the ability of Sentinel MSI to predict N concentration using the bands in VIS-NIR spectral region. The Sentinel 2A Green band (B3; mid-point 559.8 nm) explained the same amount of variation in N as the hyperspectral data and more than the Sentinel Red Edge Point 1 (B5; mid-point 704.9 nm) with the lower 10 m resolution Green band reporting an R-2 = 0.85, compared with the R-2 = 0.78 of downscaled Sentinel Red Edge Point 1 at 5 m. The remaining Sentinel bands explained much lower variation (maximum was NIR at R-2 = 0.48). Investigation of the red edge peak region in the first derivative showed strong promise with RIDAmid (R-2 = 0.81) being the best index. The machine learning approach narrowed the range of bands required to investigate plant condition over this trial site, greatly improved processing time and reduced processing complexity. While Sentinel performed well in this comparison and would be useful in a broadacre crop production context, the impact of pixel boundaries relative to a region of interest and coarse spatial and temporal resolution impacts its utility in a research capacity.

TI  - Population-Based COVID-19 Screening in Mexico: Assessment of Symptoms and Their Weighting in Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Infection
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Sentinel surveillance in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico represented a significant cost reduction and was useful in estimating the population infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, it also implied that many patients were not screened and therefore had no accurate diagnosis. In this study, we carried out a population-based SARS-CoV-2 screening in Mexico to evaluate the COVID-19-related symptoms and their weighting in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss this data in the context of the operational definition of suspected cases of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus. Materials and Methods: One thousand two hundred seventy-nine subjects were included. They were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. The weighting of COVID-19 symptoms in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated statistically. Results: Three hundred and twenty-five patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 954 were negative. Fever, asthenia, dysgeusia, and oxygen saturation predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratios ranged from 1.74 to 4.98; p < 0.05). The percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 36% and only 38.15% met the Mexican operational definition. Cq-values for the gene N of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher in asymptomatic subjects than in the groups of COVID-19 patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Dysgeusia, fever, and asthenia increased the odds of a positive result for COVID-19 1.74-4.98-fold among the study population. Patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations had higher viral loads at COVID-19 diagnosis than those observed in asymptomatic patients. A high percentage of the participants in the study (61.85%) did not meet the operational definition for a suspected case of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus, representing a high percentage of the population that could have remained without a COVID-19 diagnosis, so becoming a potential source of virus spread.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mt. Seulawah Agam could make a good location for a geothermal power plant with an estimated energy of 150 Mwe. In geothermal exploration, thermal and multispectral imagery is required for surface temperature calculation, subsurface temperature modeling, and mapping of geothermal potential in volcanoes. In general, temperature data and vegetation index are obtained through such satellite images as Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel. However, satellite images cannot be used for a small area due to the low resolution (> 15 m/px). In this study, the researchers used a small DJI Phantom 4 Quadcopter equipped with the FLIR One and MAPIR Survey 3 sensors to map the heat signatures of a geothermal feature from the Ie Jue geothermal manifestation, Seulawah Agam, Indonesia. An area of 500 m x 430 m has been scanned, and the images were mosaicked and processed using Drone Deploy Cloud and ArcGIS 10.2. Based on the data processing, NDVI data calculated from the MAPIR sensor are capable of showing vegetation contrast with high resolution (5 cm/px) in several manifestations, which also correspond to Landsat-8 imagery. Meanwhile, the FLIR thermal sensor shows a temperature of 85 degrees C in the manifestation area, which was confirmed by a geo-thermometer and field outcrops. It was proved that, compared to satellite imagery, UAVs could be applied effectively to support the quantitative assessment of geothermal resources in volcanoes.

TI  - LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGES IN A HUMAN-WILDLIFE MEDIATED LANDSCAPE OF SAVE VALLEY CONSERVANCY, SOUTH-EASTERN LOWVELD OF ZIMBABWE
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to map and predict land use and land cover change dynamics in a human-wildlife mediated landscape of Save Valley Conservancy (SVC), south-eastern lowveld of Zimbabwe. In April 2018, remote sensing was used to quantify land use and land cover changes between 1990 and 2015 based on satellite images acquired from North Atlantic Space Agency (LANDSAT TM, path 170 raw 73). Household surveys were administered using a structured questionnaire to 100 communal settlers to collect biophysical/socioecological data on explanatory variables which included; density of human and livestock, fuelwood consumption and area under cultivation. The study used multicriteria evaluation procedure based on dynamic adjustments of socio-ecological data to generate transitional probability maps of SVC. Thresholds of socio-ecological data were then computed in the Markov-cellular automata model through a multi-objective land allocation procedure and a cellular automata spatial filter in order to simulate future land use and land cover maps of 2020, 2030 and 2040 for SVC. If the Zimbabwe land reform and its agricultural resettlement program is not properly coordinated and planned in the study area, the study predicted a continuing downward trend in woodland cover category and a significant upward trend of land under agriculture. For the period 1990 to the 2040s, the woodland cover is likely to decrease by 46.7% changing into agricultural land use and/or bare land in SVC. Future land use and land cover simulations indicated that if the current land use and land cover trends continue unabated across the study area without a holistic sustainable agricultural land-wildlife management plan and community development measures, severe woodland degradation will occur. The study recommends ecological restoration and/or re-planning on agriculture-wildlife land use and zonation, delineating agriculture and human settlement in the southern part of the conservancy while the northern part of SVC is exclusively reserved and protected for wildlife management.

TI  - Metastasis-Initiating Cells and Ecosystems
T2  - CANCER DISCOVERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Metastasis is initiated and sustained through therapy by cancer cells with stem-like and immune-evasive properties, termed metastasis-initiating cells (MIC). Recent progress suggests that MICs result from the adoption of a normal regenerative progenitor phenotype by malignant cells, a phenotype with intrinsic programs to survive the stresses of the metastatic process, undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, enter slow-cycling states for dormancy, evade immune surveillance, establish supportive interactions with organ-specific niches, and co-opt systemic factors for growth and recurrence after therapy. Mechanistic understanding of the molecular mediators of MIC phenotypes and host tissue ecosystems could yield cancer therapeutics to improve patient outcomes.Significance: Understanding the origins, traits, and vulnerabilities of progenitor cancer cells with the capacity to initiate metastasis in distant organs, and the host microenvironments that support the ability of these cells to evade immune surveillance and regenerate the tumor, is critical for developing strategies to improve the prevention and treatment of advanced cancer. Leveraging recent progress in our understanding of the metastatic process, here we review the nature of MICs and their ecosystems and offer a perspective on how this knowledge is informing innovative treatments of metastatic cancers.

TI  - Narrative review of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer: a technique in constant evolution with still numerous unresolved questions
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this narrative review was to provide an update on the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast carcinoma (BC). Relevant studies published between 01/01/1994 and 15/08/2020 assessing the accuracy and the usefulness of SLNB were reviewed. SLNB was first used in 1977 for penile cancers. However, it took 17 years to enter in clinical practice for BC. The first procedures were based on two methods of non-specific marking of LN vmacrophages using a radioisotope (Tc-99m) and a blue dye (BD, Isosulfan, Patent or Methylene). To overcome side effects of radioisotopes (radiation exposure) and BD (allergic reactions), innovative tracers such as indocyanine green (ICG), superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), and microbubbles have been explored. The SLN intraoperative examination is no longer performed, due to its low impact on the rate of reoperation and high time and cost of surgery. Likewise, immunohistochemistry, which can lead to an unnecessary ALND in some cases of occult metastases, is no more recommended. Except cases with metastasized LN, all contraindications aim to avoid situations where the risk of false negative would be too high (notably T3-T4 or multicentric tumors). The current indications for invasive BC are T0-T1-T2 N0 or N1 (after an accurate LN evaluation with ultrasound and/or cytology or core biopsy) and for DCIS treated by mastectomy or presenting as a palpable mass. After SLNB, axillary recurrence rates are generally below 2% after a follow up of 8-10 years, comparable to those observed after ALN. Likewise, when the SLN contains less than 2 metastases, axillary recurrence rates remain low even when ALN is omitted. In case of more than 2 metastatic SLN or capsular effraction, ALND is still indicated. For most teams, SLNB can be performed in clinically node-negative patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy. The results of the literature consistently show that SLNB is extremely reliable in selected BC, as long as it is performed with a rigorous technique by teams having undergone multidisciplinary training and having gained the necessary experience.

TI  - Current status and challenges in sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - As an optimal surgical procedure to accurately evaluate lymph node (LN) metastasis during surgery with minimal surgical resection, we have been developing sentinel node (SN) biopsy for early gastric cancer since the 1990s. Twelve institutions from the Japanese Society of Sentinel Node Navigation Surgery (SNNS), including Keio University Hospital, conducted a multicenter prospective trial to validate the SN concept using the dual-tracer method with blue dye and a radioisotope. According to the results, 397 patients were included in the final analysis, and the overall accuracy in detecting LN metastasis using SN biopsy was 99% (383 of 387). Based on the validation study, we are targeting cT1N0 with a primary tumor of <= 4 cm in diameter as an indication for SN biopsy for gastric cancer. We are currently running a multicenter nonrandomized phase III trial to assess the safety and efficacy of SN navigation surgery. The Korean group has reported the result of a multicenter randomized phase III trial. Since meticulous gastric cancer in the remnant stomach was rescued by subsequent gastrectomy, the disease-specific survival was comparable between the two techniques, implying that SN navigation surgery can be an alternative to standard gastrectomy. With the development of SN biopsy procedure and treatment modalities, the application of SN biopsy will be expanded to achieve an individualized minimally invasive surgery.

TI  - Old groundwater buffers the effects of a major drought in groundwater-dependent ecosystems of the eastern Sierra Nevada (CA)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global groundwater resources are stressed and the effects of climate change are projected to further disrupt recharge processes. Therefore, we must identify the buffers to climate change in hydrogeologic systems in order to understand which groundwater resources will be disproportionally affected by these changes. Here, we utilize a novel combination of remote sensing (e.g. Landsat) and groundwater residence time data (H-3, Cl-36) to identify the factors controlling the hydrogeologic stability of aridland mountain-front springs in response to a major climate event, the 2011-2017 California drought. Desert springs within Owens Valley (CA) support unique ecosystems that are surrounded by lush, green vegetation sustained only by discharging groundwater and are not reliant on localized precipitation. Therefore, the health or ecological response of this vegetation is a direct reflection of the hydrogeologic stability of the mountain-block groundwater system since water is the limiting resource for riparian plant growth in arid regions. We compared spring water residence times to vegetation health metrics computed from Landsat imagery leading up to and during the drought interval. We observe that the vegetation surrounding springs discharging a high fraction of modern and bomb-pulse groundwater (<100 years) showed evidence of increased drying and desiccation as the drought progressed. In comparison, springs discharging a higher fraction of old groundwater (>100 years) showed little response thereby supporting the conceptual model where old groundwater, i.e. a distribution of deep and stable groundwater flowpaths, buffers short- to long-term climate perturbations and may provide hydrogeologic resistance to future effects from climate change.

TI  - Induced Seismic Events-Distribution of Ground Surface Displacements Based on InSAR Methods and Mogi and Yang Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present a possible approach to use satellite radar data for a complete description of the formation process of a subsidence trough resulting from an induced seismic event-a mining tremor. Our main goal was to verify whether SAR data allow for the calculation of the basic indicators for the trough (w-subsidence, T-trough slope, K-curvature, u-horizontal displacements, epsilon-horizontal deformations). We verified the extent to which the Mogi and Yang models can be fitted to match the actual displacements recorded after an induced seismic tremor. The calculations were performed for the Legnica-Glogow Copper Belt (LGCB) area in southwest Poland. Due to intensive mining operations and specific geological and tectonic conditions, the area shows a high level of induced seismic activity. Our detailed analysis focused on four powerful mining tremors: the first tremor occurred on 29 November 2016 (MW3.4), the second on 7 December 2017 (MW3.3), the next on 26 December 2017 (MW3.6) and the last tremor on 29 January 2019 (MW3.7). For each analyzed event, we determined the displacements based on the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) method and Sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from two paths (22 and 73). Additionally, for the period from November 2014 to October 2020, we calculated the displacements using the Small Baseline Subset method (SBAS) time series method. In all cases, the tremor was followed by the development of long-lasting surface deformations. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that it is possible to calculate indicators that result from a specific induced mining event. Considering the full moment tensor and nature of the tremor source, we demonstrated that the Mogi and Yang models can be employed to describe the influence of an induced tremor on the surface in an area of mining activity. We also confirmed the global character of the influence of the reduced troposphere on SAR data calculations. Our conclusions indicate that accounting for the tropospheric correction does not distort horizontal and vertical displacement values in regions influenced by mining activity/tremors.

TI  - Synergy between Low Earth Orbit (LEO)-MODIS and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)-GOES Sensors for <i>Sargassum</i> Monitoring in the Atlantic Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2011, massive stranding of the brown algae Sargassum has regularly affected the coastal waters of the West Caribbean, Brazil, and West Africa, leading to heavy environmental and socio-economic impacts. Ocean color remote sensing observations as performed by sun-synchronous satellite sensors such as MODIS (NASA), MERIS (ESA), or OLCI (ESA/Copernicus) are used to provide quantitative assessments of Sargassum coverage through the calculation of indices as the Alternative Floating Algae Index (AFAI). Sun-synchronous sensors usually provide at best one daytime observation per day of a given oceanic area. However, such a daily temporal revisit rate is not fully satisfactory to monitor the dynamics of Sargassum aggregation due to their potentially significant drift over the course of the day as a result of oceanic currents and sea surface wind stress. In addition, the sun glint and the presence of clouds limit the use of low earth orbit observations, especially in tropical zones. The high frequency sampling provided by geostationary sensors can be a relevant alternative approach in synergy with ocean color sun-synchronous sensors to increase the temporal resolution of the observations, thus allowing efficient monitoring of Sargassum dynamics. In this study, data acquired by a geostationary satellite sensor located at 36,000 km from Earth, namely GOES-16 (NASA/NOAA), which was primarily designed for meteorology applications, are analyzed to investigate the Sargassum dynamics. The results demonstrate that a GOES-16 hourly composite product is appropriate to identify Sargassum aggregations using an index commonly used for vegetation monitoring, namely NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). It is also shown that GOES hourly observations can significantly improve the simulated drift obtained with a transport circulation model, which uses geostrophic current, wind, and waves. This study thus highlights the significant relevance of the effective synergy between sun-synchronous and geostationary satellite sensors for characterizing the Sargassum dynamics. Such a synergy could be summarized as follows: (i) A sun-synchronous sensor enables accurate Sargassum detection and quantitative estimates (e.g., fractional coverage) through AFAI Level-2 products while (ii) a geostationary sensor enables the determination of the displacement features of Sargassum aggregations (velocity, direction).

TI  - CERES MODIS Cloud Product Retrievals for Edition 4-Part I: Algorithm Changes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Edition 2 (Ed2) cloud property retrieval algorithm system was upgraded and applied to the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Edition 4 (Ed4) products. New calibrations for solar channels and the use of the 1.24-mu m channel for cloud optical depth (COD) over snow improve the daytime consistency between Terra and Aqua MODIS retrievals. Use of additional spectral channels and revised logic enhanced the cloud-top phase retrieval accuracy. A new ice crystal reflectance model and a CO2-channel algorithm retrieved higher ice clouds, while a new regional lapse rate technique produced more accurate water cloud heights than in Ed2. Ice cloud base heights are more accurate due to a new cloud thickness parameterization. Overall, CODs increased, especially over the polar (PO) regions. The mean particle sizes increased slightly for water clouds, but more so for ice clouds in the PO areas. New experimental parameters introduced in Ed4 are limited in utility, but will be revised for the next CERES edition. As part of the Ed4 retrieval evaluation, the average properties are compared with those from other algorithms and the differences between individual reference data and matched Ed4 retrievals are explored. Part II of this article provides a comprehensive, objective evaluation of selected parameters. More accurate interpretation of the CERES radiation measurements has resulted from the use of the Ed4 cloud properties.

TI  - Commensal <i>Escherichia coli</i> Antimicrobial Resistance and Multidrug-Resistance Dynamics during Broiler Growing Period: Commercial vs. Improved Farm Conditions
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryThis experiment was designed to evaluate the differences in antimicrobial and multidrug resistance dynamics in broilers reared under two different farm conditions (commercial vs. improved) during the growing period, using Escherichia coli as sentinel bacterium. Although no antibiotics were applied during rearing for two different management conditions tested, high rates of antimicrobial and multidrug-resistant bacteria were observed throughout rearing, with the percentages of resistant bacteria observed being of particular concern in day-old chicks on arrival day and in chickens at the end of the growing period, just before delivery to the slaughterhouse.New measures applied to reduce antimicrobial resistances (AMR) at field level in broiler production are focused on improving animals' welfare and resilience. However, it is necessary to have better knowledge of AMR epidemiology. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate AMR and multidrug resistance (MDR) dynamics during the rearing of broilers under commercial (33 kg/m(2) density and max. 20 ppm ammonia) and improved (17 kg/m(2) density and max. 10 ppm ammonia) farm conditions. Day-old chicks were housed in two poultry houses (commercial vs. improved), and no antimicrobial agents were administered at any point. Animals were sampled at arrival day, mid-period and at slaughter day. High AMR rates were observed throughout rearing. No statistical differences were observed between groups. Moreover, both groups presented high MDR at slaughter day. These results could be explained by vertical or horizontal resistance acquisition. In conclusion, AMR and MDR are present throughout rearing. Moreover, although a lower level of MDR was observed at mid-period in animals reared under less intensive conditions, no differences were found at the end. In order to reduce the presence of AMR bacteria in poultry, further studies are needed to better understand AMR acquisition and prevalence in differing broiler growing conditions.

AB  - This article aims to reflect on the concept of Homeland Earth, from the eponymous book by Edgar Morin and Anne-Brigitte Kern, considering the epistemology of the complexity, which brings about a change in thinking - from linear to complex - for the reintegration of scientific culture and humanistic culture. This perspective points to a new worldview, a new ethical pact for civilization, founded not only on illustrated reason, but also on human sensibility and emotional intelligence that are expressed through care, solidarity, understanding, and ecological and social responsibility. Through the methodology of bibliographic research, we also link up the Homeland Earth work with the recommendations of the Earth Charter through sustainable development, which leads us to the creation of a new planetary citizenship. We consider the following guiding questions: What are the theoretical foundations present in this work that can be considered as the underlying bases for a pedagogical theory capable of enlightening education and moving it towards this new cosmovision? How can the epistemology present in Homeland Earth inspire or guide pedagogical action towards a reform of thinking and educational institutions? We conclude by recognizing that the cognitive operators of complex thinking are mechanisms that generate this epistemology and that transdisciplinary pedagogical practices are fundamental for a better understanding of reality.

TI  - Expert commentary on the challenges and opportunities for surgical site infection prevention through implementation of evidence-based guidelines in the Asia-Pacific Region
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE AND INFECTION CONTROL
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Introduction Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC), adversely impacting patient quality of life, fiscal productivity and placing a major economic burden on the country's healthcare system. This commentary reports the findings of a two-day meeting that was held in Singapore on July 30-31, 2019, where a series of consensus recommendations were developed by an expert panel composed of infection control, surgical and quality experts from APAC nations in an effort to develop an evidence-based pathway to improving surgical patient outcomes in APAC. Methods The expert panel conducted a literature review targeting four sentinel areas within the APAC region: national and societal guidelines, implementation strategies, postoperative surveillance and clinical outcomes. The panel formulated a series of key questions regarding APAC-specific challenges and opportunities for SSI prevention. Results The expert panel identified several challenges for mitigating SSIs in APAC; (a) constraints on human resources, (b) lack of adequate policies and procedures, (c) lack of a strong safety culture, (d) limitation in funding resources, (e) environmental and geographic challenges, (f) cultural diversity, (g) poor patient awareness and (h) limitation in self-responsibility. Corrective strategies for guideline implementation in APAC were proposed that included: (a) institutional ownership of infection prevention strategies, (b) perform baseline assessments, (c) review evidence-based practices within the local context, (d) develop a plan for guideline implementation, (e) assess outcome and stakeholder feedback, and (f) ensure long-term sustainability. Conclusions Reducing the risk of SSIs in APAC region will require: (a) ongoing consultation and collaboration among stakeholders with a high level of clinical staff engagement and (b) a strong institutional and national commitment to alleviate the burden of SSIs by embracing a safety culture and accountability.

TI  - Mapping <i>Opuntia stricta</i> in the Arid and Semi-Arid Environment of Kenya Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and Ensemble Machine Learning Classifiers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, grassland biomes form one of the largest terrestrial covers and present critical social-ecological benefits. In Kenya, Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASAL) occupy 80% of the landscape and are critical for the livelihoods of millions of pastoralists. However, they have been invaded by Invasive Plant Species (IPS) thereby compromising their ecosystem functionality. Opuntia stricta, a well-known IPS, has invaded the ASAL in Kenya and poses a threat to pastoralism, leading to livestock mortality and land degradation. Thus, identification and detailed estimation of its cover is essential for drawing an effective management strategy. The study aimed at utilizing the Sentinel-2 multispectral sensor to detect Opuntia stricta in a heterogeneous ASAL in Laikipia County, using ensemble machine learning classifiers. To illustrate the potential of Sentinel-2, the detection of Opuntia stricta was based on only the spectral bands as well as in combination with vegetation and topographic indices using Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to detect the abundance. Study results showed that the overall accuracies of Sentinel 2 spectral bands were 80% and 84.4%, while that of combined spectral bands, vegetation, and topographic indices was 89.2% and 92.4% for XGBoost and RF classifiers, respectively. The inclusion of topographic indices that enhance characterization of biological processes, and vegetation indices that minimize the influence of soil and the effects of atmosphere, contributed by improving the accuracy of the classification. Qualitatively, Opuntia stricta spatially was found along river banks, flood plains, and near settlements but limited in forested areas. Our results demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 multispectral sensors to effectively detect and map Opuntia stricta in a complex heterogeneous ASAL, which can support conservation and rangeland management policies that aim to map and list threatened areas, and conserve the biodiversity and productivity of rangeland ecosystems.

TI  - Detrending Crop Yield Data for Improving MODIS NDVI and Meteorological Data Based Rice Yield Estimation Model
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By removing the increasing trend that long-term time series average of rice yield due to technological advancement of rice variety and cultivation management, we tried to improve the rice yield estimation model which developed earlier using MODIS NDVI and meteorological data. A multiple linear regression analysis was carried out by using the NDVI derived from MYD13Q1 and weather data from 2002 to 2019. The model was improved by analyzing the increasing trend of rime-series rice yield and removing it. After detrending, the accuracy of the model was evaluated through the correlation analysis between the estimated rice yield and the yield statistics using the improved model. It was found that the rice yield predicted by the improved model from which the trend was removed showed good agreement with the annual change of yield statistics. Compared with the model before the trend removal, the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination were also higher. It was indicated that the trend removal method effectively corrects the rice yield estimation model.

TI  - Riparian Area Changes in Greenness and Water Use on the Lower Colorado River in the USA from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Declines in riparian ecosystem greenness and water use have been observed in the delta of the Lower Colorado River (LCR) since 2000. The purpose of our case study was to measure these metrics on the U.S. side of the border between Hoover and Morelos Dams to see if declining greenness was unique to the portion of the river in Mexico. In this case study, five riparian reaches of the LCR from Hoover to Morelos Dam since 2000 were studied to evaluate trends in riparian ecosystem health. We measure these riparian woodlands using remotely sensed measurements of the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2; a proxy for greenness); daily evapotranspiration (ET; mmd(-1)) using EVI2 (ET(EVI2)); and an annualized ET based on EVI2, the Phenology Assessment Metric (PAM ET), an annualized ET using Landsat time-series. A key finding is that riparian health and its water use has been in decline since 2000 on the U.S. portion of the LCR, depicting a loss of green vegetation over the last two decades. EVI2 results show a decline of -13.83%, while average daily ET(EVI2) between the first and last decade had a decrease of over 1 mmd(-1) (-27.30%) and the respective average PAM ET losses were 170.91 mmyr(-1) (-17.95%). The difference between the first and last five-year periods, 2000-2005 and 2016-2020, showed the largest decrease in daily ET(EVI) of 1.24 mmd(-1) (-32.61%). These declines come from a loss in healthy, green, riparian plant-cover, not a change in plant water use efficiency nor efficient use of managed water resources. Our results suggest further deterioration of biodiversity, wildlife habitat and other key ecosystem services on the U.S. portion of the LCR.

TI  - Wheat Yield Forecasting for the Tisza River Catchment Using Landsat 8 NDVI and SAVI Time Series and Reported Crop Statistics
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the increasing global demand of food grain, early and reliable information on crop production is important in decision making in agricultural production. Remote sensing (RS)-based forecast models developed from vegetation indices have the potential to give quantitative and timely information on crops for larger regions or even at farm scale. Different vegetation indices are being used for this purpose, however, their efficiency in estimating crop yield certainly needs to be tested. In this study, wheat yield was derived by linear regressing reported yield values against a time series of six different peak-seasons (2013-2018) using the Landsat 8-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). NDVI- and SAVI-based forecasting models were validated based on 2018-2019 datasets and compared to evaluate the most appropriate index that performs better in forecasting wheat production in the Tisza river basin. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index was positive with E-1 = 0.716 for the model from NDVI and for SAVI E-1 = 0.909, which means that the forecasting method developed and performed good forecast efficiency. The best time for wheat yield prediction with Landsat 8-SAVI and NDVI was found to be the beginning of full biomass period from the 138th to 167th day of the year (18 May to 16 June; BBCH scale: 41-71) with high regression coefficients between the vegetation indices and the wheat yield. The RMSE of the NDVI-based prediction model was 0.357 t/ha (NRMSE: 7.33%). The RMSE of the SAVI-based prediction model was 0.191 t/ha (NRMSE 3.86%). The validation of the results revealed that the SAVI-based model provided more accurate forecasts compared to NDVI. Overall, probable yield amount is possible to predict far before harvest (six weeks earlier) based on Landsat 8 NDVI and SAVI and generating simple thresholds for yield forecasting, and a potential loss of wheat yield can be mapped.

TI  - Prediction of Forest Aboveground Biomass Using Multitemporal Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is a prime forest parameter that requires global level estimates to study the global carbon cycle. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is the state-of-the-art technology for AGB prediction but it is expensive, and its coverage is restricted to small areas. On the contrary, spaceborne Earth observation data are effective and economical information sources to estimate and monitor AGB at a large scale. In this paper, we present a study on the use of different spaceborne multispectral remote sensing data for the prediction of forest AGB. The objective is to evaluate the effects of temporal, spectral, and spatial capacities of multispectral satellite data for AGB prediction. The study was performed on multispectral data acquired by Sentinel-2, RapidEye, and Dove satellites which are characterized by different spatial resolutions, temporal availability, and number of spectral bands. A systematic process of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) variable selection generalized linear modeling, leave-one-out cross-validation, and analysis was accomplished on each satellite dataset for AGB prediction. Results point out that the multitemporal data based AGB models were more effective in prediction than the single-time models. In addition, red-edge and short wave infrared (SWIR) channel dependent variables showed significant improvement in the modeling results and contributed to more than 50% of the selected variables. Results also suggest that high spatial resolution plays a smaller role than spectral and temporal information in the prediction of AGB. The overall analysis emphasizes a good potential of spaceborne multispectral data for developing sophisticated methods for AGB prediction especially with specific spectral channels and temporal information.

TI  - Analyzing NPP Response of Different Rangeland Types to Climatic Parameters over Mongolia
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming threatens ecosystem functions, biodiversity, and rangeland productivity in Mongolia. The study analyzes the spatial and temporal distributions of the Net Primary Production (NPP) and its response to climatic parameters. The study also highlights how various land cover types respond to climatic fluctuations from 2003 to 2018. The Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model was used to simulate the rangeland NPP of the last 16 years. Satellite remote sensing data products were mainly used as input for the model, where ground-based and MODIS NPP were used to validate the model result. The results indicated that the BEPS model was moderately effective (R-2 = 0.59, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 13.22 g C m(-2)) to estimate NPP for Mongolian rangelands (e.g., grassland and sparse vegetation). The validation results also showed good agreement between the BEPS and MODIS estimates for all vegetation types, including forest, shrubland, and wetland (R-2 = 0.65). The annual total NPP of Mongolia showed a slight increment with an annual increase of 0.0007 Pg (0.68 g C per meter square) from 2003 to 2018 (p = 0.82) due to the changes in climatic parameters and land cover change. Likewise, high increments per unit area found in forest NPP, while decreased NPP trend was observed in the shrubland. In conclusion, among the three climatic parameters, temperature was the factor with the largest influence on NPP variations (r = 0.917) followed precipitation (r = 0.825), and net radiation (r = 0.787). Forest and wetland NPP had a low response to precipitation, while inter-annual NPP variation shows grassland, shrubland, and sparse vegetation were highly sensitive rangeland types to climate fluctuations.

TI  - Mangrove and Saltmarsh Distribution Mapping and Land Cover Change Assessment for South-Eastern Australia from 1991 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland ecosystems, such as saltmarsh and mangroves, provide a wide range of important ecological and socio-economic services. A good understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of these ecosystems is critical to maximising the benefits from restoration and conservation projects. We mapped mangrove and saltmarsh ecosystem transitions from 1991 to 2015 in south-eastern Australia, using remotely sensed Landsat data and a Random Forest classification. Our classification results were improved by the addition of two physical variables (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM), and Distance to Water). We also provide evidence that the addition of post-classification, spatial and temporal, filters improve overall accuracy of coastal wetlands detection by up to 16%. Mangrove and saltmarsh maps produced in this study had an overall User Accuracy of 0.82-0.95 and 0.81-0.87 and an overall Producer Accuracy of 0.71-0.88 and 0.24-0.87 for mangrove and saltmarsh, respectively. We found that mangrove ecosystems in south-eastern Australia have lost an area of 1148 ha (7.6%), whilst saltmarsh experienced an overall increase in coverage of 4157 ha (20.3%) over this 24-year period. The maps developed in this study allow local managers to quantify persistence, gains, and losses of coastal wetlands in south-eastern Australia.

TI  - Characterization of Groundwater Recharge and Flow in California's San Joaquin Valley From InSAR-Observed Surface Deformation
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface deformation in California's Central Valley (CV) has long been linked to changes in groundwater storage. Recent advances in remote sensing have enabled the mapping of CV deformation and associated changes in groundwater resources at increasingly higher spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) from the Sentinel-1 missions, augmented by continuous Global Positioning System (cGPS) positioning, to characterize the surface deformation of the San Joaquin Valley (SJV, southern two-thirds of the CV) for consecutive dry (2016) and wet (2017) water years. We separate trends and seasonal oscillations in deformation time series and interpret them in the context of surface and groundwater hydrology. We find that subsidence rates in 2016 (mean -42.0 mm/yr; peak -345 mm/yr) are twice that in 2017 (mean -20.4 mm/yr; peak -177 mm/yr), consistent with increased groundwater pumping in 2016 to offset the loss of surface-water deliveries. Locations of greatest subsidence migrated outwards from the valley axis in the wetter 2017 water year, possibly reflecting a surplus of surface-water supplies in the lowest portions of the SJV. Patterns in the amplitude of seasonal deformation and the timing of peak seasonal uplift reveal entry points and potential pathways for groundwater recharge into the SJV and subsequent groundwater flow within the aquifer. This study provides novel insight into the SJV aquifer system that can be used to constrain groundwater flow and subsidence models, which has relevance to groundwater management in the context of California's 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA).

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) Change Detection and the Implications for Coastal Water Resource Management in the Wami-Ruvu Basin, Tanzania
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of river basins requires land-use and land-cover (LULC) change detection to determine hydrological and ecological conditions for sustainable use of their resources. This study assessed LULC changes over 28 years (1990-2018) in the Wami-Ruvu Basin, located in Tanzania, Africa. Six pairs of images acquired using Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI sensors in 1990 and 2018, respectively, were mosaicked into a single composite image of the basin. A supervised classification using the Neural Network classifier and training data was used to create LULC maps for 1990 and 2018, and targeted the following eight classes of agriculture, forest, grassland, bushland, built-up, bare soil, water, and wetland. The results show that over the past three decades, water and wetland areas have decreased by 0.3%, forest areas by 15.4%, and grassland by 6.7%, while agricultural, bushland, bare soil, and the built-up areas have increased by 11.6%, 8.2%, 1.6%, and 0.8%, respectively. LULC transformations were assessed with water discharge, precipitation, and temperature, and the population from 1990 to 2018. The results revealed decreases in precipitation, water discharge by 4130 m(3), temperature rise by 1 degrees C, and an increase in population from 5.4 to 10 million. For proper management of water-resources, we propose three strategies for water-use efficiency-techniques, a review legal frameworks, and time-based LULC monitoring. This study provides a reference for water resources sustainability for other countries with basins threatened by LULC changes.

TI  - Shoreline Changes along Northern Ibaraki Coast after the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze the influence of the Great East Japan Earthquake, which occurred on 11 March 2011, on the shoreline of the northern Ibaraki Coast. After the earthquake, the area experienced subsidence of approximately 0.4 m. Shoreline changes at eight sandy beaches along the coast are estimated using various satellite images, including the ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), ALOS AVNIR-2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite, Advanced Visible and Near-infrared Radiometer type 2), and Sentinel-2 (a multispectral sensor). Before the earthquake (for the period March 2001-January 2011), even though fluctuations in the shoreline position were observed, shorelines were quite stable, with the averaged change rates in the range of +/- 1.5 m/year. The shoreline suddenly retreated due to the earthquake by 20-40 m. Generally, the amount of retreat shows a strong correlation with the amount of land subsidence caused by the earthquake, and a moderate correlation with tsunami run-up height. The ground started to uplift gradually after the sudden subsidence, and shoreline positions advanced accordingly. The recovery speed of the beaches varied from +2.6 m/year to +6.6 m/year, depending on the beach conditions.

TI  - The DLR FireBIRD Small Satellite Mission: Evaluation of Infrared Data for Wildfire Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires significantly influence ecosystem patterns and processes on a global scale. In many cases, they pose a threat to human lives and property. Through greenhouse gas emissions, wildfires also directly contribute to climate change. The monitoring of such events and the analysis of acquired data is crucial for understanding wildfire and ecosystem interactions. The FireBIRD small satellite mission, operated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), was specifically designed for the detection of wildfires. It features a higher spatial resolution than available with other Earth-observation systems. In addition to the detection of active fire locations, the system also allows the derivation of fire intensity by means of the Fire Radiative Power (FRP). This indicator can be used as a basis to derive the amount of emitted pollutant, which makes it valuable for climate studies. With the FireBIRD mission facing its end of life in 2021, this study retrospectively evaluates the performance of the system through an inter-comparison with data from two satellite missions of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and discusses the potential of such a system. The comparison is performed regarding both geometrical and radiometric aspects, the latter focusing on the FRP. This study uses and compares two different methods to derive the FRP from FireBIRD data. The data are analyzed regarding six major fire incidents in different regions of the world. The FireBIRD results are in accordance with the reference data, showing a geometrical overlapping rate of 83% and 84% regarding MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) overpasses in close temporal proximity. Furthermore, the results show a positive bias in FRP of about 11% compared to MODIS.

TI  - The Use of Sentinel-2 for Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Spatial Dynamics Assessment: A Comparative Study on Different Lakes in Northern Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication of inland waters is an environmental issue that is becoming more common with climatic variability. Monitoring of this aquatic problem is commonly based on the chlorophyll-a concentration monitored by routine sampling with limited temporal and spatial coverage. Remote sensing data can be used to improve monitoring, especially after the launch of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2. In this study, we compared the estimation of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) from different bio-optical algorithms using hyperspectral proximal remote sensing measurements, from simulated MSI responses and from an MSI image. For the satellite image, we also compare different atmospheric corrections routines before the comparison of different bio-optical algorithms. We used in situ data collected in 2019 from 97 sampling points across 19 different lakes. The atmospheric correction assessment showed that the performances of the routines varied for each spectral band. Therefore, we selected C2X, which performed best for bands 4 (root mean square error-RMSE = 0.003), 5 (RMSE = 0.004) and 6 (RMSE = 0.002), which are usually used for the estimation of chl-a. Considering all samples from the 19 lakes, the best performing chl-a algorithm and calibration achieved a RMSE of 16.97 mg/m(3). When we consider only one lake chain composed of meso-to-eutrophic lakes, the performance improved (RMSE: 10.97 mg/m(3)). This shows that for the studied meso-to-eutrophic waters, we can reliably estimate chl-a concentration, whereas for oligotrophic waters, further research is needed. The assessment of chl-a from space allows us to assess spatial dynamics of the environment, which can be important for the management of water resources. However, to have an accurate product, similar optical water types are important for the overall performance of the bio-optical algorithm.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-2 Satellite Data for Windthrows Monitoring and Delimiting: The Case of "Vaia" Storm in Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (North-Eastern Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On the 29th of October 2018, a storm named "Vaia" hit North-Eastern Italy, causing the loss of 8 million m(3) of standing trees and creating serious damage to the forested areas, with many economic and ecological implications. This event brought up the necessity of a standard procedure for windthrow detection and monitoring based on satellite data as an alternative to foresters' fieldwork. The proposed methodology was applied in Carnic Alps (Friuli Venezia Giulia, NE Italy) in natural stands dominated by Picea abies and Abies alba. We used images from the Sentinel-2 mission: 1) to test vegetation indices performance in monitoring the vegetation dynamics in the short period after the storm, and 2) to create a windthrow map for the whole Friuli Venezia Giulia region. Results showed that windthrows in forests have a significant influence on visible and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of Sentinel-2, both in the short and the long-term timeframes. NDWI8A and NDWI were the best indices for windthrow detection (R-2 = 0.80 and 0.77, respectively) and NDVI, PSRI, SAVI and GNDVI had an overall good performance in spotting wind-damaged areas (R-2 = 0.60-0.76). Moreover, these indices allowed to monitor post-Vaia forest die-off and showed a dynamic recovery process in cleaned sites. The NDWI8A index, employed in the vegetation index differencing (VID) change detection technique, delimited damaged areas comparable to the estimations provided by Regional Forest System (2545 ha and 3183 ha, respectively). Damaged forests detected by NDWI8A VID ranged from 500 m to 1500 m a.s.l., mainly covering steep slopes in the south and east aspects (42% and 25%, respectively). Our results suggested that the NDWI8A VID method may be a cost-effective and accurate way to produce windthrow maps, which could limit the risks associated with fieldwork and may provide a valuable tool to plan tree removal interventions in a more efficient way.

TI  - Application of remote sensing indices to digital soil salt composition and ionic strength mapping in the east shore of Urmia Lake, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to apply fifteen remote sensing indices extracted by Landsat 8 OLI imagery for predicting and spatially mapping of soil salt composition, major electrolytes and ionic strength (IST) as difficult-to-measure soil chemical properties and parameters. For this, an area with extension of 22300 ha was selected from the east shore of Urmia Lake, Iran with extremely saline and sodic soils. This article also focuses on the importance of data mining techniques in advanced digital soil mapping (DSM). In addition to routine chemical analysis, the Visual MINTEQ software was utilized for computing the saturation index of salt composition as well as ionic strength. The positive values of saturation indices were only identified for calcite, dolomite and gypsum in the study area. For mapping the aforementioned properties, Random Forests, Cubist and decision tree were the three candidate modeling approaches. The bootstrapping technique according to the calculated prediction intervals was then used to inspect the associated uncertainty of all created digital maps. Regarding optimality, the Cubist model was identified as the most efficient model for our data set and environmental covariates. The prediction of monovalent (i.e. Na+, K+ and Cl) ion concentrations, but not divalent (i.e. Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42) ion concentrations, was generally quite good with calibration and validation dataset. The most important finding of this paper was the successful prediction of spatial distribution of IST using solely remotely-sensed indices. The outcomes of this study are of great importance for the remote sensing society, by means of applying the respective remote sensing indices and identifying the most effective techniques.

TI  - Downscaling Multispectral Satellite Images Without Colocated High-Resolution Data: A Stochastic Approach Based on Training Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high-resolution satellite imagery from the latest generation commercial platforms provides an unprecedented capacity for imaging the Earth with very high spatial detail. However, these data are generally expensive, particularly if large areas or temporal sequences are required. In recent years, lower quality imagery has been enabled through the launch of constellations of small satellites with short revisit time. In this article, we apply for the first time a statistical approach to downscale and bias-correct these multispectral satellite data using the information contained in a limited training set of very high-resolution images. The technique, based on the direct sampling algorithm, aims at extending the coverage of high-resolution images by sampling data from a training data set, where similar lower resolution data patterns are found. Unlike the majority of the current downscaling techniques, the approach does not require colocated fine-resolution data, but it is based on the use of training images similar to the target zone. A novel specific setup is proposed, which is adaptive to different types of landscapes with no additional user effort. The results show that the proposed technique can generate more realistic images than the traditional approaches based on the parametric bias correction and bicubic interpolation. In particular, properties such as the intensity histogram, spatial correlation, and connectivity are accurately preserved. The proposed approach can be used to extend the footprint of the high-resolution images to generate new time frames or to downscale the remote sensing imagery based on a distant but structurally similar training image.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility mapping in the Champagne vinyards between Epernay and Dormans (France): the contribution of multispectral remote sensing
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGIE-RELIEF PROCESSUS ENVIRONNEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the area between Epernay and Dormans (Marne), the characterization of the water status of vineyard soils and the determination of their susceptibility to landslides are addressed through vegetation indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) obtained via high-resolution multispectral images provided by Sentinel-2 between 2017 and 2019. The study is based on the known relation between the phytomass status determined through vegetation indices and the soil water status measured in the field. This relation allows the NDVI and NDWI indices to be used to highlight areas of high annual water balancefluctuations. By combining data from multispectral remote sensing, weather records and landfinins analysis using photo-interpretation and field observation, a landslide susceptibility map based on the spatial and temporal relation between soil moisture content and slope instability can be drawn up. This approach thus provides an original tool for landslide risk management.

TI  - Assessment of k-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest Classifiers for Mapping Forest Fire Areas in Central Portugal Using Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Terra Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires threaten the population's health, biomass, and biodiversity, intensifying the desertification processes and causing temporary damage to conservation areas. Remote sensing has been used to detect, map, and monitor areas that are affected by forest fires due to the fact that the different areas burned by a fire have similar spectral characteristics. This study analyzes the performance of the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers for the classification of an area that is affected by fires in central Portugal. For that, image data from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Terra satellites and the peculiarities of each of these platforms with the support of Jeffries-Matusita (JM) separability statistics were analyzed. The event under study was a 93.40 km(2) fire that occurred on 20 July 2019 and was located in the districts of Santarem and Castelo Branco. The results showed that the problems of spectral mixing, registration date, and those associated with the spatial resolution of the sensors were the main factors that led to commission errors with variation between 1% and 15.7% and omission errors between 8.8% and 20%. The classifiers, which performed well, were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method, generating maps that were compared based on the areas under the curves (AUC). All of the AUC were greater than 0.88 and the Overall Accuracy (OA) ranged from 89 to 93%. The classification methods that were based on the kNN and RF algorithms showed satisfactory results.

TI  - A Low-Cost and Robust Landsat-Based Approach to Study Forest Degradation and Carbon Emissions from Selective Logging in the Venezuelan Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging in the tropics is a major driver of forest degradation by altering forest structure and function, including significant losses of aboveground carbon. In this study, we used a 30-year Landsat time series (1985-2015) to analyze forest degradation and carbon emissions due to selective logging in a Forest Reserve of the Venezuelan Amazon. Our work was conducted in two phases: the first, by means of a direct method we detected the infrastructure related to logging at the sub-pixel level, and for the second, we used an indirect approach using buffer areas applied to the results of the selective logging mapping. Pre- and post-logging forest inventory data, combined with the mapping analysis were used to quantify the effects of logging on aboveground carbon emissions for three different sources: hauling, skidding and tree felling. With an overall precision of 0.943, we demonstrate the potential of this method to efficiently map selective logging and forest degradation with commission and omission errors of +7.6 +/- 4.5 (Mean +/- SD %) and -7.5% +/- 9.1 respectively. Forest degradation due to logging directly affected close to 24,480 ha, or about similar to 1% of the total area of the Imataca Forest Reserve. On average, with a relatively low harvest intensity of 2.8 +/- 1.2 trees ha(-1) or 10.5 +/- 4.6 m(3) ha(-1), selective logging was responsible for the emission of 61 +/- 21.9 Mg C ha(-1). Lack of reduced impact logging guidelines contributed to pervasive effects reflected in a mean reduction of similar to 35% of the aboveground carbon compared to unlogged stands. This research contributes to further improve our understanding of the relationships between selective logging and forest degradation in tropical managed forests and serves as input for the potential implementation of projects for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+).

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of satellite technology over decades established unique approach to analyze rice crop phenological parameters and supervise growth and production. Advancement in technology leads to the development of microwave remote sensing that is operational round the clock irrespective of weather conditions. An attempt has been carried out in the present study to classify and map phenological stages, namely, transplanting stage, heading stage, and harvesting stage of rice crop using Sentinel-1, MODIS Enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data. Puddling stage, transplanting stage, heading stage, and harvesting stages are identified on 05th and 15th January, 28th February, and 27th March of the year 2017, respectively. Field visits are performed frequently at sampling locations for an effective study on rice phenological stages, rice yield estimation, and mapping large-scale area using regression analysis. Estimated yield is compared with ground truth data; average yield produced from study area is 3.03 tons/acre. Methodology adopted reflected satisfactory performance with minimal error for mapping of rice phenological stages, and it is suggested to experiment with other agricultural crops.

TI  - CME Magnetic Structure and IMF Preconditioning Affecting SEP Transport
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs) are two phenomena that can cause severe space weather effects throughout the heliosphere. The evolution of CMEs, especially in terms of their magnetic structure, and the configuration of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) that influences the transport of SEPs are currently areas of active research. These two aspects are not necessarily independent of each other, especially during solar maximum when multiple eruptive events can occur close in time. Accordingly, we present the analysis of a CME that erupted on May 11, 2012 (SOL2012-05-11) and an SEP event following an eruption that took place on May 17, 2012 (SOL2012-05-17). After observing the May 11 CME using remote-sensing data from three viewpoints, we evaluate its propagation through interplanetary space using several models. Then, we analyze in-situ measurements from five predicted impact locations (Venus, Earth, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Mars Science Laboratory en route to Mars, and Mars) in order to search for CME signatures. We find that all in-situ locations detect signatures of an SEP event, which we trace back to the May 17 eruption. These findings suggest that the May 11 CME provided a direct magnetic connectivity for the efficient transport of SEPs. We discuss the space weather implications of CME evolution, regarding in particular its magnetic structure, and CME-driven IMF preconditioning that facilitates SEP transport. Finally, this work remarks the importance of using data from multiple spacecraft, even those that do not include space weather research as their primary objective.

TI  - Discrepancies between Global Forest Net Primary Productivity Estimates Derived from MODIS and Forest Inventory Data and Underlying Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The net primary productivity (NPP) of a forest is an important indicator of its potential for the provision of ecosystem services such as timber, carbon, and biodiversity. However, accurately and consistently quantifying global forest NPP remains a challenge in practice. We converted carbon stock changes using the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) data and carbon losses associated with disturbances and timber removals into an NPP equivalent measurement (FRA NPP*) and compared it with the NPP derived from the MODIS satellite data (MOD17 NPP) for the world's forests. We found statistically significant differences between the two NPP estimates, with the FRA NPP* being lower than the MOD17 NPP; the differences were correlated with forest cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and GDP per capita in countries, and may also stem from the NPP estimation methods and scopes. While the former explicitly accounts for carbon losses associated with timber removals and disturbances, the latter better reflects the principles of photosynthesis. The discrepancies between the two NPP estimates increase in countries with a low income or low forest cover, calling for enhancing their forest resource assessment capacity. By identifying the discrepancies and underlying factors, we also provide new insights into the relationships between the MOD17 NPP and global forest carbon stock estimates, motivating and guiding future research to improve the robustness of quantifying global forest NPP and carbon sequestration potential.

TI  - Estimation of Ground-level PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Using Boosting-based Machine Learning from Satellite and Numerical Weather Prediction Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5 with a diameter less than 10 and 2.5 mu m, respectively) can be absorbed by the human body and adversely affect human health. Although most of the PM monitoring are based on ground-based observations, they are limited to point-based measurement sites, which leads to uncertainty in PM estimation for regions without observation sites. It is possible to overcome their spatial limitation by using satellite data. In this study, we developed machine learning-based retrieval algorithm for ground-level PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations using aerosol parameters from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite and various meteorological parameters from a numerical weather prediction model during January to December of 2019. Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) were used to estimate PM concentrations. The model performances were examined for two types of feature sets-all input parameters (Feature set 1) and a subset of input parameters without meteorological and land-cover parameters (Feature set 2). Both models showed higher accuracy (about 10 % higher in R-2) by using the Feature set 1 than the Feature set 2. The GBRT model using Feature set 1 was chosen as the final model for further analysis (PM10: R-2 = 0.82, nRMSE = 34.9 %, PM2.5: R-2 = 0.75, nRMSE = 35.6 %). The spatial distribution of the seasonal and annual-averaged PM concentrations was similar with in-situ observations, except for the northeastern part of China with bright surface reflectance. Their spatial distribution and seasonal changes were well matched with in-situ measurements.

TI  - BEYOND NATIONALISM IN THIS 'ERA OF DISASTER': Setting a New Relationship for a Sustainable Future
T2  - JOURNAL OF DHARMA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the authors analyse the post-apocalyptic narrative as an environmental crisis discourse and suggest a vision of SDGs from the standpoint of ecological criticism. Kobo Abe's post-apocalyptic narrative in The Ark Sakura presents ethical challenges to the readers. Furthermore, the myriad of formal elements (surreal space composition, fictional apocalyptic hypothesis, and biblical motifs) and themes (threat of nuclear war, human greed, loss of humanity, and littering problem) are converged on ecological themes to convey warning messages to humanity. This literary imagination of apocalypse and disaster plays a role as a tool for self-reflection and warning against the absurdities of reality, while at the same time presents alternatives and solutions for a new vision for the future. In particular, it demands critical reflection on collectivism, that is, nationalism founded on human selfishness. This is a strategic worldview that deals with the disasters and the destruction of people and planet, as well as a lesson to be taught by ecological writing for a new future society.

TI  - Applications of Satellite Radar Imagery for Hazard Monitoring: Insights from Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation (EO) satellites facilitate hazard monitoring and mapping over large-scale and remote areas. Despite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites being well-documented as a hazard monitoring tool, the uptake of these data is geographically variable, with the Australian continent being one example where the use of SAR data is limited. Consequently, less is known about how these data apply in the Australian context, how they could aid national hazard monitoring and assessment, and what new insights could be gleaned for the benefit of the international disaster risk reduction community. The European Space Agency Sentinel-1 satellite mission now provides the first spatially and temporally complete global SAR dataset and the first opportunity to use these data to systematically assess hazards in new locations. Using the example of Australia, where floods and uncontrolled bushfires, earthquakes, resource extraction (groundwater, mining, hydrocarbons) and geomorphological changes each pose potential risks to communities, we review past usage of EO for hazard monitoring and present a suite of new case studies that demonstrate the potential added benefits of SAR. The outcomes provide a baseline understanding of the potential role of SAR in national hazard monitoring and assessment in an Australian context. Future opportunities to improve national hazard identification will arise from: new SAR sensing capabilities, which for Australia includes a first-ever civilian EO capability, NovaSAR-1; the integration of Sentinel-1 SAR with other EO datasets; and the provision of standardised SAR products via Analysis Ready Data and Open Data Cubes to support operational applications.

TI  - Transformation of Multispectral Data to Quasi-Hyperspectral Data Using Convolutional Neural Network Regression
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral (HS) data are proven to be more resourceful compared to multispectral (MS) data for object detection, classification, and several other applications. However, absence of any space-borne HS sensor since 2017, which can provide open-source data with global coverage, and high cost and limited obtainability of airborne sensors-based images limit the use of HS data. Transformation of readily available MS data into quasi-HS data can be a feasible solution for this issue. In this article, we propose the use of convolutional neural network regression (CNNR), a deep learning-based algorithm, for MS (i.e., Landsat 7/8) to quasi-HS (i.e., quasi-Hyperion) data transformation. The proposed CNNR model is compared with the existing pseudo-HS image transformation algorithm (PHITA), a simple linear model [i.e., stepwise linear regression (SLR)], and a nonlinear modeling approach [i.e., support vector regression (SVR)] by evaluating the quality of the quasi-Hyperion data. Contrary to these existing and simple models, the proposed CNNR model has the added advantage of utilizing deep learning-based spectralspatial features for MS to quasi-HS data transformation through regression-based nonlinear modeling. Different statistical metrics are calculated to compare each bands reflectance values as well as spectral reflectance curve of each pixel of the quasi-Hyperion data with that of the original Hyperion data. The developed models and generated quasi-Hyperion data are also evaluated with application to crop classification. Analyzing the results of all the experiments, it is evident that CNNR model is more efficient compared to PHITA, SLR, and SVR in creating the quasi-Hyperion data and this transformed data are proven to be resourceful for crop classification application. The proposed CNNR model-based MS to quasi-HS data transformation approach can be used as a viable alternative for different applications in the absence of original HS images.

TI  - Prelaunch Radiometric Calibration and Uncertainty Analysis of Landsat Thermal Infrared Sensor 2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Thermal Infrared Sensor-2 (TIRS-2) that will be onboard Landsat 9 has undergone a prelaunch testing campaign to characterize its radiometric, spectral, and spatial performances and demonstrate compliance to its requirements. This work reviews the key elements of the instrument-level radiometric testing using an SI-traceable source to derive its uncertainties. Those arising from on-orbit calibration using the TIRS-2 onboard blackbody are also discussed. We use a Monte Carlo approach to propagate the uncertainties through a nonlinear calibration equation and address both random and systematic uncertainty terms. Achieving the required performance demonstrates the instruments potential for enhancing our understanding of the Earths environment.

TI  - Combining TanDEM-X and Sentinel-2 for large-area species-wise prediction of forest biomass and volume
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, data from the satellite sensors TanDEM-X and Sentinel-2 were combined with national field inventory data to predict forest above-ground biomass (AGB) and stem volume (VOL) over a large area in Sweden. The data sources were evaluated both separately and in combination. The study area covers approximately 20,000,000 ha and corresponds to about 70% of the Swedish forest area. The study area was divided into tiles of 2.5 x 2.5 km(2), which were processed sequentially. The field plots were inventoried on 7 m and 10 m circular plots by the Swedish National Forest Inventory, and plot AGB and VOL at the year of the satellite data were estimated based on a 10-year period of field data. The AGB and VOL were modelled using the k nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm, with k = 5 neighbors. The combined use of two data sources with different scene extents enabled the generation of seamless AGB and VOL maps. Moreover, the kNN algorithm provided the VOL divided per tree species, which was used for classification of the dominant tree species at stand-level. The overall accuracy for the dominant tree species classification was 77%. The predicted AGB and VOL rasters were evaluated using 549 field inventoried forest stands distributed over Sweden. The RMSE for the predictions based on both data sources were 31.4 t/ha (29.1%) for AGB, and 59.0 m(3)/ha (30.2%) for VOL. By estimating and removing the variance due to sampling (the stand values were estimated from sample plots), the RMSE was improved to 18.0 t/ ha (16.6%). The evaluated approach of using kNN was suitable for estimating forest variables from a combination of different satellite sensors, provided sufficient field reference data are available. The TanDEM-X data were most important for the AGB and VOL predictions, while Sentinel-2 data were essential to map the tree species.

TI  - Assessing Current Seismic Hazards in Irpinia Forty Years after the 1980 Earthquake: Merging Historical Seismicity and Satellite Data about Recent Ground Movements
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, a new strain rate map of Italy and the surrounding areas has been obtained by processing data acquired by the persistent scatterers (PS) of the synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) satellites-ERS and ENVISAT-between 1990 and 2012. This map clearly shows that there is a link between the strain rate and all the shallow earthquakes (less than 15 km deep) that occurred from 1990 to today, with their epicenters being placed only in high strain rate areas (e.g., Emilia plain, NW Tuscany, Central Apennines). However, the map also presents various regions with high strain rates but in which no damaging earthquakes have occurred since 1990. One of these regions is the Apennine sector, formed by Sannio and Irpinia. This area represents one of the most important seismic districts with a well-known and recorded seismicity from Roman times up to the present day. In our study, we merged historical records with new satellite techniques that allow for the precise determination of ground movements, and then derived physical dimensions, such as strain rate. In this way, we verified that in Irpinia, the occurrence of new strong shocks-forty years after one of the strongest known seismic events in the district that occurred on the 23 November 1980, measuring Mw 6.8-is still a realistic possibility. The reason for this is that, from 1990, only areas characterized by high strain rates have hosted significant earthquakes. This picture has been also confirmed by analyzing the historical catalog of events with seismic completeness for magnitude M >= 6 over the last four centuries. It is easy to see that strong seismic events with magnitude M >= 6 generally occurred at a relatively short time distance between one another, with a period of 200 years without strong earthquakes between the years 1732 and 1930. This aspect must be considered as very important from various points of view, particularly for civil protection plans, as well as civil engineering and urban planning development.

TI  - Responding to Large-Scale Forest Damage in an Alpine Environment with Remote Sensing, Machine Learning, and Web-GIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports a semi-automated workflow for detection and quantification of forest damage from windthrow in an Alpine region, in particular from the Vaia storm in October 2018. A web-GIS platform allows to select the damaged area by drawing polygons; several vegetation indices (VIs) are automatically calculated using remote sensing data (Sentinel-2A) and tested to identify the more suitable ones for quantifying forest damage using cross-validation with ground-truth data. Results show that the mean value of NDVI and NDMI decreased in the damaged areas, and have a strong negative correlation with severity. RGI has an opposite behavior in contrast with NDVI and NDMI, as it highlights the red component of the land surface. In all cases, variance of the VI increases after the event between 0.03 and 0.15. Understorey not damaged from the windthrow, if consisting of 40% or more of the total cover in the area, undermines significantly the sensibility of the VIs to detecting and predicting severity. Using aggregational statistics (average and standard deviation) of VIs over polygons as input to a machine learning algorithm, i.e., Random Forest, results in severity prediction with regression reaching a root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.96, on a severity scale of 0-100, using an ensemble of area averages and standard deviations of NDVI, NDMI, and RGI indices. The results show that combining more than one VI can significantly improve the estimation of severity, and web-GIS tools can support decisions with selected VIs. The reported results prove that Sentinel-2 imagery can be deployed and analysed via web-tools to estimate forest damage severity and that VIs can be used via machine learning for predicting severity of damage, with careful evaluation of the effect of understorey in each situation.

TI  - Molecular Typing of Pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i> Species Isolated from Wild Mammal Reservoirs in Sardinia
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryLeptospirosis is caused by pathogenic spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira. Humans can become infected with these bacteria through direct contact with urine from infected animals or indirectly through interaction with a urine contaminated environment. Among wildlife species, rodents are considered the primary reservoir hosts for leptospirosis in rural and urban environments. Epidemiological data, regarding leptospirosis in various wild species in Europe, suggest that these animals play a different role in leptospiral persistence. Unfortunately, studies on the presence and typing of Leptospira species in wild mammals are lacking in Sardinia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of Leptospira species in wild mammals. Kidneys collected from carcasses were analyzed by culture and molecular testing. Greater positivity was found in hedgehogs, followed by weasels and rodents. The results obtained suggest that Sardinian fauna may play a possible sentinel role in the transmission cycle of leptospirosis to humans. Gathering this information in different wildlife species is crucial for better understanding of the epidemiology of leptospirosis and for the development of appropriate prevention measures.Leptospirosis is a global zoonosis caused by pathogenic species of Leptospira that infect a large spectrum of domestic and wild animals. This study is the first molecular identification, characterization, and phylogeny of Leptospira strains with veterinary and zoonotic impact in Sardinian wild hosts. All samples collected were cultured and analyzed by multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Sequencing, phylogenetic analyses (based on rrs and secY sequences), and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) based on the analysis of seven concatenated loci were also performed. Results revealed the detection of Leptospira DNA and cultured isolates in 21% and 4% of the samples examined, respectively. Sequence analysis of Leptospira positive samples highlighted the presence of the interrogans and borgpetersenii genospecies that grouped in strongly supported monophyletic clades. MLST analyses identified six different Sequence Types (ST) that clustered in two monophyletic groups specific for Leptospira interrogans, and L. borgpetersenii. This study provided about the prevalence of leptospires in wild mammals in Sardinia, and increased our knowledge of this pathogen on the island. Monitoring Leptospira strains circulating in Sardinia will help clinicians and veterinarians develop strategic plans for the prevention and control of leptospiral infections.

TI  - Assessing the Sentinel-2 Capabilities to Identify Abandoned Crops Using Deep Learning
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The termination or interruption of agro-forestry practices for a long period gradually results in abandoned land. Abandoned land parcels do not match the requirements to access to the basic payment of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Therefore, the identification of those parcels is key in order to return fair subsidies to farmers. In this context, the present work proposes a methodology to detect abandoned crops in the Valencian Community (Spain) from remote sensing data. The approach is based on the assessment of multitemporal Sentinel-2 images and derived spectral indices, which are used as predictors for training machine learning and deep learning classifiers. Several classification scenarios, including both abandoned and active parcels, were evaluated. The best results (98.2% overall accuracy) were obtained when a bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) network was trained with a multitemporal dataset composed of twelve reflectance time series, and a derived bare soil spectral index (BSI). In this scenario we were able to effectively distinguish abandoned crops from active ones. The results revealed Sentinel-2 features are well suited for land use identification including abandoned lands, and open the possibility of implementing this type of remote sensing based methodology into the CAP payments supervision.

TI  - The Road to Operationalization of Effective Tropical Forest Monitoring Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urgency to preserve tropical forest remnants has encouraged the development of remote sensing tools and techniques to monitor diverse forest attributes for management and conservation. State-of-the-art methodologies for mapping and tracking these attributes usually achieve accuracies greater than 0.8 for forest cover monitoring; r-square values of similar to 0.5-0.7 for plant diversity, vegetation structure, and plant functional trait mapping, and overall accuracies of similar to 0.8 for categorical maps of forest attributes. Nonetheless, existing operational tropical forest monitoring systems only track single attributes at national to global scales. For the design and implementation of effective and integrated tropical forest monitoring systems, we recommend the integration of multiple data sources and techniques for monitoring structural, functional, and compositional attributes. We also recommend its decentralized implementation for adjusting methods to local climatic and ecological characteristics and for proper end-user engagement. The operationalization of the system should be based on all open-source computing platforms, leveraging international support in research and development and ensuring direct and constant user engagement. We recommend continuing the efforts to address these multiple challenges for effective monitoring.

TI  - Impacts of the San Francisco Bay Area shelter-in-place during the COVID-19 pandemic on urban heat fluxes
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to make quantitative connections between changes in social and economic activities in northern California urban areas and related Earth system environmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. We tested the hypothesis that the absence of worker activities during Shelter-in-Place in the San Francisco Bay Area detectably altered the infrared heat flux from parking lots, highways, and large building rooftops, caused primarily by quantitative changes in the reflective properties in these different classes of urban surfaces. The Landsat satellite's thermal infrared (TIR) sensor imagery for surface temperature (ST) was quantified for all the large urban features in the Bay Area that have flat (impervious) surfaces, such parking lots, wide roadways, and rooftops. These large impervious surface features in the five-county Bay Area were first delineated and classified using sub-meter aerial imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). We then compared Landsat ST data acquired on (or near) the same dates from the three previous years (2017-2019) for all these contiguous impervious surfaces. Results showed that all the large parking lots, roadway corridors, and industrial/commercial rooftops across the entire Bay Area urban landscape were detected by Landsat ST time series as significantly cooler (by 5o C to 8o C) during the unprecedented Shelterin-Place period of mid-March to late-May of 2020, compared to same months of the three previous years. The explanation for this region-wide cooling pattern in 2020 that was best supported by both remote sensing and ground-based data sets was that relatively low atmospheric aerosol lower (PM2.5) concentrations from mid-March to late May of 2020 resulted in weaker temperature inversions over the Bay Area, higher diurnal surface mixing, and lowered urban surface temperatures, compared to the three previous years.

TI  - How frequent is natural cloud seeding from ice cloud layers (&lt;-35 °C) over Switzerland?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds and cloud feedbacks represent one of the largest uncertainties in climate projections. As the ice phase influences many key cloud properties and their lifetime, its formation needs to be better understood in order to improve climate and weather prediction models. Ice crystals sedimenting out of a cloud do not sublimate immediately but can survive certain distances and eventually fall into a cloud below. This natural cloud seeding can trigger glaciation and has been shown to enhance precipitation formation. However, to date, an estimate of its occurrence frequency is lacking. In this study, we estimate the occurrence frequency of natural cloud seeding over Switzerland from satellite data and sublimation calculations.We use the DARDAR (radar lidar) satellite product between April 2006 and October 2017 to estimate the occurrence frequency of multi-layer cloud situations, where a cirrus cloud at T < -35 degrees C can provide seeds to a lower-lying feeder cloud. These situations are found to occur in 31% of the observations. Of these, 42% have a cirrus cloud above another cloud, separated, while in 58% the cirrus is part of a thicker cloud, with a potential for in-cloud seeding. Vertical distances between the cirrus and the lower-lying cloud are distributed uniformly between 100 m and 10 km. They are found to not vary with topography. Seasonally, winter nights have the most multi-layer cloud occurrences, in 38% of the measurements. Additionally, in situ and liquid origin cirrus cloud size modes can be identified according to the ice crystal mean effective radius in the DARDAR data. Using sublimation calculations, we show that in a significant number of cases the seeding ice crystals do not sublimate before reaching the lower-lying feeder cloud. Depending on whether bullet rosette, plate-like or spherical crystals were assumed, 10 %, 11% or 20% of the crystals, respectively, could provide seeds after sedimenting 2 km.The high occurrence frequency of seeding situations and the survival of the ice crystals indicate that the seeder-feeder process and natural cloud seeding are widespread phenomena over Switzerland. This hints at a large potential for natural cloud seeding to influence cloud properties and thereby the Earth's radiative budget and water cycle, which should be studied globally. Further investigations of the magnitude of the seeding ice crystals' effect on lower-lying clouds are necessary to estimate the contribution of natural cloud seeding to precipitation.

TI  - Characterizing the Topographic Changes and Land Subsidence Associated with the Mountain Excavation and City Construction on the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A mega project, Mountain Excavation and City Construction (MECC), was launched in the hilly and gully region of the Chinese Loess Plateau in 2012, in order to address the shortage of available land and create new flat land for urban construction. However, large-scale land creation and urban expansion significantly alters the local geological environment, leading to severe ground deformation. This study investigated the topographic changes, ground deformation, and their interactions due to the MECC project in the Yan'an New District (YND). First, new surface elevations were generated using ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) stereo images acquired after the construction in order to map the local topographic changes and the fill thickness associated with the MECC project. Then, the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series and 32 Sentinel-1A images were used to assess the spatial patterns of the ground deformation in the YND during the postconstruction period (2017-2018). By combining the InSAR-derived results and topographic change features, the relationship between the ground deformation and large-scale land creation was further analyzed. The results indicated that the MECC project in the YND has created over 22 km(2) of flat land, including 10.8 km(2) of filled area, with a maximum fill thickness of similar to 110 m. Significant uneven ground deformation was detected in the land-creation area, with a maximum subsidence rate of approximately 121 mm/year, which was consistent with the field survey. The strong correlation between the observed subsidence patterns and the land creation project suggested that this recorded uneven subsidence was primarily related to the spatial distribution of the filling works, along with the changes in the thickness and geotechnical properties of the filled loess; moreover, rapid urbanization, such as road construction, can accelerate the subsidence process. These findings can guide improvements in urban planning and the mitigation of geohazards in regions experiencing large-scale land construction.

TI  - Assessing scaling effect in downscaling land surface temperature in a heterogenous urban environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is confirmed that there exists a scaling effect in downscaling land surface temperature (DLST) processes. However, a literature review indicates that quantifying and fully understanding scaling effect in DLST processing remains unclear. In this study, a main goal is to quantify, assess and understand scaling effect in downscaling LST product processes at different higher spatial resolutions and spatial extents. A machine leaning model and a traditional multivariate regression model were adopted with corresponding scaling factors extracted from ASTER 15-30 m optical multispectral data and Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Different Applications (AISA) 2 m hyperspectral visible-near infrared data. MODIS 990 m LST and ASTER 90 m LST products were downscaled to high and very high resolution LST maps. In addition, ETM+ 60 m retrieved LST and Thermal Airborne Broadband Imager (TABI) 2 m retrieved LST and its upscaled LSTs were used to verify higher resolution DLST maps. The experimental results demonstrate that scaling effect in downscaling LST processes is significant, especially downscaling LST to high and very high resolution LST maps. One innovation point derived from findings by assessing the scaling effect in DLST processing is that when DLST processes are at spatial resolutions beyond a range (20-30 m in this study) measured from semivariograms, the processes are safe and their results are reasonable and reliable, and thus their scaling effect may be ignored, but when spatial resolutions and spatial extent lag distance within the range, the DLST processes are not safe, and their results are not reliable and thus the scaling effect has to be considered. Therefore, it is recommended that before conducting a DLST processing project, a range needs to be calculated by plotting semivariograms with high or very high resolution images (better to include three visible and one NIR bands), then DLST processes may be conducted at spatial resolutions lower than and equal to the range.

This is usually made through in-situ measurements. In this paper, we propose a machine learning methodology to infer the vertical distribution of phytoplankton pigments from surface satellite observations, allowing their global estimation with a high spatial and temporal resolution. After imputing missing values through iterative completion Self-Organizing Maps, smoothing and reducing the vertical distributions through principal component analysis, we used a Self-Organizing Map to cluster the reduced profiles with satellite observations. These referent vector clusters were then used to invert the vertical profiles of phytoplankton pigments. The methodology was trained and validated on the MAREDAT dataset and tested on the Tara Oceans dataset. The different regression coefficients R2 between observed and estimated vertical profiles of pigment concentration are, on average, greater than 0.7. We could expect to monitor the vertical distribution of phytoplankton types in the global ocean.

TI  - A Tool for Pre-Operational Daily Mapping of Floods and Permanent Water Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An automated tool for pre-operational mapping of floods and inland waters using Sentinel-1 data is presented. The acronym AUTOWADE (AUTOmatic Water Areas DEtector) is used to denote it. The tool provides the end user (Italian Department of Civil Protection) with a continuous, near real-time (NRT) monitoring of the extent of inland water surfaces (floodwater and permanent water). It implements the following operations: downloading of Sentinel-1 products; preprocessing of the products and storage of the resulting geocoded and calibrated data; generation of the intermediate products, such as the exclusion mask; application of a floodwater/permanent water mapping algorithm; generation of the output layer, i.e., a map of floodwater/permanent water; delivery of the output layer to the end user. The open floodwater/permanent water mapping algorithm implemented in AUTOWADE is based on a new approach, denoted as buffer-from-edge (BFE), which combines different techniques, such as clustering, edge filtering, automatic thresholding and region growing. AUTOWADE copes also with the typical presence of gaps in the flood maps caused by undetected flooded vegetation. An attempt to partially fill these gaps by analyzing vegetated areas adjacent to open water is performed by another algorithm implemented in the tool, based on the fuzzy logic. The BFE approach has been validated offline using maps produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. Validation has given good results with a F1-score larger than 0.87 and a kappa coefficient larger than 0.80. The algorithm to detect flooded vegetation has been visually compared with optical data and aerial photos; its capability to fill some of the gaps present in flood maps has been confirmed.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion and its future projection play an important role in the changing climatic scenario. An attempt has been made to establish a relationship between NDVI and cover-management factor (C-factor) which varies with area and crop. IRS LISS III data with 23.5 m resolution is used to derive precisely NDVI and correlated with C-factor, the derived regression equation shows a good relationship between NDVI and C-factor value. An approach was made to use this area specific equation for getting C- factor for the whole Mahabubnagar district, Telangana from 2013 imagery data and the study was conducted in 2017. For future scenarios study, a relationship between rainfall, temperature, and NDVI of the whole district was derived. The NDVI value of the study area varies between 0.63 and 0.046. Based on the regression model C-factor for the future scenarios using available CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-5) has been mapped for the whole district. Using the NDVI map, the C-factor map of the area was prepared in ArcGIS 10.0 software. The spatial distribution shows that the C-factor values varied between 0.52-0.86. On an average C- factor for 2020s, 2050s and in 2080s were 0.53, 0.76, and 0.77 respectively. The predicted C- factor values were then brought under the GIS environment and C- factor prediction maps were generated.

AB  - Moisture is one of the crucial atmospheric parameters in parameterization schemes and hence it is important to study regional moisture variation with altitude at different temporal scales. ERA-Interim and MERRA reanalysis data for 38 years (1980?2017) is analyzed to study the diurnal, seasonal, and annual variation of relative humidity (RH) with altitudes over Indian land (IND), East Equatorial Indian Ocean (EEIO), and West Equatorial Indian Ocean (WEIO). Layer Averaged Relative Humidity (LARH) data for six years (2012?2017) retrieved from Megha-Tropiques (MT) satellite, is used to compare with reanalysis data at different temporal scales. Results indicate, early morning (03?06 Local Time (LT)) maximum and afternoon (15?18 LT) minimum contrasting diurnal RH pattern, with a comparatively dry middle troposphere for Indian land and oceans. Maximum diurnal variability over land is observed at lower tropospheric humidity, whereas the same is observed at upper tropospheric humidity over oceans. Contrasting seasonal variation of moisture over land and oceans show wettest (driest) monsoon and driest (wettest) winter over land (oceans). LARH comparison between the reanalysis and satellite data at multiple scales indicates that ERA-Interim data performs slightly better than MERRA data over land and oceans. Trend analysis of 38 years of ERA-data indicates increasing moisture trends over land and decreasing trend at the surface level over oceans.

TI  - Blind Hyperspectral Unmixing Based on Graph Total Variation Regularization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data from hyperspectral cameras suffer from limited spatial resolution, in which a single pixel of a hyperspectral image may contain information from several materials in the field of view. Blind hyperspectral image unmixing is the process of identifying the pure spectra of individual materials (i.e., endmembers) and their proportions (i.e., abundances) at each pixel. In this article, we propose a novel blind hyperspectral unmixing model based on the graph total variation (gTV) regularization, which can be solved efficiently by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). To further alleviate the computational cost, we apply the Nystrom method to approximate a fully connected graph by a small subset of sampled points. Furthermore, we adopt the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme to solve the gTV-involved subproblem in ADMM by decomposing a gray-scale image into a bitwise form. A variety of numerical experiments on synthetic and real hyperspectral images are conducted, showcasing the potential of the proposed method in terms of identification accuracy and computational efficiency.

TI  - Flood Monitoring in Rural Areas of the Pearl River Basin (China) Using Sentinel-1 SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood hazards result in enormous casualties and huge economic losses every year in the Pearl River Basin (PRB), China. It is, therefore, crucial to monitor floods in PRB for a better understanding of the flooding patterns and characteristics of the PRB. Previous studies, which utilized hydrological data were not successful in identifying flooding patterns in the rural and remote regions in PRB. Such regions are the key supplier of agricultural products and water resources for the entire PRB. Thus, an analysis of the impacts of floods could provide a useful tool to support mitigation strategies. Using 66 Sentinel-1 images, this study employed Otsu's method to investigate floods and explore flood patterns across the PRB from 2017 to 2020. The results indicated that floods are mainly located in the central West River Basin (WRB), middle reaches of the North River (NR) and middle reaches of the East River (ER). WRB is more prone to flood hazards. In 2017, 94.0% flood-impacted croplands were located in WRB; 95.0% of inundated croplands (similar to 9480 hectares) were also in WRB. The most vulnerable areas to flooding are sections of the Yijiang, Luoqingjiang, Qianjiang, and Xunjiang tributaries and the lower reaches of Liujiang. Our results highlight the severity of flood hazards in a rural region of the PRB and emphasize the need for policy overhaul to enhance flood control in rural regions in the PRB to ensure food safety.

TI  - A Scalable Unsupervised Classification Method Using Rough Set for Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE-IJSSCI
M3  - Article
AB  - Reference to geographic scale and geographic space representation are characteristics of geospatial data. This work has discussed two issues related to satellite image data, namely huge size and mixed pixels. In clustering, an unsupervised classification and a set of similar objects are grouped together based on the similarity measures. The similarity between intracluster objects is high, whereas the similarity between intercluster objects is low. This paper proposes a clustering technique called spatial rough k-means that classifies the mixed pixels based on their spatial neighbourhood relationship. The authors compared the performance of different state-of-the-art clustering algorithms with that of proposed algorithms for image partitioning and map-reduce methods. The results show that the proposed algorithm has produced clusters of better quality than state-of-the-art algorithms in both the approaches used for handling the vast input data size. Experiments conducted on Landsat-TM 5 data of Delhi region demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed work.

AB  - In the area of remote sensing, one of the problems is how high-quality remote sensing images are automatically categorized and classified. There have been many suggestions for alternatives. Amongst these, there are drawbacks of approaches focused on low visual and intermediate visual characteristics. This article, therefore, adopts the deep learning method for classifying high-resolution remote sensing picture scenes to learn semantic knowledge. Most of the existing neural network convolution approaches are focused on the model of transfer training and there are comparatively like hidden Marco models, linear fitting methods, the creation of new neural networks based on the latest high-resolution remote sensing picture data sets. But in this paper, we used a modified backpropagation neural network is proposed to detect the objects in images. To test the performance of the proposed model we use two remote sensing data sets benchmark tests were done. The test-precision, precision, reminder, and F1 scores are all fine with the Assist data collection. The precision, precision, reminder, and F1 score are all enhanced on the SIRI-WHU dataset. The proposed system has better precision and robustness compared to the current approaches including the most conventional methods and certain profound learning methods to scene distinguish high-resolution remote sensing pictures.

TI  - Mapping a Cloud-Free Rice Growth Stages Using the Integration of PROBA-V and Sentinel-1 and Its Temporal Correlation with Sub-District Statistics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring rice production is essential for securing food security against climate change threats, such as drought and flood events becoming more intense and frequent. The current practice to survey an area of rice production manually and in near real-time is expensive and involves a high workload for local statisticians. Remote sensing technology with satellite-based sensors has grown in popularity in recent decades as an alternative approach, reducing the cost and time required for spatial analysis over a wide area. However, cloud-free pixels of optical imagery are required to produce accurate outputs for agriculture applications. Thus, in this study, we propose an integration of optical (PROBA-V) and radar (Sentinel-1) imagery for temporal mapping of rice growth stages, including bare land, vegetative, reproductive, and ripening stages. We have built classification models for both sensors and combined them into 12-day periodical rice growth-stage maps from January 2017 to September 2018 at the sub-district level over Java Island, the top rice production area in Indonesia. The accuracy measurement was based on the test dataset and the predicted cross-correlated with monthly local statistics. The overall accuracy of the rice growth-stage model of PROBA-V was 83.87%, and the Sentinel-1 model was 71.74% with the Support Vector Machine classifier. The temporal maps were comparable with local statistics, with an average correlation between the vegetative area (remote sensing) and harvested area (local statistics) is 0.50, and lag time 89.5 days (n = 91). This result was similar to local statistics data, which correlate planting and the harvested area at 0.61, and the lag time as 90.4 days, respectively. Moreover, the cross-correlation between the predicted rice growth stage was also consistent with rice development in the area (r > 0.52, p < 0.01). This novel method is straightforward, easy to replicate and apply to other areas, and can be scaled up to the national and regional level to be used by stakeholders to support improved agricultural policies for sustainable rice production.

TI  - Uncertainty in different precipitation products in the case of two atmospheric river events
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the World Climate Research Programme Grand Challenges is to evaluate whether existing observations are enough to underpin the assessment of weather and climate extremes. In this study, we focus on extreme associated with atmospheric rivers (ARs). ARs are characterized by intense moisture transport usually from the tropics to the extra-tropics. They can either be beneficial, providing critical water supply, or hazardous, when excessive precipitation accumulation leads to floods. Here, we examine the uncertainty in gridded precipitation products included in the Frequent Rainfall Observations on GridS (FROGS) database during two atmospheric river events in distinct Mediterranean climates: one in California, USA, and another in Portugal. FROGS is composed of gridded daily-precipitation products on a common 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid to facilitate intercomparison and assessment exercises. The database includes satellite, ground-based and reanalysis (RE) products. Results show that the precipitation products based on satellite data, individually or combined with other products, perform least well in capturing daily precipitation totals over land during both cases studied here. The RE and the gauge-based products show the best agreement with local ground stations. As expected, there is an overall underestimation of precipitation by the different products. For the Portuguese AR, the multi-product ensembles reveal mean absolute percentage errors between -25% and -60%. For the western US case, the range is from -60% to -100%.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Urbanization Patterns in Four Rapidly Growing South Asian Cities Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and dominant urbanization in Asian cities has fueled concerns regarding the local and global efforts toward urban sustainability. Specifically, South Asian cities have been a topical issue concerning ecological and environmental threats due to their unplanned and haphazard urban development. However, comparative urbanization studies in South Asian cities remain uncommon. Therefore, in this study, we sought to comparatively examine the land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics and to detect the urbanization patterns of four rapidly developing South Asian lowland cities: Mumbai (India), Colombo (Sri Lanka), Karachi (Pakistan), and Dhaka (Bangladesh). Sentinel-2 (10 m) data and various geospatial approaches, including urban-rural gradient and grid-based methods, statistics, and urban landscape metric techniques, were used to facilitate the analysis. The study revealed that Mumbai, Karachi, and Dhaka had larger built-up landscapes compared to Colombo. Mumbai had the highest percentage of green spaces, followed by Colombo. Dhaka and Karachi had relatively small percentages of green spaces. Colombo and Dhaka had more croplands, which consistently increased along the urban-rural gradient compared to Mumbai and Karachi. Karachi showed that the only major land use was built-up, while most of the areas were left as open lands. On the other hand, Colombo's urban setup was more fragmented than the other three cities. Mumbai and Karachi had larger patches of urban footprints compared to Colombo and Dhaka. Thus, this study provides vital information on the past land utilization priorities in the four cities, and comparatively proffers guidance on certain critical areas of focus for local, regional, and global future sustainable urban planning.

TI  - Land Subsidence Susceptibility Mapping Using Persistent Scatterer SAR Interferometry Technique and Optimized Hybrid Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, land subsidence susceptibility was assessed for Shahryar County in Iran using the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) machine learning algorithm. Another aim of the present paper was to assess if ensembles of ANFIS with two meta-heuristic algorithms (imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and gray wolf optimization (GWO)) would yield a better prediction performance. A remote sensing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset from 2019 to 2020 and the persistent-scatterer SAR interferometry (PS-InSAR) technique were used to obtain a land subsidence inventory of the study area and use it for training and testing models. Resulting PS points were divided into two parts of 70% and 30% for training and testing the models, respectively. For susceptibility analysis, eleven conditioning factors were taken into account: the altitude, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to stream, distance to road, stream density, groundwater drawdown, and land use/land cover (LULC). A frequency ratio (FR) was applied to assess the correlation of factors to subsidence occurrence. The prediction power of the models and their generated land subsidence susceptibility maps (LSSMs) were validated using the root mean square error (RMSE) value and area under curve of receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) analysis. The ROC results showed that ANFIS-ICA had the best accuracy (0.932) among the models (ANFIS-GWO (0.926), ANFIS (0.908)). The results of this work showed that optimizing ANFIS with meta-heuristics considerably improves LSSM accuracy although ANFIS alone had an acceptable result.

TI  - An Adaptive Tracking Algorithm for Convection in Simulated and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A robust and computationally efficient object tracking algorithm is developed by incorporating various tracking techniques. Physical properties of the objects, such as brightness temperature or reflectivity, are not considered. Therefore, the algorithm is adaptable for tracking convection-like features in simulated data and remotely sensed two-dimensional images. In this algorithm, a first guess of the motion, estimated using the Fourier phase shift, is used to predict the candidates for matching. A disparity score is computed for each target-candidate pair. The disparity also incorporates overlapping criteria in the case of large objects. Then the Hungarian method is applied to identify the best pairs by minimizing the global disparity. The high-disparity pairs are unmatched, and their target and candidate are declared expired and newly initiated objects, respectively. They are tested for merger and split on the basis of their size and overlap with the other objects. The sensitivity of track duration is shown for different disparity and size thresholds. The paper highlights the algorithm's ability to study convective life cycles using radar and simulated data over Darwin, Australia. The algorithm skillfully tracks individual convective cells (a few pixels in size) and large convective systems. The duration of tracks and cell size are found to be lognormally distributed over Darwin. The evolution of size and precipitation types of isolated convective cells is presented in the Lagrangian perspective. This algorithm is part of a vision for a modular platform [viz., TINT is not TITAN (TINT) and Tracking and Object-Based Analysis of Clouds (tobac)] that will evolve into a sustainable choice to analyze atmospheric features.

TI  - The applicability of Magseed? for targeted axillary dissection in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Targeted axillary dissection (TAD), the combination of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and targeted lymph node biopsy (TLNB), can reduce the false negative rates of sentinel node biopsy alone dramatically in breast cancer patients, who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). However methods for TAD are still under investigation. Methods: Magseed (R), a non-radioactive magnetic marker was used to mark the biopsied positive TLN after NAC. The SLNB with the standard technetium-based method and the selective TLNB with Magseed (R) localization were performed in 40 patients. The TLNs were identified with the Sentimag (R) probe and excised in all patients. Specimen x-ray was performed to confirm the Magseed (R) within the prior to NAC biopsied and clipped lymph node. Results: The TLN identification rate was 100% (40/40), the SLN identification rate was 82.5% (33/40), the concordance rate between the TLN and the SLN was 65% (26/40). Complications according Magseed (R) deployment or identification could not be observed. Conclusion: Magseed (R) is a reliable and feasible marker for the identification of TLNs after NAC.

TI  - Detecting and Analyzing the Evolution of Subsidence Due to Coal Fires in Jharia Coalfield, India Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Public safety and socio-economic development of the Jharia coalfield (JCF) in India is critically dependent on precise monitoring and comprehensive understanding of coal fires, which have been burning underneath for more than a century. This study utilizes New-Small BAseline Subset (N-SBAS) technique to compute surface deformation time series for 2017-2020 to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of coal fires in JCF. The line-of-sight (LOS) surface deformation estimated from ascending and descending Sentinel-1 SAR data are subsequently decomposed to derive precise vertical subsidence estimates. The most prominent subsidence (similar to 22 cm) is observed in Kusunda colliery. The subsidence regions also correspond well with the Landsat-8 based thermal anomaly map and field evidence. Subsequently, the vertical surface deformation time-series is analyzed to characterize temporal variations within the 9.5 km(2) area of coal fires. Results reveal that nearly 10% of the coal fire area is newly formed, while 73% persisted throughout the study period. Vulnerability analyses performed in terms of the susceptibility of the population to land surface collapse demonstrate that Tisra, Chhatatanr, and Sijua are the most vulnerable towns. Our results provide critical information for developing early warning systems and remediation strategies.

TI  - Bayesian long-term survival model including a frailty term: Application to melanoma data
T2  - CHILEAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a flexible cure rate model including a frailty term, which was obtained by incorporating a random effect in the risk function of latent competing causes. The number of competing causes of the event of interest follows a negative binomial distribution, and the frailty variable follows a power variance function distribution, which includes other frailty models such as gamma, positive stable, and inverse Gaussian frailty models as special cases. The proposed model takes into account the presence of covariates and right-censored data, which are suitable for populations with a long-term survivors. Besides, it allows quantification of the degree of unobserved heterogeneity induced by unobservable risk factors, which is important to explain the lifetime. Once the posterior density function is not expressed in the closed form, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are performed for the estimation procedure. Simulation studies were considered in order to evaluate the proposed model performance, and its practical relevance was illustrated in a real medical dataset from a population-based study of incident cases of melanoma diagnosed in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

TI  - Serological and molecular survey of <i>Leptospira</i> spp. infections in wild boars and red foxes from Southeastern France
T2  - VETERINARY WORLD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aim: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease. Information on the recent prevalence of Leptospira in hunted wild animals is limited, particularly in southeastern France. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the prevalence and diversity of Leptospira spp. among wild boars (Sus scrofa) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from two military camps in Southeastern France.Materials and Methods: Serological analyses were performed using microscopic agglutination tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to demonstrate Leptospira spp. infection from boar kidney DNA extracts.Results: According to the species, the positive sera were obtained from 18% of 358 boars and 6 % of 64 foxes tested. The prevalence rate is significantly higher (p <= 0.02) in boars than in foxes. In wild boar, Australis represents the most recorded serogroup (15.9%), followed by Sejroe (2.8%) and icterohaemorhagiae (2.8%). In red fox, icterohaemorhagiae represents the most recorded serogroup (6.25%), followed by Sejroe (1.57%) and Hebdomadis (1.57%). PCR-based detection of Leptospira DNA was positive in 6/62 (9.6%) of the wild boars tested.Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed the importance of wild boar in the epidemiology of leptospirosis among wildlife in Southeastern France. Due to their predatory behavior and their varied diet, mainly composed of small mammals, red foxes could be considered sentinel animals of environmental contamination with leptospires.

TI  - Rates of Osteoporosis Management and Secondary Preventative Treatment After Primary Fragility Fractures.
T2  - JB & JS open access
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Fragility fractures are often sentinel events in documenting new cases of osteoporosis. Numerous analyses have demonstrated low rates of adequate osteoporosis evaluation and treatment following primary fragility fractures. The purpose of this study was to quantify the incidence of primary fragility fractures in America and the rates of osteoporosis screening and management before and after fracture.METHODS: A retrospective review of the PearlDiver database was conducted using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Patients who were 60 to 80 years of age and had primary fragility fractures of the hip, wrist, spine, pelvis, humerus, and other unspecified locations were included. The rates of dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening and osteoporosis pharmacotherapy were assessed for 2 years before and 2 years after the primary fracture.RESULTS: In this study, 48,668 patients with a primary fragility fracture were identified. Within this cohort, 25.8% (12,573 of 48,668) had received osteoporosis screening or treatment in the prior 2 years. In the 36,095 patients with no management before the fracture, 19% (6,799 patients) were diagnosed with osteoporosis and 18.4% (6,653 patients) received a DXA scan and/or filed claims for pharmacotherapy in the following 2 years. Patients with an osteoporosis diagnosis were more likely to receive both types of management (odds ratio [OR], 11.55 [95% confidence (CI), 10.31 to 12.95]), and male patients were less likely to receive both types of management (OR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.17 to 0.27]). Secondary fragility fractures within the next 2 years were diagnosed in 8.4% (3,038 of 36,095) of patients at a mean of 221 days following the primary fracture.CONCLUSIONS: The rates of appropriate osteoporosis evaluation, diagnosis, and management following primary fragility fractures remain unacceptably low. Less than one-third of patients with primary fragility fractures had been evaluated or treated for osteoporosis in the 2 years prior to fracture. Furthermore, among patients without pre-fracture management, <20% received osteoporosis screening or treatment within the next 2 years.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - Spectral and diurnal temporal suitability of GOES Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) reflectance for burned area mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the new generation of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series provides 10 min, multi-spectral, 500 m to 2 km observations, with significantly improved capabilities compared to the previous GOES sensors. For the first time GOES data are available with sufficient resolution to potentially enable burned area mapping using the reflective wavelength data. In this study GOES-16 ABI unburned and burned reflectance acquired over four extensive burns in the United States and South America were examined. Significant diurnal variations in the ABI reflectance due to surface reflectance anisotropy and changes in the position of the sun at each ABI observation time were observed, with unburned near-infrared (NIR) reflectance that varied by more than 50% over the day, and this variation was greater than the change in reflectance due to fire. The diurnal reflectance variation included locally increased backscatter reflectance acquired under near hot-spot conditions when the solar zenith was close to the view zenith. The spectral and diurnal temporal suitability of the ABI data for burned area mapping was assessed for the red, NIR and short wave infrared (SWIR) bands using the transformed divergence metric applied to the unburned and burned reflectance values for each ABI acquisition time. The separabilities varied diurnally but with no consistent view-solar geometry or time when the separabilities were consistently high among the four sites. The paper results demonstrate that use of ABI reflectance without consideration of, or correction, for surface anisotropy will be unreliable. The most suitable ABI bands to detect burned areas are the NIR, which provided high diurnal separabilities except in the early morning and late evening, and the normalized burn ratio (NBR), computed as the difference between the NIR and SWIR reflectance divided by their sum, that had more consistently high diurnal separability. Implications and recommendations for future ABI burned area mapping research are discussed.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Lake Water Clarity: Performance and Transferability of Both Historical Algorithms and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been little rigorous investigation of the transferability of existing empirical water clarity models developed at one location or time to other lakes and dates of imagery with differing conditions. Machine learning methods have not been widely adopted for analysis of lake optical properties such as water clarity, despite their successful use in many other applications of environmental remote sensing. This study compares model performance for a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm and a simple 4-band linear model with 13 previously published empirical non-machine learning algorithms. We use Landsat surface reflectance product data aligned with spatially and temporally co-located in situ Secchi depth observations from northeastern USA lakes over a 34-year period in this analysis. To evaluate the transferability of models across space and time, we compare model fit using the complete dataset (all images and samples) to a single-date approach, in which separate models are developed for each date of Landsat imagery with more than 75 field samples. On average, the single-date models for all algorithms had lower mean absolute errors (MAE) and root mean squared errors (RMSE) than the models fit to the complete dataset. The RF model had the highest pseudo-R-2 for the single-date approach as well as the complete dataset, suggesting that an RF approach outperforms traditional linear regression-based algorithms when modeling lake water clarity using satellite imagery.

TI  - Operational Coregistration of the Sentinel-2A/B Image Archive Using Multitemporal Landsat Spectral Averages
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geometric misalignment between Landsat and Sentinel-2 data sets as well as multitemporal inconsistency of Sentinel-2A and -2B data sets currently complicate multitemporal analyses. Operational coregistration of Sentinel-2A and -2B imagery is thus required. We present a modification of the established Landsat Sentinel Registration (LSReg) algorithm. The modifications enabled LSReg to be included in an operational preprocessing workflow to automatically coregister large volumes of Sentinel-2 imagery with Landsat base images that represent multiannual monthly spectral average values. The modified LSReg was tested for the complete Sentinel-2 archive covering Crete, Greece, which is a particularly challenging region due to steep topographic gradients and high shares of water in Sentinel-2 tiles. A coregistration success rate of 87.5% of all images was obtained with a mean coregistration precision of 4.4 m. The mean shifts of 14.0 m in the x-direction and 13.4 m in the y-direction before coregistration were found, with maxima exceeding four pixels. Time series noise in locations with land cover transitions (n = 585) was effectively reduced by 43% using the presented approach. The multitemporal geometric consistency of the Sentinel-2 data set was substantially improved, thus enabling time series analyses within the Sentinel-2 data record, as well as integrated Landsat and Sentinel-2A and -2B data sets. The modified algorithm is implemented in the Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE) version 3.0 (https://github.com/davidfrantz/force).

TI  - An Assessment of Water Sources for Heritage Listed Organic Mound Springs in NW Australia Using Airborne Geophysical (Electromagnetics and Magnetics) and Satellite Remote Sensing Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Discrete phreatophytic vegetation associated with organic mound springs is present in several places in the semi-arid Walyarta Conservation Park (Park) in northern Western Australia. The mound springs are heritage listed, having significant cultural and environmental significance. Increased industrial (mining and agriculture) development in the region, coupled with a growing demand for groundwater to support these developments, requires an enhanced understanding of how the springs operate and the source of water that sustains their presence. The springs are broadly believed to be situated on geological faults and receive groundwater from artesian sources. However, their association with deeper geological structures and aquifer systems, the focus of this study, is not well understood. This study employed regional- and finer-scale airborne geophysical data, including electromagnetics (AEM) and magnetics, to constrain the sub-basin-scale hydrogeology of the West Canning Basin in Western Australia and to detail tectonic deformation, sedimentological and hydrological processes. The AEM data were inverted using 1- and 2D methods to better define structural discontinuities in the Park, and the results identified the location of faults and other geological structures that were coincident with spring locations. A complementary analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of green vegetation was undertaken using remote sensing data. A model for the extent of green vegetation (in percent), calculated using a constrained linear spectral unmixing algorithm and applied to a select Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image archive, showed the persistence of green vegetation aligned with interpreted fault systems through extended dry periods. These geophysical and remotely sensed datasets demonstrate that in the Park, the sedimentary aquifers and landscapes are highly compartmentalized and that this constrains aquifer distribution, groundwater quality and the location of wetlands and phreatophytic vegetation. Integrating key information from these datasets allows for the construction of a three-dimensional model that predicts the nature and extent of the critical zone which sustains perennial groundwater discharge within mound springs, drainages and wetlands and provides a framework to assess discharge rates, mixing and, ultimately, sensitivity to changed water availability.

TI  - Quantitative Control of Early Flowering in White Lupin (<i>Lupinus albus</i> L.)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is a pulse annual plant cultivated from the tropics to temperate regions for its high-protein grain as well as a cover crop or green manure. Wild populations are typically late flowering and have high vernalization requirements. Nevertheless, some early flowering and thermoneutral accessions were found in the Mediterranean basin. Recently, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining flowering time variance were identified in bi-parental population mapping, however, phenotypic and genotypic diversity in the world collection has not been addressed yet. In this study, a diverse set of white lupin accessions (n = 160) was phenotyped for time to flowering in a controlled environment and genotyped with PCR-based markers (n = 50) tagging major QTLs and selected homologs of photoperiod and vernalization pathway genes. This survey highlighted quantitative control of flowering time in white lupin, providing statistically significant associations for all major QTLs and numerous regulatory genes, including white lupin homologs of CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T, FY, MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1, PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4, SKI-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1, and VERNALIZATION INDEPENDENCE 3. This revealed the complexity of flowering control in white lupin, dispersed among numerous loci localized on several chromosomes, provided economic justification for future genome-wide association studies or genomic selection rather than relying on simple marker-assisted selection.

TI  - Tracers and corresponding detection devices: technetium colloids, blue dyes & NIR fluorescence
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tracers and corresponding detection devices for the mapping of sentinel lymph nodes have been evolving since the first use of lymphangiogram methods in 1977 in penile carcinoma. Nowadays a variety of dyes and radiotracers have been validated for use in breast, vulvar and cervical cancer as well as melanoma. Each tumor site with its anatomical conditions requires different mapping protocol. While the combination of radiotracer and blue dye or radiotracer alone is an established method for breast surgery, vulvar cancer and melanoma, in pelvic sentinel lymph node mapping indocyanine green is currently gaining popularity. Near infrared fluorescence imaging is an emerging technique that enables a real-time image-guided procedure and is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a sentinel lymph node mapping substance with standard of care. New tracers and devices are constantly under investigation to better understand the pathway of lymphatic drainage and increase the sensibility and sensitivity of the method. In the present review the evolution of available tracers and detection devices is discussed. An exhaustive review of current clinical indications of each method, its particularities and adverse effects is made. Finally, an update on ongoing clinical studies in sentinel lymph node mapping methods is presented.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node in vulvar cancer
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node removal as a part of surgical management is a standard of care in vulvar cancer patients. Due to patient morbidities and difficulties in treatment of inguinal healing after lymph nodes removal, lymphatic mapping has emerged as an increasingly popular option over the past few years. At this time several different techniques have been described and variety of different dyes were used. In addition, an important aspect of the use of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique is the removal of a limited number of lymph nodes, which allows more detailed pathological examination. Moreover, the interpretation of pathological ultra-staging of SLNs, which can identify low-volume metastases for which the clinical significance and the ideal management, remain uncertain. Despite differences in techniques and dyes used, this minimally invasive procedure is currently recommended as an alternative to full inguinofemoral lymph node dissection in selected cases by all major international societies. As for now SLN concept became a standard of care in vulvar cancer. This technique, though simple as a concept, requires a learning curve and should only be used in expert centers. This article provides a review on literature on SLN technique in vulvar cancer, current recommendations and future lines of investigation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass beds play an ecological role in the shallow marine environment, such as a habitat for biota, primary producers, and sediment traps. They also act as nutrient recyclers. Since they have such an important role, this natural resource needs to be preserved. Therefore, continuous monitoring and mapping of seagrass beds, especially by remote sensing methods, is paramount. The current rapid development of satellite sensor technology, especially its spatial and spectral resolutions, has improved the quality of the seagrass distribution map. The use of proper classification methods and schemes in the classification of seagrass distribution based on satellite imagery can affect the accuracy of the map, which is why various alternative algorithm studies are required. In this study, the Support Vector Machine and Fuzzy Logic algorithms were used to classify the WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 satellite imageries on Kodingareng Lompo Island with four classes of seagrass cover, sparse (0-25%), moderate (26-50%), dense (51-75%), and very dense (76-100%). The result showed that the Fuzzy Logic algorithm applied to WorldView-2 imagery has the best overall accuracy of 78.60% seagrass cover classification.

TI  - Fusion of Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope time-series data into daily 3 m surface reflectance and wheat LAI monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of Leaf Area Index (LAI) from space is key to identify crop types and their phenology over large areas, and to characterize spatial variations within growers' fields. However, for years remote-sensing applications have been constrained by a trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolutions. This study resolves this limitation. Over the past decade, the number of companies and organizations developing CubeSat constellations has increased. These new satellites make it possible to acquire large image collections at high spatial and temporal resolutions at a relatively low cost. However, the images obtained from CubeSat constellations frequently suffer from inconsistency in the data calibration between the different satellites within the constellation. To overcome these inconsistencies, a new method to fuse a time series of images sourced from two different satellite constellations is proposed, combining the advantages of both (i.e., the temporal, spatial and spectral resolution). This new technique was applied to fuse PlanetScope images with Sentinel-2 images, to create spectrally consistent daily images of wheat LAI at a 3 m resolution. The daily 3 m LAI estimations were compared with 57 in-situ wheat LAI measurements taken in Australia and Israel. This approach was demonstrated to successfully estimate Green LAI (LAI before the major on-set of leaf senescence) with an R-2 of 0.94 and 86% relative accuracy (RMSE of 1.37) throughout the growing season without using any ground calibration. However, both the Sentinel-2 based estimates and the fused Green LAI were underestimated at high LAI values (LAI > 3). To account for this, regression models were developed, improving the relative accuracy of the Green LAI estimations by up to a further 47% (RMSE of 0.35-0.63) in comparison with field measured LAI. The new time series fusion method is an effective tool for continuous daily monitoring of crops at high-resolution over large scales, which opens up a range of new precision agriculture applications. These high spatio-temporal resolution time-series are valuable for monitoring crop growth and health, and can improve the effectiveness of farming practices and enhance yield forecasts at the field and sub-field scales.

TI  - Influence of Pan-African tectonics on older Precambrian basement structural fabrics as revealed from the interpretation of aeromagnetic and remote sensing data of Ikole/Kabba region, southwestern Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliance on structural data from geological mapping will be grossly inadequate to establish an informative regional tectonogenic interpretation in southwestern Nigeria mainly because of poor exposure of outcrops due to severe weathering in the tropical region. Therefore high resolution aeromagnetic anomaly and Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data were adopted for tectonic analysis of Ikole/Kabba area where qualitative analysis of Landsat-8 imagery provides surface lineaments with major E - W and N-S trends. Processing of the aeromagnetic anomaly data utilizing the horizontal gradient magnitude and total gradient methods indicated various E - W, NW - SE, N-S and NE - SW structural features in agreement with the surface lineaments; lending credence to the existing geologic structural interpretation. The resulting synoptic structural interpretation suggests the preservation of two major successive events; an earlier prominent E-W trending lineaments resulting from a N-S compressional deformation, succeeded by a brittle deformational event characterized by NW-SE and NE-SW trending lineaments. Additionally, the magnetic basement depth map deduced from the source parameter imaging technique shows depth values between 50 m and 650 m, which represent depths to the top of structural features within the basement rocks of the region. The collective interpretation of high resolution aeromagnetic anomaly and Landsat-8 data provides significant information about regional tectonics and structures that are good conduits for mineral deposits within the study area.

TI  - Statistical Validation of MODIS-Based Sea Surface Temperature in Shallow Semi-Enclosed Marginal Sea: A Comparison between Direct Matchup and Triple Collocation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Validating remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental step in establishing reliable biological/physical models that can be used in different marine applications. Mapping SST using accurate models would assess in understanding critical mechanisms of marine and coastal zones, such as water circulations and biotic activities. This study set out to validate MODIS SSTs with a spatial resolution of 1-km in the Arabian Gulf (24-30 degrees N, 48-57 degrees E) and to assess how well direct comparison of dual matchups and triple collocation analyses perform. For the matchup process, three data sets, MODIS-Aqua, MODIS-Terra, and iQuam, were co-located and extracted for 1-pixel box centered at each actual in situ measurement location with a time difference window restricted to a maximum of +/- 3 h of the satellite overpass. Over the period July 2002 to May 2020, the MODIS SSTs (N = 3786 triplets) exhibited a slight cool night-time bias compared to iQuam SSTs, with a mean +/- SD of -0.36 +/- 0.77 degrees C for Aqua and -0.27 +/- 0.83 degrees C for Terra. Daytime MODIS SST observations (N = 5186 triplets) had a lower negative bias for both Aqua (Bias = -0.052 degrees C, SD = 0.93 degrees C) and Terra (Bias = -0.24 degrees C, SD = 0.90 degrees C). Using extended triple collocation analysis, the statistical validation of system- and model-based products against in situ-based product indicated the highest ETC-based determination coefficients (rho(2)(t,X) >= 0.98) with the lowest error variances (sigma(2)(epsilon) <= 0.32), whereas direct comparison underestimated the determination coefficients and overestimated the error estimates for all MODIS algorithms. The ETC-based error variances for MODIS Aqua/Terra NLSSTs were 0.25/0.19 and 0.26/0.32 in daytime and night-time, respectively. In addition, MODIS-Aqua was relatively more sensitive to the SST signal than MODIS-Terra at night and vice versa as seen in the unbiased signal-to-noise ratios for all observation types.

TI  - Canopy Cover Estimation in Lowland Forest in South Sumatera, Using LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI imagery
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy cover is one of the most important variables in ecology, hydrology, and forest management, and useful as a basis for defining forests. LiDAR is an active remote sensing method that provides the height information of an object in three-dimensional space. The method allows for the mapping of terrain, canopy height and cover. Its only setback is that it has to be integrated with Landsat to cover a large area. The main objective of this study is to generate the canopy cover estimation model using Landsat 8 OLI and LiDAR. Landsat 8 OLI vegetation indices and LiDAR-derived canopy cover estimation, through First Return Canopy Index (FRCI) method, were used to obtain a regression model. The performance of this model was then assessed using correlation, aggregate deviation, and raster display. Lastly, the best canopy cover estimation was obtained using equation, FRCI = 2.22 + 5.63Ln(NDVI), with R-2 at 0.663, standard deviation at 0.161, correlation between actual and predicted value at 0.663, aggregate deviation at -0.182 and error at 56.10%.

TI  - Role of radical hysterectomy in patients with early-stage high-grade neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma: a NeCTuR study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivePatients with early-stage, high-grade neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma typically undergo radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. To explore the role of radical surgery in patients with this disease, who have a high likelihood of undergoing postoperative adjuvant therapy, we aimed to determine the rate of parametrial involvement and the rate of parametrial involvement without other indications for adjuvant treatment in these patients.MethodsWe retrospectively studied patients in the Neuroendocrine Cervical Tumor Registry (NeCTuR) at our institution to identify those with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 stage IA1-IB2, high-grade neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma who underwent up-front radical surgery with or without adjuvant therapy.ResultsOne hundred patients met the inclusion criteria. The median age was 35 years (range 22-65), and 51% (51/100) had pure high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma. No patient had a tumor >4 cm or suspected parametrial or nodal disease before surgery. Ten patients (10%) had microscopic parametrial compromise in the final surgical specimens. Ninety-four (94%) patients underwent nodal assessment, and 19 (19%) had positive nodes. Ten patients underwent both sentinel lymph node biopsy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, and none had false-negative findings. Patients with parametrial compromise were more likely to have positive pelvic nodes (80% vs 12%, p<0.0001), and a positive vaginal margin (20% vs 1%, p=0.03). All patients with parametrial compromise had lymphovascular space invasion (100% vs 73%, p=0.10). Of the 100 patients, 95 (95%) were recommended adjuvant therapy and 89 (89%) were known to have received it. Adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy reduced the likelihood of local recurrence by 62%.ConclusionsIn carefully selected patients with high-grade neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma, the rate of microscopic parametrial involvement is 10%. As most patients receive adjuvant treatment, we hypothesize that simple hysterectomy may be adequate when followed by adjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide followed by additional chemotherapy.

TI  - Potential wood stock in brazilian savanna using geotechnologies
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring natural resources of our planet is essential to gather information to support strategies for conservation and a sustainable use of these natural resources. This monitoring is even more important in endangered biomes, as is the case of Brazilian savannas, one of the most threatened and richest, in terms of biodiversity, savannas in the world. Usually, forest monitoring is accomplish by measuring the trees on the field, the so-called forest inventories, which are expensive, costly and extremely difficult to be performed periodically in extensive forests, as is the case of the Brazilian savannas. Therefore, this study aimed to update the information about volume and carbon stocks in savanna fragments in order to reduce tree measurements in the field. We used data from 61 savanna remnants, where 25 of them had 2 measurements with 5 years interval (monitoring). Multiple linear models, based on field data and reflectance values of Landsat images, were fitted and validated. Subsequently, the best models were applied to remnants that had only one measured, and then volume and carbon estimates were obtained for all 61 remnants in the second year of measurement. Additionally, maps updating the productivity of these remnants were generated.

TI  - STUDY OF MANGROVE COVERAGE CHANGE BASED ON OBJECT (OBIA) USING SATELLITE IMAGERY IN DOMPAK ISLAND PROVINCE OF KEPULAUAN RIAU
T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The threats on mangrove forest, either naturally such as climate change or human activities such as landfill, land-use change, and deforestation, can increase the vulnerability of this ecosystem itself Remote sensing is an effective method to use as mangrove monitoring activity because it can be done periodically and can reach a large area. This research aims to analyse mangrove coverage changes in Dompak Island, Kepulauan Riau Province. The method that was used is satellite imagery classification based on object (OBIA) with support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Satellite imagery data that was used are SPOT 4 in 2007 and Sentinel 2B in 2018 with spatial resolution of 10 x 10 m. Ground check was conducted on September-October 2018 using random sampling method. The classification results of OBIA with SVM algorithm showed 89% accuracy level, 0.86 kappa values with optimum segmentation value of 3. Based on coverage land analysis, there was degradation of 34.19% mangrove area, or about 46.61 ha, since 2007 to 2018.

TI  - Assessing Accuracy of Land Cover Change Maps Derived from Automated Digital Processing and Visual Interpretation in Tropical Forests in Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the accuracy of land cover change (2000-2018) maps compiled from Landsat images with either automated digital processing or with visual interpretation for a tropical forest area in Indonesia. The accuracy assessment used a two-stage stratified random sampling involving a confusion matrix for assessing map accuracy and by estimating areas of land cover change classes and associated uncertainty. The reference data were high-resolution images from SPOT 6/7 and high-resolution images finer than 5 m obtained from Open Foris Collect Earth. Results showed that the map derived from automated digital processing had lower accuracy (overall accuracy 73-77%) compared to the map based on visual interpretation (overall accuracy 80-84%). The automated digital processing map error was in differentiating between native forest and plantation areas. While the visual interpretation map had a higher accuracy, it did not consistently differentiate between native forest and shrub areas. Future improvement of the digital map requires more accurate differentiation between forest and plantation to better support national forest monitoring systems for sustainable forest management.

TI  - Fluvial response to active tectonics: analysis of DEM-derived longitudinal profiles in the Rangit River Basin, Eastern Himalayas, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan Mountain Range has originated from the ongoing collision of the Eurasian and the Indo-Australian plates since the Paleogene. It is widely accepted that this tectonically-driven uplift is still continuing, as reflected by a large number of earthquakes in the area. Apart from the sub-surface and geophysical signatures, the surficial geomorphic markers deserve due attention. Fluvial systems, which preserve the evidence of the past and present tectonic perturbations on the surface, have often been investigated to assess the imprints of uplift in a region. Sensitive to long-term tectonic, structural and climatic regimes, the general forms of the longitudinal profile and its derivatives have been analysed across the globe for determining the varying roles of tectonics, litho-structure and climate. This article assesses the degree of tectonic and lithological control on the drainage network of the Rangit Basin in the Eastern Himalayas. One of the important characteristics of the studied basin is that the Main Central Thrust (MCT), which is located between the Greater Himalayas and the Lesser Himalayas, divides the basin into two distinct domains. Longitudinal profiles and their derivatives of 16 major tributaries of the Rangit River were extracted from the ALOS-PALSAR DEM and analysed. The controls on this Himalayan river were evaluated based on investigations of longitudinal profile shapes, stream gradient (SL) indices, longitudinal profile concavities and steepness. Prominent drainage anomalies such as above-grade conditions, exponential and linear fitting of longitudinal profiles, elevated values of SL indices, barbed drainage, over-steepened stream segments and fluvial hanging valleys imply rapid erosion rates in the basin. This is noticeable particularly in the lower domain of the Rangit Basin, especially in the areas located downstream of the MCT. A comparison of steep segments with the geological and lineament maps reveals that many of these anomalies are lineament-controlled. Furthermore, a large number of such features do not conform to lithological intersections, suggesting a possible tectonic factor behind the occurrence of such anomalies.

TI  - Air pollution in Ukraine: a view from the Sentinel-5P satellite
T2  - IDOJARAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents analysis of current air pollution state over Ukraine including remote regions and uncontrolled Ukrainian territories; features of NO2, SO2, and CO spatial distribution and seasonality under the influence of local anthropogenic emissions. The research is based on Sentinel-5P satellite data for the period of November 2018 - January 2020. Despite the increasing traffic emissions, the industrial emissions still greatly influence the air pollution in Ukraine. Sentinel-5P coverage allowed detecting a number of cities with huge anthropogenic NO2 and SO2 emissions, where ground-based measurements are absent. Uncontrolled territories on the cast part of Ukraine still negatively affect air quality in the region due to the activity of coal-fired thermal power plants. The study indicates significant air quality changes during the heating season in winter and open burning in March - April. There were found differences in NO2 seasonal variability over clean remote regions and industrial zones. The paper analyzes features of shipping emissions during the tourist season for Ukrainian coastline of Black and Azov Seas, showing huge negative impact of chaotic movements of tourists boats near the Dzharylhach National Nature Park.

TI  - THE TEACHING AND LEARNING DWELLING IN PANDEMIC TIMES AND THE VIRTUALITY OF AN OnLIFE EDUCATION
T2  - REVISTA PRAXIS EDUCACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents qualitative research that appropriates the cartographic method of intervention-research to understand the traces present in the educational contexts (K-12, Higher and Postgraduate Education), in pandemic times. It problematizes the teaching and learning dwelling in the constitution of knowledge and development networks that articulate, from research, education at different levels. The objective is to identify clues that make it possible to cocreate an OnLIFE Education proposal, from an ecosystem perspective. We understand the concept of the network as the connective movement that forms the social, which is composed of different biological, physical and digital entities (human and non-human), which through connective acts weave this network. Thus, it is never completely clear who is acting.The connective act occurs in the operational encounter and this can take place both in geographic space, as in digital, synchronously or asynchronously, by plural presences, in hybridities, where intelligent ecologies operate (human and non-human intelligences) in network. This understanding brings the overcoming of a dualistic theory of action, sometimes content/teacher/student-centered. The network is then what emerges from the trans organic connective acts, product of the agency between human and non-human actors, who act mutually, connecting diverse intelligences, thus promoting transubstantiation. That contributes to overcoming an anthropocentric, subject-centric and technocentric worldview. As a result, we present some clues that allow updating the virtuality of a transubstantiated OnLIFE Education, as an ecosystem of innovation in education.

TI  - How fire patterns reveal uneven stabilization at the end of conflict: examining Syria's unusual fire year in 2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2019, Syria experienced its largest outbreak of fires since 2003, when fire occurrence began to be monitored via the MODIS satellite instruments. Here, we combine remotely sensed data on fire, local climatic conditions, and vegetation with spatial data on violence, territorial control, and return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to explore the underlying causes of Syria's fires at the sub-district, or ADM-3, level. We find evidence for a nuanced story: precipitation and stabilization in Kurdish-controlled territory fueled a bountiful wheat-growing year in 2019. This agricultural resurgence coincided with high fire activity, possibly revealing that people were attempting to jump-start agricultural livelihoods that were lost during the civil war. Restoration of labor forces from IDP returns was not a significant factor in this agricultural recovery. Meanwhile, most sub-districts outside Kurdish-controlled territory were free of fires, which explains the absence of a relationship between vegetation and fire. Thus, Syrian fire patterns in 2019 may be a signal of uneven stabilization, rather than destabilization.

TI  - New Biomass Estimates for Chaparral-Dominated Southern California Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chaparral shrublands are the dominant wildland vegetation type in Southern California and the most extensive ecosystem in the state. Disturbance by wildfire and climate change have created a dynamic landscape in which biomass mapping is key in tracking the ability of chaparral shrublands to sequester carbon. Despite this importance, most national and regional scale estimates do not account for shrubland biomass. Employing plot data from several sources, we built a random forest model to predict aboveground live biomass in Southern California using remote sensing data (Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) and a suite of geophysical variables. By substituting the NDVI and precipitation predictors for any given year, we were able to apply the model to each year from 2000 to 2019. Using a total of 980 field plots, our model had a k-fold cross-validation R-2 of 0.51 and an RMSE of 3.9. Validation by vegetation type ranged from R-2 = 0.17 (RMSE = 9.7) for Sierran mixed-conifer to R-2 = 0.91 (RMSE = 2.3) for sagebrush. Our estimates showed an improvement in accuracy over two other biomass estimates that included shrublands, with an R-2 = 0.82 (RMSE = 4.7) compared to R-2 = 0.068 (RMSE = 6.7) for a global biomass estimate and R-2 = 0.29 (RMSE = 5.9) for a regional biomass estimate. Given the importance of accurate biomass estimates for resource managers, we calculated the mean year 2010 shrubland biomasses for the four national forests that ranged from 3.5 kg/m(2) (Los Padres) to 2.3 kg/m(2) (Angeles and Cleveland). Finally, we compared our estimates to field-measured biomasses from the literature summarized by shrubland vegetation type and age class. Our model provides a transparent and repeatable method to generate biomass measurements in any year, thereby providing data to track biomass recovery after management actions or disturbances such as fire.

TI  - Contact-Dependent Transmission of Langat and Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus in Type I Interferon Receptor 1-Deficient Mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is transmitted to humans primarily through tick bites or oral consumption of accordingly contaminated unpasteurized milk or milk products. The detection of TBEV RNA in various body fluids in immuno suppressed human patients is documented. However, the risk of direct contact exposure remains unclear. Interferon alpha receptor 1-deficient (Ifnar1(-/-)) mice, which lack the interferon alpha/beta responses, develop neurologic manifestations after infection with TBEV and Langat virus (LGTV). We showed that subcutaneous, intranasal, and peroral infections of LGTV lead to disease, whereas mice with intragastric application of LGTV showed no disease signs. With LGTV infection, mice exhibit seroconversion, and significant viral RNA levels were detected in saliva, eye smear, feces, and urine. As a result, TBEV and LGTV are transmitted between mice from infected to naive cocaged sentinel animals. Although intranasal inoculation of LGTV is entirely sufficient to establish the disease in mice, the virus is not transmitted by aerosols. These pooled results from animal models highlight the risks of exposure to TBEV contaminants and the possibility for close contact transmission of TBEV in interferon alpha receptor 1-deficient laboratory mice.IMPORTANCE Tick-borne encephalitis is a severe disease of the central nervous system caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Every year, between 10,000 and 12,000 people become infected with this flavivirus. TBEV is usually transmitted to humans via the bite of a tick, but infections due to consumption of infectious milk products are being increasingly reported. Since there is no therapy for TBEV infection and the mechanisms of virus persistence in reservoir animals are unclear, it is important to highlight the risk of exposure to TBEV contaminants and know the possible routes of transmission of this virus. The significance of our research is in identifying other infection routes of TBEV and LGTV and the possibility of close contact transmission.

Regular areal estimates of green tide surfaces are publicly available but only from 2002 onwards. Using free and openly accessible Landsat satellite imagery archives over 35 years (1984-2019), this study explores the potential of remote sensing for detection and long-term monitoring of green macroalgae blooms. By using a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script, we were able to detect and quantify green tide surfaces using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) at four highly affected beaches in Northern Brittany. Mean green tide coverage was derived and analyzed from 1984 to 2019, at both monthly and annual scales. Our results show important interannual and seasonal fluctuations in estimated macroalgae cover. In terms of trends over time, green tide events did not show a decrease in extent at three out of four studied sites. The observed decrease in nitrogen concentrations for the rivers draining the study sites has not resulted in a reduction of green tide extents.

TI  - SENTINEL COYOTE PATHOGEN SURVEY TO ASSESS DECLINING BLACK-FOOTED FERRET (<i>MUSTELA NIGRIPES</i>) POPULATION IN SOUTH DAKOTA, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the national recovery effort, endangered black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) were reintroduced to the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, US in 2000. Despite an encouraging start, numbers of ferrets at the site have declined. In an effort to determine possible causes of the population decline, we undertook a pathogen survey in 2012 to detect exposure to West Nile virus (WNV), canine distemper virus (CDV), plague (Yersinia pestis), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) using coyotes (Canis latrans) as a sentinel animal. The highest seroprevalence was for WNV with 71% (20/28) of coyotes testing antibody-positive. Seroprevalence of CDV and plague were lower, 27% and 13%, respectively. No evidence of active infection with tularemia or heartworm was seen in the coyotes sampled. As this study did not sample black-footed ferrets themselves, the definitive cause for the decline of this population cannot be determined. However, the presence of coyotes seropositive for two diseases, plague and CDV, lethal to black-footed ferrets, indicated the potential for exposure and infection. The high seroprevalence of WNV in the coyotes indicated a wide exposure to the virus; therefore, exposure of black-footed ferrets to the virus is also likely. Due to the ability of WNV to cause fatal disease in other species, studies may be useful to elucidate the impact that WNV could have on the success of reintroduced black-footed ferrets as well as factors influencing the spread and incidence of the disease in a prairie ecosystem.

TI  - Long Live A(me)rica! An Examination of the Interplay Between Nationalistic-Symbolic Immortality Striving and Belief in Life After Death
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terror management theory (TMT) proposes that the awareness of our eventual death is at odds with our evolved desire to live and that humans attempt to resolve this psychological conflict by investing in cultural worldviews that grant symbolic or literal immortality. The present studies examine the interplay between symbolic and literal immortality striving. Three studies show that, following a death reminder, only individuals who did not have a route to literal immortality (belief in an afterlife) increased how long they believe their culture (Canada in Studies 1 and 2, the United States in Study 3), will last by thousands of years. Study 4 demonstrated that this moderation effect cannot be explained by general religiosity; Study 5 conceptually replicated this finding using a different measure of perceived cultural longevity. Finally, Study 6 demonstrates that for those who were highly invested in their nation but did not believe in an afterlife, perceived cultural longevity was associated with decreased death anxiety. These results are consistent with the notion that people possess a primary path to immortality that follows directly from their worldview. The need for increased specificity in study design in TMT and the threat and defense literature more broadly is discussed.

TI  - Cloud Cover over the Sahara during the Summer and Associated Circulation Features
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the Sahara in summer, the activity of the Saharan thermal low pressure system (SHL), which is linked to the West-African monsoon dynamics and the mid-latitude circulation, is modulated by dust concentration and water-vapor transport. In this context, the role of clouds over western Sahara remains under-investigated. Using Meteosat-Second-Generation geostationary satellite data, for the first time the variability of cloud occurrence over Sahara by type in summer, at diurnal, daily and intra-seasonal time scales for the 2008-2014 period is documented. Using European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA) Interim (ERAI) reanalysis, cloud cover occurrences are characterized in terms of regional circulation patterns and moisture balance. We show that, over West-Sahara and Hoggar, mid-top clouds are the most frequent cloud-type in summer. Their summit reaches between 500 hPa and 400 hPa and lies just above the top of the Saharan Atmospheric Boundary Layer (SABL). During the rest of the year, high-top clouds are the most frequent. The variations in the spatial distribution of mid-top cloud occurrence coincide with the seasonal displacement and strengthening of the SHL and, in the mid-troposphere, of the Saharan anticyclone. Mid-top clouds occur most frequently when, at large scale, mass and humidity converge in the lower SABL due to heating on an extensive surface, and diverge in the upper SABL. Their diurnal cycle, with minimal frequency around 10 UTC and maximum in the evening, is consistent with the diurnal development of the Saharan Convective-Boundary-Layer. The frequency of high cloud increases when anticyclonic circulations at mid-level and upper-level retreat to the southeast and upper-level trough from mid-latitudes can penetrate more southwards.

TI  - The Eco-Theology of the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>: A Multi-Layered Ethical Theory
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - I argue that a normative environmental ethical theory can be coherently derived out of the theological matrix of the Bhagavad Gita. I build upon Ithamar Theodor's articulation of the Gita's underlying unifying structure to depict how the Gita conceives of three possible relationships with nature. This allows me to tease out three concurrent worldviews in the Gita-a world-affirming worldview, a world-renouncing worldview and a bhakti worldview, which is simultaneously world-affirming and world-renouncing. I show how three distinct theories of motivation-three different reasons for acting in the world-emerge from the interconnected normative, soteriological and ontological dimensions of each of these three worldviews. More importantly, the motivation to act for the welfare of individuals in nature, such as animals and plants, can be legitimately derived from these three theories of motivation. I contextualize the Bhagavad Gita's environmental ethics by placing it within the larger framework of the text's distinctive multi-layered approach to ethical theory, in which the foundational teleological mok?a theory grounds and explains the plurality of more superficial normative foundational theories.

TI  - Assessing Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Assisted Machine Perception for Urban Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatial-resolution satellite imagery has been widely applied for detailed urban mapping. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown promise in certain remote sensing applications, but they are still relatively new techniques for general urban mapping. This study examines the use of two DCNNs (U-Net and VGG16) to provide an automatic schema to support high-resolution mapping of buildings, road/open built-up, and vegetation cover. Using WorldView-2 imagery as input, we first applied an established OBIA method to characterize major urban land cover classes. An OBIA-derived urban map was then divided into a training and testing region to evaluate the DCNNs' performance. For U-Net mapping, we were particularly interested in how sample size or the number of image tiles affect mapping accuracy. U-Net generated cross-validation accuracies ranging from 40.5 to 95.2% for training sample sizes from 32 to 4096 image tiles (each tile was 256 by 256 pixels). A per-pixel accuracy assessment led to 87.8 percent overall accuracy for the testing region, suggesting U-Net's good generalization capabilities. For the VGG16 mapping, we proposed an object-based framing paradigm that retains spatial information and assists machine perception through Gaussian blurring. Gaussian blurring was used as a pre-processing step to enhance the contrast between objects of interest and background (contextual) information. Combined with the pre-trained VGG16 and transfer learning, this analytical approach generated a 77.3 percent overall accuracy for per-object assessment. The mapping accuracy could be further improved given more robust segmentation algorithms and better quantity/quality of training samples. Our study shows significant promise for DCNN implementation for urban mapping and our approach can transfer to a number of other remote sensing applications.

TI  - Assessing the Effect of Training Sampling Design on the Performance of Machine Learning Classifiers for Land Cover Mapping Using Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning classifiers are being increasingly used nowadays for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping from remote sensing images. However, arriving at the right choice of classifier requires understanding the main factors influencing their performance. The present study investigated firstly the effect of training sampling design on the classification results obtained by Random Forest (RF) classifier and, secondly, it compared its performance with other machine learning classifiers for LULC mapping using multi-temporal satellite remote sensing data and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We evaluated the impact of three sampling methods, namely Stratified Equal Random Sampling (SRS(Eq)), Stratified Proportional Random Sampling (SRS(Prop)), and Stratified Systematic Sampling (SSS) upon the classification results obtained by the RF trained LULC model. Our results showed that the SRS(Prop) method favors major classes while achieving good overall accuracy. The SRS(Eq) method provides good class-level accuracies, even for minority classes, whereas the SSS method performs well for areas with large intra-class variability. Toward evaluating the performance of machine learning classifiers, RF outperformed Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) with a >95% confidence level. The performance of CART and SVM classifiers were found to be similar. RVM achieved good classification results with a limited number of training samples.

TI  - Improving Boundary Constraint of Probability Integral Method in SBAS-InSAR for Deformation Monitoring in Mining Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal-mining subsidence causes ground fissures and destroys surface structures, which may lead to severe casualties and economic losses. Time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) plays an important role in surface deformation detection and monitoring without the restriction of weather and sunlight conditions. In addition, the probability integral method (PIM) is a surface movement model that is widely used in the field of mining subsidence. In recent years, the integration of TS-InSAR and the PIM has been extensively studied. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate mining subsidence with the PIM based on TS-InSAR results. This study focuses on the improvement of a boundary constraint and dynamic parameter estimation in the PIM through the inversion of the line-of-sight (LOS) time series deformation derived by TS-InSAR. In addition, 45 Sentinel-1A images from 17 June 2015 to 27 December 2017 of a coal mine in Jiaozuo are utilized to acquire the surface displacement. We apply a time series deformation analysis using small baseline subsets (SBAS) and place the results into an improved PIM to estimate the mining parameters. The simulated mining subsidence is highly consistent with the leveling data, exhibiting an RMSE of 0.0025 m. Compared with the conventional method, the proposed method is more accurate in discovering displacement in mining areas. In the final section of this paper, some sources of error that affect the experiment are discussed.

M3  - Article
AB  - The author of the article, proceeding from a number of ideas developed by Ilya Kasavin, attempts to consider a few aspects embedded in the idea of science as a good and, in doing so, focuses on Zoltan Istvan's technoutopia The Transhumanist Wager as an illustration. The author elucidates the main ideological principles underlying Istvan's and Bacon's utopian projects and embracing benefits from science; right reason; true religion (Bacon)/transhumanist ideology (Istvan); a strict choice of "initiated" epistemocrats/scientists; the desire to use science and technology only for the good (Bacon), and utility and commitment to the transhuman worldview (Istvan). The author considers the consistency of the view that regards the Baconian project as a major source of the future transhumanism and the latter - as an inevitable expansion of Bacon's ideas. Such a view has emerged within some transhumanistic approaches represented by Max More, James Hughes, and others, and, in saying so, it goes to extremes. Istvan's futurist project attempts to advance humanity mostly through technology. However, in doing so, it ignores the deep philosophical and humanistic reflection over the very foundations of its program, while some of the missing parts from Bacon's utopia can be traced in his extensive philosophical legacy. Commenting on these inconsistencies, the author, nevertheless, considers it possible to assume that Istvan's technoutopia may arise as a logical and, possibly, route-dependent outcome of the Western European project of science and technology.

TI  - Exploring the Regional Dynamics of U.S. Irrigated Agriculture from 2002 to 2017
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States has a geographically mature and stable land use and land cover system including land used as irrigated cropland; however, changes in irrigation land use frequently occur related to various drivers. We applied a consistent methodology at a 250 m spatial resolution across the lower 48 states to map and estimate irrigation dynamics for four map eras (2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017) and over four 5-year mapping intervals. The resulting geospatial maps (called the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Irrigated Agriculture Dataset or MIrAD-US) involved inputs from county-level irrigated statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, agricultural land cover from the U.S. Geological Survey National Land Cover Database, and an annual peak vegetation index derived from expedited MODIS satellite imagery. This study investigated regional and periodic patterns in the amount of change in irrigated agriculture and linked gains and losses to proximal causes and consequences. While there was a 7% overall increase in irrigated area from 2002 to 2017, we found surprising variability by region and by 5-year map interval. Irrigation land use dynamics affect the environment, water use, and crop yields. Regionally, we found that the watersheds with the largest irrigation gains (based on percent of area) included the Missouri, Upper Mississippi, and Lower Mississippi watersheds. Conversely, the California and the Texas-Gulf watersheds experienced fairly consistent irrigation losses during these mapping intervals. Various drivers for irrigation dynamics included regional climate fluctuations and drought events, demand for certain crops, government land or water policies, and economic incentives like crop pricing and land values. The MIrAD-US (Version 4) was assessed for accuracy using a variety of existing regionally based reference data. Accuracy ranged between 70% and 95%, depending on the region.

TI  - Evaluation of historic and operational satellite radar altimetry missions for constructing consistent long-term lake water level records
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A total of 13 satellite missions have been launched since 1985, with different types of radar altimeters on board. This study intends to make a comprehensive evaluation of historic and currently operational satellite radar altimetry missions for lake water level retrieval over the same set of lakes and to develop a strategy for constructing consistent long-term water level records for inland lakes at global scale. The lake water level estimates produced by different retracking algorithms (retrackers) of the satellite missions were compared with the gauge measurements over 12 lakes in four countries. The performance of each retracker was assessed in terms of the data missing rate, the correlation coefficient r, the bias, and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the altimetry-derived lake water level estimates and the concurrent gauge measurements. The results show that the model-free retrackers (e.g., OCOG/Ice-1/Ice) outperform the model-based retrackers for most of the missions, particularly over small lakes. Among the satellite altimetry missions, Sentinel-3 gave the best results, followed by SARAL. ENVISAT has slightly better lake water level estimates than Jason-1 and Jason-2, but its data missing rate is higher. For small lakes, ERS-1 and ERS-2 missions provided more accurate lake water level estimates than the TOPEX/Poseidon mission. In contrast, for large lakes, TOPEX/Poseidon is a better option due to its lower data missing rate and shorter repeat cycle. GeoSat and GeoSat Follow-On (GFO) both have an extremely high data missing rate of lake water level estimates. Although several contemporary radar altimetry missions provide more accurate lake level estimates than GFO, GeoSat was the sole radar altimetry mission, between 1985 and 1990, that provided the lake water level estimates. With a full consideration of the performance and the operational duration, the best strategy for constructing long-term lake water level records should be a two-step bias correction and normalization procedure. In the first step, use Jason-2 as the initial reference to estimate the systematic biases with TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, and Jason-3 and then normalize them to form a consistent TOPEX/Poseidon-Jason series. Then, use the TOPEX/Poseidon-Jason series as the reference to estimate and remove systematic biases with other radar altimetry missions to construct consistent long-term lake water level series for ungauged lakes.

T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Starting from 2006, the active development of the Aibga Ridge slopes in the vicinity of the resort township of Krasnaya Polyana and construction of sports and tourist facilities in that area have changed the land use type; as a result, exogenous processes, primarily mudflows, have intensified, posing risks to the engineering facilities and human safety. Based on remote sensing data (high-resolution satellite images, orthoaerial imagery, and digital elevation models produced on their basis), an inventory of the main types of anthropogenic disturbances and manifestations of exogenous processes was performed for 2006 and 2019 in a number of hierarchically subordinate test areas: a 25-km(2) polygon, the Sulimovskii creek basin (6.9 km(2)), and a key site in the Chernyi creek (a right tributary of the Sulimovskii creek) catchment basin (0.8 km(2)) whose upper reaches approach engineering facilities of the Rosa Khutor ski resort. Comparative analysis made it possible to assess the conjugate spatial development of anthropogenic forms and natural processes. In 2006-2019, the area of anthropogenically transformed lands increased by more than five times on average reaching 25-30% (in some catchment basins, up to 50%). Concurrently, the total area of sites affected by exogenous processes has increased both qualitatively (more types of processes) and quantitatively (by more than seven times on average) reaching 0.8% of the test polygon area (in some catchment basins, up to 4%). The anthropogenically-induced land use changes doubled the surface runoff causing a sharp intensification of erosion, landslide, and other conjugate slope runoff processes; as a result, the frequency of mud floods increased.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral unmixing techniques aim to retrieve the abundances of the materials contributing to a spectral measurement by inverting the underlying spectral mixture occurring at the surface level. In environment and Earth sciences, the darkening effect of moisture on soils and rocks is a common challenge that may lead to major errors when neglected. In this study, a linear function was calibrated to relate a single moisture index to its spectral effect. The function was then combined with the Neighbor-Band Ratio Unmixing (NBRU) and the Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) approaches and applied on spectra of a crafted mixture and a rock sample acquired in laboratory conditions, and on a WorldView-3 (WV3) superspectral image of the Canadian Malartic open pit mine. In laboratory conditions, the addition of the moisture function led to a higher stability and a lower deviation of the abundances retrieved with varying water contents (WC). The combined method also obtained a moisture map of the Mine Canadian Malartic consistent with the known systematic watering performed by the mining company.

Whereas alternative data sources such as mobile phones have been investigated by previous researchers, this research proposes the integration of mobile-phone, satellite, and public geospatial data to improve credit evaluations where financial data are lacking. An approach to integrating these disparate data sources involving both spatial and temporal analysis methods such as spatial aggregation was employed, resulting in various data combinations. The resulting data sets were used to train classifiers of varying complexity, from logistic regression to ensemble learning. Comparisons were based on various performance metrics, including accuracy and the area under the receiver operating-characteristic curve. The combination of all three data sources performed significantly better than mobile-phone data, with the mean classifier accuracy and F1 score improving by 18% and 0.149, respectively. It is shown how these improvements can translate to cost savings for financial institutions through a reduction in misclassification errors. Alternative data combined in this manner could enhance credit provision to financially excluded persons while managing associated risks, leading to greater financial inclusion.

TI  - Applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys and Structure from Motion photogrammetry in glacial and periglacial geomorphology
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, UAS, drones) combined with Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry have emerged over the last decade as the basis for a very efficient workflow in glacial and periglacial geomorphology by filling the spatial gap between traditional ground-based surveys and aerial or satellite remote sensing data. UAV-generated data offer flexible spatial and temporal resolution, thus enabling a shift from a pure description of geomorphological forms to a better understanding of process-form relationships, e.g., by quantification of short-term landscape changes in response to various drivers. In this contribution, we present an overview of current applications of UAV-SfM in studies of modern and past glacial environments that include mostly geomorphological mapping and change-detection analysis. We also indicate potential future applications, e.g., by combining UAV-data with historical archives, terrestrial SfM, and crowd-based image gathering to allow for a better understanding of landscape changes in response to present climate warming.

TI  - Whole-island wind bifurcation and localized topographic steering: Impacts on aeolian dune dynamics
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic steering has been observed around Gran Canaria, a high-profile circular island located in the Canary Island Archipelago, Spain, culminating in a complex lee-side wind regime at the Maspalomas dunefield. Maspalomas has experienced rapid environmental changes since the 1960s, coincident with a boom in the tourism industry in the region and requires further examination on the linkages between meso-scale airflow patterns and acolian processes modifying the landscape. The aim of this work is to simulate mean and turbulent airflow conditions at Maspalomas due to incremental changes in the regional wind direction and to compare these results to the predicted and observed aeolian dynamics taken from meteorological records, a global wind retro-analysis model, and remote sensing data. A Smagorinsky Large Eddy Simulation (S-LES) model was used to identify meso-scale airflow perturbations and turbulence at different locations around the island. Variability in meteorological data was also identified, with sites recording accelerated or retarded velocities and directional distributions ranging between unimodal to bimodal. Using a global retro-analysis model, relatively consistent upwind conditions were predicted over a period coinciding with three aerial LiDAR surveys (i.e., 2006, 2008, and 2011) at the Maspalomas dunefield. Despite the consistent predicted airflow conditions, dune migration rates dropped from 726 01 y(-1) to 2.80 M y(-1) and 28% of dunes experienced crest reversal towards the east, or opposite of the primary westerly migration direction during the second time period. Our results indicate that meso-scale airflow steering alters local wind conditions that can modify sediment transport gradients at Maspalomas. Given the rapidity of environmental changes and anthropogenic impacts at Maspalomas, these findings improve our understanding on the aeolian dynamics at Maspalomas and can be used to inform future management strategies. Lastly the approach used in this study could be applied to other high-profile island settings or similarly complex aeolian environments. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - More than Skin Deep: Sea Surface Temperature as a Means of Inferring Atlantic Water Variability on the Southeast Greenland Continental Shelf Near Helheim Glacier
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhanced outlet glacier discharge accounts for almost half of the Greenland Ice Sheet's mass loss since 1990. Warming subsurface Atlantic Water (AW) has been implicated in much of that loss, particularly along Greenland's southeastern coast. However, oceanographic observations are sparse prior to the last decade, making it difficult to diagnose changes in AW properties reaching the glaciers. Here, we investigate the use of sea surface temperature (SST) measurements to quantify ocean temperature variability on the continental shelf near Sermilik Fjord and Helheim Glacier. We find that after removing the short-term, atmospheric-driven variability in non-winter months, regional SSTs provide a reliable upper ocean (surface mixed layer) temperature record. In the trough region near Sermilik Fjord, the adjusted SSTs correlate well with moored ocean measurements of the water entering the fjord at depth and driving glacier melting. Using this relationship, we reconstruct the AW variability on the shelf dating back to 2000, 8 years before the first mooring deployments. Across the 19-year record, the AW temperatures in the trough do not always track properties in the source waters of the Irminger Current, which flows along the continental break. Instead, the properties of the waters found at the fjord mouth depend on variations in the source AW and, also, in the Polar Water that flows into the region from the Arctic Ocean. Satellite-derived SSTs, when combined with local oceanography considerations, have the potential to improve understanding around previously unanswered glacier-ocean questions in areas surrounding Greenland.

TI  - To What Extent Can a Sediment Yield Model Be Trusted? A Case Study from the Passauna Catchment, Brazil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil degradation and reservoir siltation are two of the major actual environmental, scientific, and engineering challenges. With the actual trend of world population increase, further pressure is expected on both water and soil systems around the world. Soil degradation and reservoir siltation are, however, strongly interlinked with the erosion processes that take place in the hydrological catchments, as both are consequences of these processes. Due to the spatial scale and duration of erosion events, the installation and operation of monitoring systems are rather cost- and time-consuming. Modeling is a feasible alternative for assessing the soil loss adequately. In this study, the possibility of adopting reservoir sediment stock as a validation measure for a monthly time-step sediment input model was investigated. For the assessment of sediment stock in the reservoir, the commercial free-fall penetrometer GraviProbe (GP) was used, while the calculation of sediment yield was calculated by combining a revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE)-based model with a sediment delivery ratio model based on the connectivity approach. For the RUSLE factors, a combination of remote sensing, literature review, and conventional sampling was used. For calculation of the C Factor, satellite imagery from the Sentinel-2 platform was used. The C Factor was derived from an empirical approach by combining the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the degree of soil sealing, and land-use/land-cover data. The key research objective of this study was to examine to what extent a reservoir can be used to validate a long-term erosion model, and to find out the limiting factors in this regard. Another focus was to assess the potential improvements in erosion modeling from the use of Sentinel-2 data. The use of such data showed good potential to improve the overall spatial and temporal performance of the model and also dictated further opportunities for using such types of model as reliable decision support systems for sustainable catchment management and reservoir protection measures.

TI  - From systematic lymphadenectomy to sentinel lymph node mapping: a review on transitions and current practices in endometrial cancer staging
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer care has undergone major changes in the past 30 years. In 1988, staging transitioned from clinical to surgical. Moreover, the surgical approach of choice is no longer open surgery, but minimally invasive surgery. An improvement in terms of nodal evaluation followed. Full systematic lymphadenectomy has been continuously replaced by sentinel lymph node mapping. Although sentinel lymph node mapping with a cervical injection of indocyanine green dye is rapidly gaining clinical acceptance, we lack consistent recommendations on a well-defined procedure that accurately and indolently assesses the lymph node status. Such recommendations are indispensable, as nodal status is the most important predictive factor of survival and is essential for tailoring adjuvant treatment to the risk of recurrence. This paper focuses on transitions in endometrial cancer care and highlights current data on sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer. We demonstrate that sentinel lymph node mapping is a safe and accurate strategy for nodal status evaluation with appropriate sensitivity, false-negative rate and negative predictive value in high-as well as low-risk settings. Furthermore, we elaborate on type and dose of tracer, site of injection, number of sentinel lymph nodes to be removed, sentinel lymph node mapping learning curve, operation mode and sentinel lymph node ultrastaging. In the future, guidelines with consistent recommendations on the above outlined features of sentinel lymph node mapping should be established to allow for a uniform and wide-spread application of the sentinel lymph node mapping procedure.

TI  - Variation in Ice Phenology of Large Lakes over the Northern Hemisphere Based on Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice phenology data of 22 large lakes of the Northern Hemisphere for 40 years (1979-2018) have been retrieved from passive microwave remote sensing brightness temperature (Tb). The results were compared with site-observation data and visual interpretation from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectivity products images (MOD09GA). The mean absolute errors of four lake ice phenology parameters, including freeze-up start date (FUS), freeze-up end date (FUE), break-up start date (BUS), and break-up end date (BUE) against MODIS-derived ice phenology were 2.50, 2.33, 1.98, and 3.27 days, respectively. The long-term variation in lake ice phenology indicates that FUS and FUE are delayed; BUS and BUE are earlier; ice duration (ID) and complete ice duration (CID) have a general decreasing trend. The average change rates of FUS, FUE, BUS, BUE, ID, and CID of lakes in this study from 1979 to 2018 were 0.23, 0.23, -0.17, -0.33, -0.67, and -0.48 days/year, respectively. Air temperature and latitude are two dominant driving factors of lake ice phenology. Lake ice phenology for the period 2021-2100 was predicted by the relationship between ice phenology and air temperature for each lake. Compared with lake ice phenology changes from 1990 to 2010, FUS is projected to be delayed by 3.1 days and 11.8 days under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively; BUS is projected to be earlier by 3.3 days and 10.7 days, respectively; and ice duration from 2080 to 2100 will decrease by 6.5 days and 21.9 days, respectively.

TI  - Comparing Assimilation of Synthetic Soil Moisture Versus C-Band Backscatter for Hyper-Resolution Land Surface Modeling
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the assimilation of synthetic surface soil moisture retrievals and C-band backscatter signal in a 100-meter resolution version of the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) on footprint scale soil moisture with a time interval of three hours. The synthetic surface soil moisture map was generated by extrapolating a regression relationship between in situ measurements and open loop land surface model outputs based on the soil texture of a given pixel. The surface roughness was inverted from RADARSAT-2 imagery using a modified Integral Equation Model (IEM) model. Three hourly synthetic backscatter maps were created from this surface roughness and the synthetic soil moisture. The Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with bias correction was applied to mitigate the impact of nonlinear errors introduced by multi-sourced perturbations. Both time series and spatial maps were examined in the evaluation of the assimilation experiments. Results show that the assimilation of backscatter is as effective as assimilating soil moisture retrievals although the later has slightly better temporal statistics. Compared to the open loop, both approaches improved the analysis of surface and root zone soil moisture with significantly lower bias. For the later, the open loop average bias was reduced from -1.25 vol/vol to 0.59 vol/vol by backscatter assimilation and to 0.41 vol/vol by soil moisture assimilation.

TI  - The Evolving Role of Marked Lymph Node Biopsy (MLNB) and Targeted Axillary Dissection (TAD) after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT) for Node-Positive Breast Cancer: Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryThe 5-year survival rate for patients with breast cancer, in whom disease has spread to local lymph nodes, is 85%. However, many live with the complications of surgery to remove the lymph nodes in the armpit thus impacting their quality of life. In recent years, new approaches have been developed to minimise surgery and reduce complications. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the feasibility and accuracy of two minimally invasive surgical procedures, Marked Lymph Node Biopsy and Targeted Axillary Dissection as an alternative to complete removal of the axillary lymph nodes after upfront chemotherapy in patients in whom cancer spread to the regional lymph nodes. Our findings confirm that these procedures can safely replace more radical surgery in women who have responded well to upfront drug treatment. Therefore, although further research to determine long-term outcomes is required, this review concludes that it is reasonable to offer such patients the option of less invasive surgery thus avoiding over treatment and enhancing quality of life.Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) is a new axillary staging technique that consists of the surgical removal of biopsy-proven positive axillary nodes, which are marked (marked lymph node biopsy (MLNB)) prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in addition to the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). In a meta-analysis of more than 3000 patients, we previously reported a false-negative rate (FNR) of 13% using the SLNB alone in this setting. The aim of this systematic review and pooled analysis is to determine the FNR of MLNB alone and TAD (MLNB plus SLNB) compared with the gold standard of complete axillary lymph node dissection (cALND). The PubMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases were searched using MeSH-relevant terms and free words. A total of 9 studies of 366 patients that met the inclusion criteria evaluating the FNR of MLNB alone were included in the pooled analysis, yielding a pooled FNR of 6.28% (95% CI: 3.98-9.43). In 13 studies spanning 521 patients, the addition of SLNB to MLNB (TAD) was associated with a FNR of 5.18% (95% CI: 3.41-7.54), which was not significantly different from that of MLNB alone (p = 0.48). Data regarding the oncological safety of this approach were lacking. In a separate analysis of all published studies reporting successful identification and surgical retrieval of the MLN, we calculated a pooled success rate of 90.0% (95% CI: 85.1-95.1). The present pooled analysis demonstrates that the FNR associated with MLNB alone or combined with SLNB is acceptably low and both approaches are highly accurate in staging the axilla in patients with node-positive breast cancer after NACT. The SLNB adds minimal new information and therefore can be safely omitted from TAD. Further research to confirm the oncological safety of this de-escalation approach of axillary surgery is required. MLNB alone and TAD are associated with acceptably low FNRs and represent valid alternatives to cALND in patients with node-positive breast cancer after excellent response to NACT.

TI  - On the Use of Standardized Multi-Temporal Indices for Monitoring Disturbance and Ecosystem Moisture Stress across Multiple Earth Observation Systems in the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we explore three methods for quantifying ecosystem vegetation responses spatially and temporally using Google's Earth Engine, implementing an Ecosystem Moisture Stress Index (EMSI) to monitor vegetation health in agricultural, pastoral, and natural landscapes across the entire era of spaceborne remote sensing. EMSI is the multitemporal standard (z) score of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) given as I, for a pixel (x,y) at the observational period t. The EMSI is calculated as: z(xyt) = (I-xyt - mu(xyT))/sigma(xyT), where the index value of the observational date (I-xyt) is subtracted from the mean (mu(xyT)) of the same date or range of days in a reference time series of length T (in years), divided by the standard deviation (sigma(xyT)), during the same day or range of dates in the reference time series. EMSI exhibits high significance (z > |2.0 +/- 1.98 sigma|) across all geographic locations and time periods examined. Our results provide an expanded basis for detection and monitoring: (i) ecosystem phenology and health; (ii) wildfire potential or burn severity; (iii) herbivory; (iv) changes in ecosystem resilience; and (v) change and intensity of land use practices. We provide the code and analysis tools as a research object, part of the findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) data principles.

TI  - Mapping Alkaline Fens, Transition Mires and Quaking Bogs Using Airborne Hyperspectral and Laser Scanning Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the identification of Natura 2000 wetland habitats (Alkaline fens-code 7230, and Transition mires and quaking bogs-code 7140) depending on various remotely sensed (RS) data acquired from an airborne platform. Both remote sensing data and botanical reference data were gathered for mentioned habitats in the Lower (LB) and Upper Biebrza (UB) River Valley and the Janowskie Forest (JF) in different seasonal stages. Several different classification scenarios were tested, and the ones that gave the best results for analyzed habitats were indicated in each campaign. In the final stage, a recommended term of data acquisition, as well as a list of remote sensing products, which allowed us to achieve the highest accuracy mapping for these two types of wetland habitats, were presented. Designed classification scenarios integrated different hyperspectral products such as Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) bands, spectral indices and products derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data representing topography (developed in SAGA), or statistical products (developed in OPALS-Orientation and Processing of Airborne Laser Scanning). The image classifications were performed using a Random Forest (RF) algorithm and a multi-classification approach. As part of the research, the correlation analysis of the developed remote sensing products was carried out, and the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFE-CV) analysis was performed to select the most important RS sub-products and thus increase the efficiency and accuracy of developing the final habitat distribution maps. The classification results showed that alkaline fens are better identified in summer (mean F1-SCORE equals 0.950 in the UB area, and 0.935 in the LB area), transition mires and quaking bogs that evolved on/or in the vicinity of alkaline fens in summer and autumn (mean F1-SCORE equals 0.931 in summer, and 0.923 in autumn in the UB area), and transition mires and quaking bogs that evolved on dystrophic lakes in spring and summer (mean F1-SCORE equals 0.953 in spring, and 0.948 in summer in the JF area). The study also points out that the classification accuracy of both wetland habitats is highly improved when combining selected hyperspectral products (MNF bands, spectral indices) with ALS topographical and statistical products. This article demonstrates that information provided by the synergetic use of data from different sensors can be used in mapping and monitoring both Natura 2000 wetland habitats for its future functional assessment and/or protection activities planning with high accuracy.

TI  - Morphodynamic Controls for Growth and Evolution of a Rubble Coral Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubble islands are dynamic sedimentary features present on reef platforms that evolve under a variety of morphodynamic processes and controlling mechanisms. They provide valuable inhabitable land for small island nations, critical habitat for numerous species, and are threatened by climate change. Aiming to investigate the controlling mechanisms dictating the evolution of One Tree Island (OTI), a rubble island in the Southern Great Barrier Reef, we combined different remotely-sensed data across varying timescales with wave data extracted from satellite altimetry and cyclone activity. Our findings show that (1) OTI had expanded by 7% between 1978 and 2019, (2) significant gross planform decadal adjustments were governed by the amount, intensity, proximity, and relative position of cyclones as well as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases, and (3) the mechanisms of island growth involve rubble spits delivering and redistributing rubble to the island through alongshore sediment transport and wave overtopping. Frequent short-term monitoring of the island and further research coupling variations in the different factors driving island change (i.e., sediment availability, reef-wave interactions, and extreme events) are needed to shed light on the future trajectory of OTI and other rubble islands under a climate change scenario.

TI  - Vicarious Calibration for the AHSI Instrument of Gaofen-5 With Reference to the CRCS Dunhuang Test Site
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The visible-shortwave infrared Advanced Hyperspectral Imager (AHSI) is a payload onboard the Gaofen-5 satellite, which is China's first hyperspectral satellite and is part of the Chinese High-Resolution Earth Observation System. As a supplement to the onboard radiometric calibration of the AHSI instrument, vicarious calibration is also required, which is independent of the instrument-based calibration. In this article, a reflectance-based vicarious calibration approach is presented, which takes surface reflectance data, aerosol data, and atmospheric water vapor data into account. The Dunhuang test site, which is one of the China Radiometric Calibration Sites (CRCS) for the vicarious calibration of spaceborne sensors, possesses stable, uniform, and measurable surface objects, so it was chosen as the radiation source to replace the laboratory and onboard calibrators. A Spectra Vista Corporation (SVC) spectral radiometer and a CE318 sun photometer were utilized for the measurement of the surface reflectance and the condition of the aerosol, respectively. The radiance at the entrance pupil at the top of atmosphere was then obtained through the MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) atmospheric transmission model. The surface reflectance was obtained using the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes (FLAASH) atmospheric model for validation. The results show that, with regard to the calibration coefficients, the calibrated AHSI instrument presents a stable radiometric performance among different land-cover types. The ratios on all the bands are between 0.8 and 1.2 and are consistent with the reflectance data from the Dunhuang test site. The R-2 values are all greater than 0.95 and the spectral angle is all less than 2 degrees. The standard deviations of the ratios are less than 3% for each chosen band, which proves that the calibrated data have a high consistency with the in situ measurements. When compared with Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, the mean errors of the surface reflectance are all under 0.06, which further demonstrates that the calibrated reflectance has a high accuracy.

TI  - Near-Real-Time Estimation of 1-km All-Weather Land Surface Temperature by Integrating Satellite Passive Microwave and Thermal Infrared Observations
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A widely used approach for all-weather land surface temperature (LST) estimation is the integration of satellite passive microwave (MW) and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing observations. However, there are still few methods for estimating near-real time (NRT) all-weather (AW) (NRT-AW) LST. Besides, estimation of the LST within the swath gap of the satellite MW images is still greatly limited. This letter proposes a so-called NRT-AW method for the estimation of NRT-AW LST. NRT-AW firstly fills up the brightness temperatures (BT) inside the AMSR2 swath gap. Then, the NRT AW LST is estimated by learning the mapping between the time series of AMSR2 BT and MODIS LST on the annual scales. The results of the application of NRT-AW in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) show that the NRT-AW LST is spatially continuous and highly consistent with the original MODIS LST with a standard deviation (STD) of 1.27-1.77 K. Validation based on in situ LST indicates that the NRT-AW LST estimate has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.46-4.62 K. This method is beneficial for rapid mapping of all-weather LST over large areas and, thus, can satisfy associated applications.

TI  - Assessment of State Transition Dynamics of Coastal Wetlands in Northern Venice Lagoon, Italy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands represent particularly valuable natural resources, characterized by the interaction between their geomorphological and biological components. Their adaptation to the changing conditions depends on the rate and extent of spatial and temporal processes and their response is still not fully understood. This work aims at detecting and improving the understanding of the transition dynamics on eco-geomorphological structures in a coastal wetland ecosystem. The approach could support sustainable habitat management improving the detection and optimizing the offer of Earth Observation (EO) products for coastal system monitoring. Such course of action will strengthen evidence-based policy making, surface biophysical data sovereignty and the Space Data downstream sector through remote sensing techniques thanks to the capability of investigating larger scale and short-to-long-term dynamics. The selected case study is the Lido basin (Venice Lagoon, Italy). Our methodology offers a support in the framework of nature-based solutions, allowing the identification of ecosystem-level indicators of the surface biophysical properties influencing stability and evolution of intertidal flats on which a conceptual model is implemented. Landsat satellite imagery is used to delineate the spatial and temporal variability of the main vegetation and sediment typologies in 1990-2011. Within this period, specific anthropic activities were carried out for morphological restoration and flood protection interventions. Specifically, the lower saltmarsh shows its more fragmented part in the Baccan islet, a residual sandy spit in front of the Lido inlet. The area covered by Sarcocornia-Limonium, that triggers sediment deposition, has fluctuated yearly, from a minimum coverage of 13% to a maximum of 50%. The second decade (2001-2009) is identified as the period with major changes of halophytic and Algae-Biofilm cover typologies distribution. The power law and related thresholds, representing the patch size frequency distribution, is an indicator of the ecosystem state transition dynamics. The approach, based on multi-temporal and spatial EO analysis, is scalable elsewhere, from regional to local-to-global scale, considering the variability of climate data and anthropogenic activities. The present research also supports sustainable habitat management, improving the detection, and optimizing the offer of EO products for coastal system monitoring.

TI  - Quality of Life in Women Subjected to Surgical Treatment of Breast Cancer Depending on the Procedure Performed within the Breast and Axillary Fossa-A Single-Center, One Year Prospective Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of life of patients undergoing surgical treatment of breast cancer depending on the type of procedure involving the breast (mastectomy vs. breast conserving treatment) and axillary fossa (sentinel lymph node biopsy vs. axillary lymph node dissection). The prospective study was carried out in a group of 338 females undergoing breast cancer treatment. Study variables were assessed by means of a diagnostic survey using standardized QLQ C30 and BR23 questionnaires as well as the Acceptance of Illness Scale and Mini-MAC scales. The quality of life was assessed at threetime points: on the day before the surgical procedure (I assessment) as well as three and 12 months after surgery (II and III assessment). Statistically significant differences between study groups were observed in the overall quality of life subscale (I, II, III-p < 0.0001), physical functioning (I-p < 0.0001; II-p = 0.0413; III-p < 0.0001), role functioning (I-p = 0.0002; III-p < 0.0001), emotional functioning (III-p = 0.0082), cognitive functioning (I-p = 0.0112; III-p < 0.0001), social functioning (III-p < 0.0001), body image (I, II, III-p < 0.0001), and sexual functioning (I-p = 0.0233; III-p = 0.0011). In most symptomatic scales, significant (p < 0.05) differences were also noted. Mastectomy and limfadenectomy patients were significantly (p < 0.0001) more prone to present with destructive coping strategies one year after surgery. Breast conserving therapy is associated with better quality of life outcomes as compared to mastectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is associated with a lower intensity of adverse changes in multiple dimensions of patients' functioning.

TI  - Flow Duration Curves from Surface Reflectance in the Near Infrared Band
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Flow duration curve (FDC) is a cumulative frequency curve that shows the percent of time a specific discharge has been equaled or exceeded during a particular period of time at a given river location, providing a comprehensive description of the hydrological regime of a catchment. Thus, relying on historical streamflow records, FDCs are typically constrained to gauged and updated ground stations. Earth Observations can support our monitoring capability and be considered as a valuable and additional source for the observation of the Earth's physical parameters. Here, we investigated the potential of the surface reflectance in the Near Infrared (NIR) band of the MODIS 500 m and eight-day product, in providing reliable FDCs along the Mississippi River. Results highlight the capability of NIR bands to estimate the FDCs, enabling a realistic reconstruction of the flow regimes at different locations. Apart from a few exceptions, the relative Root Mean Square Error, rRMSE, of the discharge value in validation period ranges from 27-58% with higher error experienced for extremely high flows (low duration), mainly due to the limit of the sensor to penetrate the clouds during the flood events. Due to the spatial resolution of the satellite product higher errors are found at the stations where the river is narrow. In general, good performances are obtained for medium flows, encouraging the use of the satellite for the water resources management at ungauged river sites.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Axillary Ultrasound for Prediction of Axillary Pathologic Response after Neoadjuvant Treatment in Breast Cancer
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the era of NAT, to accurately predict pathologic response is a great challenge, which might influence surgical approach for breast and axilla. Axillary staging via imaging methods as an adjunct have long been used with various reported accuracy rates. However, the role of preoperative axillary ultrasonography (AUS) in clinical N0 patients after NAT is still controversial. The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate the precision of preoperative AUS for identifying pathologic complete response (ypCR = ypT0, ypN0) after NAT.Methods: A single-institution, retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was analyzed to identify breast cancer patients treated with NAT. Only those patients who underwent AUS and 18F-FDG-PET/CT before and after NAT with documentation of clinical and radiological response were incorporated for outcome analysis.Resuits: In 253 consecutive invasive breast cancer patients axillary ypN0 disease was achieved in 67.19%. In 11.23% ynon-pCR patients AUS failed to detect residual disease presence 80% of which were ITCs and micrometastases. Macrometastasis was present in 21.73% (55/253) of the cases 98.18% (54/55) of which was determined by AUS. Overall accuracy for axillary pCR was found to be 89.32% for AUS and 76.28 % for 18-FDG-PET/CT. The false negative rate (FNR) of AUS and 18-FDG-PET/CT was 12.04% and 15.59%, respectively. The PPV of AUS was higher in Luminal-like tumors (%87.69), whereas HER-2 positive (%100) and triple-negative (93.47% subtypes had higher NPV.Conclusions: AUS is a beneficial tool with the potential of accurate prediction of pCR in more than 80% of patients following NAT. Nevertheless, in cases of residual ITCs and micrometastasis the accuracy of US should be interrogated cautiously.

TI  - The Effect of Obesity on Operating Room Utilization in Breast Surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The current obesity epidemic is associated with increased health care costs associated with comorbidities such as diabetes and heart disease as well as postoperative complications. However, the effect of obesity on operating room (OR) utilization, especially in common breast procedures, has not been completely evaluated. Our study is the first to examine the effect of patient obesity on operative time (OPT) for common breast procedures. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project databases for 2010-2018 were searched for this retrospective review. Patients undergoing common breast operations (lumpectomy, lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (+/-injection), lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), simple mastectomy, mastectomy with SLNB (+/-injection), and mastectomy with ALND) were filtered out by Current Procedural Terminology code and divided into three groups based on their body mass index (BMI) and weight. Using the two-sample t-test, OPT for the procedures was compared among the lowest and highest BMI and weight categories. We also used a linear regression t-test to demonstrate that for every unit increase in BMI, there was a corresponding increase in OPT for each procedure. Results: When the lowest and highest BMI and weight groups were compared, significant dif-ferences in OPT (P < 0.0001) were seen for each of the procedures. Numerous factors that could affect the complexity of surgery and thus OR time were identified. The correlation between BMI and weight and OPT remained significant after controlling for these variables. The differences between the highest and lowest BMI groups were most pronounced for higher complexity procedures, such as lumpectomy with ALND and mastectomy with ALND, with average oper-ating times increasing by 18.2 min and 18.6 min, respectively, for patients with a higher BMI. Conclusions: Patient BMI and weight significantly affect OPT for common breast procedures. Therefore, patient BMI should be taken into account to improve OR scheduling. ? 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - TATSSI: A Free and Open-Source Platform for Analyzing Earth Observation Products with Quality Data Assessment
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation (EO) data play a crucial role in monitoring ecosystems and environmental processes. Time series of satellite data are essential for long-term studies in this context. Working with large volumes of satellite data, however, can still be a challenge, as the computational environment with respect to storage, processing and data handling can be demanding, which sometimes can be perceived as a barrier when using EO data for scientific purposes. In particular, open-source developments which comprise all components of EO data handling and analysis are still scarce. To overcome this difficulty, we present Tools for Analyzing Time Series of Satellite Imagery (TATSSI), an open-source platform written in Python that provides routines for downloading, generating, gap-filling, smoothing, analyzing and exporting EO time series. Since TATSSI integrates quality assessment and quality control flags when generating time series, data quality analysis is the backbone of any analysis made with the platform. We discuss TATSSI's 3-layered architecture (data handling, engine and three application programming interfaces (API)); by allowing three APIs (a native graphical user interface, some Jupyter Notebooks and the Python command line) this development is exceptionally user-friendly. Furthermore, to demonstrate the application potential of TATSSI, we evaluated MODIS time series data for three case studies (irrigation area changes, evaluation of moisture dynamics in a wetland ecosystem and vegetation monitoring in a burned area) in different geographical regions of Mexico. Our analyses were based on methods such as the spatio-temporal distribution of maxima over time, statistical trend analysis and change-point decomposition, all of which were implemented in TATSSI. Our results are consistent with other scientific studies and results in these areas and with related in-situ data.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Chikungunya virus and living conditions in Feira de Santana, Bahia-Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundChikungunya is an arbovirus, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, which emerged in the Americas in 2013 and spread rapidly to almost every country on this continent. In Brazil, where the first cases were detected in 2014, it currently has reached all regions of this country and more than 900,000 cases were reported. The clinical spectrum of chikungunya ranges from an acute self-limiting form to disabling chronic forms. The purpose of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of chikungunya infection in a large Brazilian city and investigate the association between viral circulation and living condition.Methodology/principal findingsWe conducted a population-based ecological study in selected Sentinel Areas (SA) through household interviews and a serologic survey in 2016/2017. The sample was of 1,981 individuals randomly selected. The CHIKV seroprevalence was 22.1% (17.1 IgG, 2.3 IgM, and 1.4 IgG and IgM) and varied between SA from 2.0% to 70.5%. The seroprevalence was significantly lower in SA with high living conditions compared to SA with low living condition. There was a positive association between CHIKV seroprevalence and population density (r = 0.2389; p = 0.02033).Conclusions/significanceThe seroprevalence in this city was 2.6 times lower than the 57% observed in a study conducted in the epicentre of the CHIKV epidemic of this same urban centre. So, the herd immunity in this general population, after four years of circulation of this agent is relatively low. It indicates that CHIKV transmission may persist in that city, either in endemic form or in the form of a new epidemic, because the vector infestation is persistent. Besides, the significantly lower seroprevalences in SA of higher Living Condition suggest that beyond the surveillance of the disease, vector control and specific actions of basic sanitation, the reduction of the incidence of this infection also depends on the improvement of the general living conditions of the population.Author summaryChikungunya is a disease caused by viruses transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. It stands out because it can produce chronic cases and disabling forms. This survey was conducted in a large city in Brazil, involving 1,981 people living in different living conditions/LC, distributed in 30 urban areas. Interviews and blood collection were performed to know the seroprevalence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The global seroprevalence was 22.1%, ranged from 2.0 to 70.5%. The areas where the highest and lowest seroprevalence were of low LC, but population density was different among them, which was related to seroprevalence. The mosquito index was not associated with the seroprevalence. Our results showed that lower seroprevalence than another survey conducted in the epicentre of the epidemic of this same city. So, a considerable proportion of the population of Feira de Santana is susceptible to the CHIKV. Possibly the virus will continue to circulate and manifest itself as endemic or epidemic, as long as LC remain favourable to the reproduction of the transmitting vector of CHIKV.

TI  - Assessing Forest Phenology: A Multi-Scale Comparison of Near-Surface (UAV, Spectral Reflectance Sensor, PhenoCam) and Satellite (MODIS, Sentinel-2) Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of forest phenology based on observations from near-surface sensors such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), PhenoCams, and Spectral Reflectance Sensors (SRS) over satellite sensors has recently gained significant attention in the field of remote sensing and vegetation phenology. However, exploring different aspects of forest phenology based on observations from these sensors and drawing comparatives from the time series of vegetation indices (VIs) still remains a challenge. Accordingly, this research explores the potential of near-surface sensors to track the temporal dynamics of phenology, cross-compare their results against satellite observations (MODIS, Sentinel-2), and validate satellite-derived phenology. A time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC), and Normalized Difference of Green & Red (VIgreen) indices were extracted from both near-surface and satellite sensor platforms. The regression analysis between time series of NDVI data from different sensors shows the high Pearson's correlation coefficients (r > 0.75). Despite the good correlations, there was a remarkable offset and significant differences in slope during green-up and senescence periods. SRS showed the most distinctive NDVI profile and was different to other sensors. PhenoCam(GCC) tracked green-up of the canopy better than the other indices, with a well-defined start, end, and peak of the season, and was most closely correlated (r > 0.93) with the satellites, while SRS-based VIgreen accounted for the least correlation (r = 0.58) against Sentinel-2. Phenophase transition dates were estimated and validated against visual inspection of the PhenoCam data. The Start of Spring (SOS) and End of Spring (EOS) could be predicted with an accuracy of <3 days with GCC, while these metrics from VIgreen and NDVI resulted in a slightly higher bias of (3-10) days. The observed agreement between UAV(NDVI) vs. satellite(NDVI) and PhenoCam(GCC) vs. satellite(GCC) suggests that it is feasible to use PhenoCams and UAVs for satellite data validation and upscaling. Thus, a combination of these near-surface vegetation metrics is promising for a holistic understanding of vegetation phenology from canopy perspective and could serve as a good foundation for analysing the interoperability of different sensors for vegetation dynamics and change analysis.

TI  - Preoperative Ultrasound Assessment of Regional Lymph Nodes in Melanoma Patients Does not Provide Reliable Nodal Staging Results From a Large Multicenter Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess whether preoperative ultrasound (US) assessment of regional lymph nodes in patients who present with primary cutaneous melanoma provides accurate staging. Background: It has been suggested that preoperative US could avoid the need for sentinel node (SN) biopsy, but in most single-institution reports, the sensitivity of preoperative US has been low. Methods: Preoperative US data and SNB results were analyzed for patients enrolled at 20 centers participating in the screening phase of the second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial. Excised SNs were histopathologically assessed and considered positive if any melanoma was seen. Results: SNs were identified and removed from 2859 patients who had preoperative US evaluation. Among those patients, 548 had SN metastases. US was positive (abnormal) in 87 patients (3.0%). Among SN-positive patients, 39 (7.1%) had an abnormal US. When analyzed by lymph node basin, 3302 basins were evaluated, and 38 were true positive (1.2%). By basin, the sensitivity of US was 6.6% (95% confidence interval: 4.6-8.7) and the specificity 98.0% (95% CI: 97.5-98.5). Median cross-sectional area of all SN metastases was 0.13 mm(2); in US true-positive nodes, it was 6.8 mm(2). US sensitivity increased with increasing Breslow thickness of the primary melanoma (0% for <= 1 mm thickness, 11.9% for >4 mm thickness). US sensitivity was not significantly greater with higher trial center volume or with pre-US lymphoscintigraphy. Conclusion: In the MSLT-II screening phase population, SN tumor volume was usually too small to be reliably detected by US. For accurate nodal staging to guide the management of melanoma patients, US is not an effective substitute for SN biopsy.

TI  - Variations in the Aboveground Phytomass in Northern Eurasia in the 21st Century
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the phytomass of the ecosystems of Northern Eurasia were traced based on the results of modeling and analysis of multispectral satellite imagery (MODIS archives 2000-2020). It was established that, since the end of the 20th century, an increase in reserves has been noted caused by climate change (an increase in the concentration of CO2, annual mean temperatures, etc.). Application of the GIS-information products based on the MODIS-projective vegetation cover (MODIS/006/MOD44B), evapotranspiration and the thermal field (MOD16A2), and biological production (MOD17A3HGF) allowed us to conduct retrospective modeling of the trend in the aboveground carbon reserves (tC/ha). It was revealed that in the years 2000-2020, a slight trend remained of an increase in the phytomass of forest ecosystems (1.2-6.0%), floodplain, and mountain meadows and shrubs (8.1-9.8%). In the last 17 years, a negative trend has been observed in treeless biomes: -6.0% in tundra, -9.0% in meadow and typical steppes, and -11.3% in deserted steppes. Multidirectional changes in carbon reserves of the aboveground phytomass of biomes, in addition to the internal (succession) and external (climate and anthropogenic transformation: forest felling, landscape fires, etc.) factors, are also due to the synergy of their action.

TI  - Open data repositories and Geo Small Data for mapping the wildfire risk exposure in wildland urban interface (WUI) in Spain: A case study in the Valencian Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The risk of forest fires in areas of wildland urban-interface (WUI.) is increasing due to the increase in urbanized areas and the progressive abandonment of traditional farming and forest uses. The global increase in catastrophic episodes in regions with a Mediterranean climate is worrying. Resilient towns and villages have given way to extensive and scattered residential estates that are in contact with forest fuel. These changes in the landscape when added to those of the climate, increase the danger of what some call 'igneous storms'. The risk in many areas has increased greatly in the last few decades. It is necessary to limit the growing exposure to this type of risk - and geographical information resources are essential for determining the territorial magnitude of the problem. Official libraries offering remote sensing data or geographical databases on land use and land cover (LULC) may be the best option (although accessing this data is complex for many end users). This research proposes identifying areas exposed to fire risk in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) through the automated integration of massive data from official geographic information sources. The application of this study to the region of Valencia (Spain) shows that the integration of these official sources of geographical information can achieve the objective at a detailed scale with relatively short processing times and for large geographical areas (approximately 8 h required to process about 70 Gb of LIDAR data). Geo Small Data techniques for the process of large datasets and its application to the objective of the study have been the best way to automate the analysis of lidar point clouds, with more than 5 billion echoes, through the use of free and open tools, containerization technologies, parallel processing and specific python libraries for geospatial data management. The LIDAR data has provided the necessary geometric definition to complement and improve the WUI area map from the reclassification of hundreds of thousands of polygons from the official Spanish land use geodatabase (SIOSE), achieving a map scale of more than 1: 25,000, for its part, the quality of the SIOSE geodatabase has allowed us to reduce the total LIDAR data to process by 97.8%.

M3  - Article
AB  - Question Which optical traits, retrieved from biophysical models applied to Sentinel-2 images, enable an estimation of tree species diversity based on the Spectral Variation Hypothesis? Location Coniferous mountain forest in the eastern Italian Alps. Methods We analyzed the PROSPECT-5 and Invertible Forest Reflectance Model (INFORM) biophysical parameters as retrieved from canopy reflectance data of different forest plots (using Sentinel-2 images for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019) as optical trait indicators (OTIs). We successively tested the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) for each retrieved OTI using the Rao's Q as heterogeneity index, validating them against Shannon's H values calculated as a tree species diversity index derived from in-situ collected data. Results We demonstrated differences among OTIs in terms of how well their variations can be linked to species diversity. In particular the variations of brown pigments (Cbrown), carotenoids (Car) and chlorophyll content (Cab) can be considered the most relevant OTIs for the application of the SVH when using the Rao's Q as a proxy for tree species diversity in our study site. Conclusions This research underlined that the OTIs contribute differently in the SVH to estimate tree species diversity, highlighting significant positive correlations between tree species diversity and the spatial heterogeneity of the estimated pigment content (Cab, Car, Cbrown).

TI  - Adaptive ensemble optimal interpolation for efficient data assimilation in the red sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) is a variant of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) that operates with a static ensemble to drastically reduce its computational cost. The idea is to use a pre-selected ensemble to parameterize the background covariance matrix, which avoids the costly integration of the ensemble members with the dynamical model during the forecast step of the filtering process. To better represent the pronounced time-varying circulation of the Red Sea, we propose a new adaptive EnOI approach in which the ensemble members are adaptively selected at every assimilation cycle from a large dictionary of ocean states describing the Red Sea variability. We implement and test different schemes to select the ensemble members (i) based on the similarity to the forecast state according to some criteria, or (ii) in term of best representation of the forecast in an ensemble subspace using an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. The relevance of the schemes is first demonstrated with the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 models. Then results of numerical experiments assimilating real remote sensing data into a high resolution MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) of the Red Sea using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) system are presented and discussed.

TI  - Identification of egg parasitoids of rice leafhoppers and planthoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae and Delphacidae) of economic importance in Taiwan, part 1: Mymaridae (Hymenoptera)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fairyfly egg parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) of rice leafhoppers and planthoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae and Delphacidae) known from Taiwan are identified taxonomically, keyed, and illustrated. Their host associations are determined by rearings using sentinel eggs of mainly four key pest species. The previously published records of such egg parasitoids in Taiwan are critically analyzed in the unfortunate absence of almost any voucher specimens. Three species of Mymaridae are shown to be the predominant egg parasitoids of one leafhopper and three planthopper major pests of rice in Taiwan: Anagrus (Anagrus) incarnatus Haliday of the green rice leafhopper Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler) and the delphacids Laodelphax striatella (Fallen) (small brown planthopper), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) (brown planthopper), and Sogatella furcifera (Horvath) (white-backed planthopper), as well as Gonatocerus aegyptiacus Soyka and Mymar taprobanicum Ward of N. cincticeps. The zig-zag leafhopper Maiestas dorsalis (Motschulsky), which is also common in paddy fields, is newly recorded as a host for A. incarnatus, G. aegyptiacus, Lymaenon litoralis (Haliday), and M. taprobanicum. Additional new records of some other Mymaridae in Taiwan, mostly from the rice field agroecosystems, are indicated. Litus assamensis Rehmat and Anis, syn. nov. from India, is synonymized with L. sutil Triapitsyn and Berezovskiy from Thailand, which is also newly recorded from Taiwan.

TI  - Validation and consistency assessment of land surface temperature from geostationary and polar orbit platforms: SEVIRI/MSG and AVHRR/Metop
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a fundamental state variable for land surface processes, long available from satellite observations in the thermal infrared. Here we make an assessment of LST products derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on-board the geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), and from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on-board Metop polar-orbiting satellites, as provided by the Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF). The validation of LSA-SAF LST products uses ground observations taking into account the representativeness of each station at pixel scale. The in situ - satellite comparisons reveal overall accuracies of 0.13 degrees C for SEVIRI LST and -0.32 degrees C for AVHRR-based LST. Better matches are usually found for night-time observations, highlighting the influence of LST spatial and temporal variability as well as of sensor view angle on satellite daytime estimates. The averaged difference between AVHRR and SEVIRI LST products remains mostly within +/- 1 degrees C. The impact of different viewing and illumination angles is particularly pronounced for daytime matchups, leading to higher standard deviation of differences than in the case of night-time. Over heterogeneous landscapes, this primarily results from illumination-shadowing effects in daytime observations present in all LST estimates derived from infrared observations. These differences are smaller for night-time observations, or over homogeneous surfaces in general: in these cases, the dependency of LST differences on viewing geometry is smoother and likely explained by the impact of view angle on surface emissivity. Overall the LSA-SAF SEVIRI and AVHRR LST datasets are consistent and meet high accuracy standards. Their production is ensured by the LSA-SAF throughout the life-cycle of the sensors' satellite platforms, making them good candidates for long term applications and studies.

TI  - Minimum Snow/Ice Extent over the Northern Circumpolar Landmass in 2000-19: How Much Snow Survives the Summer Melt?
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel satellite image processing technique developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing has been utilized to produce annual time series of the minimum snow/ice (MSI) extent over the northern circumpolar landmass area (9,000 km x 9,000 km) for 2000-19. The information has been derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 10-day clear-sky composites generated at 250-m spatial resolution over the April-September period. Derived interannual variations agree very well with the warm-season average surface air temperatures from the European reanalysis (ERA5). The region-average correlation coefficient is -0.78. The total MSI extent demonstrated a statistically significant declining trend equal to -1,477 km(2) yr(-1). Results have been compared with data from the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 6.0). The comparison points to a significant contribution of minimum seasonal snow cover relative to RGI glacierized areas. Quantitative estimates obtained for the first time showed that the region-average snow extent that survives the summer melt and resides outside of RGI area can be as high as 15% (or 53 x 10(3) km(2)) while in the northern Canadian Arctic it can reach 41% (or 43 x 10(3) km(2)). The derived MSI time series data can be recommended to the glacier and land-cover scientific community as a source of validation data and annual updates of snow and ice maps over the northern circumpolar landmass.

TI  - A narrative review of the pharmacological, cultural and psychological literature on ibogaine
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHEDELIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ibogaine is a psychoactive alkaloid contained in the West African plant Tabernanthe iboga. Although preliminary, evidence suggests that ibogaine could be effective in the treatment of certain substance use disorders, specifically opioid use disorder. This narrative review concentrated on the pharmacological, cultural and psychological aspects of ibogaine that contribute to its reputed effectiveness with a specific focus on the ibogaine state of consciousness. Although the exact pharmacological mechanisms for ibogaine are still speculative, the literature highlighted its role as an NMDA antagonist in the effective treatment of substance use disorders. The cultural aspects associated with the use of ibogaine pose questions around the worldview of participants as experienced in the traditional and western contexts, which future research should clarify. From a psychological perspective, the theory that the ibogaine state of consciousness resembles REM sleep is questionable due to evidence that indicated ibogaine supressed REM sleep, and contradictory evidence in relation to learning and memory. The suggested classification of the ibogaine experience as oneirophrenic also seems inadequate as it only describes the first phase of the ibogaine experience. The ibogaine experience does however present characteristics consistent with holotropic states of consciousness, and future research could focus on exploring and potentially classifying the state of consciousness induced by ibogaine as holotropic.

TI  - Rotavirus Strain Distribution before and after Introducing Rotavirus Vaccine in India
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - In April 2016, an indigenous monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotavac) was introduced to the National Immunization Program in India. Hospital-based surveillance for acute gastroenteritis was conducted in five sentinel sites from 2012 to 2020 to monitor the vaccine impact on various genotypes and the reduction in rotavirus positivity at each site. Stool samples collected from children under 5 years of age hospitalized with diarrhea were tested for group A rotavirus using a commercial enzyme immunoassay, and rotavirus strains were characterized by RT-PCR. The proportion of diarrhea hospitalizations attributable to rotavirus at the five sites declined from a range of 56-29.4% in pre-vaccine years to 34-12% in post-vaccine years. G1P[8] was the predominant strain in the pre-vaccination period, and G3P[8] was the most common in the post-vaccination period. Circulating patterns varied throughout the study period, and increased proportions of mixed genotypes were detected in the post-vaccination phase. Continuous long-term surveillance is essential to understand the diversity and immuno-epidemiological effects of rotavirus vaccination.

TI  - Temporal mosaicking approaches of Sentinel-2 images for extending topsoil organic carbon content mapping in croplands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major environmental challenge, notably for evaluating soil carbon stocks. Recent works have shown the capability of Sentinel-2 to predict SOC content over temperate agroecosystems characterized with annual crops. However, because spectral models are only applicable on bare soils, the mapping of SOC is often obtained on limited areas. A possible improvement for increasing the number of pixels on which SOC can be retrieved by inverting bare soil reflectance spectra, consists of using optical images acquired at several dates. This study compares different approaches of Sentinel-2 images temporal mosaicking to produce a composite multi-date bare soil image for predicting SOC content over agricultural topsoils. A first approach for temporal mosaicking was based on a per-pixel selection and was driven by soil surface characteristics: bare soil or dry bare soil with/without removing dry vegetation. A second approach for creating composite images was based on a per-date selection and driven either by the models performance from single date, or by average soil surface indicators of bare soil or dry bare soil. To characterize soil surface, Sentinel-1 (S1)-derived soil moisture and/or spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2), bare soil index (BSI) and a soil surface moisture index (S2WI) were used either separately or in combination. This study highlighted the following results: i) none of the temporal mosaic images improved model performance for SOC prediction compared to the best single-date image; ii) of the per-pixel approaches, temporal mosaics driven by the S1-derived moisture content, and to a lesser extent, by NBR2 index, outperformed the mosaic driven by the BSI index but they did not increase the bare soil area predicted; iii) of the per-date approaches, the best trade-off between predicted area and model performance was achieved from the temporal mosaic driven by the S1-derived moisture content (R-2 similar to 0.5, RPD similar to 1.4, RMSE similar to 3.7 g.kg(-1)) which enabled to more than double (*2.44) the predicted area. This study suggests that a number of bare soil mosaics based on several indicators (moisture, bare soil, roughness...), preferably in combination, might maintain acceptable accuracies for SOC prediction whilst extending over larger areas than single-date images.

TI  - Comprehensive study on evaluation of Kaliasaur Landslide attributes in Garhwal Himalaya by the execution of geospatial, geotechnical and geophysical methods
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The devastating Kaliasaur Landslide of Garhwal Himalaya disrupted a significant part of the National route directing to Kedarnath-Badrinath originates from Kaliasaur fault of Srinagar thrust. This landslide event comprising mainly rocks as well as debris got provoked by the monsoonal precipitation overcasting the Himalayan region. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data evaluates this precipitation intensity. Further Rapid Mass Movement Simulation (RAMMS) modeling is employed (using ALOS PALSAR 12.5m DEM data), that infers rockfall has 12.87 m maximum jump height, 41.52 ms(-1) maximum velocities, and maximum kinetic rock energy of 1401.63 KJ just above as well as below the road. Whereas in the debris flow, the maximum height of flow is 5.3 m, the maximum velocity at its upper part is 13.04 ms(-1), and maximum pressure at its upper-middle portion is 340.33 kPa. In this landslide zone, samples collected from four identified locations on which Attenberg test, as well as a direct shear test, are conducted to determine its moisture content and shear strength. Evaluation of these samples is done in terms of the grain size distribution (by sieve analysis), identification of the flaky structure of weathered minerals (by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) imaging), and measurement of reflectance (using ADS spectroscopy). All these evaluations ascertained the geology of this area is composed of weathered volcanic and metamorphic rocks. Now content with the surface investigation, the study is burrowed further into the subsurface. The concealed properties get revealed by the aid of Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) that identifies saturated, weathered as well as semi consolidated zone and inclined, horizontal bedding with discontinuity respectively. The saddles present in this landcover and impact loading of the river on the toe of the slope are the significant geomorphological findings. Finally, integrating all the methods, significant aspects of Kaliasaur landslide are sketched out, which shall help in the prevention of future fatal consequences.

TI  - Multiresolution Detection of Persistent Scatterers: A Performance Comparison Between Multilook GLRT and CAESAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterers (PS) interferometry tools are extensively used for the monitoring of slow, long-term ground deformation. High spatial resolution is typically required in urban areas to cope with the variability of the signal, whereas in rural regions, multilook shall be implemented to improve the coverage of monitored areas. Along this line, SqueeSAR and later Component extrAction and sElection SAR (CAESAR) were introduced for the monitoring of both persistent and (decorrelating) distributed scatterers (DS). Multilook generalized likelihood ratio test (MGLRT) is a detector derived in the context of tomographic SAR processing that has been investigated for a fixed multilook degree. In this work, we address MGLRT and CAESAR in the multiresolution context characterized by a spatially variable multilook degree. We compare the two schemes for the multiresolution selection of PS and DS, highlighting the pros and cons of each scheme, particularly the peculiarities of CAESAR that have important implications at the implementation stage. A performance analysis of both detectors in case of model mismatch is also addressed. Experiments carried out with data acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed constellation support both the theoretical argumentation and the results achieved by resorting to Monte Carlo simulations.

TI  - Cognitive-Emotional Music Listening Paradigm in Professional Music Education
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE RESEARCH IN SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND EDUCATION-IJCRSEE
M3  - Review
AB  - Music education is an important factor of students' development. The positive effect of music training is evident in all areas, from the intellectual, psychomotor to social and emotional ones, and therefore music classes in the music school should focus both on music making and on experience, understanding and evaluating music, as well as on expressing one's own ideas, feelings and thoughts. In ear training classes it can be achieved through the area of music listening. Didactical initiatives of the 19th and 20th century contributed to the recognition of the advantages of the auditory approach, while technological innovations allowed the practical application of music listening. Although there are examples that point to fostering the emotional experience in music classes, music listening is still focused on giving assignments of cognitive type and learning about music components. Some exceptions pertain to the application of multimodality in music teaching using both musical and extra-musical areas. The paper is aimed at pointing to the value of the cognitive-emotional music listening and to the possibilities it opens in ear training classes. The cognitive-emotional music listening focuses on experiencing, understanding and appreciation of classical music aimed at shaping students' worldview and improving their music competences. It can be achieved by the multimodal and interdisciplinary approach to a musical piece. Students learn about the musical-historical context of the emergence of a piece in a given time and circumstances, about the composing approach and the theoretical and harmony features of the work, they develop their musical and critical thinking, make music, and evaluate both music and their own achievements. Repeated listening to a musical piece or excerpts from it, observing and familiarizing with the piece from different perspectives and discussion about the piece and experience after listening make it possible to better understand the piece and its specifics, as well as to discover and improve one's own self and accept others and the different.

TI  - Identifying heart failure in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease through the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network in British Columbia: a case derivation study.
T2  - CMAJ open
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) poses a substantial global health burden, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study was to validate an electronic medical record-based definition of HF in patients with COPD in primary care practices in the province of British Columbia, Canada.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective chart review from Sept. 1, 2018, to Dec. 31, 2018, for a cohort of patients from primary care practices in BC whose physicians were recruited through the BC node of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. Heart failure case definitions were developed by combining diagnostic codes, medication information and laboratory values available in primary care electronic medical records. These were compared with HF diagnoses identified through detailed chart review as the gold standard. Sensitivity, specificity, negative (NPV) and positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for each definition.RESULTS: Charts of 311 patients with COPD were reviewed, of whom 72 (23.2%) had HF. Five categories of definitions were constructed, all of which had appropriate sensitivity, specificity and NPV. The optimal case definition consisted of 1 HF billing code or a specific combination of medications for HF. This definition had an excellent specificity (93.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 89.4%-96.1%), sensitivity (90.3%, 95% CI 81.0%-96.0%), PPV (80.2%, 95% CI 69.9%-88.3%) and NPV (97.0%, 95% CI 93.8%-98.8%).INTERPRETATION: This comprehensive case definition improves upon previous primary care HF definitions to include medication codes and laboratory data, along with previously used billing codes. A case definition for HF was derived and validated and can be used with data from electronic medical records to identify HF in patients with COPD in primary care accurately.

TI  - The heritage of the Second World War: bombing in the forests and wetlands of the Kozle Basin
T2  - ANTIQUITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kozle Basin in Poland was radically transformed by aerial bombardment during the Second World War. Today, the region has approximately 6000 well-preserved bomb craters with diameters ranging from 5-15m and depths often exceeding 2m. Combining remote-sensing data and fieldwork with historical accounts, this article analyses these craters, demonstrating that their varied morphologies derive from the weight of the bombs that created them, and on the type and moisture content of the soil on which the bombs fell. Based on their results, the authors issue a call for the official protection of the Kozle landscape, which has particular historical, educational and ecological value.

TI  - An Innovative Intelligent System with Integrated CNN and SVM: Considering Various Crops through Hyperspectral Image Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Generation of a thematic map is important for scientists and agriculture engineers in analyzing different crops in a given field. Remote sensing data are well-accepted for image classification on a vast area of crop investigation. However, most of the research has currently focused on the classification of pixel-based image data for analysis. The study was carried out to develop a multi-category crop hyperspectral image classification system to identify the major crops in the Chiayi Golden Corridor. The hyperspectral image data from CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) were used as the experimental data in this study. A two-stage classification was designed to display the performance of the image classification. More specifically, the study used a multi-class classification by support vector machine (SVM) + convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification analysis. SVM is a supervised learning model that analyzes data used for classification. CNN is a class of deep neural networks that is applied to analyzing visual imagery. The image classification comparison was made among four crops (paddy rice, potatoes, cabbages, and peanuts), roads, and structures for classification. In the first stage, the support vector machine handled the hyperspectral image classification through pixel-based analysis. Then, the convolution neural network improved the classification of image details through various blocks (cells) of segmentation in the second stage. A series of discussion and analyses of the results are presented. The repair module was also designed to link the usage of CNN and SVM to remove the classification errors.

TI  - Study on Vegetation Restoration Characteristics of Daxing'anling Burned Area Based on <i>EVI</i>
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] Using Landsat images to study the identification and vegetation restoration Of burned areas based on dNBR (difference Normalized Burned Ratio) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). [Method] Taking the 1987 forest fire happened in the northern region of Daxing' an Mountain as the research background, based on land classification and dNBR values, the burned areas were identified and extracted by K-means method, and were classified into light, moderate and severe fire intensity area; and then, based on the EVI values of the burned areas, the vegetation restoration characteristics in the burned area from 1987 to 2019 were analyzed by using the methods of one-way linear regression, Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen median, so as to explore the vegetation restoration process of burned areas in Daxing'an Mountains. [Result] Based on dNBR, the total burned area was 1291.68 hm(2), and the proportions of light, moderate and severe burned area were 45.70%, 32.16% and 22.14%, respectively. The severe burned area was distributed in the center of the burned area, and the fire intensity gradually decreased from the center to the outside. The impact of forest fire on EVI was obvious, the EVI values of light, moderate and severe burned area decreased by 30.0%, 48,3% and 68.8%, respectively. After the forest fire, the EVI values of burned areas gradually increased with the vegetation recovery, and their differences with the controlled area were gradually reduced. The recovery rates of EVI on different burned forest lands were severe > moderate > light, and the EVI value of shrub grassland was the same as that of the controlled area 2 years after the forest fire. During the process of vegetation restoration in the burned area, the EVI mutation points of forest land were less than that of shrub grassland, EVI mutation points of light burned area were less than those of severe and moderate burned area, and the mutation time of controlled area were all lagged behind that of burned area. [Conclusion] dNBR can be used to extract the burned area and fire intensity. The EVI values of burned area decreased obviously because of the fire, and the decreasing degree increased with the increase of fire intensity. In the process of vegetation restoration, the EVI values of the burned are increased gradually; the light and moderate burned forest land recovered to normal vegetation state 6-8 years after the fire, and the severe burned area returned to normal vegetation state about 14 years after the fire, while the burned shrub grassland recovered to normal 2 years after the fire. The ecosystem in the burned area is fragile and vulnerable to environmental conditions. Therefore, the fire intensity and natural environment are the main factors affecting the vegetation restoration of the burned area in Daxing'an Mountains. The results can provide some data support for vegetation restoration and management in Daxing'an Mountains.

TI  - Characterizing Spatiotemporal Variations of Soil Salinization and Its Relationship with Eco-Hydrological Parameters at the Regional Scale in the Kashi Area of Xinjiang, China from 2000 to 2017
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the most serious issues of land degradation, especially in inland drylands, such as the Kashgar region in the Xinjiang province, western China. The investigation of the spatiotemporal variations of soil salinization and its causes is critical for regional ecological restoration and social development. In this study, salinization severity was firstly interpreted in Kashgar region for the years 2000, 2010, and 2017 using multitemporal Landsat images, and the spatiotemporal variations of salinized soil area, salinization severity index, and important index of salinization change were then analyzed using transition matrix method. Finally, the relationship between salinization and eco-hydrological parameters at the regional scale was investigated using correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression. The results show that salinized soil is mainly concentrated in irrigated oasis areas. Although the decrease rate of total salinized soil area is decreasing, the decrease rate of average salinization severity is increasing gradually. There is an increasing trend for the improved area of salinized soil, whereas an opposite trend was observed for the deteriorated area of salinized soil. The conversion from extremely severe salinized soil to the severe ones was the dominant transforming type from 2000 to 2017; meanwhile, the transformation from non-salinized soil to salinized soil for the newly reclaimed farmland was observed, indicating that some necessary irrigation control measures must be taken to avoid further soil salinizing. A significant negative correlation between salinization severity and evapotranspiration, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was observed, implying that soil structure change induced by vegetation, associated with high evapotranspiration (ET) and low land surface temperature (LST), played a positive role in alleviating soil salinization in this region. It is concluded that the soil salinization had been alleviated from 2000 to 2017, mainly due to the combined effects of the farmland expansion and the reasonable irrigation system.

TI  - Optimization of residential green space for environmental sustainability and property appreciation in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities in arid and semi-arid regions have been exploring urban sustainability policies, such as lowering the vegetation coverage to reduce residential outdoor water use. Meanwhile, urban residents express concerns that such policies could potentially impact home prices regardless of the reduced water costs because studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between vegetation coverage and home values. On the other hand, lower vegetation coverage in arid and semi-arid desert regions could increase surface temperatures, and consequently increases energy costs. The question is therefore where the point in which residential outdoor water use can be minimized without overly increasing surface temperatures and negatively impacting home values. This study examines the impacts of spatial composition of different vegetation types on land surface temperature (LST), outdoor water use (OWU), and property sales value (PSV) in 302 local residential communities in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona using remotely sensed data and regression analysis. In addition, the spatial composition of vegetation cover was optimized to achieve a relatively lower LST and OWU and maintain a relatively higher PSV at the same time. We found that drought-tolerant landscaping that is composed of mostly shrubs and trees adapted to the desert environment is the most water efficient way to reduce LST, but grass contributes to a higher PSV. Research findings suggest that different residential landscaping strategies may be better suited for different neighborhoods and goal sets can be used by urban planners and city managers to better design urban residential landscaping for more efficient water conservation and urban heat mitigation for desert cities.

TI  - Habitat suitability modeling based on remote sensing to realize time synchronization of species and environmental variables
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Remote sensing (RS) is a technical method for effectively capturing real-world data on a large scale. We aimed to (i) realize the time synchronization of species and environmental variables, and extract variables related to the actual growth of species based on RS in habitat suitability modeling, and (ii) provide a reference for species management.Methods Taking invasive species Ambrosia artemisiifolia in China as an example for habitat suitability modeling. Temperature and precipitation variables were calculated from the land surface temperature provided by the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and climate station data, respectively. Besides, other variables that directly affect the growth or reproduction of A. artemisiifolia were also included, such as the relative humidity of the previous year's flowering period (RHPFP), and the effective UV irradiance reaching the Earth's surface (UVI). The random forest method was selected to model the habitat suitability. The environmental variables and samples were divided into four-time periods (i.e. 1990-2000, 2001-2005, 2006-2010 and 2011-2016) based on sampling time. Variables from the long-time series of RS (1990-2016) and WorldClim (1960-1990) were also modeled.Important Findings It was feasible to extract environmental variables from RS for habitat suitability modeling, and was more accurate than that based on the variables from WorldClim. The potential distribution of A. artemisiifolia in 1990-2000 and 2006-2010 was smaller than that in 2001-2005 and 2011-2016. The precipitation of driest months (bio14), precipitation coefficient of variation (bio15), RHPFP and UVI were the important environmental variables that affect the growth and reproduction of A. artemisiifolia. The results indicated that the time synchronization of species and environmental variables improved the prediction accuracy of A. artemisiifolia, which should be considered in habitat suitability modeling (especially for annual species). This study can provide an important reference for the management and prevention of the spread of A. artemisiifolia.

TI  - Inversion of Ionospheric O/N<sub>2</sub> by Using FY-3D Ionospheric Photometer Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space weather events such as magnetic storms can cause significant changes in the concentration of the neutral components O and N-2 in the thermosphere. Therefore, the ratio of the column density of oxygen atom to nitrogen molecule O/N-2 is often used as a sign of the ionosphere's disturbance. The results have shown that the ratio of the density of O and N-2 columns density O/N-2 and the ratio of the column emission intensity 135. 6/LBH of far ultraviolet airglow 0 I 135. 6 nm and N-2 LBH have a good correlation, so far ultraviolet optical remote sensing is very important for monitoring space weather. Since the 1970s, research on ionospheric exploration with far ultraviolet airglow has been conducted abroad, and several related satellite coordinates have been launched, especially in the United States, Japan, Sweden and other countries. Among the airborne prediction and optical detection instruments operating in orbit, only some work in the microwave and visible wavelength, and there are no detection instruments working in far ultraviolet longer, until the successful launch of FENGYUN-3D meteorological satellite in November 2017. The ionospheric photometer on the satellite is the first airborne far ultraviolet airglow remote sensing detection load in China. It provides us with a series of far ultraviolet detection data with independent intellectual property rights, and lays a foundation for us to carry out the research of ionospheric O/N-2 characteristics. Firstly, we described how to retrieve the ratio of column density O/N-2 of the neutral component in the thermosphere by using the ratio of column radiation intensity 135. 6/LBH. Secondly, in the msise-00 atmospheric model, the ratio coefficient between 135. 6/LBH and O/N-2 is calculated by AURIC, and then the ionospheric O/N-2 is retrieved by using the far ultraviolet airglow data observed by ionospheric photometer in real time, which further verifies the disturbance of the ionospheric neutral component during the magnetic storm. In the process of data processing, Chebyshev filter is used to process the out of band stray light in the data, which further suppresses the influence of the stray light signal on the FUV spectrum signal. Finally, the inversion results of O/N-2 retrieved by Ionospheric Photometer are compared with the results of Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) loaded by foreign optical remote sensing. The results show that they have the same response to a magnetic storm, and the product RMS error of O/N-2 is about 0. 319 6. In this paper, we have made an initial analysis of the possible causes of the differences, which lays a foundation for the follow-up work. This studyis the first time to use the data of the far ultraviolet airglow remote sensing payload independently developed in China for data inversion and analysis, which is of great significance to the development of the ionospheric far ultraviolet remote sensing technology in China.

TI  - A Universal Ratio Snow Index for Fractional Snow Cover Estimation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow algorithm has been used to generate global fractional snow cover (FSC) at a pixel size of 500 m using a linear regression relationship (called "FRA6T") between FSC and the normalized difference snow index (NDSI). However, the linear relationship is problematic because of the considerable NDSI variation in nonsnow conditions. In this letter, we propose a universal ratio snow index (URSI), which is the ratio of the visible reflectance and the sum of the near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectances. It is called "universal" because it has weak sensitivity under snow-free ground conditions and, therefore, can improve the stability of the linear snow index methodology. A comparison between NDSI and URSI with regard to estimate FSC using the linear snow index methodology is carried out for the Tibetan Plateau. The scatter plots of MODIS NDSI/URSI and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) FSC indicate that a linear relationship can be assumed for both NDSI and URSI for barren land conditions and is more appropriate for URSI than it is for NDSI in forested areas. Validation efforts show that the linear relationship using URSI (designated "FracURSI") achieves fewer errors in FSC estimation compared with the developed NDSI method ("FracNDSI"), particularly for forested areas and for moderate FSC values. Averaged over all comparisons, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of FSC estimates for FRA6T is 0.13, and for FracNDSI is 0.12, whereas FracURSI RMSE is 0.11.

TI  - Characterization of the aerosol chemical composition during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Suzhou in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To control the spread of COVID-19, rigorous restrictions have been implemented in China, resulting in a great reduction in pollutant emissions. In this study, we evaluated the air quality in the Yangtze River Delta during the COVID-19 lockdown period using satellite and ground-based data, including particle matter (PM), trace gases, water-soluble ions (WSIs) and black carbon (BC). We found that the impacts of lockdown policy on air quality cannot be accurately assessed using MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, whereas the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) vertical column density can well reflect the influences of these restrictions on human activities. Compared to the pre-COVID period, the PM2.5, PM10, NO2, carbon monoxide (CO), BC and WSIs during the lockdown in Suzhou were observed to decrease by 37.2%, 38.3%, 64.5%, 26.1%, 53.3% and 58.6%, respectively, while the sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (0 3 ) increased by 1.5% and 104.7%. The WSIs ranked in the order of NO3- > NO4+ > SO42 > Cl- > Ca-2(+) > K+ > Mg-2(+) > Na+ during the lockdown period. By comparisons with the ion concentrations during the pre-COVID period, we found that the ions NO3-, NH4+, + SO42, Cl, Ca-2(+), K+ and Na+ decreased by 66.3%, 48.8%, 52.9%, 56.9%, 57.9% and 76.3%, respectively, during the lockdown, in contrast to Mg2+, which increased by 30.2%. The lockdown policy was found to have great impacts on the diurnal variations of Cl-, SO42-, Na+ and Ca2+. (C) 2020 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon under Different Land Use Types Using Sentinel-1/-2 Data in a Small Watershed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key property for evaluating soil quality. SOC is thus an important parameter of agricultural soils and needs to be regularly monitored. The aim of this study is to explore the potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery (Sentinel-1), optical satellite imagery (Sentinel-2), and digital elevation model (DEM) data to estimate the SOC content under different land use types. The extreme gradient boosting (XGboost) algorithm was used to predict the SOC content and evaluate the importance of feature variables under different land use types. For this purpose, 290 topsoil samples were collected and 49 features were derived from remote sensing images and DEM. Feature selection was carried out to prevent data redundancy. Coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), percent root mean squared error (%RMSE), ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ), and corrected akaike information criterion (AICc) were employed for evaluating model performance. The results showed that Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were both important for the prediction of SOC and the prediction accuracy of the model differed with land use types. Among them, the prediction accuracy of this model is the best for orchard (R-2 = 0.86 and MSE = 0.004%), good for dry land (R-2 = 0.74 and MSE = 0.008%) and paddy field (R-2 = 0.66 and MSE = 0.009%). The prediction model of SOC content is effective and can provide support for the application of remote sensing data to soil property monitoring.

TI  - Satellite-Observed Decreases in Water Turbidity in the Pearl River Estuary: Potential Linkage With Sea-Level Rise
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water turbidity is an important indicator of water quality, which regulates primary production by changing the light field in the water column. Thus, monitoring the spatial and temporal variations in water turbidity is environmentally and biologically important. In this study, nine commonly used spectral index algorithms were tuned using in situ data collected from two field surveys in the Pearl River Estuary of China, and the spectral ratios between the red and green bands (i.e., Rrs(678)/Rrs(531) and Rrs(645)/Rrs(555)) were selected as the optimal indicator to estimate water turbidity in this region. A long-term environmental data record of water turbidity was established for the Pearl River Estuary by applying the proposed algorithm to MODIS/Aqua data covering the estuary from 2003 to 2019. Water turbidity in the Pearl River Estuary has significantly decreased at a rate of 0.11 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) per year (R-2 = 0.84, p < 0.01). The decline in water turbidity is linked with sea-level rise in this area. Sea-level rise may cause the longitudinal and lateral landward retreat of estuarine turbidity maxima (ETMs), directly contributing to the decline in water turbidity. Further, the sea-level rise and the decline in water turbidity in the Pearl River Estuary are also two effects resulting from similar processes, such as urbanization. A high degree of correlation was observed between the water turbidity and salinity, which could facilitate promising monitoring of the increasingly severe saltwater intrusions in this region.

TI  - Automatic Cotton Mapping Using Time Series of Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop mapping is essential for agricultural management. Phenological variation often exists in the same crop due to different climatic regions or practice management, resulting in current classification models requiring sufficient training samples from different regions. However, the cost of sample collection is more time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive, so it is necessary to develop automatic crop mapping models that require only a few samples and can be extended to a large area. In this study, a new white bolls index (WBI) based on the unique canopy of cotton at the bolls opening stage was proposed, which can characterize the intensity of bolls opening. The value of WBI will increase as the opening of the bolls increases. As a result, the white bolls index can be used to detect cotton automatically from other crops. Four study areas in different regions were used to evaluate the WBI performance. The overall accuracy (OA) for the four study sites was more than 82%. Additionally, the dates when the opening stage of bolls begins can be determined based on the time series of WBI. The results of this research demonstrated the potential of the proposed approach for cotton mapping using sentinel-2 time series of remotely sensed data.

TI  - Downscaling Land Surface Temperature Based on Non-Linear Geographically Weighted Regressive Model over Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a vital physical parameter in geoscience research and plays a prominent role in surface and atmosphere interaction. Due to technical restrictions, the spatiotemporal resolution of satellite remote sensing LST data is relatively low, which limits the potential applications of these data. An LST downscaling algorithm can effectively alleviate this problem and endow the LST data with more spatial details. Considering the spatial nonstationarity, downscaling algorithms have been gradually developed from least square models to geographical models. The current geographical LST downscaling models only consider the linear relationship between LST and auxiliary parameters, whereas non-linear relationships are neglected. Our study addressed this issue by proposing an LST downscaling algorithm based on a non-linear geographically weighted regressive (NL-GWR) model and selected the optimal combination of parameters to downscale the spatial resolution of a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST from 1000 m to 100 m. We selected Jinan city in north China and Wuhan city in south China from different seasons as study areas and used Landsat 8 images as reference data to verify the downscaling LST. The results indicated that the NL-GWR model performed well in all the study areas with lower root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), rather than the linear model.

TI  - Vegetation Change and Its Response to Climate Extremes in the Arid Region of Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in climate extremes have a profound impact on vegetation growth. In this study, we employed the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and a recently published climate extremes dataset (HadEX3) to study the temporal and spatial evolution of vegetation cover, and its responses to climate extremes in the arid region of northwest China (ARNC). Mann-Kendall test, Anomaly analysis, Pearson correlation analysis, Time lag cross-correlation method, and Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression (Lasso) were conducted to quantitatively analyze the response characteristics between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climate extremes from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that: (1) The vegetation in the ARNC had a fluctuating upward trend, with vegetation significantly increasing in Xinjiang Tianshan, Altai Mountain, and Tarim Basin, and decreasing in the central inland desert. (2) Temperature extremes showed an increasing trend, with extremely high-temperature events increasing and extremely low-temperature events decreasing. Precipitation extremes events also exhibited a slightly increasing trend. (3) NDVI was overall positively correlated with the climate extremes indices (CEIs), although both positive and negative correlations spatially coexisted. (4) The responses of NDVI and climate extremes showed time lag effects and spatial differences in the growing period. (5) Precipitation extremes were closely related to NDVI than temperature extremes according to Lasso modeling results. This study provides a reference for understanding vegetation variations and their response to climate extremes in arid regions.

TI  - Two Severe Prolonged Hydrological Droughts Analysis over Mainland Australia Using GRACE Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, many droughts have happened over mainland Australia, especially the two severe prolonged droughts, from 2006 to 2009 and 2018 to 2020, resulting in serious water scarcity. Therefore, using the Total Storage Deficit Index (TSDI) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), we analyzed the two severe prolonged droughts from the perspective of the affected area, spatial evolution, frequency, severity and drought driving factors. The results show that the affected area of Drought 2006-2009 ranged from 57% to 95%, and that of Drought 2018-2020 ranged from 45% to 95%. Drought 2006-2009 took its rise in southeastern Australia and gradually spread to the central part. Drought 2018-2020 originated in the southwest corner of the Northern Territory and northern New South Wales, and gradually expanded to Western Australia and the whole New South Wales respectively. During Drought 2006-2009, Victoria suffered drought all months, including 59% mild drought and 41% moderate drought, North Territory had the highest drought severity of 44.26 and Victoria ranked the second high with the severity of 35.51 (cm months). For Drought 2018-2020, Northern Territory was also dominated by drought all months, including 92% mild drought and 8% moderate drought, the drought severities were in North Territory and Western Australia with 52.19 and 31.44 (cm months), respectively. Finally, the correlation coefficients between the two droughts and Indo-Pacific climate variability including El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are computed. By comparing the correlation coefficients of Drought 2018-2020 with Drought 2006-2009, we find that the impact of the El Nino on the hydrological drought becomes weaker while IOD is stronger, and the role of Southern Oscillation on droughts is diverse with the quite different spatial patterns. The results from Fourier analysis confirm that the two hydrological droughts are all related to Indo-Pacific climate variability but with slightly different driving mechanisms.

TI  - Monitoring and Evaluating Restoration Vegetation Status in Mine Region Using Remote Sensing Data: Case Study in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological restoration of mining areas is very important, and repeated field surveys are inefficient in large-scale vegetation monitoring. The coal mining industry is currently facing the challenge of the lack of appropriate methods for monitoring restoration processes. This study used an open pit coal mine in Dongsheng District, Inner Mongolia, China as an example, and used the 2011-2018 Landsat TM/ETM+ and OLI images to monitor and evaluate vegetation restoration activity of the coal mine. The average value of the monthly maximum value of vegetation index in the growing season was selected as the basic indicator for studying vegetation and bare soil changes. The growth root normalized differential vegetation index (GRNDVI) and GRNDVI anomaly method indicated that the constructed land type change factor was used to study the growth of mine vegetation and change of the range of bare land in the entire mining region. We found that westward mining activities started from 2012, and vegetation was restored in the eastern original mining region from 2013. The restoration vegetation areas from 2015 to 2016 and from 2017 to 2018 were larger than those in the other restoration years. Moreover, areas of expanded bare land from 2011 to 2012, and from 2017 to 2018 were larger than those in the other expansion years. The restoration vegetation growth changes were compared with those of the natural vegetation growth. Results showed that the restoration vegetation growth trend was considerably similar with that of the natural vegetation. Inter-annual restoration effects were analyzed by constructing the effect of the area-average factor and using vegetation growth data. Accordingly, the restoration vegetation effects were best in 2014 and 2016. Comprehensive restoration effect was analyzed using the weighted evaluation method to obtain the overall restoration effects of the coal mine. Results showed that the comprehensive restoration effect is inclined to the inferior growth state. This study conducted a preliminary evaluation of mine restoration vegetation, thereby providing a promising way for the future monitoring and evaluation of such processes.

TI  - Routing and Wavelength Assignment Based on Load Balance for Optical Satellite Network
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A load balancing-routing wavelength assignment (IARAVA) algorithm based on user traffic distribution for satellite optical networks (OSNO) is proposed. The ant colony algorithm is employed to find the optical path so that the OSNs can achieve effective load balancing. The LBRWA optimization model in the OSNs based on global user traffic distribution is established. It searches for the next-hop link according to the link duration and wavelength idle rate and introduces random disturbance to avoid local optimum. The statistical average optical path cost corrected by the user traffic intensity is employed to update the link status; the traffic is directed to the satellite nodes in the non-hot spot area to find the load balancing optimal optical path for user requests. Numerical simulation results show that compared with traditional elastic load balancing (ELB) algorithm haled on link-state, LIIRAVA algorithm reduces the congestion rate by 20.49%. In addition, LBRWA has better performance in terms of resource utilization, traffic distribution index, and max normalized inter-satellite link load, thereby effectively realizing load balancing in OSNs.

TI  - Comparing Luojia 1-01 and VIIRS Nighttime Light Data in Detecting Urban Spatial Structure Using a Threshold-Based Kernel Density Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) data are increasingly used in urban studies and urban planning owing to their strong connection with human activities, although the detection capacity is limited by the spatial resolution of older data. In the present study, we comparedthe results of extractions of urban built-up areas using data obtained from the first professional NTL satellite Luojia 1-01 with a resolution of 130 m and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We applied an analyzing framework combing kernel density estimation (KDE) under different search radii and threshold-based extraction to detect the boundary and spatial structure of urban areas. The results showed that: (1) Benefiting from a higher spatial resolution, Luojia 1-01 data was more sensitive in detecting new emerging urban built-up areas, thus better reflected the spatial structure of urban system, and can achieve a higher extraction accuracy than that of VIIRS data; (2) Combining with a proper threshold, KDE improves the extraction accuracy of NTL data by making use of the spatial autocorrelation of nighttime light, thus better detects the scale of the spatial pattern of urban built-up areas; (3) A proper searching radius for KDE is critical for achieving the optimal result, which was 1000 m for Luojia 1-01 and 1600 m for VIIRS in this study. Our findings indicate the usefulness of the KDE method in applying the upcoming high-resolution NTL data such as Luojia 1-01 data in urban spatial analysis and planning.

TI  - Assessments of Ecological Quality in Jinjiang District of Chengdu City Using the FVC and RSEI Models
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate assessment of urban ecological quality and its change is of important reference to ecological construction and renovating in high-speed developing urban in central and western regions of China. Taking Jinjiang District in Chengdu City as example and choosing Landsat 5/8 images in 2002, 2009 and 2018, the ecological quality and its change in Jinjiang District from 2002 to 2018 were assessed. The results show that : (1) The values of FVC in 2002, 2009 and 2018 were 0. 522, 0. 493 and 0. 502, respectively. It indicates that FVC of the research area decreased first and then picked up during the period of the 16 years, but the overall trend was in a decreasing state. The values of RSEI in 2002, 2009 and 2018 were 0. 526, 0. 517 and 0. 505, respectively. It indicates that RSEI of the research area decreased in the 16 years. ( 2) The overall ecological quality in the research area was in ordinary status but continued to decline in 16 years. The decline mainly performed as the decrease of excellent and good quality areas. Ecological quality in the south part of the Jinjiang District, which consisted mainly of built-up areas, decreased dramatically. On the contrary, ecological quality in the north part of the Jinjiang District, which consisted mainly of old quarter, increased in the 16 years. (3) The distribution and variation of FVC was highly consistent with those of RSEI. FVC is the major positive factor for the ecological quality of the research area. With the rapid urban development, the built-up area has become the major negative factor. FVC and RSEI can comprehensively reflect the ecological quality and its change of Jinjiang District.

TI  - Market Privilege: The Place of Neoliberalism in American Political Development
T2  - STUDIES IN AMERICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1970s, the neoliberal worldview has become reflected increasingly in the policy ideas and institutional innovations advanced by both major parties in the United States. This is most obvious in the realm of economic and social policy, but especially evident at the subnational level, particularly in the city. I argue that neoliberalism, as an ideology, a set of policy prescriptions, and institutional designs, is conceptually distinct from liberalism, especially in its "New Deal" form, social democracy, and from conservatism. Moreover, it is having a developmental effect-neoliberal ideas and institutions have proved durable. This article argues that an urban lens most strikingly reveals the presence of a neoliberal political order that has also made its mark on national political institutions, particularly in the American political economy.

TI  - High-Dimensional Satellite Image Compositing and Statistics for Enhanced Irrigated Crop Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate irrigated area maps remain difficult to generate, as smallholder irrigation schemes often escape detection. Efforts to map smallholder irrigation have often relied on complex classification models fitted to temporal image stacks. The use of high-dimensional geometric median composites (geomedians) and high-dimensional statistics of time-series may simplify classification models and enhance accuracy. High-dimensional statistics for temporal variation, such as the spectral median absolute deviation, indicate spectral variability within a period contributing to a geomedian. The Ord River Irrigation Area was used to validate Digital Earth Australia's annual geomedian and temporal variation products. Geomedian composites and the spectral median absolute deviation were then calculated on Sentinel-2 images for three smallholder irrigation schemes in Matabeleland, Zimbabwe, none of which were classified as areas equipped for irrigation in AQUASTAT's Global Map of Irrigated Areas. Supervised random forest classification was applied to all sites. For the three Matabeleland sites, the average Kappa coefficient was 0.87 and overall accuracy was 95.9% on validation data. This compared with 0.12 and 77.2%, respectively, for the Food and Agriculture Organisation's Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data (WaPOR) land use classification map. The spectral median absolute deviation was ranked among the most important variables across all models based on mean decrease in accuracy. Change detection capacity also means the spectral median absolute deviation has some advantages for cropland mapping over indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. The method demonstrated shows potential to be deployed across countries and regions where smallholder irrigation schemes account for large proportions of irrigated area.

Thresholding Single Water Index image (TSWI) with threshold is a common way of using water index (WI) for mapping water for it is easy to use and could obtain acceptable accuracies in many applications. As more and more WIs are available and each has its distinct merits, the real-world application of TSWI, however, often face two practical concerns: (1) selection of an appropriate WI and (2) determination of an appropriate threshold for a given WI. These two issues are problematic for many users who rely either on trial-and-error procedures that are time-consuming or on their personal preferences that are somewhat subjective. To better deal with these two practical concerns, an alternative way of using WIs is suggested here by transforming the current paradigm into a simple but robust ensemble approach called Collaborative Decision-making with Water Indices (CDWI). A total of 145 subsite images (900 x 900 m) from 22 Landsat-8 OLI scenes that covering various water-land environments around the world were used to assess the performance of TSWI and the CDWI. Five benchmark WIs were adopted in five TSWI methods and CDWI method: Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), the Modified NDWI (MNDWI), the Automated Water Extraction Indices without considering (AWEI0) and with considering (AWEI1) shadows, and the state-of-the-art 2015 water index (WI2015). Two aspects of performance were analyzed: comparing their accuracies (indicated by both F1-scores and Youden's Index) over various environments and comparing their accuracy sensitivities to threshold. The results demonstrate that CDWI produced higher accuracies than the other five TSWI methods for most application cases. Particularly, more cases (indicated by percentage) produced higher F1-scores by CDWI than the other five TSWI methods, i.e. 67% (CDWI) vs. 15% (TSWINDWI), 54% (CDWI) vs. 22% (TSWIMNDWI), 42% (CDWI) vs. 12% (TSWIAWEI0), 57% (CDWI) vs. 17% (TSWIAWEI1), and 34% (CDWI) vs. 12% (TSWIWI2015). Moreover, the F1-score of the CDWI is less sensitive to the change of thresholds compared with that of the five TSWI methods. These important benefits of CDWI make it a robust approach for mapping water. The uncertainty of CDWI method was thoroughly discussed and a general guidance (or look-up-table) for determining parameters of CDWI method was also suggested. The underlying framework of CDWI could be readily generalizable and applicable to other satellite images, such as Landsat TM/ETM+, MODIS, and Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - TOOL OR LENS? WORLDVIEW THEORY AND CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE LEGAL ACTIVISM
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAW AND RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article combines historical and philosophical analysis to examine and critique the ideas motivating Christian conservative legal activism. Such activists routinely claim to be motivated by a Christian worldview, which they define as a comprehensive explanation of reality that determines all their thinking and action, including their legal activism and argumentation. Examination of the historical and philosophical roots of the concept of worldview identified by Christian thinkers reveals two understandings of the concept: an analytic tool for rationally comparing the evidence for different social philosophies, and a pre-theoretical lens that determines what counts as evidence in the first place. Christian conservatives have largely favored the first sense of worldview as a tool to understand issues like sexuality and gender identity in an essentialist way and to demonstrate with foundationalist logic the rational superiority of their legal conclusions about these issues. However, a comparison of the Christian conservative worldview and the queer theory worldview illustrates how this understanding of worldview as a tool fails because there is no neutral perspective outside of any worldview, from which one could examine and compare one to another. The idea of worldview as a pre-theoretical, historically, and socially contingent lens can be more productive. Embracing this notion of worldview in a personalist way is necessary to build a culture of dialogue that uses narrative to pursue the truth while also respecting and honoring the different perspectives from which these narratives are told.

TI  - Analysis of Correlation and Mapping of Chlorophyll-a Concentrations and Sea Surface Temperatures in Coastal Areas Based on Terra MODIS Satellite Image Data
T2  - MAKARA JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems in aquatic environments are distinct from ecosystems on land. Changes that occur in ecosystems in aquatic environments affect the lives of biota in these waters, including the fish used as a food source in fishing communities in coastal areas. This study aims to determine the role of remote sensing in mapping and analyzing the relationship between the parameters of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations on the coast. The correlation of sea surface temperature with chlorophyll-a concentrations is modeled via linear regression. An analysis of variance test is performed to establish the suitability of the temperature data for the data on chlorophyll-a concentrations and to map the concentration distribution with the SeaDAS program. Results revealed a linear Chlor (mg/m(3)) = 63,695 - 2,014T (degrees C) with an R-2 coefficient value of 0.325. This work concludes that Terra MODIS satellite imagery can be used to predict the distribution of chlorophyll-a concentrations on the coast, although its results require further comparison with those of other sensors.

TI  - Differences in the Reaction of North Equatorial Countercurrent to the Developing and Mature Phase of ENSO Events in the Western Pacific Ocean
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) is an eastward zonal current closely related to an El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. This paper investigated the variations of NECC in the Western Pacific Ocean over 25 years (1993-2017) using satellite data provided by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Remote Sensing System (RSS). The first mode of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis showed that the NECC strengthened or weakened in each El Nino (La Nina) event during the developing or mature phase, respectively. We also found that the NECC shifting was strongly coincidental with an ENSO event. During the developing phase of an El Nino (La Nina) event, the NECC shifted southward (northward), and afterward, when it entered the mature phase, the NECC tended to shift slightly northward (southward). Moreover, the NECC strength was found to have undergone a weakening during the 2008-2017 period.

TI  - Comparison of Spaceborne and UAV-Borne Remote Sensing Spectral Data for Estimating Monsoon Crop Vegetation Parameters
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Various remote sensing data have been successfully applied to monitor crop vegetation parameters for different crop types. Those successful applications mostly focused on one sensor system or a single crop type. This study compares how two different sensor data (spaceborne multispectral vs unmanned aerial vehicle borne hyperspectral) can estimate crop vegetation parameters from three monsoon crops in tropical regions: finger millet, maize, and lablab. The study was conducted in two experimental field layouts (irrigated and rainfed) in Bengaluru, India, over the primary agricultural season in 2018. Each experiment contained n = 4 replicates of three crops with three different nitrogen fertiliser treatments. Two regression algorithms were employed to estimate three crop vegetation parameters: leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll concentration, and canopy water content. Overall, no clear pattern emerged of whether multispectral or hyperspectral data is superior for crop vegetation parameter estimation: hyperspectral data showed better estimation accuracy for finger millet vegetation parameters, while multispectral data indicated better results for maize and lablab vegetation parameter estimation. This study's outcome revealed the potential of two remote sensing platforms and spectral data for monitoring monsoon crops also provide insight for future studies in selecting the optimal remote sensing spectral data for monsoon crop parameter estimation.

T2  - CLINICAL ADVANCES IN HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the vast majority of cases, cutaneous melanoma presents as localized disease and is treated with wide excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy, with shared decision making regarding completion lymph node dissection and adjuvant systemic therapy. The treatment of recurrent and in-transit disease is more complex, with further options for regional and systemic therapies and multiple variables to be factored into decisions. Rates of overall and complete response to regional therapies can be quite high in carefully chosen patients, which limits the need for systemic therapies and their inherent side effects. Ongoing trials aim to assess the efficacy of combination regional and systemic therapies and assist in deciding among these options. This review discusses the treatment of primary melanoma and regional nodal disease and offers an in-depth discussion of options for the treatment of recurrent melanoma and in-transit melanoma.

TI  - Using Multi-Angular Hyperspectral Data to Estimate the Vertical Distribution of Leaf Chlorophyll Content in Wheat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heterogeneity exists in the vertical distribution of the biochemical components of crops. A leaf chlorophyll deficiency occurs in the bottom- and middle-layers of crops due to nitrogen stress and leaf senescence. Some studies used multi-angular remote sensing data for estimating the vertical distribution of the leaf chlorophyll content (LCC). However, these studies performed LCC inversion of different vertical layers using a fixed view zenith angle (VZA), but rarely considered the contribution of the components of the non-target layers to the spectral response. The main goal of this work was to determine the LCC of different vertical layers of the canopy of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), using multi-angular remote sensing and spectral vegetation indices. Different combinations of VZAs were used for obtaining the LCC of different layers. The results revealed that the responses of the transformed chlorophyll in reflectance absorption index (TCARI) and modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (MCARI)/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) to the upper-layer LCC were strongest at VZA 10 degrees. For the middle-layer LCC, the response was strongest at 30 degrees, but the response was significantly lower than that of the upper-layer. For the bottom-layer LCC, the responses were weak due to the obscuring effect of the upper- and middle-layer; thus, the LCC inversion of the bottom-layer data was not optimal for a single VZA. The optimal VZA or VZA combinations for LCC estimation were VZA 10 degrees for the upper-layer LCC (TCARI with coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.69, root mean square error (RMSE) = 4.80 ug/cm(2), MCARI/OSAVI with R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 4.17 ug/cm(2)), VZA 10 degrees and 30 degrees for the middle-layer LCC (TCARI with R-2 = 0.17, RMSE = 4.81 ug/cm(2), MCARI/OSAVI with R-2 = 0.17, RMSE = 4.76 ug/cm(2)), and VZA 10 degrees, 30 degrees, and 50 degrees for the bottom-layer LCC (TCARI with R-2 = 0.40, RMSE = 6.29 ug/cm(2), MCARI/OSAVI with R-2 = 0.40, RMSE = 6.36 ug/cm(2)). The proposed observation strategy provided a significantly higher estimation accuracy of the target layer LCC than the single VZA approach, and demonstrated the ability of canopy multi-angular spectral reflectance to accurately estimate the wheat canopy chlorophyll content vertical distribution.

TI  - Role of TRPA1 in Tissue Damage and Kidney Disease
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - TRPA1, a nonselective cation channel, is expressed in sensory afferent that innervates peripheral targets. Neuronal TRPA1 can promote tissue repair, remove harmful stimuli and induce protective responses via the release of neuropeptides after the activation of the channel by chemical, exogenous, or endogenous irritants in the injured tissue. However, chronic inflammation after repeated noxious stimuli may result in the development of several diseases. In addition to sensory neurons, TRPA1, activated by inflammatory agents from some non-neuronal cells in the injured area or disease, might promote or protect disease progression. Therefore, TRPA1 works as a molecular sentinel of tissue damage or as an inflammation gatekeeper. Most kidney damage cases are associated with inflammation. In this review, we summarised the role of TRPA1 in neurogenic or non-neurogenic inflammation and in kidney disease, especially the non-neuronal TRPA1. In in vivo animal studies, TRPA1 prevented sepsis-induced or Ang-II-induced and ischemia-reperfusion renal injury by maintaining mitochondrial haemostasis or via the downregulation of macrophage-mediated inflammation, respectively. Renal tubular epithelial TRPA1 acts as an oxidative stress sensor to mediate hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in vitro and ischaemia-reperfusion-induced kidney injury in vivo through MAPKs/NF-kB signalling. Acute kidney injury (AKI) patients with high renal tubular TRPA1 expression had low complete renal function recovery. In renal disease, TPRA1 plays different roles in different cell types accordingly. These findings depict the important role of TRPA1 and warrant further investigation.

TI  - Identification of Native and Invasive Vegetation Communities in a Tidal Flat Wetland Using Gaofen-1 Imagery
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasion by Spartina alterniflora is widespread in coastal wetlands in China, threatening native vegetation. Obtaining the distribution of native and invasive vegetation at the small community scale is important to understand the invasion mechanism of S. alterniflora and the protection of wetland ecosystems. Remote sensing images can quickly and effectively identify vegetation at a large scale, which can have a considerable influence on the protection of biological diversity. Although Landsat-like space borne sensors have been applied in the monitoring of invasive species in wetlands, their spatial resolutions are often coarser than those of small communities of invasive species. To identify small-scale native (Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter) and invasive (S. alterniflora) vegetation communities around Chongming Island in eastern China, we first investigated the performance of four classifiers based on spectral features. Then, textural features of Gaofen-1 images under an appropriate textural window size were added. Furthermore, a comprehensive classification (CC) method generated by multiple classification features was proposed to obtain a reliable classification, and CC was further improved by considering the properties of neighbouring pixels. The results demonstrated that (i) the random forest (RF) classifier reached a higher overall accuracy (OA) than all the other classifiers; (ii) adding textural features slightly increased the OA, but the production accuracy (PA) for P. australis and the user accuracy (UA) for S. alterniflora decreased; (iii) the CC method improved OA by up to 4.12 %, and accounting for the neighbouring pixels improved the OA to 93.96 %. The comprehensive method effectively improved not only OA but also PA and UA for the vegetation communities, and it can be used in other wetlands.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Change of Phytoplankton Biomass in the East China Sea with MODIS Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - A ten-year chlorophyll-a concentration dataset from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) were used to analyze the variation of phytoplankton biomass and its potential relation with climate in the East China Sea. The result indicated that the phytoplankton biomass generally had a regular pattern every year, and phytoplankton bloom mainly occurred between May and July. The highest phytoplankton biomass appeared near the Yangtze River Estuary. The lowest phytoplankton biomass located near the Taiwan Strait. In general, the starting bloom time was earlier in the south than in the north, and the span time of the former was also longer. During the recent ten years, the phytoplankton biomass around the Yangtze River Estuary decreased obviously. The change of phytoplankton biomass was found to be related with the Nino 3.4 Index. The correlation between the intensity of phytoplankton bloom with the number and square of red tide were 0.63 and 0.74, respectively.

TI  - Wetlands Cool Land Surface Temperature in Tropical Regions but Warm in Boreal Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play a critical role in global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. Regulating the regional climate is one of the most important ecosystem services of natural wetlands. However, the impact of wetlands on local temperature on the global scale and the attribution is still unclear. This study utilizes the satellite-based products (land surface temperature (LST), albedo, and evapotranspiration (ET)) to evaluate the difference in LST between wetlands and their adjacent landcover types and the possible drivers. Here we show that on average for the whole year, wetlands have a cooling effect in tropical regions, but have a warming effect in boreal regions. The impacts of wetlands on LST show great seasonality in the boreal regions; i.e., the wetlands have a warming effect in winter but a cooling effect in summer. The difference in albedo and ET between wetlands and the other landcover types only interprets 30% of temporal variation of the difference in LST. Due to the large water storage in wetlands, the ground heat flux (G) may interpret the rest of the impact, absorbing energy in summer and releasing energy in winter in wetlands, which has often been neglected in previous studies. Our results indicate that it is critical to comprehensively consider the effects of wetland restoration in different regions to realize potential climatic benefits in the future.

TI  - Statistical assessment metrics for InSAR atmospheric correction: Applications to generic atmospheric correction online service for InSAR (GACOS) in Eastern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric effect represents one of the major error sources in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), and its mitigation is found crucial for high-precision InSAR applications. Numerous studies on InSAR atmospheric correction methods and applications covering a wide range of regions worldwide have been reported with varying degrees of success. However, more efforts on the performance assessment are needed, and the conclusions may lack statistical significance due to the limited interferograms involved in most of these analyses. To optimally utilise different InSAR atmospheric correction methods and avoid potential uncertainty caused, appropriate statistical metrics to assess the correction performance must be set up. In this work, we provide a general guideline for statistical assessment of InSAR atmospheric correction. Based on the physical properties of the atmosphere, three metrics are applied: (i) the phase standard deviation which assesses the overall performance of the correction; (ii) the spatial structure function which evaluates the reduction of the long-wavelength atmospheric effect; and (iii) the phase-elevation correlation coefficient which measures the reduction of the stratified component of the atmospheric delay. The performance of the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS) products for two typical terrains in Eastern China is evaluated. Statistical results of the 1250 Sentinel-1 interferograms covering the Yellow River Delta and Shandong hilly region show that (i) GACOS reduces the interferometric phase standard deviation in 84.6% of the interferograms by an average of 36.4%; (ii) the phase decorrelation distance decreases from 321 km to 225 km on average after correction; and (iii) the mean phase-elevation correlation declines by 33.3% for the areas with considerable topographic variations. The results verify the effectiveness of GACOS products in Eastern China for the first time, and the three proposed metrics further characterise the sources of improvement after correction.

TI  - Long-Term and Emergency Monitoring of Zhongbao Landslide Using Space-Borne and Ground-Based InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents the ideal combination of space-borne and ground-based (GB) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) applications. In the absence of early investigation reporting and specialized monitoring, the Zhongbao landslide unexpectedly occurred on 25 July 2020, forming a barrier lake that caused an emergency. As an emergency measure, the GB-InSAR system was installed 1.8 km opposite the landslide to assess real-time cumulative deformation with a monitoring frequency of 3 min. A zone of strong deformation was detected, with 178 mm deformation accumulated within 15 h, and then a successful emergency warning was issued to evacuate on-site personnel. Post-event InSAR analysis of 19 images acquired by the ESA Sentinel-1 from December 2019 to August 2020 revealed that the landslide started in March 2020. However, the deformation time series obtained from satellite InSAR did not show any signs that the landslide had occurred. The results suggest that satellite InSAR is effective for mapping unstable areas but is not qualified for rapid landslide monitoring and timely warning. The GB-InSAR system performs well in monitoring and providing early warning, even with dense vegetation on the landslide. The results show the shortcomings of satellite InSAR and GB-InSAR and a clearer understanding of the necessity of combining multiple monitoring methods.

TI  - Crop Monitoring and Classification Using Polarimetric RADARSAT-2 Time-Series Data Across Growing Season: A Case Study in Southwestern Ontario, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has proven as a very effective technique in agricultural monitoring and crop classification. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of crop monitoring and classification over an agricultural area in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The time-series RADARSAT-2 C-Band PolSAR images throughout the entire growing season were exploited. A set of 27 representative polarimetric observables categorized into ten groups was selected and analyzed in this research. First, responses and temporal evolutions of each of the polarimetric observables over different crop types were quantitatively analyzed. The results reveal that the backscattering coefficients in cross-pol and Pauli second channel, the backscattering ratio between HV and VV channels (HV/VV), the polarimetric decomposition outputs, the correlation coefficient between HH and VV channel rho HHVV, and the radar vegetation index (RVI) show the highest sensitivity to crop growth. Then, the capability of PolSAR time-series data of the same beam mode was also explored for crop classification using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The results using single groups of polarimetric observables show that polarimetric decompositions, backscattering coefficients in Pauli and linear polarimetric channels, and correlation coefficients produced the best classification accuracies, with overall accuracies (OAs) higher than 87%. A forward selection procedure to pursue optimal classification accuracy was expanded to different perspectives, enabling an optimal combination of polarimetric observables and/or multitemporal SAR images. The results of optimal classifications show that a few polarimetric observables or a few images on certain critical dates may produce better accuracies than the whole dataset. The best result was achieved using an optimal combination of eight groups of polarimetric observables and six SAR images, with an OA of 94.04%. This suggests that an optimal combination considering both perspectives may be valuable for crop classification, which could serve as a guideline and is transferable for future research.

TI  - Deriving Non-Cloud Contaminated Sentinel-2 Images with RGB and Near-Infrared Bands from Sentinel-1 Images Based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 images have been widely used in studying land surface phenomena and processes, but they inevitably suffer from cloud contamination. To solve this critical optical data availability issue, it is ideal to fuse Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to create fused, cloud-free Sentinel-2-like images for facilitating land surface applications. In this paper, we propose a new data fusion model, the Multi-channels Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (MCcGAN), based on the conditional generative adversarial network, which is able to convert images from Domain A to Domain B. With the model, we were able to generate fused, cloud-free Sentinel-2-like images for a target date by using a pair of reference Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 images and target-date Sentinel-1 images as inputs. In order to demonstrate the superiority of our method, we also compared it with other state-of-the-art methods using the same data. To make the evaluation more objective and reliable, we calculated the root-mean-square-error (RSME), R2, Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), structural similarity index (SSIM), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the simulated Sentinel-2 images generated by different methods. The results show that the simulated Sentinel-2 images generated by the MCcGAN have a higher quality and accuracy than those produced via the previous methods.

TI  - Assimilating All-sky Infrared Radiances from Himawari-8 Using the 3DVar Method for the Prediction of a Severe Storm over North China
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although radar observations capture storm structures with high spatiotemporal resolutions, they are limited within the storm region after the precipitation formed. Geostationary satellites data cover the gaps in the radar network prior to the formation of the precipitation for the storms and their environment. The study explores the effects of assimilating the water vapor channel radiances from Himawari-8 data with Weather Research and Forecasting model data assimilation system (WRFDA) for a severe storm case over north China. A fast cloud detection scheme for Advanced Himawari imager (AHI) radiance is enhanced in the framework of the WRFDA system initially in this study. The bias corrections, the cloud detection for the clear-sky AHI radiance, and the observation error modeling for cloudy radiance are conducted before the data assimilation. All AHI radiance observations are fully applied without any quality control for all-sky AHI radiance data assimilation. Results show that the simulated all-sky AHI radiance fits the observations better by using the cloud dependent observation error model, further improving the cloud heights. The all-sky AHI radiance assimilation adjusts all types of hydrometeor variables, especially cloud water and precipitation snow. It is proven that assimilating all-sky AHI data improves hydrometeor specifications when verified against the radar reflectivity. Consequently, the assimilation of AHI observations under the all-sky condition has an overall improved impact on both the precipitation locations and intensity compared to the experiment with only conventional and AHI clear-sky radiance data.

TI  - Generating a High-Resolution Time-Series Ocean Surface Net Radiation Product by Downscaling J-OFURO3
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean surface net radiation (R-n) characterizing ocean surface radiation budget is a key variable in ocean climate modeling and analysis. In this study, a downscaling scheme was developed to generate a high-resolution (0.05 degrees) time-series (2002-2013) daily ocean surface R-n from the third-generation Japanese Ocean Flux Data Sets with Use of Remote-Sensing Observations (J-OFURO3) at 0.25 degrees based on the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations (AVH021C) and other ancillary information (Clearness Index and cloud mask). This downscaling scheme includes the statistical downscaling models and the residual correction post-processing. A series of angle-dependent downscaling statistical models were established between the daily ocean surface R-n in J-OFURO3 and the AVHRR TOA data, and then, the residual correction was conducted to the model estimates R-n_AVHRR_est to obtain the final downscaled data set R-n_AVHRR. Validation against the measurements from 57 moored buoy sites in six ocean observing networks shows the high accuracy of the downscaled estimates R-n_AVHRR_est with a R-2 of 0.88, RMSE of 23.44 W.m(-2), and bias of -0.14 W.m(-2) under all-sky condition. The results of the spatio-temporal analysis in R-n_AVHRR and intercomparison with Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) products also indicated that the superior of the R-n_AVHRR with more detailed information especially in the hot spot regions, such as central tropical Pacific (warming pool), Atlantic and Equatorial Eastern Indian Ocean (EIO).

TI  - Evaluation of Cloud Mask and Cloud Top Height from Fengyun-4A with MODIS Cloud Retrievals over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has profound thermal and dynamic influences on the atmospheric circulation, energy, and water cycles of the climate system, which make the clouds over the TP the forefront of atmospheric and climate science. However, the highest altitude and most complex terrain of the TP make the retrieval of cloud properties challenging. In order to understand the performance and limitations of cloud retrievals over the TP derived from the state-of-the-art Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the new generation of Chinese Geostationary (GEO) meteorological satellites Fengyun-4 (FY-4), a three-month comparison was conducted between FY-4A/AGRI and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for both cloud detection and cloud top height (CTH) pixel-level retrievals. For cloud detection, the AGRI and MODIS cloud mask retrievals showed a fractional agreement of 0.93 for cloudy conditions and 0.73 for clear scenes. AGRI tended to miss lower CTH clouds due to the lack of thermal contrast between the clouds and the surface of the TP. For cloud top height retrievals, the comparison showed that on average, AGRI underestimated the CTH relative to MODIS by 1.366 +/- 2.235 km, and their differences presented a trend of increasing with height.

TI  - Exploring conservation strategies for oriental white stork fledglings <i>(Ciconia boyciana)</i> across the breeding wetland landscape: Hints from tracking movement patterns
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore conservation strategies for endangered birds, especially for fledglings during breeding periods, the characteristics of habitat and nest site selection, daily activity pattern, and home range size must be understood. In the spring of 2016, we tracked four oriental white stork (Ciconia boyciana) fledglings' movement patterns in Xingkai Lake National Reserve of Heilongjiang Province in China using miniaturized multi-sensor satellite transmitters from three different artificial nests established in the same wetland fragment. Location information and hourly distance from satellite transmitters were recorded to quantify activity patterns, movement hot spots, and home range size. In this paper, we provide systematic conservation recommendations of oriental white storks with perspective on artificial nests, activity rhythms, and spatial movement patterns in the breeding landscape. Results showed that oriental white stork fledglings were more active during the daytime, significant activity peaks occurred from 03:00-05:00 A.M and from 17:00-19:00 P.M. This suggests that anthropogenic pressure should be reduced or suspended during these activity peaks and captive fledglings should feed following natural rhythms. Fledglings tended to concentrate their movement around two or three hot-spot locations with flat spaces or small ponds and their movement routes between the different hot spots presented different shapes: triangular shape, L shape, and straight line. It is necessary to create enough flat spaces or man-made ponds to support fledglings foraging. The home range area based on 100% Minimum Convex Polygons varied considerably among the four individuals, ranging from 14.79 to 39.40 km(2) during the tracking period. This helps determine the core protection boundary of the fledglings in the breeding habitat fragment. Establishing more artificial nests and improving nests monitoring systems are essential to ensure breeding success. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. CC_BY_NC_ND_4.0

TI  - Tidal Flat Extraction and Change Analysis Based on the RF-W Model: A Case Study of Jiaozhou Bay, East China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal tidal flats are important ecological resources. As the dividing line between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, tidal flats provide a large number of ecosystem services. However, with the excessive development of coastal areas, tidal flat resources have been drastically reduced, leading to the deterioration of coastal ecosystems. There is an urgent need to acquire accurate information on the changes in tidal flat resources. This research proposes a tidal flat extraction model (RF-W model) that combines the random forest (RF) method and waterline method, which aims to improve the accuracy of tidal flat extraction. This method can effectively eliminate the shortcomings of the RF method in determining the lower boundary of tidal flats and those of the waterline method in distinguishing river channels and tidal flats. The tidal flat extraction of Qingdao Jiaozhou Bay in 2020 is performed as an example of the model. The results show that the user's and producer's accuracies of the RF-W model were both the highest, indicating that the improved model can accurately extract tidal flat information. Then, we used the RF-W model to extract tidal flat information for Jiaozhou Bay in seven periods (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020) and to study the spatiotemporal changes in the tidal flats and influencing factors from 1990 to 2020. The tidal flat area of Jiaozhou Bay showed an overall downward trend before 2015, and the area decreased by 21.9 km(2), with a reduction in the rate of approximately 1.1%/year. After 2015, the tidal flat area rebounded slightly. The overall change in Jiaozhou Bay showed reclamation and expansion toward the sea. The reduction in the sand content of the rivers entering the sea, reclamation and cultivation, and land development were the main factors contributing to the reduction in the tidal flat area in Jiaozhou Bay. In addition, sea level rise due to climate warming is a long-term potential factor.

TI  - High-Resolution Monitoring and Assessment of Evapotranspiration and Gross Primary Production Using Remote Sensing in a Typical Arid Region
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP) are critical components in terrestrial ecosystems with water and carbon cycles. Large-scale, high-resolution, and accurately quantified ET and GPP values are important fundamental data for freshwater resource management and help in understanding terrestrial carbon and water cycles in an arid region. In this study, the revised surface energy balance system (SEBS) model and MOD17 GPP algorithm were used to estimate daily ET and GPP at 100 m resolution based on multi-source satellite remote sensing data to obtain surface biophysical parameters and meteorological forcing data as input variables for the model in the midstream oasis area of the Heihe River Basin (HRB) from 2010 to 2016. Then, we further calculated the ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE). We validated the daily ET, GPP, and WUE from ground observations at a crop oasis station and conducted spatial intercomparisons of monthly and annual ET, GPP, and WUE at the irrigation district and cropland oasis scales. The site-level evaluation results show that ET and GPP had better performance than WUE at the daily time scale. Specifically, the deviations in the daily ET, GPP, and WUE data compared with ground observations were small, with a root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 0.75 mm/day and 26.59%, 1.13 gC/m(2) and 36.62%, and 0.50 gC/kgH(2)O and 39.83%, respectively. The regional annual ET, GPP, and WUE varied from 300 to 700 mm, 200 to 650 gC/m(2), and 0.5 to 1.0 gC/kgH(2)O, respectively, over the entire irrigation oasis area. It was found that annual ET and GPP were greater than 550 mm and 500 gC/m(2), and annual oasis cropland WUE had strong invariability and was maintained at approximately 0.85 gC/kgH(2)O. The spatial intercomparisons from 2010 to 2016 revealed that ET had similar spatial patterns to GPP due to tightly coupled carbon and water fluxes. However, the WUE spatiotemporal patterns were slightly different from both ET and GPP, particularly in the early and late growing seasons for the oasis area. Our results demonstrate that spatial full coverage and reasonably fine spatiotemporal variation and variability could significantly improve our understanding of water-saving irrigation strategies and oasis agricultural water management practices in the face of water shortage issues.

T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on light falling net fishery production data from 2 vessels collected from 2013 to 2016 in the South China Sea, and the satellite data of environmental factors, the fishing ground distribution of Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis and its relationships with the spatiotemporal and environmental factorsin the South China Sea is studied using Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The results suggest that the Catch Per Unit Effort(CPUE) of S. oualaniensis in 2013-2014 shows an increasing trend, while significantly declining in 2015-2016. The fishing ground of S. oualaniensis in the South China Sea was mainly located in the waters of [114 degrees E -115 degrees E, 10 degrees N-12 degrees N] in 2013-2015, and turned west in 2016. GAM model shows that the rate of the cumulative deviance explained about CPUE is 66.40%. Four factors, including longitude, latitude, sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a concentration (CHL),have significant effects on the CPUE (P<0.05), the relative importance of them inaffecting the fishing ground of S. oualaniensis can be followed the order of longitude, latitude, CHL and SST. Other factors, such as year, month and sea surface salinity(SSS) do not have significant effects on the CPUE (P>0.05). The optimal environment for S. oualanie ns is is unde r conditions of 27 degrees C similar to 30 degrees C SST and the CHL of 0.10-0.15 mg/m(3).

T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the southwestern Yellow Sea is analyzed based on in situ observations in Augustand September 2018. The in situ data demonstrate an obvious coldwater zone along the Jiangsu Coast in the west of the study area, where the surface DO had slightly higher concentration. In the south of the study area close to the Yangtze River Estuary, the salinity increased from south to north, and the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the upper layer is markedly higher than that in the lower layer. Based on the observation data, CCMP data, and remote sensing data of sea surface temperature and salinity (AVHRR and SMAP), the possible drivers of dissolved oxygen are analyzed preliminarily. Upwelling from the Yellow Sea to the Jiangsu Coast is initiated by the southerly wind in summer, may account for the cold water and the high concentration of DO in this area. The Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW) mainly extends to the southwest Yellow Sea, where the eutrophic conditions may be responsible for the high DO in the upper layer and hypoxia in the bottom layer.

AB  - In the first attempt to configure the Fengyun-3B satellite's Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) radiance data in the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model's Data Assimilation system (WRFDA), the impact of MWRI data assimilation on the analysis and forecast of Typhoon Son-Tinh in 2012 was evaluated with WRFDA's three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) data-assimilation scheme. Compared to a benchmark experiment with no MWRI data, assimilating MWRI radiances improved the analyses of typhoon central sea level pressure (CSLP), warm core structure, and wind speed. Moreover, verified with European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analysis data, significant improvements in model variable forecast, such as geopotential height and specific humidity, were produced. Substantial error reductions in track, CSLP, and maximum-wind-speed forecasts with MWRI assimilation was also obtained from analysis time to 48 h forecast.

TI  - Variation of water body in Dongting Lake from in situ measurements and MODIS observations in recent decades
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of the water body in Dongting Lake, the second largest freshwater lake in China, is crucial for water resource management. In this study, the variations of the water body were comprehensively analyzed based on remote sensing images and in situ measurements from 2000 to 2019. Four breakpoint detection approaches were integrated to analyze the change trends and explore the related driving forces behind the changes. The results showed that significant intra- and inter-annual fluctuations of the water body were found from 2000 to 2019. The water area and volume decreased at rates of 1.26 km(2)/a and 16.65 x 10(6) m(3)/a, respectively. During the entire study period, the outflow at Chenglingji station (CLJ), the inflow from three outlets of the Yangtze River (Inflow2), and the inundation conditions during the last period (Area(lag)) made the largest relative contributions to the water area variation (around 25%, 27% and 24%, respectively). A breakpoint was detected around 2004, corresponding to the operation period of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The regulation of TGD profoundly affected the hydrological characteristics at the three outlets and CLJ, and may have indirectly caused the water area to expand by 2.41 km(2)/a during the dry seasons between 2004 and 2019. These results provide valuable insight into how natural and anthropogenic factors affect water body variation and may offer a practical reference for the local government to adjust management strategies.

TI  - Spatial Pattern Change and Ecosystem Service Value Dynamics of Ecological and Non-Ecological Redline Areas in Nanjing, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological conservation red line (ECRL) is gaining increasing academic attention as delimiting the minimum space scope of ecological protection and the bottom line of ecological security. Taking Nanjing as a case study, we divided the territory into ecological and non-ecological redline areas (ERAs and NERAs, respectively). This paper highlights two key research issues based on the 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 annual remote sensing data: (i) quantitative analysis of the Ecological Redline Policy (ERP) validity by conducting a horizontal comparison of the ERAs and NERAs; and (ii) exploration of the land-use transitions and spatial pattern changes affecting ecosystem service value (ESV). Results showed that delineating ECRL could effectively slow down the decline rate of ESV. The trend of eco-quality deterioration was greater than eco-quality improvement in Nanjing, presenting an ESV that declined slightly in the whole. According to our findings, we suggest that reasonably increasing eco-lands (woodland and water area) and decreasing construction land will enhance the regional ESV. Meanwhile, promoting the transition from production space to ecological space and depressing the encroachment of living space on other space types, will be instrumental in mitigating the ESV decline. The results of this study are expected to provide valuable implications for spatial planning and sustainable development in Nanjing.

Although meteorological satellite-based imager derived winds by tracking the motion of characteristic targets in continuous cloud field images is an effective observation method that has improved numerical weather prediction forecasts on both regional and global scales, an error still exists in the ambiguity of the vector height assignment. Satellite-based infrared hyperspectral sounder has the capability of atmospheric vertical detection of temperature and humidity profiles, which can provide more accurate vector height assignment of wind field by analyzing atmospheric motion vectors among multiple vertical layers, improving the ambiguity of the vector height assignment. We proposed a method of tropospheric 3D winds measurement on cross-platform polar meteorological satellite-based infrared hyperspectral sounders of FY-3D/HIRAS and NOAA-20/CrIS, collocated vapor channel images through nadir overpass observations of both instruments, derived wind field by calculating the motion of dense optical flow field, combined ERA-Interim reanalysis data to verify the mean absolute deviation(MAE) and root mean square error(RMSE) of wind speed and the MAE of wind direction after quality control. The vertical wind fields of 200, 300, 400, 600, 650 and 1 000 hPa are calculated through observations of HIRAS and CrIS at 00:00, 06:00 and 12:00 UTC on February 20, 2019, the results show that, the trend of the variation of wind speed range is consistent with ERA-Interim reanalysis data, the wind speed range decreases as the height decreases, the upper layers are more sensitive to wind speeds above 20 m.s(-1), while wind speeds measured near the surface are concentrated within 10 m.s(-1). The MAE of wind speed is mostly less than 3 m.s(-1) while the maximum value is less than 4 m.s(-1), the RMSE of wind speed is mostly less than 3.5 m.s(-1) while the maximum value is less than 4.5 m.s(-1), the MAE of wind direction is mostly less than 30 while the maximum value is less than 40. The wind field error mainly comes from the observation deviation of radiation data due to different instrument parameters, along with the positioning deviation of data image re-projection due to different spatial resolution.

TI  - Recovery: Fast and Slow-Vegetation Response During the 2012-2016 California Drought
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2012-2016 California Drought severely impacted natural vegetation across a wide range of environmental gradient. Although several studies have reported an increase in plant water stress and mortality, the spatiotemporal variations of ecosystem productivity responses and the associated environmental and biological drivers remain unclear. Here, using Enhanced Vegetation Index from the Moderate resolution imaging spectrometer, we found that 45% of the natural ecosystems showed an abrupt change (breakpoint [BP]) in productivity during 2012-2016. There were three major contrasting temporal patterns of productivity responses: (i) a steady increase under higher temperature followed by a decline due to accumulated moisture depletion (high elevation forest) or temperature decrease (high elevation nonforest), (ii) gradual decline during the drought followed by a rapid recovery within 1 year after drought stress was partially relieved, and (iii) both a gradual decline and an abrupt decline. The magnitude of abrupt changes was negatively correlated (r = -0.80, p < 0.001) with initial gradual changes. Overall, changes during BP offset, on average, 57% of the preceding gradual responses. The spatial variability in ecosystem response patterns is driven by both environmental and biological factors. Particularly, for forests, positive BP was driven by increasing rainfall and decreasing temperature, while negative BP was mainly driven by the precipitation anomaly. By 2019, 33% of the natural vegetation have recovered to the level of EVI in 2010. Ecosystem responses to multiyear droughts can influence ecosystem dynamics in a complex pattern. Multiple ecohydrological factors should be considered to understand and predict the long-term drought impacts on ecosystems.

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimation of the Influence of Land Use and Cover Change on the Surface Shortwave Radiation Budget in a Humid Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface shortwave radiation budget (Rsn) is one of the main drivers of Earth's ecosystems and varies with atmospheric and surface conditions. Land use and cover change (LUCC) alters radiation through biogeophysical effects. However, due to the complex interactions between atmospheric and surface factors, it is very challenging to quantify the sole impacts of LUCC. Based on satellite data from the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) Product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, this study introduces an observation-based approach for detecting LUCC influences on the Rsn by examining a humid basin over the Dongting Lake Basin, China from 2001 to 2015. Our results showed that the Rsn of the study area presented a decreasing trend due to the combined effects of LUCC and climate change. Generally, LUCC contributed -0.45 W/m(2) to Rsn at the basin scale, which accounted for 2.53% of the total Rsn change. Furthermore, the LUCC contributions reached -0.69 W/m(2), 0.21 W/m(2), and -0.41 W/m(2) in regions with land transitions of forest -> grass, grass -> forest, and grass -> farmland, which accounted for 5.38%, -4.68%, and 2.40% of the total Rsn change, respectively. Physically, LUCC affected surface radiation by altering the surface properties. Specifically, LUCC induced albedo changes of +0.0039 at the basin scale and +0.0061, -0.0020, and +0.0036 in regions with land transitions of forest -> grass, grass -> forest, and grass -> farmland, respectively. Our findings revealed the impact and process of LUCC on the surface radiation budget, which could support the understanding of the physical mechanisms of LUCC's impact on ecosystems.

TI  - Changes in Land-Use and Ecosystem Service Value in Guangdong Province, Southern China, from 1990 to 2018
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use/cover is one of the major factors that affect the ecosystem and the services it provides. The impact of land-use change on ecosystem service value is a hotspot in developing countries, especially China-a region with rapid economic development and rapid population growth. As the leading area of China's reform and opening-up, Guangdong province in southern China is subjected to land-use conversion that significantly alters the capacity of natural ecosystem to provide ecosystem services supporting human well-being. We analyzed the characteristics of land-use changes from 1990 to 2018 using the four-phase land-use data interpreted from Landsat satellite images. We estimated the ecosystem service value through a well-established benefit transfer method using modified local value coefficients, analyzed the trade-offs and synergies among ecosystem services through ecosystem service trade-off degree, and compared the relationship between ecosystem services value, economic development, and population in Guangdong province. The results indicated that the following: (1) Built-Up Area drastically expanded from 6783.1 km(2) in 1990 to 13,142.0 km(2) in 2018 (93.7%), especially in the Pearl River Delta, where the growth rate of Built-Up Area expansion was up to 169.0%. The other land-use types were all contracted as Cropland (-10.9%), Forestland (-1.0%), Grassland (-4.0%), Water Body (-2.1%), and Unused Land (-24.4%). (2) Total ecosystem service value decreased from US$121,666 billion in 1990 to US$116,432 billion in 2018 (-4.3%). Cropland, Forestland, and Water Body played the most important roles for the total ecosystem service value. Water supply experienced the largest declines in ecosystem services value (US$ -1866.3 million, -10.1%), followed by waste treatment (7.6%) and gas regulation (-4.9%). (3) Synergy was the dominant relationship among ecosystem services. The above results can not only serve as reference case for other provinces/regions/countries/ to carry out relevant research work but also provide much focus on land-use planning to manage the impacts of land-use change on regional ecosystem services function.

TI  - Decision-Level and Feature-Level Integration of Remote Sensing and Geospatial Big Data for Urban Land Use Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about urban land use is important for urban planning and sustainable development. The emergence of geospatial big data (GBD), increased the availability of remotely sensed (RS) data and the development of new methods for data integration to provide new opportunities for mapping types of urban land use. However, the modes of RS and GBD integration are diverse due to the differences in data, study areas, classifiers, etc. In this context, this study aims to summarize the main methods of data integration and evaluate them via a case study of urban land use mapping in Hangzhou, China. We first categorized the RS and GBD integration methods into decision-level integration (DI) and feature-level integration (FI) and analyzed their main differences by reviewing the existing literature. The two methods were then applied for mapping urban land use types in Hangzhou city, based on urban parcels derived from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network, 10 m Sentinel-2A images, and points of interest (POI). The corresponding classification results were validated quantitatively and qualitatively using the same testing dataset. Finally, we illustrated the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches via bibliographic evidence and quantitative analysis. The results showed that: (1) The visual comparison indicates a generally better performance of DI-based classification than FI-based classification; (2) DI-based urban land use mapping is easy to implement, while FI-based land use mapping enables the mixture of features; (3) DI-based and FI-based methods can be used together to improve urban land use mapping, as they have different performances when classifying different types of land use. This study provides an improved understanding of urban land use mapping in terms of the RS and GBD integration strategy.

TI  - Spatial and transient modelling of land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics in a Sahelian landscape under semi-arid climate in northern Burkina Faso
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sahelian landscapes have gone through rapid changes over the past decades under high pressure from an evergrowing population, climate hazards and land degradation. Understanding drivers of change and forecasting LULC dynamics in time and space are critical for sustainable land management. This research aimed at analyzing LULC patterns and forecasting future changes in the landscape at the watershed level in semi-arid climate in northern Burkina Faso. Three LULC categories (natural vegetation, degradation soils, and cultivated areas) were considered. Seasonal vegetation dynamics were assessed through the monitoring of radiometric indices over the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. The post-harvest period (October-November) was found to be optimal for single-date LULC mapping. Furthermore, LULC maps for 1986, 1999, 2009 and 2017 were produced through a supervised classification of Landsat satellite images. For land change modelling and prediction, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network was calibrated between 1999 and 2009 and validated against 2017 reference map, then used to simulate prediction maps for 2030 and 2050, in conjunction with population growth forecasts. Analysis of LULC changes revealed degradation soils were the major contributor to cultivated areas expansion between 1986 and 2017. Land use maps predicted for 2030 and 2050 indicated an expected increase in cultivated areas of 10.4 % and 22.7 % respectively. These results highlight the strength of the human-environment relationship in the watershed and call for careful planning and conservation actions for a sustainable balance between sustainable agricultural production and natural resources conservation.

TI  - A Study on Photovoltaic Panel Monitoring Using Sentinel-1 InSAR Coherence
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Photovoltaic panels are hazardous electronic waste that has heavy metal as one of the hazardous components. Each year, hazardous electronic waste is increasing worldwide and every heavy rainfall exposes the photovoltaic panel to become the source of heavy metal soil contamination. the development needs a monitoring technology for this hazardous exposure. this research use relationships between SAR temporal baseline and coherence of Sentinel-1 satellite to detected photovoltaic panel. Also, the photovoltaic plant detection tested using the difference between that photovoltaic panel and the other difference surface of coherence. The author tested the photovoltaic panel and its environment to calculate differences in coherence relationships. As a result of the experiment, the coherence of the photovoltaic panel, which is assumed to be a permanent scatterer, shows a bias that is biased toward a median value of 0.53 with a distribution of 0.50 to 0.65. Therefore, further research is needed to improve errors that may occur during processing. Additionally, the author found that the change detection using a temporal baseline is possible as the rate of reduction of coherence of photovoltaic panels differs from those of artificial objects such as buildings. This result could be an efficient way to continuously monitor regardless of weather conditions, which was a limitation of the existing optical satellite image-based photovoltaic panel detection research and to understand the spatial distribution in situations such as photovoltaic panel loss.

TI  - Modeling Soil Moisture from Multisource Data by Stepwise Multilinear Regression: An Application to the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to integrate multisource data to model the relative soil moisture (RSM) over the Chinese Loess Plateau in 2017 by stepwise multilinear regression (SMLR) in order to improve the spatial coverage of our previously published RSM. First, 34 candidate variables (12 quantitative and 22 dummy variables) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and topographic, soil properties, and meteorological data were preprocessed. Then, SMLR was applied to variables without multicollinearity to select statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) variables. After the accuracy assessment, monthly, seasonal, and annual spatial patterns of RSM were mapped at 500 m resolution and evaluated. The results indicate that there was a high potential of SMLR to model RSM with the desired accuracy (best fit of the model with Pearson's r = 0.969, root mean square error = 0.761%, and mean absolute error = 0.576%) over the Chinese Loess Plateau. The variables of elevation (0-500 m and 2000-2500 m), precipitation, soil texture of loam, and nighttime land surface temperature can continuously be used in the regression models for all seasons. Including dummy variables improved the model fit both in calibration and validation. Moreover, the SMLR-modeled RSM achieved better spatial coverage than that of the reference RSM for almost all periods. This is a significant finding as the SMLR method supports the use of multisource data to complement and/or replace coarse resolution satellite imagery in the estimation of RSM.

TI  - Water balance and influence mechanism analysis: a case study of Hongjiannao Lake, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hongjiannao groundwater exchange was the largest desert freshwater lake in China (57.25 km(2) in 1986). However, it shrank sharply over the past 34a (1986-2019), with the smallest lake area 31.41 km(2) in 2015. The objective of this study was to use the Landsat images, ASTER GDEM V2 data, and meteorology and statistics data, in combination with the water balance model to calculate the dynamics of water balance elements, quantify and characterize the interannual variations in lake-groundwater exchanges, and analyze its influencing factors by using the geographical detector. The results showed that in the stable stage (1986-1997), the average rate of the lake area, water level, and lake volume change was -0.26 km(2)/a, -0.0483 m/a, and -0.0009 km(3)/a, respectively. Precipitation, river inflow, and groundwater were 0.0203 km(3), 0.0485 km(3), and 0.0098 km(3), which accounts for the whole input were 25.83%, 61.70%, and 12.47%, respectively; evaporation was 0.0786 km(3). In the reduction stage (1998-2015), the average rate of the lake area, water level, and lake volume change was -1.21 km(2)/a, -0.2422 m/a, and -0.0101 km(3)/a, respectively. Before 2006, precipitation, river inflow, and groundwater were 0.0154 km(3), 0.0475 km(3), and -0.0025 km(3), respectively; from 2006 to 2009, precipitation, river inflow, and groundwater were 0.0143 km(3), 0.0334 km(3), and 0.0058 km(3), respectively; after 2009, precipitation, river inflow, and groundwater were 0.0139 km(3), 0.0199 km(3), and 0.0085 km(3), respectively. Evaporation decreased from 0.0714 to 0.0480 km(3) from 1998 to 2015. In the growth stage (2016-2019), the average rate of the lake area, water level, and lake volume change were 1.38 km(2)/a, 0.27 m/a, and 0.0088 km(3)/a, respectively. Precipitation, river inflow, and groundwater were 0.0209 km(3), 0.0005 km(3), and 0.0373 km(3), which accounts for the whole input were 46.63%, 52.12%, and 1.25%, respectively; evaporation was 0.0187 km(3). Compared with the stable stage, groundwater in the growth stage reduced from 12.47% (0.0098 km(3)) to only 1.25% (0.0005 km(3)). From 1998 to 2004, Hongjiannao Lake experienced continuous losing conditions (discharge from the lake to groundwater), with a variable exchange volume of up to -0.01582 km(3) in 1999. Through geographical detector analysis, it was found that temperature was the dominant factor from 1988 to 1997, while human factors were the dominant factors from 1998 to 2015.

TI  - Hotspot analysis of spatial distribution of algae blooms in small and medium water bodies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive land use favors eutrophication processes and algae bloom proliferation in freshwaters, which is considered to be one of the main environmental issues worldwide. In general, and particularly in South America, inland water monitoring only covers the main water bodies due to the high costs and efforts involved. In order to improve the coverage of spatial and temporal of algae bloom monitoring, remote sensing serves as an alternative tool. Thereby, the analysis of significant spatial clusters of high values (hotspots) and low values (coldspots) of chlorophyll-a has been applied in coastal studies; however, at present, there are no studies in freshwaters. In this study, Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis was applied to detect spatial distribution patterns of algae bloom dynamics in small- and medium-sized freshwater bodies. Four in situ samplings were carried out in five suburban lakes of Uruguay, in agreement with the satellite capture. Total and cyanobacterial chlorophyll-a concentration, and suspended solids were evaluated. Linear models were developed by combining pre-established indexes with additional Sentinel-2 spectral bands and in situ data. The relationship between red and red edge regions allowed mapping the chlorophyll-a in the study lakes with an adjustment of R-2=0.83. Hotspot analysis was performed with the selected linear model, and significant chlorophyll-a variability within each lake was successfully detected. The novel application of hotspots analyses presented in this work represents a contribution to advance knowledge in the remote detection of algae bloom dynamics and improve monitoring capabilities of inland water bodies.

TI  - Arctic Sea X-band Microwave Emission Modeling Based on Satellite Data: Considering the Measurement Angle
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean X-band microwave emission model for modeling measurements of satellite radiometers over the cold Arctic seas at an observation angle of 65 degrees is proposed. The model is based on the experimental geophysical model function (GMF) of microwave emission dependence on surface wind speed for an angle of 55 degrees, that was developed from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) measurements and the two-scale theory of the ocean microwave radiation. The experimental GMF is derived from the comparison of AMSR2 measurements over the Arctic seas with surface wind speeds retrieved from these data. The model is limited by wind speed of 15 m/s and does not take into account the foam emission. The model allows discriminating between longwave and shortwave wind-induced microwave radiation and using the presented approach to proceed to the observation angle of the MTVZA-GYa (temperature and humidity atmospheric sounding unit) microwave radiometer on board the Meteor-M Russian polar orbiting satellites.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of burned areas, fire drivers, and fire probability across the equatorial Andes
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-based fire studies in the equatorial Andes indicate that fires are strongly associated with biophysical and anthropogenic variables. However, fire controls and fire regimes at the regional scale remain undocumented. Therefore, this paper describes spatial and temporal burned-area patterns, identifies biophysical and anthropogenic fire drivers, and quantifies fire probability across 6 degrees of latitude and 3 degrees of longitude in the equatorial Andes. The spatial and temporal burned-area analysis was carried out based on 18 years (2001-2018) of the MCD64A1 MODIS burned-area product. Climate, topography, vegetation, and anthropogenic variables were integrated in a logistic regression model to identify the significance of explanatory variables and determine fire occurrence probability. A total of 5779 fire events were registered during the 18 years of this study, located primarily along the western cordillera of the Andes and spreading from North to South. Eighty-eight percent of these fires took place within two fire hotspots located in the northwestern and southwestern corners of the study area. Ninety-nine percent occurred during the second part of the year, between June and December. The largest density of fires was primarily located on herbaceous vegetation and shrublands. Results show that mean monthly temperature, precipitation and NDVI during the pre-fire season, the location of land cover classes such as forest and agriculture, distance to roads and urban areas, slope, and aspect were the most important determinants of spatial and temporal fire distribution. The logistic regression model achieved a good accuracy in predicting fire probability (80%). Probability was higher in the southwestern and northern corners of the study area, and lower towards the north in the western and eastern piedmonts of the Andes. This analysis contributes to the understanding of fires in mountains within the tropics. The results here presented have the potential to contribute to fire management and control in the region.

TI  - A Novel Strategy to Reconstruct NDVI Time-Series with High Temporal Resolution from MODIS Multi-Temporal Composite Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices (VIs) data derived from satellite imageries play a vital role in land surface vegetation and dynamic monitoring. Due to the excessive noises (e.g., cloud cover, atmospheric contamination) in daily VI data, temporal compositing methods are commonly used to produce composite data to minimize the negative influence of noise over a given compositing time interval. However, VI time series with high temporal resolution were preferred by many applications such as vegetation phenology and land change detections. This study presents a novel strategy named DAVIR-MUTCOP (DAily Vegetation Index Reconstruction based on MUlti-Temporal COmposite Products) method for normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series reconstruction with high temporal resolution. The core of the DAVIR-MUTCOP method is a combination of the advantages of both original daily and temporally composite products, and selecting more daily observations with high quality through the temporal variation of temporally corrected composite data. The DAVIR-MUTCOP method was applied to reconstruct high-quality NDVI time-series using MODIS multi-temporal products in two study areas in the continental United States (CONUS), i.e., three field experimental sites near Mead, Nebraska from 2001 to 2012 and forty-six AmeriFlux sites evenly distributed across CONUS from 2006 to 2010. In these two study areas, the DAVIR-MUTCOP method was also compared to several commonly used methods, i.e., the Harmonic Analysis of Time-Series (HANTS) method using original daily observations, Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering using daily observations with cloud mask products as auxiliary data, and SG filtering using temporally corrected composite data. The results showed that the DAVIR-MUTCOP method significantly improved the temporal resolution of the reconstructed NDVI time series. It performed the best in reconstructing NDVI time-series across time and space (coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.93 similar to 0.94) between reconstructed NDVI and ground-observed LAI). DAVIR-MUTCOP method presented the highest robustness and accuracy with the change of the filtering parameter (R-2 = 0.99 similar to 1.00, bias = 0.001, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.020). Only MODIS data were used in this study; nevertheless, the DAVIR-MUTCOP method proposed a universal and potential way to reconstruct daily time series of other VIs or from other operational sensors, e.g., AVHRR and VIIRS.

TI  - Compact Polarimetry Synthetic Aperture Radar Ocean Wind Retrieval: Model Development and Validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed C-band compact polarimetry geophysical model functions for RADARSAT Constellation Mission ocean surface wind speed retrieval. A total of 1594 RADARSAT-2 images acquired in quad-polarization SAR imaging mode were collocated with in situ buoy observations. This dataset is first used to simulate compact polarimetric data and to examine their dependencies on radar incidence angle and wind vectors. We find that right circular transmit, right circular receive (RR-pol) radar backscatters are less sensitive to incidence angles and wind directions but are more dependent on wind speeds, compared to right circular transmit, horizontal receive (RH-pol), right circular transmit, vertical receive (RV-pol), and right circular transmit, left circular receive (RL-pol). Subsequently, the matchup data pairs are used to derive the coefficients of the transfer functions for the proposed compact polarimetric geophysical model (CMOD) functions, and to validate the associated wind speed retrieval accuracy. Statistical comparisons show that the retrieved wind speeds from CMODRH, CMODRV, CMODRL, and CMODRR are in good agreement with buoy measurements, with root-mean-square errors of 1.38, 1.51, 1.47, and 1.25 m s(-1), respectively. The results suggest that compact polarimetry is a good alternative to linear polarization for wind speed retrieval. CMODRR is more appropriate to retrieve high wind speeds than CMODRH, CMODRV or CMODRL.

TI  - Monitoring Dynamic Evolution of the Glacial Lakes by Using Time Series of Sentinel-1A SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an approach with great potential, the interpretation of space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has been applied for monitoring the dynamic evolution of the glacial lakes in recent years. Considering unfavorable factors, such as inherent topography-induced effects and speckle noise in SAR images, it is challenging to accurately map and track the dynamic evolution of the glacial lakes by using multi-temporal SAR images. This paper presents an improved neighborhood-based ratio method utilizing a time series of SAR images to identify the boundaries of the glacial lakes and detect their spatiotemporal changes. The proposed method was applied to monitor the dynamic evolution of the two glacial lakes with periodic water discharge at the terminus of the Gongba Glacier in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau by utilizing 144 Sentinel-1A SAR images collected between October of 2014 and November of 2020. We first generated the reference intensity image (RII) by averaging all the SAR images collected when the water in the glacial lakes was wholly discharged, then calculated the neighborhood-based ratio between RII and each SAR intensity image, and finally identified the boundaries of the glacial lakes by a ratio threshold determined statistically. The time series of areas of the glacial lakes were estimated in this way, and the dates for water recharging and discharging were accordingly determined. The testing results showed that the water of the two glacial lakes began to be recharged in April and reached their peak in August and then remained stable dynamically until they began to shrink in October and were discharged entirely in February of the following year. We observed the expansion process with annual growth rates of 3.19% and 12.63% for these two glacial lakes, respectively, and monitored a glacial lake outburst flood event in July 2018. The validation by comparing with the results derived from Sentinel-2A/B optical images indicates that the accuracy for identifying the boundaries of the glacial lakes with Sentinel-1A SAR images can reach up to 96.49%. Generally, this contribution demonstrates the reliability and precision of SAR images to provide regular updates for the dynamic monitoring of glacial lakes.

TI  - An Improved Two-Step Multitemporal SAR Interferometry Method for Precursory Slope Deformation Detection Over Nanyu Landslide
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A major landslide in Nanyu township, Zhouqu county, Western China, occurred on July 12, 2018, causing widespread damage and blocking the Bailong river. As a widely used surface deformation measurement technique, persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) method fails in the precursory slope deformation detection over Nanyu landslide for two reasons: the high rate slope deformation of the landslide body before the occurrence of the disaster and the low density of measurement points in the widespread nonurban regions over hillside area. To solve these problems, a two-step multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MTInSAR) method is proposed in this letter. In the proposed method, first, a carefully designed small baseline subsets (SBASs) method is applied to extract the linear high rate deformation component, which is then subtracted from the wrapping interferogram to reduce the likelihood of signal aliasing. In the second step, a two-tier network-based MTInSAR method by exploiting both persistent scatterers (PSs) and distributed scatterers (DSs) is employed to retrieve the residual deformation. The proposed method is applied to 47 Sentinel-1 images acquired between December 2016 and July 2018 and successfully detects the precursory deformation over Nanyu landslide for the first time. Experiment results illustrate the advantage of the proposed method for measuring high rate deformation compared with the traditional PSI. By using the proposed algorithm, the deformation rate map shows a clear landslide boundary and precursors of the rapid slope movements with a maximum displacement rate of 483 mm/year along the line of sight of the satellite.

TI  - Relationship between Near-Surface Winds Due to Tropical Cyclones and Infrared Brightness Temperature Obtained from Geostationary Satellite
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on ten-year tropical cyclones (TCs) observations from 2009 to 2018, the black body temperature (TBB, also called cloud-top brightness temperature) data obtained from the infrared channel 1 (with the wavelength of 10.30-11.30 mu m) of the FY-2 satellite image, and the wind observation data at the automatic weather stations (AWSs) in Guangdong province, this study explores the relationship between the TBBs and the winds induced by TCs at AWSs. It is found that the wind speeds at AWSs cannot be obtained directly by using TBB value inversion, but the maximum potential wind gust (MPG) and the maximum potential average-wind (MPAW) at AWSs can be estimated when a TBB is known. Influenced by the terrain, the surrounding environment, and detected height, the MPG and the MPAW values of different AWSs may differ for the same TBB. The wind data from ERA5 reanalysis is also used to explore the relationship between the TBBs and the winds over grids area during the TCs' periods. Similar to the AWSs, there is a capping function between the winds over the grids and the TBBs. The reanalysis data can generally show the average wind conditions of the weather stations inside the grids, and therefore, can be used to supplement the data for the areas where there is no AWS observation available. Such a study could provide references for estimating the potential wind disasters induced by TCs in the study area.

TI  - Near-Infrared Comb Spectroscopy Technology Based on Flat Coherent Supercontinuum
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Optical frequency comb ( OFC) is a coherent light source with excellent time-frequency stability. In frequency domain, an OFC is a set of frequency comb teeth with narrow linewidth and equidistant distribution. Because of this characteristic, the OFC has revolutionized the approach to molecular spectroscopy, making it possible to simultaneously and rapidly measure hundreds of molecular spectral lines with high resolution. The OFC spectroscopy technology has become a hot spot in the field of spectral technology, and has promoted the technological changes in the fields of optical coherence tomography, trace analysis and optical remote sensing. However, due to the limitation of the light source gain bandwidth, the comb spectrum is still unable to compare with the traditional Fourier transform spectroscopy technology in ultra-wideband spectrum measurement, which limits its applications in, such as chemical analysis and atmospheric environment monitoring. At present, supercontinuum ( SC) generation technology is the main way to expand the spectral width of light sources. However, the strong nonlinear effect and phase modulation instability inside nonlinear fibers will not only cause strong amplitude oscillation and jitter of SC spectrum, but also introduce additional phase (frequency) noise, resulting in obvious decoherence. These problems seriously limit the application of SC generation technology in comb and spectrum measurement. Here, the generation of near infrared SC comb with high coherence and flat spectrum is investigated. The coherence is confirmed by beat note measurements and nonlinear Schrodinger equation ( NLSE) based numerical simulation. The source could be useful for broadband gas sensing in monitoring of electrical installations. s First, an erbium -doped fiber comb is harnessed for producing a flat SC with spectral coverage of 12501900 nm in a high nonlinear dispersion shifted fiber( HNL-DSF). A home-made nonlinear-polarization-rotation (NPR) mode-locked fiber laser comb delivered a train of 650 fs pulses at a repetition rate of 54. 5 MHz with 10 mW of average output power (Fig. 1). The output pulses are temporally chirped with a 2 m -long single mode fiber (SMF) and then amplified by a bidirectional pumped erbium-doped fiber amplifier ( EDFA) with an output power up to 100 mW. The EDFA also behaves as a fiber compressor, producing pulses of sub-100 fs which is directly injected into a 200 m-long HNL-DSF (Yofc) for SC generation with a flat spectral profile. The HNL-DSF had a zero dispersion wavelength around 1550 nm ( dispersion slope of 0. 03 ps/( nm2 " km); loss coefficient <1. 5 dB/km; nonlinear coefficient >10 W-1 " km -1). Second, beat note measurements between the original spectrum ( and SC) and two stable continuous-wave (CW) lasers at 1550.5 nm or 1535.4 nm are performed for confirming the coherence of the SC. For investigating the coherence beyond the CW laser wavelengths, numerical simulation is performed, revealing pulse propagation inside the fiber, by solving NLSE using split step Fourier method. Wide-band first-order spectral coherence is confirmed. Finally, the SC is launched for spectral measurements of a mixed gas sample, containing HF (6666.1 Pa), 12 CO ( 19998. 3 Pa), 12 e2 Hz ( 6666. 1 Pa), and the natural water vapor in the laboratory. The measurements are carried out with a home-made Fourier-transform spectrometer at a spectral resolution of 0.1 cm -1. The temperature is 297 K.Results and Discussions In the experiment, a broadband SC comb, spectrally spanning from 1250-1900 nm (Fig. 2) with good flatness around 1400 nm and 1800 nm, is achieved in a piece of DSF. The high coherence of SC is verified by theoretical simulation and experimental measurements. Simulation results show that the SC comb had a high coherence, g (w) 1, and low phase noise (<10 mrad) over a wide spectral range (Fig. 3). Experimentally, the beat notes between the 1550. 5 nm/1535. 4 nm laser and the comb and SC show linewidths at 3 dB of (2.7 1. 0) kHz/(2. 0 1. 0) kHz and ( 2. 6 1. 0) kHz/ ( 1. 8 1. 0) kHz, respectively ( Fig. 4). No obvious linewidth broadening is found, indicating the coherence remain unchanged in the nonlinear spectral broadening process. The absorption peak of water vapor in the near infrared region is measured around 1365 nm (Fig. 5). HzMeanwhile, the transition lines for HF ( around 1300 nm), 12CO (1580 nm), 12 e2 ri2 (1560 nm) are measured simultaneously. For spectroscopic validation, the results of HF are compared with the simulation based on the parameters given by the HITRAN2012 database. The experimental results are consistent with the simulation results (deviation less than 1.6%, as shown in Fig. 6), indicating that the SC comb could be an excellent light source for multi-gas sensing as required by monitoring of electrical power equipment.Conclusions In conclusion, ultra -broadband near-infrared SC generation is performed using a dispersion shifted high nonlinear fiber, pumped by 1.55 ttm comb pulses. The excellent flatness and coherence of SC are investigated by numerical simulation and experimental beat-note measurements. As a result, high spectral coherence and low phase noise ( <10 mrad) are demonstrated for a wide spectral coverage. Particularly, the beat note linewidths between the initial comb and SC with two CW lasers confirm that the phase noise induced by the DSF, to a certain extent, is negligible, comparing to the comb line spacing (54.5 MHz). Furthermore, based on the SC comb source, Fourier transformed frequency comb spectroscopy is carried out for measuring ultra -broadband and high-resolution molecular spectra of mixed gases ( HF,12 C2 H2 12 CO NH2 0). The experiment data are consistent with that simulated in HITRAN2012 database with standard deviation of less than 1.. We believe that flat SC based frequency comb spectroscopy will provide a promising approach for multi-gas sensing with high precision and high resolution.

TI  - Understanding Urban Land Growth through a Social-Spatial Perspective
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the urbanization process, it is essential to detect urban spatial growth and to study relations with social development. In this study, we take Wuhan as a case to examine urban land growth patterns and how social factors relate to the urban land evolution between 1990, 2000, and 2010. We first classify land cover using Landsat images and examine the urban growth patterns during various stages based on landscape metrics regarding the area, density, and shape. Afterwards, principal component analysis and census data are used to extract key social factors. Thirdly, we apply geographically weighted regression (GWR) to depict the link between urban land metrics and social factors. The results indicate that the urban land coalescence and diffusion simultaneously exist, for which redevelopment, infilling, and edge expansion dominate the city center, and diffusion dominates the peripheral areas. The social factors have global regression relationships with urban land areas while local spatial non-stationarity presents in the relationships with the urban land patch shape irregularities. Industrial upgrading, educational levelling up, and population aging show significant with local heterogeneities in the relationships. The simulation of the relationship provides a social-spatial perspective to understand urban land growth. The authors conclude that sustainable urban management should consider the coexistence of different urban spatial growth models and underline social transitions when examining the urban growth process. This works for cities in rapidly urbanizing countries or regions.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Sea Ice Classification with Gaofen-3 Fully Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the performance of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Gaofen-3 (GF-3) quad-polarization Stripmap (QPS) data is assessed for classifying late spring and summer sea ice types. The investigation is based on 18 scenes of GF-3 QPS data acquired in the Arctic Ocean in 2017. In this study, floe ice (FI), brash ice (BI) between floes and open water (OW, ice-free area) were classified based on a mini sea ice residual convolutional network, which we call MSI-ResNet. While investigating the optimal patch size for MSI-ResNet, we found that, as the patch size continues to grow, the classification accuracy first increases and then decreases. A patch size of 31 x 31 was found to achieve the best performance. The performance of classification using different polarization combinations from the QPS data was also assessed. The vertical-vertical (VV) polarization input overestimates the FI category while incorrectly identifying most of the BI as FI. The VH polarization produces a synchronous improvement in FI, BI, and OW discrimination, with a higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient (91.09% and 0.85, respectively) than the VV polarization (83.37% and 0.70, respectively). The combination of VV and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarizations presents a modest precision improvement for BI and OW together with a slight overestimation for FI. With VV, VH, and horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization data as the inputs, the user's accuracy improves to 95.12%, 93.42%, and 95.17% for FI, BI, and OW, respectively. The accuracy was assessed against visual interpretation of the sea ice classes in the images using a stratified sampling method. The application of the MSI-ResNet method to data covering the Beaufort Sea and the north of the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago was found to achieve a high overall accuracy (kappa) of 94.62% (+/- 0.92) and 94.23% (+/- 0.90), respectively. This is similar to the classification accuracy obtained in the Fram Strait. From the results of this study, it is shown that the MSI-ResNet method performs better than the classical support vector machine (SVM) classifier for sea ice discrimination. The GF-3 QPS mode data also show more details in discriminating scattered sea ice floes than the coincident Sentinel-1A Extra Wide (EW) swath mode data.

TI  - A new integrated method of GNSS and MODIS measurements for tropospheric water vapor tomography
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) tomography has proved its potential for sensing the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of atmospheric water vapor. Although the standard tomography model has improved, the geometry defect of GNSS acquisition remains a key problem and thus becomes the focus of this research. Thanks to the availability of high-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) precipitable water vapor (PWV) maps, the integration of GNSS and MODIS measurements for tropospheric tomography system is introduced and discussed to address this problem. A methodology based on the node tomography model is developed to exploit the MODIS signals, which overcomes the disadvantage of the standard voxel model in combining the MODIS observations. Three experimental schemes based on MODIS data and simultaneous GNSS observations over the Xuzhou area are implemented to validate the proposed approach. The results show that the mean number of newly crossed voxels (i.e., punctured only by the MODIS signals) increases from 2 in the top layer to 24 in the first layer. Consequently, the average number of total crossed voxels is increased from 272 to 447, which highlights the contribution of the MODIS observations to pass through the empty voxels. Besides, the mean number of tomographic observation equations is enhanced by 35.71% when the MODIS signals are combined. Two-dimensional (2D) profiles of water vapor from radiosonde and 3D distributions of it from ERA5 data are considered to validate the proposed method. It is noted that when using the proposed approach, the mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the 2D tomographic profiles is decreased by a value of about 1.06 g/m(3) and the overall accuracy of the 3D water vapor distribution is improved by 30.40%. Both the 2D and 3D validations demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the new integrated method to optimize the tomographic water vapor field.

TI  - Estimation of Lower-Stratosphere-to-Troposphere Ozone Profile Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and air pollution are emerging topics due to their possible enormous implications for health and social perspectives. In recent years, tropospheric ozone has been recognized as an important greenhouse gas and pollutant that is detrimental to human health, agriculture, and natural ecosystems, and has shown a trend of increasing interest. Machine-learning-based approaches have been widely applied to the estimation of tropospheric ozone concentrations, but few studies have included tropospheric ozone profiles. This study aimed to predict the Northern Hemisphere distribution of Lower-Stratosphere-to-Troposphere (LST) ozone at a pressure of 100 hPa to the near surface by employing a deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. We referred to a history of all the observed parameters (meteorological data of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), satellite data, and the ozone profiles of the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC)) between 2014 and 2018 for training the predictive models. Model-measurement comparisons for the monitoring sites of WOUDC for the period 2019-2020 show that the mean correlation coefficients (R-2) in the Northern Hemisphere at high latitude (NH), Northern Hemisphere at middle latitude (NM), and Northern Hemisphere at low latitude (NL) are 0.928, 0.885, and 0.590, respectively, indicating reasonable performance for the LSTM forecasting model. To improve the performance of the model, we applied the LSTM migration models to the Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container (CARIBIC) flights in the Northern Hemisphere from 2018 to 2019 and three urban agglomerations (the Sichuan Basin (SCB), North China Plain (NCP), and Yangtze River Delta region (YRD)) between 2018 and 2019. The results show that our models performed well on the CARIBIC data set, with a high R-2 equal to 0.754. The daily and monthly surface ozone concentrations for 2018-2019 in the three urban agglomerations were estimated from meteorological and ancillary variables. Our results suggest that the LSTM models can accurately estimate the monthly surface ozone concentrations in the three clusters, with relatively high coefficients of 0.815-0.889, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.769-8.729 ppb, and mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 6.111-6.930 ppb. The daily scale performance was not as high as the monthly scale performance, with the accuracy of R-2 = 0.636 similar to 0.737, RMSE = 14.543-16.916 ppb, MAE = 11.130-12.687 ppb. In general, the trained module based on LSTM is robust and can capture the variation of the atmospheric ozone distribution. Moreover, it also contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of air pollution, especially increasing our comprehension of pollutant areas.

TI  - Combination of Satellite Observations and Machine Learning Method for Internal Wave Forecast in the Sulu and Celebes Seas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal waves (IWs), observed in the world oceans, have significant impacts on ocean engineering and environments. In this study, we collected satellite images from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensors in the Sulu-Celebes Sea from 2016 to 2019 to understand the IW generation and propagation. Satellite observations show a coherent IW phase difference in both seas, indicating that the IWs are alternatively generated when the tidal currents oscillate back and forth in the Sulu Archipelago, which separates two seas. A new generation site is found for occasionally observed long IWs in the eastern Sulu Sea. To understand the IW propagation characteristics, we developed a machine-learning-based forecast model. We trained the model with both IW wave crest curves extracted from satellite images and published climatological ocean temperaturesalinity profiles. Since many satellite images contain IW packets generated at two or three tidal cycles, we can validate the model performance by matching the model prediction after one or two tidal cycles with the second or third wave crests in satellite images. Three factors are adopted to evaluate the forecast results: the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the Frchet distance (FD), and the correlation coefficient (CC). The forecast model has an average error with an RMSE of 12.92 km, an FD of 18.73 km, and a CC of 0.98. Analysis shows that a smaller time step is preferred in regions where the water depth changes significantly. Comparison with the Kortewegde Vries equation solutions shows that the developed forecast model is more robust when errors introduced to the model inputs.

TI  - Characterizing changes in land cover and forest fragmentation from multitemporal Landsat observations (1993-2018) in the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forces and anthropogenic activities greatly alter land cover, deteriorate or alleviate forest fragmentation and affect biodiversity. Thus land cover and forest fragmentation dynamics have become a focus of concern for natural resource management agencies and biodiversity conservation communities. However, there are few land cover datasets and forest fragmentation information available for the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve (DHR) of Nepal to develop targeted biodiversity conservation plans. In this study, these gaps were filled by characterizing land cover and forest fragmentation trends in the DHR. Using five Landsat images between 1993 and 2018, a support vector machine algorithm was applied to classify six land cover classes: forest, grasslands, barren lands, agricultural and built-up areas, water bodies, and snow and glaciers. Subsequently, two landscape process models and four landscape metrics were used to depict the forest fragmentation situations. Results showed that forest cover increased from 39.4% in 1993 to 39.8% in 2018. Conversely, grasslands decreased from 38.2% in 1993 to 36.9% in 2018. The forest shrinkage was responsible for forest loss during the period, suggesting that the loss of forest cover reduced the connectivity between forest and non-forested areas. Expansion was the dominant component of the forest restoration process, implying that it avoided the occurrence of isolated forests. The maximum value of edge density and perimeter area fractal dimension metrics and the minimum value of aggregation index were observed in 2011, revealing that forests in this year were most fragmented. These specific observations from the current analysis can help local authorities and local communities, who are highly dependent on forest resources, to better develop local forest management and biodiversity conservation plans.

TI  - Urban Fine-Grained Spatial Structure Detection Based on a New Traffic Flow Interaction Analysis Framework
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban structure is the spatial reflection of various economic and cultural factors acting on the urban territory. Different from the physical structure, urban structure is closely related to the population mobility. Taxi trajectories are widely distributed, completely spontaneous, closely related to travel needs, and massive in data volume. Mining it not only can help us better understand the flow pattern of a city, but also provides a new perspective for interpreting the urban structure. On the basis of massive taxi trajectory data in Chengdu, we introduce a network science approach to analysis, propose a new framework for interaction analysis, and model the intrinsic connections within cities. The spatial grid of fine particles and the trajectory connections between them are used to resolve the urban structure. The results show that: (1) Based on 200,000 taxi trajectories, we constructed a spatial network of traffic flow using the interaction analysis framework and extracted the cold hot spots among them. (2) We divide the 400 traffic flow network nodes into 6 communities. Community 2 has high centrality and density, and belongs to the core built-up area of the city. (3) A traffic direction field is proposed to describe the direction of the traffic flow network, and the direction of traffic flow roughly presents an inflow from northeast to southwest and an outflow from southeast to northwest of the study area. The interaction analysis framework proposed in this study can be applied to other cities or other research areas (e.g., population migration), and it could extract the directional nature of the network as well as the hierarchical structure of the city.

TI  - Influence of Impervious Surface Area and Fractional Vegetation Cover on Seasonal Urban Surface Heating/Cooling Rates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban thermal environment is impacted by changes in urban landscape patterns resulting from urban expansion and seasonal variation. In order to cope effectively with urban heat island (UHI) effects and improve the urban living environment and microclimate, an analysis of the heating effect of impervious surface areas (ISA) and the cooling effects of vegetation is needed. In this study, Landsat 8 data in four seasons were used to derive the percent ISA and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) by spectral unmixing and to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) from the radiative transfer equation (RTE). The percent ISA and FVC were divided into four different categories based on ranges 0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100%. The LST with percent ISA and FVC were used to calculate the surface heating rate (SHR) and surface cooling rate (SCR). Finally, in order to analyze the heating effect of ISA and the cooling effect of vegetation, the variations of LST with SHR and SCR were compared between different percent ISA and FVC categories in the four seasons. The results showed the following: (1) In summer, SHR decreases as percent ISA increases and SCR increases as FVC increases in the study area. (2) Unlike the dependence of LST on percent ISA and FVC, the trends of SHR/SCR as a function of percent ISA/FVC are more complex for different value ranges, especially in spring and autumn. (3) The SHR (heating capacity) decreases with increasing percent ISA in autumn. However, the SCR (cooling capacity) decreases with increasing FVC, except in summer. This study shows that our methodology to analyze the variation and change trends of SHR, SCR, and LST based on different ISA and FVC categories in different seasons can be used to interpret urban ISA and vegetation cover, as well as their heating and cooling effects on the urban thermal environment. This analytical method provides an important insight into analyzing the urban landscape patterns and thermal environment. It is also helpful for urban planning and mitigating UHI.

TI  - The contribution of Fintech to sustainable development in the digital age: Ant forest and land restoration in China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is a global issue that affects the livelihood of billions of people worldwide. Various responses have emerged to achieve the land degradation neutrality target, including the UN one billion tree campaign and Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Ant Forest, a land restoration approach initiated by China?s largest Fintech company Alibaba, has made substantial progress on land restoration in degraded areas in China, especially in desert areas. It represents a new model of transforming environmental protection intentions and activities of users into actual environmental benefits by planting trees. The lessons and implications of Ant Forest can contribute to ecosystem restoration globally. However, the effects and effectiveness of Ant Forest are not fully understood. Here we use the data from official reports from Alibaba?s ant financial, as well as remote sensing data, to examine how the Ant Forest contributes to land restoration and its socio-economic effects. We found that Ant Forest has many potential roles for achieving sustainable development goals, ranging from land restoration, carbon emission reduction, poverty reduction, human health improvement and many more. While its innovation has brought its international reputation at home and abroad, whether the project itself can sustain is still a question that needs to be concerned. The Fintech facilitated restoration has the potential to be scaled up, but it still needs to continue updating its platform, keep the intentions of the existed users and encouraging more new users to join in the effort.

TI  - [Spatiotemporal dynamics of soil salinity in the Yellow River Delta under the impacts of hydrology and climate.]
T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In recent years, soil salinization in the Yellow River Delta under the effects of hydrology, climate and human activities have become increasingly prominent. Based on the 20 Landsat series images of Hekou, Kenli, Dongying districts and Lijin County of Dongying City selected from 1985 to 2018, numerical regression correction method was used to perform image spectral consistency conversion. The partial least squares regression method was used to construct quantitative inversion models of soil salt content. The soil salt content of the study area were retrieved by the best salt prediction model. The temporal and spatial characteristics of soil salt changes in the Yellow River Delta were analyzed. The results showed that the soil salt inversion model constructed with 10 sensitive spectral indices performed higher prediction accuracy, with coefficient of determination R2=0.769 and RMSE=1.125 for calibration, R2=0.752 and RMSE=1.203 for validation, and relative prediction deviation (RPD)=2.08. Using the measured soil salt data in 2016 to verify the inversion accuracy of the model, the correlation between the measured value and the inverted value was 0.7279. The model was used to map the soil salinity of the Yellow River Delta based on 20 images from 1985 to 2018. The abnormal soil salinity retrieval values was all less than 10%. During the study period, the soil salinity showed an overall trend of rising first and then falling which was lowest in 1985 (3.14 g·kg-1) and highest in 1995 (5.86 g·kg-1). Spatially, the area of heavily saline soil and saline soil in the study area decreased, and that of mildly and moderately saline soil significantly increased (66.6%). The total area of saline soil showed an increasing trend. The effects of hydrological and climatic conditions on soil salinity exhibited hysteresis. The increases of temperature promoted soil salinity, with the relationship between the soil salinity and the average temperatures in the past six months and one year being significantly correlated (R=0.507 and 0.538). Soil salinity did not correlate with regional precipitation, and was most affected by the Yellow River streamflow in the previous season (R=-0.543).

TI  - Examining the Effects of Land Use on Carbon Emissions: Evidence from Pearl River Delta
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change accounts for a large proportion of the carbon emissions produced each year, especially in highly developed urban agglomerations. In this study, we combined remote sensing data and socioeconomic data to estimate land-use-related carbon emissions, and applied the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method to analyze its influencing factors, in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of China in 1990-2015. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The total amount of land-use-related carbon emissions increased from 684.84 x 10(4) t C in 1990 to 11,444.98 x 10(4) t C in 2015, resulting in a net increase of 10,760.14 x 10(4) t (16.71 times). (2) Land-use-related carbon emissions presented a "higher in the middle and lower on both sides" spatial distribution. Guangzhou had the highest levels of carbon emissions, and Zhaoqing had the lowest; Shenzhen experienced the greatest net increase, and Jiangmen experienced the least. (3) The land-use-related carbon emissions intensity increased from 4795.76 x 10(4) Yuan/t C to 12,143.05 x 10(4) Yuan/t C in 1990-2015, with the greatest increase seen in Huizhou and the lowest in Zhongshan. Differences were also found in the spatial distribution, with higher intensities located in the south, lower intensities in the east and west, and medium intensities in the central region. (4) Land-use change, energy structure, energy efficiency, economic development, and population all contributed to increases in land-use-related carbon emissions. Land-use change, economic development and population made positive contributions, while energy efficiency and energy structure made negative contributions. At last, we put forward several suggestions for promoting low-carbon development, including development of a low-carbon and circular economy, rationally planning land-use structure, promoting reasonable population growth, improving energy efficiency and the energy consumption structure, and advocating low-carbon lifestyles. Our findings are useful in the tasks related to assessing carbon emissions from the perspective of land-use change and analyzing the associated influencing factors, as well as providing a reference for realizing low-carbon and sustainable development in the PRD.

TI  - Local PM<sub>2.5</sub> Hotspot Detector at 300 m Resolution: A Random Forest-Convolutional Neural Network Joint Model Jointly Trained on Satellite Images and Meteorology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based rapid sweeping screening of localized PM2.5 hotspots at fine-scale local neighborhood levels is highly desirable. This motivated us to develop a random forest-convolutional neural network-local contrast normalization (RF-CNN-LCN) pipeline that detects local PM2.5 hotspots at a 300 m resolution using satellite imagery and meteorological information. The RF-CNN joint model in the pipeline uses three meteorological variables and daily 3 m/pixel resolution PlanetScope satellite imagery to generate daily 300 m ground-level PM2.5 estimates. The downstream LCN processes the estimated PM2.5 maps to reveal local PM2.5 hotspots. The RF-CNN joint model achieved a low normalized root mean square error for PM2.5 of within similar to 31% and normalized mean absolute error of within similar to 19% on the holdout samples in both Delhi and Beijing. The RF-CNN-LCN pipeline reasonably predicts urban PM2.5 local hotspots and coolspots by capturing both the main intra-urban spatial trends in PM2.5 and the local variations in PM2.5 with urban landscape, with local hotspots relating to compact urban spatial structures and coolspots being open areas and green spaces. Based on 20 sampled representative neighborhoods in Delhi, our pipeline revealed an annual average 9.2 +/- 4.0 mu g m(-3) difference in PM2.5 between the local hotspots and coolspots within the same community. In some cases, the differences were much larger; for example, at the Indian Gandhi International Airport, the increase was 20.3 mu g m(-3) from the coolest spot (the residential area immediately outside the airport) to the hottest spot (airport runway). This work provides a possible means of automatically identifying local PM2.5 hotspots at 300 m in heavily polluted megacities and highlights the potential existence of substantial health inequalities in long-term outdoor PM2.5 exposures even within the same local neighborhoods between local hotspots and coolspots.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for Potential Active Landslide Hazards Identification with Multi-Source Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The early identification of potential landslide hazards is of great practical significance for disaster early warning and prevention. The study used different machine learning methods to identify potential active landslides along a 15 km buffer zone on both sides of Jinsha River (Panzhihua-Huize section), China. The morphology and texture features of landslides were characterized with InSAR deformation monitoring data and high-resolution optical remote sensing data, combined with 17 landslide influencing factors. In the study area, 83 deformation accumulation areas of potential landslide hazards and 54 deformation accumulation areas of non-potential landslide hazards were identified through spatial overlay analysis with 64 potential active landslides, which have been confirmed by field verification. The Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were trained and tested through attribute selection and parameter optimization. Among the 17 landslide influencing factors, Drainage Density, NDVI, Slope and Weathering Degree play an indispensable role in the machine learning and recognition of landslide hazards in our study area, while other influencing factors play a certain role in different algorithms. A multi-index (Precision, Recall, F1) comparison shows that the SVM (0.867, 0.829, 0.816) has better recognition precision skill for small-scale unbalanced landslide deformation datasets, followed by RF (0.765, 0.756, 0.741), DT (0.755, 0.756, 0.748) and NB (0.659, 0.659, 0.659). Different from the previous study on landslide susceptibility and hazard mapping based on machine learning, this study focuses on how to find out the potential active landslide points more accurately, rather than evaluating the landslide susceptibility of specific areas to tell us which areas are more sensitive to landslides. This study verified the feasibility of early identification of landslide hazards by using different machine learning methods combined with deformation information and multi-source landslide influencing factors rather than by relying on human-computer interaction. This study shows that the efficiency of potential hazard identification can be increased while reducing the subjective bias caused by relying only on human experts.

TI  - Quantifying the Cooling Effect and Scale of Large Inner-City Lakes Based on Landscape Patterns: A Case Study of Hangzhou and Nanjing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanization worldwide has brought various environmental problems. The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is one of the most concerning issues because of its strong relation with daily lives. Water bodies are generally considered a vital resource to relieve the UHI. In this context, it is critical to develop a method for measuring the cooling effect and scale of water bodies in urban areas. In this study, West Lake and Xuanwu Lake, two famous natural inner-city lakes, are selected as the measuring targets. The scatter plot and multiple linear regression model were employed to detect the relationship between the distance to the lake and land surface temperature based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) and Sentinel-2 data. The results show that West Lake and Xuanwu Lake massively reduced the land surface temperature within a few hundred meters (471 m for West Lake and 336 m for Xuanwu Lake) and have potential cooling effects within thousands of meters (2900 m for West Lake and 3700 m for Xuanwu Lake). The results provide insights for urban planners to manage tradeoffs between the large lake design in urban areas and the cooling effect demands.

TI  - Long Time Series High-Quality and High-Consistency Land Cover Mapping Based on Machine Learning Method at Heihe River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long time series of land cover changes (LCCs) are critical in the analysis of long-term climate, environmental, and ecological changes. Although several moderate to fine resolution global land cover datasets have been publicly released and they show strong consistency at the global scale, they have large deviations at the regional scale; furthermore, high-quality land cover datasets from before 2000 are not available and the classification consistency among different datasets is not very good. Thus, long time series of land cover datasets with high quality and consistency are in great demand but they are still unavailable, even at the regional scale. The Landsat series of satellite imagery composed of eight successive satellites can be traced back to 1972 and it is, therefore, possible to produce a long time series land cover dataset. In addition, the newly available satellite data have the capability to construct time series satellite images and a time series analysis method such as LCMM can be employed for making high-quality land cover datasets. Therefore, by taking the advantages of the two categories of satellite data, we proposed a new time series land cover mapping method based on machine learning and it, thereafter, is applied to Heihe River Basin (HRB) for verification purposes. Firstly, the high-quality land cover datasets at HRB from 2011-2015, which were retrieved using the LCMM method, are used for quickly and accurately making training samples. Secondly, a strategy for transferring the training samples after 2011 to earlier years is established. Thirdly, the random forest model is employed to train the selected yearly samples and a land cover map for every year is subsequently made. Finally, comprehensive analysis and validation are carried out for evaluation. In this study, a long time series land cover dataset including 1986, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 is finally made and an average precision of about 90% is achieved. It is the longest time series land cover map with 30 m resolution at HRB and the dataset has good time continuity and stability.

T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Understanding the processes and drivers of vegetation change in giant panda habitats plays an important role in their conservation and management.Methods Based on the long-term normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series that was constructed by all available Landsat TM/ETM/OLI images from 1986 to 2018, we employed the BFAST (Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend) method and harmonic model to monitor the vegetation change during the period of 1986-2018. Three types of NDVI changes (i.e. vegetation accumulated abrupt change, accumulated gradual change, and total change) were built to reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of vegetation change. The effects of different factors (i.e. mean annual precipitation, mean annual air temperature, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to rivers, soil type, land cover type, distance to roads and distance to engineering disturbance area) on the spatial distribution of the three types of vegetation change were evaluated by Geodetector.Important findings 1) A total of 9.13% of vegetation abrupt change in the study area was detected, which was mainly distributed around the eastern boundary of the habitats, and the largest abrupt change areas occurred in 2011 and 2013. 2) The proportion of vegetation accumulated abrupt change showing degradation accounted for 40.17% of the vegetation accumulated abrupt change area, and the accumulated gradual change and total change which presented increasing trends accounted for 94.58% and 97.02% of the study area, respectively. 3) The spatial distribution of vegetation changes was mainly affected by four factors: mean annual precipitation, mean annual air temperature, elevation, and soil type. The strongest explanatory factors of vegetation accumulated abrupt change, accumulated gradual change, and total change were mean annual precipitation, elevation, and soil type, respectively. The interactions between driving factors were mutually enhanced and nonlinearly enhanced.

TI  - Detecting Offshore Drilling Rigs with Multitemporal NDWI: A Case Study in the Caspian Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore drilling rigs are the foundation of oil and gas exploitation in water areas. Their spatial and temporal distribution, state attributes and other information directly reflect the exploitation level of regional oil and gas resources. Therefore, it is very important to build an automatic detecting method for offshore drilling rigs with good performance to accurately capture the temporal and spatial distribution and state of oil and gas exploitation activities. At present, there are two main groups of methods for offshore drilling rigs: invariant feature-based methods and nighttime firelight-based methods. Methods based on invariant location are more subjective in terms of their parameter settings and require intensive computation. Nighttime light-based methods are largely unable to identify offshore drilling rigs without associated waste gas ignition. Furthermore, multiple offshore drilling rigs in close proximity to one another cannot be effectively distinguished with low spatial resolution imagery. To address these shortcomings, we propose a new method for the automatic identification of offshore drilling rigs based on Landsat-7 ETM+ images from 2018 to 2019, taking the Caspian Sea as the research area. We build a nominal annual cloud and cloud shadow-free Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) composite by designing an optimal NDWI compositing method based of the influence of cloud and cloud shadow on the NDWI values of water, bare land (island) and offshore drilling rigs. The classification of these objects is simultaneously done during the compositing process, with the following rules: water body (Max_NDWI > 0.55), bare land (island) (Min_NDWI < -0.05) and offshore drilling rig (0 < Mean_NDWI < 0.4). A threshold segmentation and postprocessing were carried out to further refine the results. Using this method, 497 offshore platforms were automatically identified using a nominal annual cloud and cloud shadow-free NDWI composite image and Google Earth Engine. Validation using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) and Google Earth images demonstrated that the correct rate of offshore drilling rig detection in the Caspian Sea is 90.2%, the missing judgment rate is 5.3% and the wrong judgment rate is 4.5%, proving the performance of the proposed method. This method can be used to identify offshore drilling rigs within a large water surface area relatively quickly, which is of great significance for exploring the exploitation status of offshore oil and gas resources. It can also be extended to finer spatial resolution optical remote sensing images; thus small-size drilling rigs can be effectively detected.

TI  - A High-Dimensional Indexing Model for Multi-Source Remote Sensing Big Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With continuous improvement of earth observation technology, source, and volume of remote sensing data are gradually enriched. It is critical to realize unified organization and to form data sharing service capabilities for massive remote sensing data effectively. We design a hierarchical multi-dimensional hybrid indexing model (HMDH), to address the problems in underlying organization and management, and improve query efficiency. Firstly, we establish remote sensing data grid as the smallest unit carrying and processing spatio-temporal information. We implement the construction of the HMDH in two steps, data classification based on fuzzy clustering algorithm, and classification optimization based on recursive neighborhood search algorithm. Then, we construct a hierarchical "cube" structure, filled with continuous space filling curves, to complete the coding of the HMDH. The HMDH reduces the amount of data to 6-17% and improves the accuracy to more than eight times than traditional grid model. Moreover, it can reduce the query time to 25% in some query scenarios than algorithms selected as the baseline in this paper. The HMDH model proposed can be used to solve the efficiency problems of fast and joint retrieval of remote sensing data. It extends the pattens of data sharing service and has a high application value.

TI  - Characterizing Wetland Inundation and Vegetation Dynamics in the Arctic Coastal Plain Using Recent Satellite Data and Field Photos
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic wetlands play a critical role in the global carbon cycle and are experiencing disproportionate impacts from climate change. Even though Alaska hosts 65% of U.S. wetlands, less than half of the wetlands in Alaska have been mapped by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) or other high-resolution wetlands protocols. The availability of time series satellite data and the development of machine learning algorithms have enabled the characterization of Arctic wetland inundation dynamics and vegetation types with limited ground data input. In this study, we built a semi-automatic process to generate sub-pixel water fraction (SWF) maps across the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska using random forest regression and 139 Sentinel-2 images taken in ice-free seasons from 2016 to 2019. With this, we characterized the seasonal dynamics of wetland inundation and explored their potential usage in determining NWI water regimes. The highest levels of surface water expression were detected in June, resulting from seasonal active layer thaw and snowmelt. Inundation was most variable in riverbeds, lake and pond margins, and depressional wetlands, where water levels fluctuate substantially between dry and wet seasons. NWI water regimes that indicate frequent inundation, such as permanently flooded wetlands, had high SWF values (SWF >= 90%), while those with infrequent inundation, such as temporarily flooded wetlands, had low SWF values (SWF < 10%). Vegetation types were also classified through the synergistic use of a vegetation index, water regimes, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data, topographic data, and a random forest classifier. The random forest classification algorithms demonstrated good performance in classifying Arctic wetland vegetation types, with an overall accuracy of 0.87. Compared with NWI data produced in the 1980s, scrub-shrub wetlands appear to have increased from 91 to 258 km(2) over the last three decades, which is the largest percentage change (182%) among all vegetation types. However, additional field data are needed to confirm this shift in vegetation type. This study demonstrates the potential of using time series satellite data and machine learning algorithms in characterizing inundation dynamics and vegetation types of Arctic wetlands. This approach could aid in the creation and maintenance of wetland inventories, including the NWI, in Arctic regions and enable an improved understanding of long-term wetland dynamics.

TI  - A convolutional neural network for semi-automated lineament detection and vectorisation of remote sensing data using probabilistic clustering: A method and a challenge
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we present the framework and open-source software code to train and apply Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the prediction of geological lineaments using topographic, magnetic, and gravity raster data. Many important applications relate to the recognition of linear geological structures from remote sensing data, such as thrust faults, bedrock fault and shear zones, lithological contacts, fractures and fold structures. The digitization of fault lineaments is conventionally performed by geologists or geophysicists with working knowledge of the relevant data, e.g., topographic Digital Elevation Model, magnetic data, and gravity data. Visual inspection and extraction is simple but subjective; the process is also time-expensive with efficiency and accuracy depending on the individual?s knowledge, experience, and skill. For decades there has been interest in ways to automate this process. Our CNN approach is trained using publicly available lineament GIS data from the Quest BC project in British Columbia, Canada, and the Loch Lilly-Kars area of New South Wales, Australia. The datasets used to train the prediction models resulted in interesting predictions proximal to the training areas: some major lineaments are indicated, some are missed, and potential new (valid) lineaments are indicated. The results indicate potential for use as a semi-automated lineament detection solution. In contrast, but as anticipated, application of the model to the blind-test area of the Swayze greenstone belt, Ontario, produced poor lineament prediction results (as compared to publicly available interpretations). We interpret this result as related to insufficiently large training data inputs. However, it is inferred that results could be improved through feature engineering (e.g., use of topographic slope, rather than simply elevation) without the need to simply create larger training datasets. We hope that, by making the code open-source, the geoscience community will use this platform to gradually improve an open source fault prediction model.

TI  - Time Series Deformation Monitoring over Large Infrastructures around Dongting Lake Using X-Band PSI with a Combined Thermal Expansion and Seasonal Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term spatial-temporal deformation monitoring of densely distributed infrastructures near the lake area is of great significance to understand the urban health status and prevent the potential traffic safety problems. In this paper, the permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technology with TerraSAR-X imagery over the area around Dongting Lake was utilized to generate the long-term spatial-temporal deformation. Since the X-band SAR interferometric phases are highly influenced by the thermal dilation of the observed objects, and the deformation of large infrastructures are highly related to external temperature, a combined deformation model considering the thermal expansion and the seasonal environmental factors was proposed to model the temporal variations of the deformation. The time series deformation and the thermal dilation parameter over the area were obtained, and a comparative study with the traditional linear model was conducted. The Dongting Lake Bridge and the typical feature points distributed around the lake were analyzed in details. In order to compensate for the unavailability of external in situ measurements over the area, phase residuals and the subsidence generated through Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) were utilized to verify the accuracy of the obtained deformation time series. Experiment results suggested that the proposed model is suitable and suggested for the selected study site. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the residual phase was estimated as 0.32 rad, and the RMSE compared with D-InSAR derived deformation was +/- 1.1 mm.

TI  - Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) Over Riverside Cities Along the Gangetic Plain of India
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation in India has led to increased land use and energy demand, and the consequent uncontrolled development and increased human-induced activities are changing the micrometeorology and the local environment. Of late, the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect is quite evident in India. It is known that river banks are where the most densely populated cities can be found around the globe, and the River Ganga (Ganges) in India is no exception. Town/cities located over the Gangetic Plain are witnessing a fast urbanisation, and associated perturbation is taking place in the micro/meso-scale meteorology/environment. Discussion about the influence of the river on the SUHI and dynamics over different cities along a single major river is needed, and therefore this study is undertaken to investigate the SUHI effect on riverside towns/cities over the Gangetic Plain, India. For this purpose, the observation data for the period of 2001-2014 from the Terra-MODIS satellite are used. The study quantifies the land surface temperature (LST) under different zones namely urban, suburban, and rural, delineated on the basis of International Geosphere Biosphere Programme-Land Cover (IGBP-LC) products. The intensity and trend of SUHI are measured as an indicator of environmental and micro-climate change. The study found a prevailing regime of nighttime SUHI intensity (SUHII) as well as the daytime formation of SUHI. The interaction of the wind blowing from the river and other land cover to towns/cities was examined with respect to the SUHII of Kanpur and Patna and was found to be quite important.

TI  - The large footprint of small-scale artisanal gold mining in Ghana
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gold mining has played a significant role in Ghana's economy for centuries. Regulation of this industry has varied over time and while industrial mining is prevalent in the country, the expansion of artisanal mining, or Galamsey has escalated in recent years. Many of these artisanal mines are not only harmful to human health due to the use of Mercury (Hg) in the amalgamation process, but also leave a significant footprint on terrestrial ecosystems. degrading and destroying forested ecosystems in the region. In this study, the Landsat image archive available through Google Earth Engine was used to quantify the total footprint of vegetation loss due to artisanal gold mines in Ghana from 2005 to 2019 and understand how conversion of forested regions to mining has changed over a decadal period from 2007 to 2017. A combination of machine learning and change detection algorithms were used to calculate different land cover conversions and the timing of conversion annually. Within the study area of southwestern Ghana, our results indicate that approximately 47,000 ha (+/- 2218 ha) of vegetation were converted to mining at an average rate of similar to 2600 ha yr(-1). The results indicate that a high percentage (similar to 50%) of this mining occurred between 2014 and 2017. Around 700 ha of this mining occurred within protected areas as mapped by the World Database of Protected Areas. In addition to deforestation, increased artisanal mining activity in recent years has the potential to affect human health, access to drinking water resources and food security. This work expands upon limited research into the spatial footprint of Galamsey in Ghana, complements mapping efforts by local geographers, and will support efforts by the government of Ghana to monitor deforestation caused by artisanal mining.

TI  - Amazon forest cover change mapping based on semantic segmentation by U-Nets
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation remains a major concern with regard to climate change and the maintenance of biodiversity. Meanwhile, the development of new image processing techniques and the broad availability of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery provide an unprecedented setup for the development of effective and scalable forest cover change monitoring systems. This is especially relevant in regions with large forested areas with high rates of deforestation, such as in the region of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. In this context, existing forest cover change monitoring methods are based on a combination of visual inspection, spectral profiles, statistics, and machine learning techniques, which offer alternative backbones to deal with deforestation monitoring. Given the recent advances in the field of image processing by Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs), the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the U-Net architecture for the mapping of forest cover aimed at identifying deforestation polygons in multi-temporal satellite imagery. To this end, 10-m resolution imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite covering portions of the Legal Amazon region were employed. The U-Net could identify and draw polygons of forest areas and forest fragments with high accuracy (0.9470), precision (0.9356), recall (0.9676), and F1-score (0.9513), thus outperforming largely applied and well-know supervised and unsupervised image classification methods. The results indicate and we further discuss that UNets have the potential to run as the backbone for efficient forest cover change monitoring initiatives and support the deployment of near real-time deforestation warning systems.

TI  - The structure-in-evolution approach: a unified view of evolutionary change in policy systems
T2  - POLICY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars across the social sciences, including in the studies of institutions and policy, have found useful various elements of evolutionary and complexity research. Though sharing the same worldview, these streams of research emphasize different aspects of change and lack a shared set of assumptions and tools. As a result, they remain largely disconnected. Inspired by innovation research and its novel theory of change in technological systems, this article aims to bridge these gaps and advance a unified view of policy change called the structure-in-evolution approach. The structure-in-evolution analysis accounts for both the dynamics and the structure of change by positing that policy systems, like other technological systems, evolve according to distinct patterns and exhibit complex and adaptive properties of such systems. This approach, the article argues, thus promises not only to integrate our understanding of evolutionary change but also a major leap forward in our ability to study and develop public policy.

TI  - Validation of the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOMI cloud data with Cloudnet, Aura OMI O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub>, MODIS, and Suomi-NPP VIIRS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of cloud properties is essential to the measurement of atmospheric composition from space. In this work we assess the quality of the cloud data from three Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) TROPOMI cloud products: (i) S5P OCRA/ROCINN_CAL (Optical Cloud Recognition Algorithm/Retrieval of Cloud Information using Neural Networks;Clouds-As-Layers), (ii) S5P OCRA/ROCINN_CRB (Clouds-as-Reflecting Boundaries), and (iii) S5P FRESCO-S (Fast Retrieval Scheme for Clouds from Oxygen absorption bands - Sentinel). Target properties of this work are cloud-top height and cloud optical thickness (OCRA/ROCINN_CAL), cloud height (OCRA/ROCINN_CRB and FRESCO-S), and radiometric cloud fraction (all three algorithms). The analysis combines (i) the examination of cloud maps for artificial geographical patterns, (ii) the comparison to other satellite cloud data (MODIS, NPP-VIIRS, and OMI O-2-O-2), and (iii) ground-based validation with respect to correlative observations (30 April 2018 to 27 February 2020) from the Cloudnet network of ceilometers, lidars, and radars. Zonal mean latitudinal variation of S5P cloud properties is similar to that of other satellite data. S5P OCRA/ROCINN_CAL agrees well with NPP VIIRS cloud-top height and cloud optical thickness and with Cloudnet cloud-top height, especially for the low (mostly liquid) clouds. For the high clouds, S5P OCRA/ROCINN_CAL cloud-top height is below the cloud-top height of VIIRS and of Cloudnet, while its cloud optical thickness is higher than that of VIIRS. S5P OCRA/ROCINN_CRB and S5P FRESCO cloud height are well below the Cloudnet cloud mean height for the low clouds but match on average better with the Cloudnet cloud mean height for the higher clouds. As opposed to S5P OCRA/ROCINN_CRB and S5P FRESCO, S5P OCRA/ROCINN_CAL is well able to match the lowest CTH mode of the Cloudnet observations. Peculiar geographical patterns are identified in the cloud products and will be mitigated in future releases of the cloud data products.

TI  - Determination of application volume for coffee plantations using artificial neural networks and remote sensing
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for optimizing the application of phytosanitary products can be an alternative for sustainable agriculture. Such methods can be achieved with the use of artificial intelligence and remote sensing techniques. Our experiments were carried out in a commercial coffee plantation, where morphological variables (height and diameter) and vegetation indexes (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI and normalized difference red edge, NDRE) were collected in the upper, medium, and lower thirds of the coffee plant. From the remote sensing data, experiments were developed to determine the best neural network topology, in terms of accuracy (RMSE) and precision (R-2) and type (Multilayer Perceptron "MLP" and Radial Basis Function "RBF"), to estimate morphological variables. From these results, we evaluated the possibility of applying pesticides at a variable rate, using the tree row volume principle. The results show that, using remote sensing and artificial neural networks (MLP), it is possible to estimate coffee tree volume with reasonable accuracy. This can be done using a multi layer perceptron model to estimate coffee tree height and diameter using vegetation indexes of different parts of the plant as input.

TI  - Characterizing spatial variability in coastal wetland biomass across multiple scales using UAV and satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland biomass is an important indicator of wetland productivity, carbon storage, health, and vulnerability to climate change. The ability to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in wetlands at ecologically relevant scales is complicated by the spatial variability inherent to patterns in wetland vegetation and the biogeomorphic processes that help create them. Remote sensing provides an approach for mapping wetland biomass, but the spatial resolutions of satellite and airborne imagery often constrain the types of ecological patterns and processes that can be detected. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have previously been used to capture fine-scale (<= 1 m) variability in AGB in coastal wetland settings. However, it remains unclear if a UAV approach to estimating wetland biomass is transferrable across diverse wetland sites or how it compares to commonly used satellite-based approaches. Here, we test the capabilities of UAVs in remotely quantifying AGB and compare biomass estimation using UAV and Landsat satellite imagery (30 m resolution) in several wetland sites in Southern California. Field surveys highlight significant spatial variability in wetland plant community AGB and height that influence remote biomass estimation. Relationships between UAV vegetation indices and AGB were site-specific and influenced by vegetation types. Biomass estimation using UAVs (r(2) = 0.40, RMSE = 534.6 g m(-2)) showed better correlation with NDVI than a Landsatbased approach (r(2) = 0.26, RMSE = 596.8 g m(-2)). We found combining high-resolution UAV AGB maps and Landsat NDVI to develop AGB models showed the highest correlation (r(2) = 0.45, RMSE = 659.7 g m(-2)) and provided additional spatial information to aid scaling field data to satellite imagery. Overall, UAVs captured more spatial complexity in aboveground biomass at finer scales than is possible with moderate-resolution Landsat pixels, indicating that UAVs can be used to characterize patterns of within-marsh variability resulting from local-scale (<= 100s of meters) ecological processes.

TI  - Utilization of multispectral landsat-8 remote sensing data for lithological mapping of southwestern Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper plutonic rocks in southwestern Saudi Arabia has been mapped through Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The gathered field rock samples were subjected to spectral measurements (in the range of 0.4-2.5 mm) in the laboratory using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer. Integrated remote sensing techniques, including the band ratio, principal component analysis (PCA), and Gram-Schmidt spectral sharpening have been applied through this study. The red-greenblue composites of the pan-sharpened original bands (3, 4, and 7), principal components (PC3, PC1, and PC2), and band ratios 5/6 and 5/7 were found to be the most useful to delineate the study area's Upper Proterozoic plutonic rocks. The results of image processing methods, spectral reflectance analyses are in good agreement with the field data. The spectral reflectance curves of the collected samples and the corresponding Landsat 8 pixels match well. It is indicated that Landsat-8 image data has great capability to identify lithological units and could be applicable in several areas in arid and semiarid environments. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Factors associated with melanoma-related limb lymphoedema
T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMelanoma-related limb lymphoedema is a well-known late effect following sentinel node biopsy (SNB), and lymph node dissection (LND) in patients treated of melanoma. However, data on associated risk factors are sparse. This study aimed to investigate factors associated with melanoma-related limb lymphoedema.MethodsThe present cross-sectional single-center clinical study included patients between 18 and 75 years with American Joint Committee on Cancer Stages I-III melanoma treated with wide local excision (WLE) and unilateral axillary or inguinal SNB and/or completion LND (CLND) or therapeutic LND (TLND). The diagnosis of secondary unilateral limb lymphoedema was based on the history, symptoms, and physical examination and staged according to the International Society of Lymphology (ISL). Data on factors associated with lymphoedema were analysed with binary logistic regression models.ResultsIn total, 642 patients were eligible, of which 435 (68%) patients participated in the study. Among these 431 patients, 109 (25%) had lymphoedema of which 48 (44%), and 61 (56%) were classified with ISL Stages I and II-III, respectively. Multivariate analyses identified primary tumour on the limb (odds ratio [OR], 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-4.56; p value .017), inguinal surgery (OR, 6.91; 95% CI, 3.49-14.11; p value <.0001), LND (OR, 6.45; 95% CI, 3.18-13.57; p value <.0001), and persistent pain at the site of lymph node surgery as factors associated with lymphoedema (OR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.54-8.19; p value .003). Multivariable analysis of ISL Stage II-III lymphoedema further identified limb cellulitis to be associated with lymphoedema (OR 5.74; 95% CI, 2.11-15.99; p value .0006).ConclusionsMelanoma-related limb lymphoedema is associated with inguinal surgery, LND, primary tumour on the limb, persistent pain at the site of lymph node surgery, and cellulitis of the limb. This study highlights the importance of increasing awareness, improving prevention, and treatment of melanoma-related limb lymphoedema.

TI  - Detecting tropical selective logging with C-band SAR data may require a time series approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging is the primary driver of forest degradation in the tropics and reduces the capacity of forests to harbour biodiversity, maintain key ecosystem processes, sequester carbon, and support human livelihoods. While the preceding decade has seen a tremendous improvement in the ability to monitor forest disturbances from space, large-scale (spatial and temporal) forest monitoring systems have almost universally relied on optical satellite data from the Landsat program, whose effectiveness is limited in tropical regions with frequent cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can penetrate clouds and have been utilized in forest mapping applications since the early 1990s, but only recently has SAR data been widely available on a scale sufficient to facilitate pan-tropical selective logging detection systems. Here, a detailed selective logging dataset from three lowland tropical forest regions in the Brazilian Amazon was used to assess the effectiveness of SAR data from Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) for monitoring tropical selective logging. We built Random Forests models aimed at classifying pixel-based differences between logged and unlogged areas. In addition, we used the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm to assess if a dense time series of Sentinel-1 imagery displayed recognizable shifts in pixel values after selective logging. In general, Random Forests classification with SAR data (Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) performed poorly, having high commission and omission errors for logged observations. This suggests little to no difference in pixel-based metrics between logged and unlogged areas for these sensors, particularly at lower logging intensities. In contrast, the Sentinel-1 time series analyses indicated that areas under higher intensity selective logging ( 5% in unlogged forest. Overall our results suggest that SAR data can be used in time series analyses to detect tropical selective logging at high intensity logging locations ( 20 m3 ha- 1) within the Amazon.

TI  - Light pollution affects West Nile virus exposure risk across Florida
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) present global health threats, and their emergences are often linked to anthropogenic change. Artificial light at night (ALAN) is one form of anthropogenic change that spans beyond urban boundaries and may be relevant to EIDs through its influence on the behaviour and physiology of hosts and/or vectors. Although West Nile virus (WNV) emergence has been described as peri-urban, we hypothesized that exposure risk could also be influenced by ALAN in particular, which is testable by comparing the effects of ALAN on prevalence while controlling for other aspects of urbanization. By modelling WNV exposure among sentinel chickens in Florida, we found strong support for a nonlinear relationship between ALAN and WNV exposure risk in chickens with peak WNV risk occurring at low ALAN levels. Although our goal was not to discern how ALAN affected WNV relative to other factors, effects of ALAN on WNV exposure were stronger than other known drivers of risk (i.e. impervious surface, human population density). Ambient temperature in the month prior to sampling, but no other considered variables, strongly influenced WNV risk. These results indicate that ALAN may contribute to spatio-temporal changes in WNV risk, justifying future investigations of ALAN on other vector-borne parasites.

TI  - Increase in summer monsoon rainfall over the northeast India during El Nino years since 1600
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) at interseasonal to interannual time scales. Given the heterogeneity in rainfall patterns over India, we have revisited the linkages between El Nino and ISM for the period 1600-2016 in this study. Our analysis based on the instrumental, paleo-proxy, model and satellite data sets show significant spatiotemporal variation in the ISM in response to El Nino. We observed strengthening of ISM over the northeast India (NEI) in conjunction with El Nino events. We suggest that the decadal trends in ISM over the NEI and central India (CI) were controlled by the long term variation in strength of El Nino events. We observed spatial variation in isoGSM derived rainfall and its oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18) in response to El Nino events. We further verified our observations from isotope proxy palaeo-records. Two high resolution speleothem (cave deposits) records of reconstructed ISM during 1600-2008 confirmed the inverse relation of rainfall patterns over CI (negative) and NEI (positive) during moderate to strong El Nino periods. These speleothem records infer a long-term pause in the El Nino (or stronger La Nina) like conditions, which were persisted during 1625-1715 and favored the stronger (weaker) rainfall over the CI (NEI). Furthermore, speleothem records showed stronger El Nino events during 1715-1760 causing significant reduction and enhancement in rainfall amount over CI and NEI, respectively.

TI  - High-permeability zones in folded and faulted silicified carbonate rocks ? Implications for karstified carbonate reservoirs
T2  - MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ascending hydrothermal fluid flow and subsequent hypogene karstification can control the formation of highpermeability zones in folded or faulted carbonate rocks. This study presents a multidisciplinary and multiscale approach to investigate the relationships between regional deformation and subseismic karst conduits along fracture corridors. We investigate the Cristal Cave Karst System, which is 6.7 km long and occurs in Mesoproterozoic carbonate-siliciclastic units affected by hydrothermal silicification in the Sa?o Francisco Craton, Brazil. Based on integrated techniques of ALOS PALSAR imagery, structural field surveys, stratigraphic and laboratory analyses in the caves and the surrounding surface outcrops, we highlight the following points: (1) the cave system occurs in a regional folded sector; (2) the internal architecture of the large regional folds is composed of subseismic folds; (3) fracture corridors occur along the subseismic fold hinges, forming highpermeability zones; and (4) the principal cave passages, which are oriented NNE-SSW, are concentrated along these fold hinges. We discuss the results in terms of a spatiotemporal conceptual model and unravel the deformation and karstification stages, which are characterized by the development of (i) precontractional and (ii) contractional structural networks followed by (iii) hydrothermal silicification and karstification processes. This cave system can be used as an analog for deformed, silicified, and karstified carbonate reservoirs, allowing for the in situ characterization of subseismic structural features. This study provides the key for first-order prediction and characterization of high-permeability zone internal structures, where both deformation and karstification processes occur.

TI  - Difference Equation Model-Based PM<sub>2.5</sub> Prediction considering the Spatiotemporal Propagation: A Case Study of Bohai Rim Region, China
T2  - DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate reporting and prediction of PM2.5 concentration are very important for improving public health. In this article, we use a spectral clustering algorithm to cluster 44 cities in the Bohai Rim Region. On this basis, we propose a special difference equation model, especially the use of nonlinear diffusion equations to characterize the temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of PM2.5 propagation between and within clusters for real-time prediction. For example, through the analysis of PM2.5 concentration data for 92 consecutive days in the Bohai Rim Region, and according to different accuracy definitions, the average prediction accuracy of the difference equation model in all city clusters is 97% or 90%. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the forecast data for each urban agglomeration is within 7 units (mu g/m(3)). The experimental results show that the difference equation model can effectively reduce the prediction time, improve the prediction accuracy, and provide decision support for local air pollution early warning and urban comprehensive management.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of vegetation cover changes (VCCs) and land use land cover changes (LULCCs) on climate variabilities need to be addressed while maintaining healthy urban development. This study aimed to evaluate LULCCs and VCCs and their impacts on land surface temperature (LST) and rainfall in the Darbhanga district of Bihar, India. Landsat data and climate hazard group infrared precipitation with stations (CHIRPS) were used to assess LST or LULCCs and rainfall, respectively, over the study area. Results showed a decline in vegetation cover to 11.73% (26,857.43 ha) in the year 2019 from 19.12% (43,733.61 ha) in 1999. Also an increase in built-up and cropland by 4.9% (11,224.6 ha) and 4.38% (10,043.2 ha), respectively, was observed in the last 20 years. With decreasing vegetation cover in the study area, the mean LST increased while the mean annual rainfall decreased for the study period. The Mann-Kendall trend (MKT) test exhibited no significant trends for LST and rainfall with p values of 0.43 and 0.69, respectively, although Sen's slope indicated variability in LST and rainfall even though it was insignificant over the study area. The study would identify areas requiring immediate action for saving its resources and providing insight into upholding its competence. The findings would also lead to proper decision making for the concerned stakeholders, assuring sustainability in appropriate planning of land use and utilisation of resources and maintain the agroclimatic condition.

TI  - Breast Cancer in the Presence of Failed Saline Breast Implants
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast augmentation has been gaining popularity over the last two decades to correct congenital breast asymmetry or increase breast size and projection. Augmentation options started with saline implants, then silicone implants, and, recently, autologous fat transfer.Unfortunately, breast implants are not without complications, some of which are common, like capsular contracture, implant failure and infection. Others are quite rare, such as Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). Most of these complications will eventually require explantation in most cases, as the patients' and implants' age and risk of complications increase.We present a 79-year-old patient who presented to our breast unit with a left breast lump with 50-year-old saline implants. A triple assessment revealed incidental right breast cancer treated with radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag-guided wide local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy and bilateral explantation.

TI  - Assessing Forest Cover Change and Fragmentation in Northeastern British Columbia Using Landsat Images and a Geospatial Approach
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover loss and fragmentation have increased in recent years due to the increasing anthropogenic land use. Whereas previous studies have focused mostly on forest cover change from other disturbances (e.g., insects, diseases, and forest fires), little is known regarding how land uses are increasing at the expense of forest cover. Thus, we fill this research gap by assessing forest cover change and fragmentation with an emphasis on how competing anthropogenic land uses are increasing at the expense of the coniferous forests using empirical evidence from northeastern British Columbia (BC). We classified Landsat images from 1985, 2000, and 2015 using the Random Forests (RF) classification algorithm. The study finds an annual net loss of 2.3% (gain: 6.9%, loss: 9.2%) in the coniferous forest cover, but the timber harvest land base's (THLB) share of the coniferous forest gain and loss is higher than that of the area outside the THLB. We find that the period with a lower amount of fragmentation has a lesser amount of coniferous forest cover loss and vice versa. We show that coniferous forest cover is more likely to recover from barren land. In forest areas where anthropogenic land uses are on the rise, land managers could use knowledge from our study as ancillary information in assessing the sustainability and potential cumulative impacts of anthropogenic land uses. We conclude that the rate of forest recovery from anthropogenic-induced land categories is likely to account for the amount of forest fragmentation.

TI  - Improving soil moisture prediction of a high-resolution land surface model by parameterising pedotransfer functions through assimilation of SMAP satellite data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pedotransfer functions are used to relate gridded databases of soil texture information to the soil hydraulic and thermal parameters of land surface models. The parameters within these pedotransfer functions are uncertain and calibrated through analyses of point soil samples. How these calibrations relate to the soil parameters at the spatial scale of modern land surface models is unclear because gridded databases of soil texture represent an area average. We present a novel approach for calibrating such pedotransfer functions to improve land surface model soil moisture prediction by using observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission within a data assimilation framework. Unlike traditional calibration procedures, data assimilation always takes into account the relative uncertainties given to both model and observed estimates to find a maximum likelihood estimate. After performing the calibration procedure, we find improved estimates of soil moisture and heat flux for the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model (run at a 1 km resolution) when compared to estimates from a cosmic-ray soil moisture monitoring network (COSMOS-UK) and three flux tower sites. The spatial resolution of the COSMOS probes is much more representative of the 1 km model grid than traditional pointbased soil moisture sensors. For 11 cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture probes located across the modelled domain, we find an average 22% reduction in root mean squared error, a 16% reduction in unbiased root mean squared error and a 16% increase in correlation after using data assimilation techniques to retrieve new pedotransfer function parameters.

The methods include remote sensing technique together with kinematic analysis, Finite Element Method (FEM), and Finite Difference Method (FDM). The Sentinel-2B imaging techniques have classified most of the slopes as high susceptibility, most of these slopes have been observed to consist of active rockfalls. Furthermore, circular, toppling, planar, and wedges failures were denoted to be the most kinematic failures associated with the slopes. However, wedge failure was more pronounced than other kinematic failures. On the other hand, simulation of FoS and maximum displacement of the slope was conducted using FLACSlope. The simulation confirmed that the composition of the slopes contributes greatly to its FoS and rockmass displacement. Indeed, a slope with one rock unit was simulated to be stable with less rockmass displacement, however in a case of brittle and faulted rockmass the FoS was very low with extensive displacement simulated across the slope. The later simulation corresponds with the conditions of the current study. Finally, the influence of geological features was studied with varying stages of road construction. The simulations have shown a rapid increase in rockmass displacement generated by the joints as the stages of road construction progress. It appears that the brittleness, faulting, slope properties, and unsupported rockmass are the most contributing factors toward slope instability.

TI  - Using improved DeepLabv3+network integrated with normalized difference water index to extract water bodies in Sentinel-2A urban remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and accurate extraction of water areas from remote sensing images is a popular research topic. Currently, researchers have attempted to use neural networks to extract water from remote sensing images. However, most of these studies used computer vision techniques to improve the model results without considering the multi-band information unique to remote sensing images. Thus our study proposes an improved DeepLabv3+ network to increase the water body extraction accuracy in urban remote sensing images. The DeepLabv3+ network has the characteristics of extracting image features at multiple scales. We improved the network structure to incorporate multi-band features. By comparing several multi-band input methods, the feature map calculated by the normalized difference water index (NDWI) was converted into an input suitable for the neural network by comparing several multi-band input methods. Simultaneously, we developed a parallel convolution structure to combine the NDWI feature map with a standard false color remote sensing image during feature extraction. This allows the network to focus more on image areas that may be water bodies. We used atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2A L2A-level data, divided the training set at multiple scales, and conducted several experiments. The results show that the proposed network can improve water extraction accuracy when training subregions are unified from different sizes to 512 x 512. Finally, we used the model to extract water bodies from remote sensing images from different regions. We combined the images with visual interpretation to verify the reliability of the model results. Moreover, the model scores of four types of multi-scale neural networks in the two categories are compared, which proves the effectiveness of the method.

TI  - Spatio-temporal spectral unmixing of time-series images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed pixels exist widely in remotely sensed images. To obtain more reliable land cover information than traditional hard classification, spectral unmixing methods have been developed to estimate the composition of the mixed pixels, in terms of the proportions of land cover classes. The existing spectral unmixing methods usually require pure spectra (i.e., endmembers) of each land cover class. However, in areas dominated by mixed pixels (e.g., highly heterogeneous areas), it can be a great challenge to extract a large number of pure endmembers, especially for long time-series data. Meanwhile, intra-class spectral variation remains a long-standing issue in spectral unmixing. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal spectral unmixing (STSU) approach to address these issues. The proposed method extends spectral unmixing from the traditional spatial domain to the spatio-temporal domain. It exploits fully the multi-scale spatio-temporal information, by using temporally neighboring fine spatial resolution images to detect land cover changes and, further, extracts the proportion information of unchanged mixed pixels required for training. The STSU method is free of the need for endmember extraction, using directly the extracted mixed training samples to construct a learning model, and it accounts for intra-class spectral variation. Therefore, it is a fully automatic method suitable for dynamic monitoring of land cover changes. The effectiveness of the STSU method was validated through experiments on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in five different areas. The proposed STSU method provides a new solution for spectral unmixing of time-series data based on the goal of continuous monitoring at the global scale.

TI  - An adaptive atmospheric correction algorithm for the effective adjacency effect correction of submeter-scale spatial resolution optical satellite images: Application to a WorldView-3 panchromatic image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The adjacency effect can blur and reduce the contrast of satellite images. For low visibility, the adjacency effect has a crucial impact on submeter-scale spatial resolution optical (SM) satellite images. Therefore, SM satellite images are preprocessed with an atmospheric correction before performing visual interpretation and quantitative research. This atmospheric correction includes the adjacency effect (expressed by the average background reflectance, ABR) correction and atmospheric intrinsic reflectance correction. ABR is related to the spatial distance from the central pixel to its surrounding pixels (SDCS) and is affected by the reflectance difference between the central pixel and its surrounding pixels (RDCS). Existing methods to calculate ABR do not include the effect of RDCS. Therefore, in this study, we use equivalent average background reflectance (EABR) instead of ABR used in the 6S model. EABR considers the effects of the strengths of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), SDCS, and RDCS on the adjacency effect. Compared with ABR, EABR can better represent the adjacency effect in an SM satellite image. We develop an adaptive atmospheric correction algorithm (called adaptive-AC) based on EABR. The adaptive characteristic of adaptive-AC is that it can adjust the contribution factor (or weighted value) of the background pixel to the adjacency effect according to the SDCS and RDCS. The application of adaptive-AC to a panchromatic band image of WorldView-3 (WV-3) reveals that adaptive-AC can significantly improve image quality, with the reflectance of pixels in the corrected image processed by adaptive-AC being close to the actual reflectance. Comparison with the results of the atmospheric correction algorithm in the 6S model (6S-AC) indicates that adaptive-AC is more suitable for SM satellite image preprocessing than 6S-AC approaches. There is no clear theory or formula available to calculate the exact value of the adjacency effect range (Rad). Therefore, different Rad values are used in applying the adaptive-AC and 6S-AC. The results show that the larger is the Rad used to construct the adjacency effect model, the more satisfactory is the atmospheric correction.

TI  - Estimation of tree height and aboveground biomass of coniferous forests in North China using stereo ZY-3, multispectral Sentinel-2, and DEM data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest tree height and aboveground biomass (AGB) are important indicators for monitoring changes and trends in forest carbon storage and terrestrial carbon fluxes. Accurate large-scale wall-to-wall mapping of the forest tree height and AGB remain challenging due to the limited data availability for extraction tree height and the data signal saturation problem in AGB estimation. In this study, we explored the potential of forest tree height mapping using stereo imageries, and analyzed whether accounting for such information, in addition to optical sensor data, could improve the performance of AGB estimations of coniferous forests in a case study in North China. First, a spatially continuous tree height product was obtained using Ziyuan-3 satellite (ZY-3) stereo images combined with a digital elevation model (DEM) obtained from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) data. Second, two AGB estimation models were established by combining the forest tree height with vegetation index, spectral, biophysical (from Sentinel-2 images), and topographic variables. A random forest algorithm was utilized to evaluate the effect of including the tree height variable in the AGB estimation. The results showed that the tree height estimation using the nadir and forward views of the ZY-3 stereo images was more accurate than that based on the nadir and backward views from the same images. The AGB estimation model incorporating the tree height variable with a coefficient of determination value of 0.7789, a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 29.815 Mg/ha and a relative RMSE of 23.42% was more robust and effective, thereby demonstrating that the tree height variable can be used to alleviate the data signal saturation issue successfully. The proposed approach can provide new insight into forest tree height mapping and AGB products obtained from satellite stereo images and freely accessible Sentinel-2 multispectral images.

TI  - A systematic method for spatio-temporal phenology estimation of paddy rice using time series Sentinel-1 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal phenological information is essential for regional crop monitoring and accurate management. This study aimed to obtain the spatio-temporal distribution of rice phenology using time series Sentinel-1A images. In this study, a systematic method for spatial and temporal phenological estimation was developed based on multi-temporal Sentinel data. This method consisted of: (1) the Spectral Similarity Measures (SSM) approach for rice mapping, and (2) the DTHT-PF approach, which includes a dynamic threshold algorithm (DT), a hierarchical tree (HT), and a particle filter (PF) used for phenology estimation. Thereinto, a dynamic threshold algorithm for transplanting date retrieval and a hierarchical tree for obtaining an initial phenology, which is then run through a PF, are proposed based on the SAR backscatter time series. In brief, we found that the VH backscatter has the potential to provide accurate phenological estimations for paddy rice. Furthermore, rice mapping at a high accuracy level of 92.97%, transplanting date retrieval, and initial phenology estimations lay a good foundation for understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of rice phenology. A determination factor (R2) and a root mean square error (RMSE) obtained using the DTHT-PF method were much higher (approximately 0.52 in the difference) and lower (approximately 14.67 in the difference), respectively, than those obtained using the PF approach with uniform initialization. R2 and RMSE values obtained using the real-time DTHT-PF method are slightly different from those obtained using the non-real-time DTHT-PF method. Map analysis revealed that the transplanting dates and the spatial distribution phenology were larger in the west and north of the study area near the South China Sea because of higher temperatures and earlier transplanting. Altogether, our results suggest that the DTHT-PF method and the VH backscatter obtained from the Sentinel-1A images have great potential for furthering our understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of phenology estimation. This information can greatly contribute to the improvement of precision agriculture, including crop monitoring and yield predictions.

TI  - A review of geostatistical simulation models applied to satellite remote sensing: Methods and applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite an ever-increasing number of spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based data acquisition platforms, remote sensing data are still often spatially incomplete or temporally irregular. While deterministic interpolation techniques are often used, they tend to create unrealistic spatial patterns and generally do not provide uncertainty quantification. Geostatistical simulation models are effective in generating an ensemble of realistic and equally probable realizations of an unmeasured phenomenon, allowing data uncertainty to be propagated. These models are commonly used in several fields of earth science, and in recent years, they have been applied widely to remotely sensed data. This study provides the first review of the applications of geostatistical simulation to remote sensing data. We review recent geostatistical simulation models relevant to satellite remote sensing data and discuss the characteristics and advantages of each approach. Finally, the applications of each geostatistical simulation model are categorized in different domains of natural sciences, including soil, vegetation, topography, and atmospheric science.

TI  - Remote-sensing estimates of forest structure and dynamics as indicators of habitat quality for Magellanic woodpeckers
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bridging remote-sensing ecosystem indices with biodiversity conservation implies converting these indices into habitat quality indicators for species playing an important role in communities and ecosystems, such as woodpeckers. However, an ecologically reliable estimation of habitat quality necessarily involves an assessment of fitness components ultimately responsible for population persistence. Here, we assessed the relationship between remote-sensing indices of forest structure, dynamics and composition with the breeding performance of Magellanic woodpeckers in conservation areas of southern Chile. We used a Bayesian-spatial model based on age and sex information from woodpecker?s social group data collected seasonally in seven years. The probability of a young remaining in the group decreased with the mean group size during the previous year, with group size fluctuating temporally in all conservation areas. Tree senescence had a positive effect on the pairing probability of woodpeckers, but this effect became more marked in sites of higher altitude. Paired woodpeckers were more likely to be observed in sites supporting more than 69% of forest cover. The probability of the young remaining in the territory was positively affected by the interaction between forest canopy continuity and altitude, with retention of the young being more likely in sites located higher than 1000 masl. Social groups were larger in sites where the continuity of canopy increased over time. Those findings suggest that remote sensing indices representing the structure and dynamics of forest ecosystems are important indicators of the habitat quality for woodpeckers. Thus, forest biodiversity that depends on the woodpecker?s engineering function may be conserved through the retention of senescent trees and the maintaining of critical levels of forest cover ensuring high habitat-quality for breeding woodpeckers.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analysis of urban heat island using Landsat satellite images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The average land surface temperature (LST) of Earth has increased since the late nineteenth century due to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere. Increased surface temperatures, especially in cities, are a significant environmental problem that intensifies urban heat islands (UHIs). In this study, land surface temperature, urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI), and UHI index were mapped using Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 satellite images to identify the distribution and determine the intensities of the UHI. Maps of land use at multi-year intervals between 1995 and 2016 were created using the support vector machine (SVM) method. These were used to compare LST variations to land-use changes and to determine the linkages between the two. The results showed that the highest recorded temperatures in Ahvaz, the capital of Khozestan Province, Iran, occurred in areas of bare land (42.93 degrees C) and residential development (40.06 degrees C) in 2017. Land use classification showed that the highest classification accuracy (in 2016) was 93%. The most varying extents of land use in Ahvaz were bare lands, residential lands, and green spaces. Green spaces in the study area in 1995 and 2016 covered 14% and 7% of the area, respectively, which showed a 50% reduction in green space over 21 years. A composite map of UTFVI and UHI showed that the locations classified as very hot had the worst UTFVI. The results of this study of Ahvaz, Iran's heat islands, can inform and guide urban planners in locational matters and in efforts to mitigate and adapt changing land uses in order to limit the intensification of the UHI.

TI  - When Is Sentinel Node Biopsy Indicated in High-Risk Ductal Carcinoma in situ? Four Hundred Sixty-Eight Cases from Three Institutions
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is not indicated. However, in certain cases (size >3 cm, high grade, mass effect on mammography, or palpable mass), it may be possible to find incidental invasive carcinoma (IC) that requires an SLNB. We studied the correlation of the aforesaid factors with the probability of finding IC in the surgical specimen. Methods: Data was collected from 3 different institutions between 2010 and 2016, recording characteristics such as, but not limited to: high grade, size >3 cm, mass effect on mammography, and palpable mass. Results: On the whole, 468 "high-risk" DCIS cases were identified, 139 (29%) of which had IC. When the DCIS was high grade or the size was >3 cm, there was no significant difference in the probability of finding IC in the surgical specimen (OR = 1.13; 95% CI 0.84-1.51; OR = 1.2; 95% CI 0.85-1.40). Nevertheless, when a high grade and size (>3 cm) were combined, IC was more likely to exist (72.7 vs. 27.3%; p = 0.001). In addition, mass effect and palpation were independently associated with a significantly greater degree of IC (OR = 12.76; 95% CI 6.93-23.52). Conclusions: The results suggest that high-grade DCIS or DCIS with a size >3 cm, independently, does not require SLNB. Nonetheless, in the event that both factors are found in the same case, SLNB may be indicated. Additionally, SLNB is advisable for DCIS cases that are palpable or show a mass effect on mammography.

TI  - A map of the extent and year of detection of oil palm plantations in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - In recent decades, global oil palm production has shown an abrupt increase, with almost 90% produced in Southeast Asia alone. To understand trends in oil palm plantation expansion and for landscapelevel planning, accurate maps are needed. Although different oil palm maps have been produced using remote sensing in the past, here we use Sentinel 1 imagery to generate an oil palm plantation map for Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand for the year 2017. In addition to location, the age of the oil palm plantation is critical for calculating yields. Here we have used a Landsat time series approach to determine the year in which the oil palm plantations are first detected, at which point they are 2 to 3 years of age. From this, the approximate age of the oil palm plantation in 2017 can be derived.

TI  - Evaluation of geomorphometric characteristics and soil properties after a wildfire using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery for future fire-safe forest
T2  - FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding spatiotemporal geomorphological and pedological changes as a consequence of wildfires can allow stakeholders, land planners, and policymakers to design efficient fire safety-based afforestation and restoration programs of forest lands. The use of remote sensing techniques is a key tool to achieve this goal. The suitable combination of Sentinel-2 MSI data for mapping of different spectral indices related to burn severity and their relationship with other morphometric and soil properties can contribute to a better understanding of the impact of fire, and this is relevant in regions where is still scarce fire-related research such as Turkey. In this investigation, the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), dNDVI (Difference Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index), NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio), dNBR (Difference Normalized Burn Ratio), RBR (Relativized Burn Ratio), SBI (Soil Bare Index), As (Upslope area), CTI (Compound Topographic Index), TCI (Terrain Characterization Index), SPI (Stream Power Index) and Curvature (Standard Curvature) were combined. As a study case, 47.43 ha in a burned area of Cnarpnar forest unit, Andrn, Kahramanmaras in Turkey was selected. The results showed that dNDVI, dNBR, RBR, SBI contribute to relevant information about the effect of the wildfire. According to the dNBR fire severity classification, 75% of the total area has been exposed to high-severity fire. The relationship of Sentinel MSI satellite images with some soil and morphometric features have been found meaningful to understand the impact of forest fire in Mediterranean ecosystems. The information collected in the Turkish forest areas affected by wildfires should be relevant for planning and represent a key contribution to the selection of restoration programs and afforestation techniques for a future fire-safe forest.

TI  - Empirical model for forecasting sugarcane yield on a local scale in Brazil using Landsat imagery and random forest algorithm
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane plays an important role in food and energy production in Brazil and worldwide. The large availability of satellite sensors and advanced techniques for processing data have improved the forecasting sugarcane yield on a local and global scale, but more work is needed on exploiting the synergy between remote sensing, meteorological and agronomic data. In this study, we combined such data sources to forecast sugarcane yield using a random forest (RF) algorithm on an extensive area of 50,000 ha, over four years. Images from Landsat satellites were processed to time series of surface reflectance and spectral indices. The approach focused on the development of predictive models which only used data acquired and accessible several months before the harvest. First, three RF models were calibrated with different predictors to forecast the sugarcane yield at harvest: using Landsat satellite images and meteorological data (RF1); agronomic and meteorological data (RF2); a combination of Landsat satellite images, agronomic and meteorological data (RF3). As a comparison, we also tested the influence of including knowledge on the future harvest date in the models RF2 and RF3 (RF4 and RF5). The average values of R-2 for RF1, RF2, and RF3 were 0.66, 0.50 and 0.74, respectively. The model with the highest values of R-2 (RF3) had a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 9.9 ton ha(-1) on yield forecast, approximately 15% of the yield average. Including the harvest date improved the RF2 and RF3 models to reach R-2 = 0.69 and RMSE = 10.8 ton ha(-1) for RF4, and R-2 = 0.76 and RMSE of 9.4 ton ha(-1) for RF5. A blind forecasting test for the 2016 yields showed similar prediction than the forecast made by in situ field expertise. This result has the potential to assist management of sugarcane production.

TI  - Evaluation of the MOD16A2 evapotranspiration product in an agricultural area of Argentina, the Pampas region
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pampas Region is a big plain of approximately 520,000 km(2) in Argentina. It is essential to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) in this region since the primary productivity is directly linked to water availability. Information provided by satellite missions allows monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of ET. In the current study, we evaluated the version 006 of MOD16A2 product (MOD16A2.006) of Potential Evapotranspiration (ETp) and Actual Evapotranspiration (ETa) in Argentinian Pampas Region (APR). MOD16A2.006 product was compared with Crop Evapotranspiration (ETc), calculated with local measurements from the Oficina de Riesgo Agropecuario (ORA), and Crop Coefficient (Kc) data (function of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) in seven stations in the APR from 2009 to 2018. We evaluated ETa at two temporal scales: accumulated values (mm) per growth stages (soybean crop), and 8-day accumulated values (mm8d(-1)). The results showed a systematic overestimation around 65% for ETp((MOD16A2.006)) (found and eliminated by means of a linear function) and underestimation (in most stations) for ETa(MOD16A2.006) in accumulated values per growth stages. Respect to mm8d(-1), no systematic error was observed, but the relationship ETa(ORA)-ETa(MOD16A2.006) for soybean crop behaves similarly throughout APR.

AB  - Application of remote sensing makes the assessment and monitoring of mangroves both time and costeffective. In this study, the capacity of AVIRIS-NG data in discriminating different mangrove species of Lothian Island of Indian Sundarbans has been evaluated and compared with hyperspectral (Hyperion) and multispectral dataset (Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2). Spectral signatures of mangrove species were retrieved, and spectral libraries were created. With the corrected images and spectral libraries, mangroves were classified using appropriate classification techniques. For multispectral datasets (Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2) and hyperspectral coarser-resolution Hyperion datasets, K-means classification followed by knowledge-based classification was adopted. For fine resolution hyperspectral AVIRIS-NG data set, classification was accomplished using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The overall accuracy for the classification is significantly high in case of AVIRIS-NG data (87.61%) compared to the Landsat 8 OLI (76.42%), Sentinel-2 (79.81%), and Hyperion data (81.98%). The results showed that AVIRIS-NG hyper spectral dataset has the potential to classify not only the genus level but also species-level with satisfactory accuracy in a complex mangrove forest.(c) 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - The Rocklea Dome 3D Mineral Mapping Test Data Set
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of surface and subsurface geoscience data is critical for efficient and effective mineral exploration and mining. Publicly accessible data sets to evaluate the various geoscience analytical tools and their effectiveness for characterisation of mineral assemblages and lithologies or discrimination of ore from waste are however scarce. The open-access Rocklea Dome 3D Mineral Mapping Test Data Set (Laukamp, 2020; https://doi.org/10.25919/5ed83bf55be6a) provides an opportunity for evaluating proximal and remote sensing data, validated and calibrated by independent geochemical and mineralogical analyses, for exploration of channel iron deposits (CIDs) through cover. We present hyperspectral airborne, surface, and drill core reflectance spectra collected in the visible-near-infrared and shortwave infrared wavelength ranges (VNIR-SWIR; 350 to 2500 nm), as well as whole-rock geochemistry obtained by means of X-ray fluorescence analysis and loss-on-ignition measurements of drill core samples.The integration of surface with subsurface hyperspectral data collected in the frame of previously published Rocklea Dome 3D Mineral Mapping case studies demonstrated that about 30% of exploration drill holes were sunk into barren ground and could have been of better use, located elsewhere, if airborne hyperspectral imagery had been consulted for drill hole planning. The remote mapping of transported Tertiary detritals (i.e. potential hosts of channel iron ore resources) versus weathered in situ Archaean bedrock (i.e. barren ground) has significant implications for other areas where "cover" (i.e. regolith and/or sediments covering bedrock hosting mineral deposits) hinders mineral exploration. Hyperspectral remote sensing represents a cost-effective method for regolith landform mapping required for planning drilling programmes. In the Rocklea Dome area, vegetation unmixing methods applied to airborne hyperspectral data, integrated with subsurface data, resulted in seamless mapping of ore zones from the weathered surface to the base of the CID - a concept that can be applied to other mineral exploration and mineral deposit studies. Furthermore, the associated, independent calibration data allowed the quantification of iron oxide phases and associated mineralogy from hyperspectral data. Using the Rocklea Dome data set, novel geostatistical clustering methods were applied to the drill core data sets for ore body domaining that introduced scientific rigour to a traditionally subjective procedure, resulting in reproducible objective domains that are critical for the mining process.Beyond the previously published case studies, the Rocklea Dome 3D Mineral Mapping Test Data Set has the potential to develop new methods for advanced resource characterisation and develop new applications that aid exploration for mineral deposits through cover. The white mica and chlorite abundance maps derived from airborne hyperspectral, presented here for the first time, highlight the additional applications of remote sensing for geological mapping and could help to evaluate newly launched hyper- and multispectral spaceborne systems for geoscience and mineral exploration.

TI  - Atmospheric ammonia point source detection technique at regional scale using high resolution satellite imagery and deep learning
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is a precursor of atmospheric aerosols. The lack of real-time updated and high spatial resolution atmospheric NH3 point source information is one of the critical problems in the study of atmospheric pollution. Satellite-based NH3 observation data provide a new approach to NH3 point source detection. However current spatial resolution of NH3 concentration satellite data is still not sufficient to extract NH3 point sources at regional scale with high accuracy. Based on the traditional oversampling method to improve the spatial resolution of NH3 satellite data, this paper used high-resolution satellite image data with the geometric morphological features of NH3 point sources to detect the NH3 point sources at regional scale under deep learning techniques. The highprecision NH3 point source location and category information at regional scale is extracted concurrently, solving the current problem that multiple point sources cannot be detected in a single satellite NH3 concentration hotspot. After analyzing a priori knowledge, the industrial sources were further subdivided. The atmospheric ammonia point source detection technique in this paper were used in Northeast China, where the number and types of NH3 emission sources are abundant. The detection results significantly increased the number of NH3 potential point sources detected in Northeast China compared with the traditional oversampling method. The deep learning-based technology combines NH3 concentration remote sensing products with high resolution satellite image data to effectively detect the spatial distribution and types of NH3 point sources at regional scale, providing powerful technical support for NH3 emission regulation and control.

TI  - Estimation of leaf water content from hyperspectral data of different plant species by using three new spectral absorption indices
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT, g cm(-2)) and fuel moisture content (FMC, %) are key variables in ecological and environmental monitoring. Although a variety of hyperspectral vegetation indices have been developed to estimate the leaf EWT and FMC, most of these indices are defined considered two or three specific bands for a specific plant species, which limits their applicability. In this study, we proposed three new spectral absorption indices (SAI(970), SAI(1200), and SAI(1660)) for various plant types by considering the symmetry of the spectral absorption at 970 nm, 1200 nm and 1660 nm and spectral heterogeneity of different leaves. The indices were calculated considering the absorption peak and shoulder bands of each leaf instead of the same specific bands for all leaves. A pooled dataset of three tree species (camphor (VX), capricorn (VJ), and red-leaf plum (VL)) was used to test the performance of the SAIs in terms of the leaf EWT and FMC estimation. The results indicated that, first, SAI(1200) was more suitable for estimating the EWT than FMC, whereas SAI(970) and SAI(1660) were more suitable for estimating the FMC. Second, SAI(1200) achieved the most accurate estimation of the EWT with a cross-validation coefficient of determination (R-cv(2)) of 0.845 and relative cross-validation root mean square error (rRMSE(cv)) of 8.90%. Third, SAI(1660) outperformed the other indices in estimating the FMC at the leaf level, with an R-cv(2) of 0.637 and rRMSE(cv) of 8.56%. Fourth, SAI(970) achieved a moderate accuracy in estimating the EWT (R-cv(2) of 0.25 and rRMSE(cv) of 19.68%) and FMC (R-cv(2) of 0.275 and rRMSE(cv) of 12.10%) at the leaf level. These results can enrich the application of the SAIs and demonstrate the potential of using SAI(1200) to determine the leaf EWT and SAI(1660) to obtain the leaf FMC among various plant types.

TI  - Investigating Decadal Changes of Multiple Hydrological Products and Land-Cover Changes in the Mediterranean Region for 2009-2018
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover change is a critical concern due to its climatic, ecological, and socioeconomic consequences. In this study, we used multiple variables including precipitation, vegetation index, surface soil moisture, and evapotranspiration obtained from different satellite sources to study their association with land-cover changes in the Mediterranean region. Both observational and modeling data were used for climatology and correlation analysis. Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were used to extract surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration data. Intercomparing the results of FLDAS and GLDAS suggested that FLDAS data had better accuracy compared to GLDAS for its better coherence with observational data. Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station Data (version 2.0 final) (CHIRPS Pentad) were used to extract precipitation data while Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products were used to extract the vegetation indices used in this study. The land-cover change detection was demonstrated during the 2009-2018 period using MODIS Land-Cover data. Some of the barren and crop lands in Euphrates-Tigris and Algeria have converted to low-vegetated shrublands over the time, while shrublands and barren areas in Egypt's southwestern Delta region became grasslands. These observations were well explained by changing trends of hydrological variables which showed that precipitation and soil moisture had higher values in the countries located to the east of the Mediterranean region compared to the ones on the west. For evapotranspiration, the countries in the north had lower values except for countries in Europe such as Bosnia, Romania, Slovenia, and countries in Africa such as Egypt and Libya. The enhanced vegetation index appeared to be decreasing from north to south, with countries in the north such as Germany, Romania, and Czechia having higher values, while countries in the south such as Libya, Egypt, and Iraq having lower trends. Time series analysis for selected countries was also done to understand the change in hydrological parameters, including Enhanced Vegetation Index, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture, which showed alternating drop and rise as well as stagnant values for different parameters in each country.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Versus Elective Neck Dissection: Long-Term Oncologic Outcomes in Clinically Node-Negative Tongue Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term oncologic outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) versus elective neck dissection (END) in clinically node-negative (cN0) tongue cancer. Methods. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with cN0 tongue cancer from a single institution, including 91 patients in the SLNB group and 120 patients in the END group. Results. The overall recurrence rate showed no significant difference between the two groups. The regional control rate was also comparable between the two groups (P= 0.490). The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was slightly better in the SLNB group than in the END group (P= 0.427). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 89.9% in the SLNB group versus 91.9% in the END group (P= 0.737). In a propensity-matched subgroup analysis, the type of neck man-agement did not affect RFS or OS. Conclusion. SLNB showed non-inferior oncologic outcomes compared to END in patients with cN0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  - Natural variability contributes to model-satellite differences in tropical tropospheric warming
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-standing discrepancy exists between general circulation models (GCMs) and satellite observations: The multimodel mean temperature of the midtroposphere (TMT) in the tropics warms at approximately twice the rate of observations. Using a large ensemble of simulations from a single climate model, we find that tropical TMT trends (1979-2018) vary widely and that a subset of realizations are within the range of satellite observations. Realizations with relatively small tropical TMT trends are accompanied by subdued sea-surface warming in the tropical central and eastern Pacific. Observed changes in sea-surface temperature have a similar pattern, implying that the observed tropical TMT trend has been reduced by multidecadal variability. We also assess the latest generation of GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). CMIP6 simulations with muted warming over the central and eastern Pacific also show reduced tropical tropospheric warming. We find that 13% of the model realizations have tropical TMT trends within the observed trend range. These simulations are from models with both small and large climate sensitivity values, illustrating that the magnitude of tropical tropospheric warming is not solely a function of climate sensitivity. For global averages, one-quarter of model simulations exhibit TMT trends in accord with observations. Our results indicate that even on 40-y timescales, natural climate variability is important to consider when comparing observed and simulated tropospheric warming and is sufficiently large to explain TMT trend differences between models and satellite data.

TI  - Estimating surface solar irradiance from geostationary Himawari-8 over Australia: A physics-based method with calibration
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface Solar Irradiance (SSI) is required for solar energy planning and adoption, and is a fundamental parameter in modelling weather, climate, ecosystem and agricultural activities. Herein a time series based radiative transfer model was developed to simultaneously retrieve properties of clouds, aerosols and surface albedo, which were in turn used to calculate the components of SSI: i.e., global, direct and diffuse irradiance. The calculated results were calibrated across the Australian continent against in-situ measurements to account for minor factors (e.g., water vapor) not considered by the physics-based method. Detailed validation of the SSI components was performed against three years of in-situ measurements at 11 sites across Australia, at a range of time scales (i.e., instantaneous, hourly, daily and monthly) and under both all-sky and cloudy-sky conditions. The main advantage of the present method is the reliable separation of the direct and diffuse components with consistently low biases (similar to 4 W/m(2)) at all four time scales, while still maintaining relatively low RMSE (root-mean-square-error) and MAE (mean-absolute-error). Once calibration has been performed the model does not require any ancillary data when implemented operationally: that is the model only requires geostationary satellite data. This model may be implemented across the globe using widely available next generation geostationary satellite data with a handful of ground-data for calibration.

TI  - Bangalore: Urban heating or urban cooling?
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangalore, one of the Indian metropolitan cities, has witnessed rapid urbanization during the last decade with an overwhelming spatial growth of 696 sq. km to 2185 sq.km within a span of ten years (2006 to 2016). With this exponential rate of urban growth, the city is experiencing a shift in its micro-climatic condition. This paper aims to identify the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect by comparing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and the fraction of impervious surface area (ISA) as indicators of SUHI. Landsat 8 datasets were used to estimate the land surface temperature (LST) for two different seasons representing winter (January) and summer (April) using radiative transfer algorithm. A spatial map of ISA was generated using normalized spectral mixture analysis (NSMA) showing a standard error of 9.25%. Correlations between NDVI, NDBI and fraction of ISA with LST indicate a strong linear negative relationship between LST and ISA with a coefficient of correlation 0.85 and 0.94 s for January and April respectively and is contrary to the conventionally accepted positive SUHI phenomenon. The relationship between LST and NDVI was in particular negative at areas bearing high NDVI values. Results indicate that ISA is quantitatively a better metric indicating that the city experiences cool island effect indicative of high vegetative cover presence in the Bangalore Urban (BU) area. Also, NDVI is greatly affected by seasonal variation and NDBI shows mixing of soil characters and hence failed in providing conclusive results. ? 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Soil property maps with satellite images at multiple scales and its impact on management and classification
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil maps at appropriate scales can aid decision-making in agriculture and the environment. In this sense, remote sensing products have shown their power to investigate soil properties, but the assessment of its spatial information can be hampered by the presence of other objects than soil. To overcome this issue, soil scientists have been studying spatial patterns from multi-temporal satellite images aiming at at improving soil property maps. In this work, we applied the cubist algorithm to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, organic matter and iron contents, and soil color components) in south-eastern Brazil using multi-temporal (Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI) and single-date images (PlanetScope, Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI). We aimed to evaluate the influence of satellite's spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions on soil mapping. Predictive models were constructed with 120 soil samples and using four (vis-NIR) and six (vis-NIR-SWIR) spectral bands as predictors in a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The multi-temporal image obtained from the Sentinel2-MSI satellite (with 10 m pixel size and six spectral bands), showed the best model performances in cross-validation (R-2 between 0.48 and 0.78). The PlanetScope image, which has only four bands in the vis-NIR region and spatial resolution of 3 m did not improve model performances, although the R-2 values were higher for soil color components (R-2 > 0.5). Satellite images in different spatial, spectral and temporal resolution provides slightly different soil property maps which may promote different strategies regarding soil classification and management. However, satellite images should be used with caution, as they provide only surficial information about the soil variability and confirmation with field surveys is required.

Many studies have employed remote sensing data for assessing LULC changes, however, the investigation of fragmentation probability modeling is still scarce in the existing literature. Thus, the coupling of bagging, random forest (RF), random subspace (RSS), and their ensemble model with multitemporal datasets within the GIS environment makes it possible to model the fragmentation probability of LULC in the Teesta River Basin (TRB), Bangladesh. The number of patch (NP), edge density (ED), largest patch index (LPI), contagion index (%) (CONTAG), aggregation index (AI), perimeter area ratio (P/A ratio), the class area (CA), percentage of landscape (PLAND), patch density (PD), total edge (TE), largest shape index (LSI) and total core area (TCA) were the landscape and class matrices, which were derived from the LULC maps using FRAGSTATS software. The machine learning-based sensitivity models, such as decision tree and support vector machine-based feature selection techniques were implemented to explore the influence of the parameters for fragmentation probability modeling. The results showed that water bodies and barren land were substantially decreased by (6.21%), and (14.59%) respectively while the built-up areas increased by 1.45% from 2010 to 2019. Results revealed that the dominance of the agricultural area has been increased as human interference has been elevated in the TRB. However, twelve class-level and landscape matrices were used to delineate the fragmentation probability zone with the aid of bagging, RF, and RSS algorithms. LULC images and fragmentation probability models were validated using the kappa coefficient and the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The validation outcomes depicted that the three models such as bagging (AUC = 0.864), RF (AUC = 0.819), RSS (AUC = 0.859), and ensemble model (AUC = 0.912) have a good capability to appraise the fragmentation probability, and ensemble model has the highest precision level among three models. Nearly 49% (1789 km2) of the LULC was under a high to very high fragmentation potential zone that requires to be protected with direct measures. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the number of patches significantly influenced the fragmentation probability model, while the largest patch index was the least sensitive parameter for modeling.

TI  - The September 2019 floods in Spain: An example of the utility of satellite data for the analysis of extreme hydrometeorological events
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Major floods in Spain in September 9-13, 2019 resulted in seven casualties and massive losses to agriculture, property and infrastructure. This paper investigates the utility of satellite data to: (1) characterize the event when input into a hydrological model, and to provide an accurate picture of the evolution of the floods; and (2) inform meteorologists in real time in order to complement model forecasts. It is shown that the precipitation estimates from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory (GPM-CO, available since 2014) and the merged satellite estimates provide an extraordinary improvement over previous technologies to monitor severe hydrometeorological episodes in near real time. In spite of known biases and errors, these new satellite precipitation estimates can be of broad practical interest to deal with emergencies and long-term readiness, especially for semi-arid areas potentially affected by ongoing global warming. Comparisons of satellite data of the September event with model outputs and more direct observations such as rain gauges and ground radars reinforce the idea that satellites are fundamental for an appropriate management of hydrometeorological events.

TI  - Influence of multi-scale dynamics on the vertical nitrate distribution around the Kuroshio Extension: An investigation based on BGC-Argo and satellite data
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - The vertical delivery of nutrients from deep water into the euphotic zone is one of the major limitations for the ocean primary productivity. In this study, the influence of multi-scale dynamics on the nitrate distribution observed by two BGC-Argo floats around the Kuroshio Extension is investigated. Vertical fluctuations of isonitrate surfaces and isopycnals were found to be correlated to the variation of absolute dynamic topography. In the subtropical Northwestern Pacific Ocean, subsurface nitrate concentration was found to be elevated inside a cyclonic mesoscale eddy during summer, while little nitrate was supplied into the surface layer, which was possibly due to the inhibition of seasonal thermocline. On the northern edge of the Kuroshio Extension, elevated euphotic-layer nitrate and surface chlorophyll concentrations were observed along the periphery of an anticyclonic eddy. In addition to horizontal advection, upwelling induced by the submesoscale dynamics is suggested to likely play an important role in the enhancements of nitrate and chlorophyll concentrations. The enhanced vertical delivery of nutrients from depth due to submesoscale dynamics has been hypothesized as a significant source for some satellite-observed events of high surface chlorophyll concentration, but direct evidence from in-situ observations is lacking. In this study, the synchronous occurrence of elevated nitrate and chlorophyll concentrations along the periphery of an anti-cyclonic eddy provides an evidence to support this hypothesis to some extent.
