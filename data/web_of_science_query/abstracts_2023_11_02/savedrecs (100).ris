M3  - Article
AB  - Background The frequency of self-reported food sensitivity (SFS) is increasing, and has a negative impact on the well-being and everyday functioning of the affected people. A considerable proportion of SFS cannot be medically explained. The lack of knowledge of its origin and treatment causes further stress in those affected.Purpose This study aims to get a better understanding of the psychological background of the condition.Methods A non-representative community sample (N=335; age: 35.1 +/- 13.18 yrs; 75.8% female) completed an English on-line questionnaire assessing somatosensory amplification, health anxiety, modern health worries (MHWs), beliefs concerning the scientific validity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), holistic beliefs on health and illness.Results In multiple binary logistic regression analyses, SFS were associated with CAM related beliefs, somatosensory amplification, and health anxiety after controlling for age and gender. The connection between somatosensory amplification and SFS were completely mediated by health anxiety. No differences between the two groups were found with respect to MHWs, worries about the harmful effects of various artificial components in food, and holistic health beliefs. Discussion: More positive attitudes toward CAM might be based on the lack of conventional treatment, rather than on higher levels of MHWs or a more holistic worldview. Both the existence of symptoms and the presence of health anxiety might be needed for the development and maintenance of SFS.Conclusions The findings support the notion that somatosensory amplification and health anxiety might play a role in the development and maintenance of SFS.

TI  - Malaria incidence trends and their association with climatic variables in rural Gwanda, Zimbabwe, 2005-2015
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malaria is a public health problem in Zimbabwe. Although many studies have indicated that climate change may influence the distribution of malaria, there is paucity of information on its trends and association with climatic variables in Zimbabwe. To address this shortfall, the trends of malaria incidence and its interaction with climatic variables in rural Gwanda, Zimbabwe for the period January 2005 to April 2015 was assessed.Methods: Retrospective data analysis of reported cases of malaria in three selected Gwanda district rural wards (Buvuma, Ntalale and Selonga) was carried out. Data on malaria cases was collected from the district health information system and ward clinics while data on precipitation and temperature were obtained from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data (CHIRPS) database and the moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) satellite data, respectively. Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNLM) were used to determine the temporal lagged association between monthly malaria incidence and monthly climatic variables.Results: There were 246 confirmed malaria cases in the three wards with a mean incidence of 0.16/1000 population/month. The majority of malaria cases (95%) occurred in the >5 years age category. The results showed no correlation between trends of clinical malaria (unconfirmed) and confirmed malaria cases in all the three study wards. There was a significant association between malaria incidence and the climatic variables in Buvuma and Selonga wards at specific lag periods. In Ntalale ward, only precipitation (1- and 3-month lag) and mean temperature (1- and 2-month lag) were significantly associated with incidence at specific lag periods (p < 0.05). DLNM results suggest a key risk period in current month, based on key climatic conditions in the 1-4 month period prior.Conclusions: As the period of high malaria risk is associated with precipitation and temperature at 1-4 month prior in a seasonal cycle, intensifying malaria control activities over this period will likely contribute to lowering the seasonal malaria incidence.

TI  - Probabilistic forecasting in infectious disease epidemiology: the 13th Armitage lecture
T2  - STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Routine surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases gives rise to daily or weekly counts of reported cases stratified by region and age group. From a public health perspective, forecasts of infectious disease spread are of central importance. We argue that such forecasts need to properly incorporate the attached uncertainty, so they should be probabilistic in nature. However, forecasts also need to take into account temporal dependencies inherent to communicable diseases, spatial dynamics through human travel and social contact patterns between age groups. We describe a multivariate time series model for weekly surveillance counts on norovirus gastroenteritis from the 12 city districts of Berlin, in six age groups, from week 2011/27 to week 2015/26. The following year (2015/27 to 2016/26) is used to assess the quality of the predictions. Probabilistic forecasts of the total number of cases can be derived through Monte Carlo simulation, but first and second moments are also available analytically. Final size forecasts as well as multivariate forecasts of the total number of cases by age group, by district and by week are compared across different models of varying complexity. This leads to a more general discussion of issues regarding modelling, prediction and evaluation of public health surveillance data. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Cirrus cloud retrieval with MSG/SEVIRI using artificial neural networks
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cirrus clouds play an important role in climate as they tend to warm the Earth-atmosphere system. Nevertheless their physical properties remain one of the largest sources of uncertainty in atmospheric research. To better understand the physical processes of cirrus clouds and their climate impact, enhanced satellite observations are necessary. In this paper we present a new algorithm, CiPS (Cirrus Properties from SEVIRI), that detects cirrus clouds and retrieves the corresponding cloud top height, ice optical thickness and ice water path using the SEVIRI imager aboard the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation satellites. CiPS utilises a set of artificial neural networks trained with SEVIRI thermal observations, CALIOP backscatter products, the ECMWF surface temperature and auxiliary data.CiPS detects 71 and 95% of all cirrus clouds with an optical thickness of 0.1 and 1.0, respectively, that are retrieved by CALIOP. Among the cirrus-free pixels, CiPS classifies 96% correctly. With respect to CALIOP, the cloud top height retrieved by CiPS has a mean absolute percentage error of 10% or less for cirrus clouds with a top height greater than 8 km. For the ice optical thickness, CiPS has a mean absolute percentage error of 50% or less for cirrus clouds with an optical thickness between 0.35 and 1.8 and of 100% or less for cirrus clouds with an optical thickness down to 0.07 with respect to the optical thickness retrieved by CALIOP. The ice water path retrieved by CiPS shows a similar performance, with mean absolute percentage errors of 100% or less for cirrus clouds with an ice water path down to 1.7 gm(-2). Since the training reference data from CALIOP only include ice water path and optical thickness for comparably thin clouds, CiPS also retrieves an opacity flag, which tells us whether a re-trieved cirrus is likely to be too thick for CiPS to accurately derive the ice water path and optical thickness.By retrieving CALIOP-like cirrus properties with the large spatial coverage and high temporal resolution of SEVIRI during both day and night, CiPS is a powerful tool for analysing the temporal evolution of cirrus clouds including their optical and physical properties. To demonstrate this, the life cycle of a thin cirrus cloud is analysed.

TI  - Clinical significance of MSKCC nomogram on guiding the application of touch imprint cytology and frozen section in intraoperative assessment of breast sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - The widely practiced intra-operative methods for rapid evaluation and detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) status include frozen section (FS) and touch imprint cytology (TIC). This study optimized the use of TIC and FS in the intra-operative detection of breast SLNs based on the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram. Three hundred forty-two SLNs were removed from 79 patients. SLN metastatic probability was assessed by the MSKCC nomogram. The SLNs underwent intra-operative TIC and FS, as well as routine post-operative paraffin sections (RPSs). The relationships between TIC, FS, and SLN metastatic probability were analyzed. Overall, TIC was more sensitive than FS (92.31% vs. 76.92%), while TIC specificity was inferior to FS specificity (84.85% vs. 100%). In addition, the best cut-off value for TIC based on the MSKCC nomogram was inferior to the best FS cutoff value (22.5% vs. 34.5%). All patients with a MSKCC value <22.5% in the present study were negative based on FS and RPS, while the true-negative and false-positive rates for TIC were 92.5% and 7.5%, respectively. Thus, early breast cancer patients, based on a MSKCC value <22.5%, can safely avoid FS, but should have TIC performed intra-operatively. Patients with a MSKCC value >22.5% should have TIC and FS to determine the size of metastases, whether or not to proceed with axillary lymph node dissection, and to avoid easily missed metastases.

TI  - Spatial Patterns of Summer Speedup on South Central Alaska Glaciers
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal changes in glacier basal motion are attributable to variations in subglacial hydrology and cause variations in both ice discharge and glacier erosion. We develop a novel workflow based upon Landsat 8 feature tracking to document differences between spatial patterns of summer and winter glacier surface speed, which reflect changes in the distribution of basal motion. We identify and characterize summer speedups on 13 of 19 land-terminating glaciers in Alaska's Wrangell-St Elias Ranges. The speedups are relatively uniform over much of the ablation zones, and the speedup magnitudes vary by only a factor of similar to 2 between glaciers whose velocities span an order of magnitude. Summer speedups extend up to similar to 30km up glacier from termini and often end at the bases of icefalls. These data provide systematic observation of the spatial pattern of enhanced summer glacier basal motion and suggest the possibility of its parameterization in glacier models.

TI  - Preliminary report of an autochthonous chikungunya outbreak in France, July to September 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In August 2017, an autochthonous chikungunya case was reported in south-east France. By mid-September, eight additional autochthonous cases were found in the index case's neighbourhood, where the chikungunya virus vector Aedes albopictus was observed. Genomic characterisation identified an East-Central South African (ECSA) lineage strain, probably from the Central African region and carrying an adaptive mutation facilitating transmission by Ae. albopictus. The event confirms we need early case detection and response to contain chikungunya in Europe.

TI  - Widespread distribution of mcr-1-bearing bacteria in the ecosystem, 2015 to 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recently discovered colistin resistance-encoding element, mcr-1, adds to the list of mobile resistance genes whose products rapidly erode the antimicrobial efficacy of not only the commonly used antibiotics, but also the last line agents of carbapenems and colistin. The relative prevalence of mcr-1-bearing strains in various ecological niches including 1,371 food samples, 480 animal faecal samples, 150 human faecal samples and 34 water samples was surveyed using a novel in-house method. Bacteria bearing mcr-1 were commonly detected in water (71% of samples), animal faeces (51%), food products (36%), and exhibited stable carriage in 28% of human subjects surveyed. Such strains, which exhibited variable antibiotic susceptibility profiles, belonged to various Enterobacteriaceae species, with Escherichia coli being the most dominant in each specimen type. The mcr-1 gene was detectable in the chromosome as well as plasmids of various sizes. Among these, two conjugative plasmids of sizes ca 33 and ca 60 kb were found to be the key vectors that mediated mcr-1 transmission in organisms residing in various ecological niches. The high mcr-1 carriage rate in humans found in this study highlights the importance of continued vigilance, careful antibiotic stewardship, and the development of new antimicrobials.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of sand dune bidirectional reflectance characteristics for absolute radiometric calibration of optical remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Attempts to use pseudoinvariant calibration sites (PICS) for establishing absolute radiometric calibration of Earth observation (EO) satellites requires high-quality information about the nature of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of the surfaces used for these calibrations. Past studies have shown that the PICS method is useful for evaluating the trend of sensors over time or for the intercalibration of sensors. The PICS method was not considered until recently for deriving absolute radiometric calibration. This paper presents BRDF data collected by a high-performance portable goniometer system to develop a temporal BRDF model for the Algodones Dunes in California. By sampling the BRDF of the sand surface at similar solar zenith angles to those normally encountered by EO satellites, additional information on the changing nature of the surface can improve models used to provide absolute radiometric correction. The results demonstrated that the BRDF of a reasonably simple sand surface was complex with changes in anisotropy taking place in response to changing solar zenith angles. For the majority of observation and illumination angles, the spectral reflectance anisotropy observed varied between 1% and 5% in patterns that repeat around solar noon.

TI  - Annual Irrigation Dynamics in the US Northern High Plains Derived from Landsat Satellite Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable management of agricultural water resources requires improved understanding of irrigation patterns in space and time. We produced annual, high-resolution (30 m) irrigation maps for 1999-2016 by combining all available Landsat satellite imagery with climate and soil covariables in Google Earth Engine. Random forest classification had accuracies from 92 to 100% and generally agreed with county statistics (r(2) = 0.88-0.96). Two novel indices that integrate plant greenness and moisture information show promise for improving satellite classification of irrigation. We found considerable interannual variability in irrigation location and extent, including a near doubling between 2002 and 2016. Statistical modeling suggested that precipitation and commodity price influenced irrigated extent through time. High prices incentivized expansion to increase crop yield and profit, but dry years required greater irrigation intensity, thus reducing area in this supply-limited region. Data sets produced with this approach can improve water sustainability by providing consistent, spatially explicit tracking of irrigation dynamics over time.Plain Language Summary Irrigated agriculture is the world's largest consumer of global freshwater. In order to effectively use limited water supplies, managers need to understand when and where irrigation occurs. We fill this knowledge gap by using satellite images to produce annual maps of irrigation for 1999-2016 in a large, economically important agricultural region in the central United States that must manage its water supply for multiple users. We then used these maps to study changes in irrigation over time. We were surprised to find that the total area and individual locations of irrigated fields changed substantially from year to year. Our analysis suggests that farmers expanded irrigation when crop prices were high to increase crop yield and profit. We initially expected to also see increases in drought years to compensate for lack of rainfall, but instead, we found the opposite: irrigated area decreased in dry years. Looking closer, we realized that this happened because farmers had to irrigate more heavily over each field, which reduced the number of fields they could irrigate due to limited water supply. These irrigation maps consistently track irrigation over time and are freely available for others to use to help manage water sustainably and meet food needs.

TI  - Management of a Lassa fever outbreak, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rapid diagnosis and isolation of imported cases, community outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are considered unlikely in industrialised countries. In March 2016, the first documented locally acquired case of Lassa fever (LF) outside Africa occurred, demonstrating the disease's potential as a cross-border health threat. We describe the management surrounding this case of LF in Rhineland-Palatinate - the German federal state where secondary transmission occurred. Twelve days after having been exposed to the corpse of a LF case imported from Togo, a symptomatic undertaker tested positive for Lassa virus RNA. Potential contacts were traced, categorised based on exposure risk, and monitored. Overall, we identified 21 contact persons with legal residency in Rhineland-Palatinate: seven related to the index case, 13 to the secondary case, and one related to both. The secondary case received treatment and recovered. Five contacts were quarantined and one was temporarily banned from work. No further transmission occurred. Based on the experience gained during the outbreak and a review of national and international guidelines, we conclude that exposure risk attributable to corpses may currently be underestimated, and we present suggestions that may help to improve the anti-epidemic response to imported VHF cases in industrialised countries.

AB  - Foliar pigment contents and composition are main factors governing absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, photosynthetic activity, and physiological status of vegetation. In this study the performance of nondestructive techniques based on leaf reflectance were tested for estimating chlorophyll (Chl) and anthocyanin (AnC) contents in species with widely variable leaf structure, pigment content, and composition. Only three spectral bands (green, red edge, and near-infrared) are required for nondestructive Chl and AnC estimation with normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) below 4.5% and 6.1%, respectively. The algorithms developed are generic, not requiring reparameterization for each species allowing for accurate nondestructive Chl and AnC estimation using simple handheld field/lab instrumentation. They also have potential in interpretation of airborne and satellite data.Plain Language Summary The paper presents generic algorithms for nondestructive estimation of foliar pigment contents and composition which are main factors governing absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, photosynthetic activity, and physiological status of vegetation.

TI  - Assessing multi-decadal land-cover - land-use change in two wildlife protected areas in Tanzania using Landsat imagery
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape change in and around protected areas is of concern worldwide given the potential impacts of such change on biodiversity. Given such impacts, we sought to understand the extent of changes in different land-cover types at two protected areas, Tarangire and Katavi National Parks in Tanzania, over the past 27 years. Using Maximum Likelihood classification procedures we derived eight land-cover classes from Landsat TM and ETM+ images, including: woody savannah, savannah, grassland, open and closed shrubland, swamp and water, and bare land. We determined the extent and direction of changes for all land-cover classes using a post-classification comparison technique. The results show declines in woody savannah and increases in barren land and swamps inside and outside Tarangire National Park and increases in woody savannah and savannah, and declines of shrubland and grassland inside and outside Katavi National Park. The decrease of woody savannah was partially due to its conversion into grassland and barren land, possibly caused by human encroachment by cultivation and livestock. Based upon these changes, we recommend management actions to prevent detrimental effects on wildlife populations.

TI  - Periodic Emission Within Jupiter's Main Auroral Oval
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have discovered pulsating emission within Jupiter's main auroral oval, providing evidence of the auroral signature of Jovian ULF wave processes. The form comprises a 1 degrees x 2 degrees spot located directly on the main emission, whose intensity oscillates with a period of similar to 10 min throughout the 45 min observation. The feature appears on the duskward edge of the discontinuity, maps to similar to 13-14 h LT and similar to 20-50 R-J, and rotates at around a half of rigid corotation. We show that the period of the oscillation is similar to the expected Alfven travel time between the ionosphere and the upper edge of the equatorial plasma sheet in the middle magnetosphere, and we thus suggest that the pulsating aurora is driven by a mode confined to the low-density region outside the plasma sheet. This significant new observation shows that Jupiter's auroras present an important remote sensing window on Jovian magnetospheric wave processes.

TI  - Improving SWAT model performance in the upper Blue Nile Basin using meteorological data integration and subcatchment discretization
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Blue Nile Basin is confronted by land degradation problems, insufficient agricultural production, and a limited number of developed energy sources. Hydrological models provide useful tools to better understand such complex systems and improve water resources and land management practices. In this study, SWAT was used to model the hydrological processes in the upper Blue Nile Basin. Comparisons between a Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and a conventional ground weather dataset were done under two sub-basin discretization levels (30 and 87 sub-basins) to create an integrated dataset to improve the spatial and temporal limitations of both datasets. A SWAT error index (SEI) was also proposed to compare the reliability of the models under different discretization levels and weather datasets. This index offers an assessment of the model quality based on precipitation and evapotranspiration. SEI demonstrates to be a reliable additional and useful method to measure the level of error of SWAT. The results showed the discrepancies of using different weather datasets with different sub-basin discretization levels. Datasets under 30 sub-basins achieved Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) values of -0.51, 0.74, and 0.84; p factors of 0.53, 0.66, and 0.70; and r factors of 1.11, 0.83, and 0.67 for the CFSR, ground, and integrated datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, models under 87 sub-basins achieved NS values of 1.54, 0.43, and 0.80; p factors of 0.36, 0.67, and 0.77; r factors of 0.93, 0.68, and 0.54 for the CFSR, ground, and integrated datasets, respectively. Based on the obtained statistical results, the integrated dataset provides a better model of the upper Blue Nile Basin.

TI  - Mass coral bleaching due to unprecedented marine heatwave in Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - 2014 marked the sixth and most widespread mass bleaching event reported in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, home to the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument (PMNM), the world's second largest marine reserve. This event was associated with an unusual basin-scale warming in the North Pacific Ocean, with an unprecedented peak intensity of around 20 degrees C-weeks of cumulative heat stress at Lisianksi Island. In situ bleaching surveys and satellite data were used to evaluate the relative importance of potential drivers of bleaching patterns in 2014, assess the subsequent morality and its effects on coral communities and 3D complexity, test for signs of regional acclimation, and investigate long-term change in heat stress in PMNM. Surveys conducted at four island/atoll (French Frigate Shoals, Lisianski Island, Pearl and Hermes Atoll, and Midway Atoll) showed that in 2014, percent bleaching varied considerably between islands/atolls and habitats (back reef/fore reef and depth), and was up to 91% in shallow habitats at Lisianski. The percent bleaching during the 2014 event was best explained by a combination of duration of heat stress measured by Coral Reef Watch's satellite Degree Heating Week, relative community susceptibility (bleaching susceptibility score of each taxon * the taxon's abundance relative to the total number of colonies), depth and region. Mean coral cover at permanent Lisianski monitoring sites decreased by 68% due to severe losses of Montipora dilatata complex, resulting in rapid reductions in habitat complexity. Spatial distribution of the 2014 bleaching was significantly different from the 2002 and 2004 bleaching events likely due to a combination of differences in heat stress and local acclimatization. Historical satellite data demonstrated heat stress in 2014 was unlike any previous event and that the exposure of corals to the bleaching-level heat stress has increased significantly in the northern PMNM since 1982, highlighting the increasing threat of climate change to reefs.

TI  - Retrieving near-global aerosol loading over land and ocean from AVHRR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spaceborne advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) sensor data record is approaching 40 years, providing a crucial asset for studying long-term trends of aerosol properties regionally and globally. However, due to limitations of its channels' information content, aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from AVHRR over land are still largely lacking. In this paper, we describe a new physics-based algorithm to retrieve aerosol loading over both land and ocean from AVHRR for the first time. The over-land algorithm is an extension of our Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue algorithm, while a simplified version of our Satellite Ocean Aerosol Retrieval algorithm is used over ocean. We compare retrieved AVHRR AOD with that from MODIS on a daily and seasonal basis and find, in general, good agreement between the two. For the satellites with equatorial crossing times within 2 h of solar noon, the spatial coverage of the AVHRR aerosol product is comparable to that of MODIS, except over very bright arid regions (such as the Sahara), where the underlying surface reflectance at 630 nm reaches the critical surface reflectance. Based upon comparisons of the AVHRR AOD against Aerosol Robotic Network data, preliminary results indicate that the expected error confidence interval envelope is around +/-(0.03 + 15%) over ocean and +/-(0.05 + 25%) over land for this first version of the AVHRR aerosol products. Consequently, these new AVHRR aerosol products can contribute important building blocks for constructing a consistent long-term data record for climate studies.

TI  - Investigating the Seasonal and Diurnal Cycles of Ocean Vector Winds Near the Philippines Using RapidScat and CCMP
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal and diurnal cycles of ocean vector winds in the domain of the South China Sea are characterized and compared using RapidScat and the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) data sets. Broad agreement in seasonal flow patterns exists between these data sets during the year 2015. Both observe the dramatic reversal from wintertime trade winds (November-April) to westerly flow associated with the summer monsoon (May-October). These seasonal changes have strong but not equivalent effects on mean wind divergence patterns in both data sets. Specifically near the Philippines, the data sets agree on several aspects of the seasonal mean and diurnal cycle of near-surface vector winds and divergence. In particular, RapidScat and CCMP agree that daytime onshore and nocturnal offshore flow patterns affect the diurnal cycle of winds up to similar to 200 km west of Luzon, Philippines. Observed disagreements over the diurnal cycle are explainable by measurement uncertainty, as well as shortcomings in both data sets.Plain Language Summary It is important to know how satellite-based wind data sets compare with one another, in order to understand basic wind patterns in the South China Sea-an area that is strategically important to many countries. The seasonal and daily variability of low-altitude winds over the South China Sea was studied using two independent satellite data sets that report both wind speed and direction. One of these data sets spans a few decades, while the other is much shorter but more precisely measures the daily cycle of winds. The two data sets agree well on seasonal wind shifts during the year 2015. Both observe the dramatic reversal from winter trade winds (November-April) to the summer monsoon (May-October). Both data sets also agree on wind shifts throughout a typical day near the island of Luzon in the northern Philippines. Relative to the average wind pattern, in the morning winds blow onshore, while overnight they reverse and blow offshore as far as 200 km from the coast. The results give us confidence that we can use both data sets to understand different parts of the wind climatology near the Philippines.

TI  - Mapping land cover change over continental Africa using Landsat and Google Earth Engine cloud computing
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying and monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of the global land cover is critical for better understanding many of the Earth's land surface processes. However, the lack of regularly updated, continental-scale, and high spatial resolution (30 m) land cover data limit our ability to better understand the spatial extent and the temporal dynamics of land surface changes. Despite the free availability of high spatial resolution Landsat satellite data, continental-scale land cover mapping using high resolution Landsat satellite data was not feasible until now due to the need for high-performance computing to store, process, and analyze this large volume of high resolution satellite data. In this study, we present an approach to quantify continental land cover and impervious surface changes over a long period of time (15 years) using high resolution Landsat satellite observations and Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The approach applied here to overcome the computational challenges of handling big earth observation data by using cloud computing can help scientists and practitioners who lack high-performance computational resources.

TI  - Troposphere-Stratosphere Temperature Trends Derived From Satellite Data Compared With Ensemble Simulations From WACCM
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Decadal-scale trends in tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures derived from satellite measurements over 1979-2014 are compared with ensemble simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). The model is forced with observed sea surface temperatures, changes in greenhouse gases, and ozone-depleting substances, plus solar and volcanic effects, and results from five WACCM realizations (with slightly different initial conditions) are analyzed. We focus on the vertical structure of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling increasing with height, the latitudinal and seasonal dependence of trends, and on the temporal evolution of stratospheric temperatures in response to stratospheric ozone depletion and partial recovery. The model captures the observed trend structure in most respects, and the ensemble of simulations provides quantitative estimates of the impact of internal variability on trend estimates. In regions of low variability (e.g., over low latitudes) the ensemble mean trends agree with the observations, while in regions of high variability (e.g., the polar stratosphere) the observations mostly fall within the range of realizations. Temperature response to evolving stratospheric ozone is evaluated by computing separate trends over 1979-1997 (ozone depletion) and 1998-2014 (partial recovery). Robust changes in temperature trends between these periods occur in the global upper stratosphere and in the Antarctic spring lower stratosphere, with consistent behavior between model and observations. Observed lower stratospheric temperatures in the Antarctic show statistically significant warming after 1998, reflecting recently reported healing of the ozone hole.Plain Language Summary This work compares temperature trends during 1979-2014 measured by satellites with results from a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model, incorporating observed forcings including observed sea surface temperatures and changes in greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances, plus solar cycle and volcanic effects. We analyze an ensemble of five different model simulations (with slightly different initial conditions) to evaluate effects of internal climate variability on temperature trends. Temperature trends show good quantitative agreement between model and observations, including troposphere warming and stratosphere cooling increasing with altitude. This agreement demonstrates that the satellite-observed temperature changes are a result of known forcings, both natural and anthropogenic. Stratospheric temperatures reflect the influence of stratospheric ozone depletion and partial recovery, with stronger cooling during the first half of the record. Satellite measurements identify a warming of the Antarctic lower stratosphere since 1998, as a response to the recently reported "healing" of the Antarctic ozone hole.

TI  - Evaluation of NASA Deep Blue/SOAR aerosol retrieval algorithms applied to AVHRR measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deep Blue (DB) and Satellite Ocean Aerosol Retrieval (SOAR) algorithms have previously been applied to observations from sensors like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) to provide records of midvisible aerosol optical depth (AOD) and related quantities over land and ocean surfaces, respectively. Recently, DB and SOAR have also been applied to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations from several platforms (NOAA11, NOAA14, and NOAA18), to demonstrate the potential for extending the DB and SOAR AOD records. This study provides an evaluation of the initial version (V001) of the resulting AVHRR-based AOD data set, including validation against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and ship-borne observations, and comparison against both other AVHRR AOD records and MODIS/SeaWiFS products at select long-term AERONET sites. Although it is difficult to distil error characteristics into a simple expression, the results suggest that one standard deviation confidence intervals on retrieved AOD of +/-(0.03 + 15%) over water and +/-(0.05 + 25%) over land represent the typical level of uncertainty, with a tendency toward negative biases in high-AOD conditions, caused by a combination of algorithmic assumptions and sensor calibration issues. Most of the available validation data are for NOAA18 AVHRR, although performance appears to be similar for the NOAA11 and NOAA14 sensors as well.Plain Language Summary Aerosols are small particles in the atmosphere like desert dust, volcanic ash, smoke, industrial haze, and sea spray. Understanding them is important for applications such as hazard avoidance, air quality and human health, and climate studies. Satellite instruments provide an important tool to study aerosol loadings over the world. This paper evaluates a new satellite-based data set of aerosol loading, from a set of instruments called the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs), using ground-based observations and by comparing to other satellite data products.

TI  - Observation-Based Study on Aerosol Optical Depth and Particle Size in Partly Cloudy Regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study seeks to help better understand aerosol-cloud interactions by examining statistical relationships between aerosol properties and nearby low-altitude cloudiness using satellite data. The analysis of a global data set of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations reveals that the positive correlation between cloudiness and aerosol optical depth (AOD) reported in earlier studies is strong throughout the globe and during both winter and summer. Typically, AOD is 30-50% higher on cloudier-than-average days than on less cloudy days. A combination of satellite observations and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 global reanalysis data reveals that the correlation between cloud cover and AOD is strong for all aerosol types considered: sulfate, dust, carbon, and sea salt. The observations also indicate that in the presence of nearby clouds, aerosol size distributions tend to shift toward smaller particles over large regions of the Earth. This is consistent with a greater cloud-related increase in the AOD of fine-mode than of coarse-mode particles. The greater increase in fine-mode AOD implies that the cloudiness-AOD correlation does not come predominantly from cloud detection uncertainties. Additionally, the results show that aerosol particle size increases near clouds even in regions where it decreases with increasing cloudiness. This suggests that the decrease with cloudiness comes mainly from changes in large-scale environment, rather than from clouds increasing the number or the size of fine-mode aerosols. Finally, combining different aerosol retrieval algorithms demonstrated that quality assessment flags based on local variability can help identifying when the observed aerosol populations are affected by surrounding clouds.

TI  - Tumour mutation status and sites of metastasis in patients with cutaneous melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cutaneous melanoma can metastasise haematogenously and/or lymphogenously to form satellite/in-transit, lymph node or distant metastasis. This study aimed to determine if BRAF and NRAS mutant and wild-type tumours differ in their site of first tumour metastasis and anatomical metastatic pathway.Methods: Prospective cohort of patients with a histologically confirmed primary cutaneous melanoma at three tertiary referral centres in Melbourne, Australia from 2010 to 2015. Multinomial regression determined clinical, histological and mutational factors associated with the site of first metastasis and metastatic pathway.Results: Of 1048 patients, 306 (29%) developed metastasis over a median 4.7 year follow-up period. 73 (24%), 192 (63%) and 41 (13%) developed distant, regional lymph node and satellite/in-transit metastasis as the first site of metastasis, respectively. BRAF mutation was associated with lymph node metastasis (adjusted RRR 2.46 95% CI 1.07-5.69, P = 0.04) and sentinel lymph node positivity (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.14-2.10, P = 0.005). BRAF mutation and NRAS mutation were associated with increased odds of developing liver metastasis (aOR 3.09, 95% CI 1.49-6.42, P = 0.003; aOR 3.17, 95% CI 1.32-7.58, P = 0.01) and central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (aOR 4.65, 95% CI 2.23-9.69, P<0.001; aOR 4.03, 95% CI 1.72-9.44, P = 0.001). NRAS mutation was associated with lung metastasis (aOR 2.44, 95% CI 1.21-4.93, P = 0.01).Conclusions: BRAF mutation was found to be associated with lymph node metastasis as first metastasis and sentinel lymph node positivity. BRAF and NRAS mutations were associated with CNS and liver metastasis and NRAS mutation with lung metastasis. If these findings are validated in additional prospective studies, a role for heightened visceral organ surveillance may be warranted in patients with tumours harbouring these somatic mutations.

TI  - Clinical application and outcomes of sentinel node navigation surgery in patients with early gastric cancer
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) has been recognized as a minimally invasive tool for individualized lymphadenectomy in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC). The aim of this study was to compare clinicopathological factors, adverse events, and clinical outcomes between sentinel node mapping (SNM) and SN dissection (SND) groups and assess the clinical utility of SNNS in patients with EGC. The clinical data of 157 patients with EGC, diagnosed as clinical T1N0M0 with tumors <= 40 mm, undergoing SNNS between March 2004 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Twentyseven patients were excluded from the analysis. In the remaining 130 patients, 59 and 71 patients underwent standard lymphadenectomy for SNM and SND, respectively. The sentinel node detection rate in the SNM and SND groups was 98.3% (58/59) and 100% (71/71), respectively. Two (3.5%), 15 (25.9%), and 41 (70.7%) patients having sentinel nodes underwent total gastrectomy, proximal gastrectomy (PG), and distal gastrectomy (DG), respectively, in the SNM group. One (1.4%), 5 (7.0%), 10 (14.1%), 39 (54.9%), and 16 (22.5%) patients underwent PG, DG, segmental gastrectomy, local resection, and endoscopic submucosal dissection, respectively, in the SND group. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the SNM and SND groups (P = 0.781). Survival did not differ between the both groups (P = 0.856). The present results suggest that personalized surgery with SND provides technical safety and curability related with a favorable survival outcome in patients with EGC.

TI  - A high-resolution and observationally constrained OMI NO<sub>2</sub> satellite retrieval
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a new high-resolution NO2 dataset derived from the NASA Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 version 3.0 retrieval that can be used to estimate surface-level concentrations. The standard NASA product uses NO2 vertical profile shape factors from a 1.25 degrees x 1 degrees (similar to 110 km x 110 km) resolution Global Model Initiative (GMI) model simulation to calculate air mass factors, a critical value used to determine observed tropospheric NO2 vertical columns. To better estimate vertical profile shape factors, we use a high-resolution (1.33 km x 1.33 km) Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulation constrained by in situ aircraft observations to recalculate tropospheric air mass factors and tropospheric NO2 vertical columns during summertime in the eastern US. In this new product, OMI NO2 tropospheric columns increase by up to 160% in city centers and decrease by 20-50% in the rural areas outside of urban areas when compared to the operational NASA product. Our new product shows much better agreement with the Pandora NO2 and Airborne Compact Atmospheric Mapper (ACAM) NO2 spectrometer measurements acquired during the DISCOVER-AQ Maryland field campaign. Furthermore, the correlation between our satellite product and EPA NO2 monitors in urban areas has improved dramatically: r(2) = 0.60 in the new product vs. r(2) = 0.39 in the operational product, signifying that this new product is a better indicator of surface concentrations than the operational product. Our work emphasizes the need to use both high-resolution and high-fidelity models in order to recalculate satellite data in areas with large spatial heterogeneities in NO x emissions. Although the current work is focused on the eastern US, the methodology developed in this work can be applied to other world regions to produce high-quality region-specific NO2 satellite retrievals.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Modeling for Fine-Scale Maps of Regional Malaria Endemicity and its Implications for Transitional Complexities in a Rountine Surveillance Network in Western Cambodia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the associated and substantial efforts of many stakeholders involved in malaria containment, the disease burden of malaria has dramatically decreased in many malaria-endemic countries in recent years. Some decades after the past efforts of the global malaria eradication program, malaria elimination has again featured on the global health agenda. While risk distribution modeling and a mapping approach are effective tools to assist with the efficient allocation of limited health-care resources, these methods need some adjustment and reexamination in accordance with changes occurring in relation to malaria elimination. Limited available data, fine-scale data inaccessibility (for example, household or individual case data), and the lack of reliable data due to inefficiencies within the routine surveillance system, make it difficult to create reliable risk maps for decision-makers or health-care practitioners in the field. Furthermore, the risk of malaria may dynamically change due to various factors such as the progress of containment interventions and environmental changes. To address the complex and dynamic nature of situations in low-to-moderate malaria transmission settings, we built a spatiotemporal model of a standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) of malaria incidence, calculated through annual parasite incidence, using routinely reported surveillance data in combination with environmental indices such as remote sensing data, and the non-environmental regional containment status, to create fine-scale risk maps. A hierarchical Bayesian frame was employed to fit the transitioning malaria risk data onto the map. The model was set to estimate the SMRs of every study location at specific time intervals within its uncertainty range. Using the spatial interpolation of estimated SMRs at village level, we created fine-scale maps of two provinces in western Cambodia at specific time intervals. The maps presented different patterns of malaria risk distribution at specific time intervals. Moreover, the visualized weights estimated using the risk model, and the structure of the routine surveillance network, represent the transitional complexities emerging from ever-changing regional endemic situations.

TI  - Characterization of a Multidrug-Resistant <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Serovar Heidelberg Outbreak Strain in Commercial Turkeys: Colonization, Transmission, and Host Transcriptional Response
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg (S. Heidelberg) has been associated with numerous human foodborne illness outbreaks due to consumption of poultry. For example, in 2011, an MDR S. Heidelberg outbreak associated with ground turkey sickened 136 individuals and resulted in 1 death. In response to this outbreak, 36 million pounds of ground turkey were recalled, one of the largest meat recalls in U.S. history. To investigate colonization of turkeys with an MDR S. Heidelberg strain isolated from the ground turkey outbreak, two turkey trials were performed. In experiment 1, 3-week-old turkeys were inoculated with 10(8) or 10(10) CFU of the MDR S. Heidelberg isolate, and fecal shedding and tissue colonization were detected following colonization for up to 14 days. Turkey gene expression in response to S. Heidelberg exposure revealed 18 genes that were differentially expressed at 2 days following inoculation compared to pre-inoculation. In a second trial, 1-day-old poults were inoculated with 10(4) CFU of MDR S. Heidelberg to monitor transmission of Salmonella from inoculated poults (index group) to naive penmates (sentinel group). The transmission of MDR S. Heidelberg from index to sentinel poults was efficient with cecum colonization increasing 2 Log 10 CFU above the inoculum dose at 9 days post-inoculation. This differed from the 3-week-old poults inoculated with 10(10) CFU of MDR S. Heidelberg in experiment 1 as Salmonella fecal shedding and tissue colonization decreased over the 14-day period compared to the inoculum dose. These data suggest that young poults are susceptible to colonization by MDR S. Heidelberg, and interventions must target turkeys when they are most vulnerable to prevent Salmonella colonization and transmission in the flock. Together, the data support the growing body of literature indicating that Salmonella establishes a commensal-like condition in livestock and poultry, contributing to the asymptomatic carrier status of the human foodborne pathogen in our animal food supply.

TI  - [Clinical analysis of 76 cases of sentinel lymph node detection in cervical cancer and endometrial cancer].
T2  - Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and clinical value of identifying sentinel lymph node (SLN) and to assess possible factors associated with detection rate in both cervical cancer and endometrial cancer. Methods: Retrospective study of 76 cases (39 with cervical cancer and 37 with endometrial cancer) were conducted in Peking University People's Hospital. All patients underwent SLN biopsy with tracers of indocyanine green (ICG) and (or) carbon nanoparticles. All mapped SLN was resected and followed by procedures that systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy and hysterectomy according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. All the lymph nodes were examined postoperatively for the routine paraffin section of hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value of SLN were calculated and factors associated with the detection rate were analyzed. Results: The overall detection rate was 95% (72/76), with 74% (56/76) positive bilaterally. The bilateral detection rate of SLN with combined technique was significantly higher than that with single technique (P<0.05). The difference of SLN detection rate between cervical and endometrial cancer patients were not significant (P>0.05). SLN were mostly recognized in obturator (32.1%, 114/355) and external iliac areas (32.4%, 115/355) in cervical cancer, and in external iliac (41.2%, 91/221) and obturator areas (39.4%,87/221) in endometrial cancer. Among 55 patients underwent systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy, the sensitivity of SLN detection was 75% and the negative predictive value was 96%. The sensitivity and negative predictive value were both 100% in patients with successfully bilateral mapped of SLN. Conclusion: s The overall detection rate of SLN in cervical and endometrial cancer is the highest with the combined technique of ICG and carbon nanoparticles. The detection rate and located regions of SLN are similar between cervical and endometrial cancer, and SLN are mostly recognized in the external iliac and obturator areas. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of SLN detection are high, especially when SLN are bilateral mapped.

TI  - Predicting possible effects of dams on downstream river bed changes of a Himalayan river with morphodynamic modelling
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of building large dams on downstream channel morphology was reported by several studies on the basis of historical gauged data on discharge, sediment load and channel cross-sections records for a number of large rivers in Asia. However, there has been a notable absence of scientific literature dealing with the prediction of such changes, particularly in the context of South Asia, through model building. Establishing a predictive framework will be an essential prerequisite for including the projected climate change scenarios within the ambit of this type of investigation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the role of dam construction on the downstream channel morphology of the River Teesta, an important tributary of the Brahmaputra River, with a morphodynamic model that considers the process of erosion, deposition and sediment transport. A differential GPS-aided survey, conducted in the pre-monsoon months of 2015, provided an accurate initial model geometry for Delft3D morphodynamic model. Actual discharge (Q) and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) records of monsoon 2015 were used as model inputs. Unlike the majorities of the studies that compared results of morphodynamic models with flume-based laboratory experiments, this investigation used field and satellite-based observations, collected during the monsoon of 2015, for the distributed model calibration and validation. The predicted channel bed at the end of the monsoon of 2015 was compared with spot heights surveyed during the same time with a low RMSE of 0.26 m. In order to predict the effect of dam construction in a medium-term, Delft3D was run with gauged Q and SSC data of four consecutive monsoons belonging to the pre- and post-dam period using the identical channel geometry of the pre-monsoon 2015 channel. A comparison of the final channel bed topography of the pre- and post-dam scenarios revealed a lower relative relief and decreasing channel cross-sectional areas for the later, probably caused by attenuated flood peaks.

TI  - Spatial Coupling Relationship Between Ecological Water Demand and Landscape Pattern in Depressions Among Karst Peaks in Guangxi
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Tiandong County, a region typical of depressions among Karst peaks in Guangxi was selected as the research area. Based on GIS and RS technologies and the observation data of the meteorological stations, spatial distribution of ecological water demand in the study area was plotted and simulated by ArcGlS using the Penman-Monteith method as recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Landscape pattern indices were extracted from the land use data obtained through interpretation of the Landsat 8 data for analysis of relationship between ecological water demand and landscape pattern. Results show that the annual quota of ecological water demand of the vegetation in Tiandong County varied between 85. 91 and 339. 27 mm, and it also did spatially, being high in the northern and southern mountainous areas and relatively low in the central, western and southeastern regions. Ecological water demand of vegetation was found to be significantly and negatively related to landscape diversity and fragmentation, with correlation coefficient being -0. 198 and -0. 186, respectively, while it was significantly and positively to landscape connectivity, with correlation coefficient being 0.221. All the findings in this study may serve as certain basis for optimization and management of regional landscape patterns and allocation of water resources.

TI  - Outburst flood forecasting by monitoring glacier-dammed lake using satellite images of Karakoram Mountains, China
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) that originate in the Shaksgam Valley on the northern slope of the Karakoram Mountains (China) occur frequently and they cause many local and regional disasters in the Yarkant River basin. In order to monitor and assess their hazard potential, this study used both HJ-1A/B and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI satellite images to investigate the formation-drainage processes of the Kyagar glacier-dammed lake since 2009. Results show that four formation-drainage processes of the lake occurred with estimated maximum lake water volumes of 50.7 x 10(6), 49.8 x 10(6), 49.2 x 10(6), and 34.9 x 10(6) m(3) in 2009, 2015, and in July and August 2016, respectively. A statistical relationship based on the observed lake water volume and peak discharge at the hydrometric station during 1959-2008 was found relatively effective for forecasting peak GLOF discharge with an average relative error of similar to 24% in comparison with observed values at the hydrometric station. Dynamic changes of the Kyagar Glacier, especially its advances since 2013, were directly responsible for the repeated thickening of the glacial dam and formation of the lake. This study provides an effective method for monitoring and forecasting GLOFs in the Yarkant River basin. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - <i>Gambierdiscus</i> <i>and Fukuyoa</i> species in the greater Caribbean: Regional growth projections for ciguatera-associated dinoflagellates
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived sea surface temperature data from the MODIS Aqua instrument were used to project rates of growth for four Gambierdiscus and one Fukuyoa species, dinoflagellates associated with ciguatera fish poisoning. Dinoflagellate growth rates were modelled using experimental temperature vs. growth equations and projected bottom temperatures with light penetration and bathymetry masks. Daily projected growth rates for each species were used to calculate monthly, yearly and multiyear averages between 2003 and 2013. The resulting projections were then used to characterize patterns of regional Gambierdiscus/Fukuyoa abundance and compare these to ciguatera fish poisoning incidences in the Greater Caribbean Region. Model output indicated the highest growth potential was in the shelf waters of the Caribbean Sea, with moderate growth in the Bahamas, southern Florida and Gulf of Mexico; the lowest growth potential was in the northern Gulf of Mexico and along the U.S. south Atlantic coast. Mean projected growth rates generally coincided with distribution of ciguatera fish poisoning incidences in the region, with some exceptions in the southwestern Caribbean. The results of this study indicate spatial differences in Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa growth likely play a prominent role in governing the occurrence of ciguatera fish poisoning in the greater Caribbean. Growth and distribution models may be an effective tool for ciguatera risk assessment. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dynamic response of East Asian Greater White-fronted Geese to changes of environment during migration: Use of multi-temporal species distribution model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how migratory species select habitats is essential for applied ecology and biological conservation. Although migratory species move across a wide range of environments during migration, their dynamic response to environments has rarely been considered. Taking advantage of the fine spatial-temporal resolution of satellite tracking data, we studied habitat selection of East Asian greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) along their spring migration route from Yangtze River Basin to Lena Delta and Yana Bay. We developed a novel methodology to improve dynamic species distribution models (SDMs) by incorporating environmental variables derived from remotely sensed data precisely corresponding to migration time. Our results demonstrate that distance to the nearest water body, elevation, human population density and temperature contribute greatly to the models. Water-related and topographic factors (e.g., elevation, slope and distance to the nearest water body) were consistently associated with habitat selection of the geese from wintering area to breeding area, while the varied influences of temperature and human population density in different migration periods are closely related to their adaptation to local environments. In addition, response curves of vegetation index indicate that the geese are more strongly associated with food quality than quantity in wintering area and stopover sites. By building SDMs in different periods, we provide a unique dynamic perspective on how a long-distance migrant responds to different environments. The methodology proposed here could be integrated to future conservation management plans for predicting species relationship with fast changing environmental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Implementation of a multiangle soil moisture retrieval model using RADARSAT-2 imagery over arid Juyanze, northwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate retrieval of soil moisture is important for understanding regional environmental changes and sustainable development in arid regions. Through numerical simulation and regression analysis based on advanced integral equation model (AIEM), the study aims to establish a multiangle soil moisture retrieval model based on RADARSAT-2 image in arid Juyanze. A combined roughness parameter R-s was established, and then the influences of roughness and soil moisture on the backscattering simulations were discussed. Finally, the empirical multiangle soil moisture retrieval model was implemented and validated in Juyanze. Inversion results show that the model has favorable validity. The coefficient of determination R-2 between the inferred and measured soil moisture is 0.775 with a root-mean-square error (rmse) of 0.626%, implying better retrieval accuracy. Soil moisture varies from about 0.1% to 25% and is no more than 10% in most parts of this region, which is in reasonable agreement with the factual circumstances. The model directly relates the Fresnel reflection coefficient and soil moisture and is independent of ground roughness measurements. With a wider angular range, it has great potential for soil moisture evaluation in arid regions. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

TI  - Effects of agrochemicals on disease severity of <i>Acanthostomum burminis</i> infections (Digenea: Trematoda) in the Asian common toad, <i>Duttaphrynus melanostictus</i>
T2  - BMC ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Agrochemicals are widely used in many parts of the world posing direct and indirect threats to organisms. Xenobiotic-related disease susceptibility is a common phenomenon and a proposed cause of amphibian declines and malformations. For example, parasitic infections combined with pesticides generally pose greater risk to both tadpoles and adult frogs than either factor alone. Here, we report on experimental effects of lone and combined exposures to cercariae of the digenetic trematode Acanthostomum burminis and ecologically relevant concentrations of (0.5 ppm) four pesticides (insecticides: chlorpyrifos, dimethoate; herbicides: glyphosate, propanil) on the tadpoles and metamorphs of the Asian common toad, Duttaphrynus melanostictus.Results: All 48 cercaraie successfully penetrated each host suggesting that the pesticides had no short-term detrimental effect on cercarial penetration abilities. When the two treatments were provided separately, both cercariae and pesticides significantly decreased the survival of tadpoles and metamorphs and induced developmental malformations, such as scoliosis, kyphosis, and skin ulcers. Exposure to cercariae and the two insecticides additively reduced host survival. In contrast, mortality associated with the combination of cercariae and herbicides was less than additive. The effect of cercariae on malformation incidence depended on the pesticide treatment; dimethoate, glyphosate, and propanil reduced the number of cercarial-induced malformations relative to both the control and chlorpyrifos treatments.Conclusions: These results show that ecologically relevant concentrations of the tested agrochemicals had minimal effects on trematode infections, in contrast to others studies which showed that these same treatments increased the adverse effects of these infections on tadpoles and metamorphs of the Asian common toad. These findings reinforce the importance of elucidating the complex interactions among xenobiotics and pathogens on sentinel organisms that may be indicators of risk to other biota.

TI  - Nomogram for prediction of level 2 axillary lymph node metastasis in proven level 1 node-positive breast cancer patients
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The current management of the axilla in level 1 node-positive breast cancer patients is axillary lymph node dissection regardless of the status of the level 2 axillary lymph nodes. The goal of this study was to develop a nomogram predicting the probability of level 2 axillary lymph node metastasis (L-2-ALNM) in patients with level 1 axillary node-positive breast cancer. Materials andMethods: We reviewed the records of 974 patients with pathologyconfirmed level 1 node-positive breast cancer between 2010 and 2014 at the Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute. The patients were randomized 1: 1 and divided into a modeling group and a validation group. Clinical and pathological features of the patients were assessed with uni-and multivariate logistic regression. A nomogram based on independent predictors for the L-2-ALNM identified by multivariate logistic regression was constructed.Results: Independent predictors of L-2-ALNM by the multivariate logistic regression analysis included tumor size, Ki-67 status, histological grade, and number of positive level 1 axillary lymph nodes. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the modeling set and the validation set were 0.828 and 0.816, respectively. The false-negative rates of the L-2-ALNM nomogram were 1.82% and 7.41% for the predicted probability cut-off points of < 6% and < 10%, respectively, when applied to the validation group.Conclusions: Our nomogram could help predict L-2-ALNM in patients with level 1 axillary lymph node metastasis. Patients with a low probability of L-2-ALNM could be spared level 2 axillary lymph node dissection, thereby reducing postoperative morbidity.

AB  - BACKGROUND Synchronous bilateral breast cancer is rare. A case is presented where whole breast irradiation (WBI) was planned after breast conserving surgery in a patient with synchronous bilateral breast cancer. A comparison was made between the feasibility of helical tomotherapy and direct tomotherapy. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old woman was found to have bilateral breast nodules on routine mammographic screening, resulting in bilateral lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Histopathology showed a 6 mm diameter invasive ductal carcinoma in the right breast (Grade 1, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative) and an 8mm diameter tubular carcinoma in the left breast (Grade 1, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative). Lymph node biopsy and histology, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound scan, and bone scintigraphy were negative for metastases (both tumors were Stage 1). Adjuvant therapy with commenced with anastrozole, but no chemotherapy was given. Clinical target volumes (CTVs) were contoured on computed tomography (CT) images. For planning target volumes (PTVs), CTVs were expanded by 1 cm in all directions, except for the medial 5 mm. Since dose constraints to organs at risk (OARs) were beyond established limits, CTVs were expanded by 5 mm. For PTVs, OAR doses and homogeneity indices for helical tomotherapy and direct tomotherapy were compared. Helical tomotherapy provided better target volume coverage and OAR sparing than direct tomotherapy. CONCLUSIONS In a case of bilateral synchronous Stage 1 and Grade 1 breast cancer, helical tomotherapy appeared more suitable than direct tomotherapy.

TI  - The predictability of reported drought events and impacts in the Ebro Basin using six different remote sensing data sets
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of drought management plans contributes to reduce the wide range of adverse impacts caused by water shortage. A crucial element of the development of drought management plans is the selection of appropriate indicators and their associated thresholds to detect drought events and monitor the evolution. Drought indicators should be able to detect emerging drought processes that will lead to impacts with sufficient anticipation to allow measures to be undertaken effectively. However, in the selection of appropriate drought indicators, the connection to the final impacts is often disregarded. This paper explores the utility of remotely sensed data sets to detect early stages of drought at the river basin scale and determine how much time can be gained to inform operational land and water management practices. Six different remote sensing data sets with different spectral origins and measurement frequencies are considered, complemented by a group of classical in situ hydrologic indicators. Their predictive power to detect past drought events is tested in the Ebro Basin. Qualitative (binary information based on media records) and quantitative (crop yields) data of drought events and impacts spanning a period of 12 years are used as a benchmark in the analysis. Results show that early signs of drought impacts can be detected up to 6 months before impacts are reported in newspapers, with the best correlation-anticipation relationships for the standard precipitation index (SPI), the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and evapotranspiration (ET). Soil moisture (SM) and land surface temperature (LST) offer also good anticipation but with weaker correlations, while gross primary production (GPP) presents moderate positive correlations only for some of the rain-fed areas. Although classical hydrological information from water levels and water flows provided better anticipation than remote sensing indicators in most of the areas, correlations were found to be weaker. The indicators show a consistent behaviour with respect to the different levels of crop yield in rain-fed areas among the analysed years, with SPI, NDVI and ET providing again the stronger correlations. Overall, the results confirm remote sensing products' ability to anticipate reported drought impacts and therefore appear as a useful source of information to support drought management decisions.

TI  - Breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland - an uncommon sentinel for diffuse metastatic disease: a case report and review of the literature.
T2  - Journal of medical case reports
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metastases to the thyroid are rare. The most common primary cancer to metastasize to the thyroid is renal cell carcinoma, followed by malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and skin, with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid being rare. Overall, the outcomes in malignancies that have metastasized to the thyroid are poor. There are no prospective studies addressing the role of surgery in metastatic disease of the thyroid. Isolated thyroidectomy has been proposed as a local disease control option to palliate and prevent the potential morbidity of tumor extension related to the airway. Here, we present a case of a patient with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland and discuss the role of thyroidectomy in the context of the current literature.CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman was diagnosed as having bilateral breast carcinoma in 2004, for which she underwent bilateral mastectomy. The pathology revealed multifocal disease on the right, T2N0(0/20)M0 grade 1 and 2 invasive ductal carcinoma, and on the left side, T3N1(2/18)M0 grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma. Surgery was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and regional radiotherapy. The disease was under control on hormonal therapy until 2016, when she developed cervical lymphadenopathy. The fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid was reported as papillary thyroid cancer; and the fine-needle biopsy of the left lateral nodal disease was more suggestive of breast malignancy. She underwent a total thyroidectomy and a clearance of the central compartment lymph nodes and a biopsy of the lateral nodal disease. The histopathological analysis was consistent with metastatic breast cancer in the thyroid and lymph nodes with no evidence of a primary thyroid malignancy.CONCLUSIONS: A past history of a malignancy elsewhere should raise the index of suspicion of metastatic disease in patients presenting with thyroid lumps with or without cervical lymphadenopathy. Detection of metastases to the thyroid generally indicates poor prognosis, obviating the need of surgery in an already compromised patient. An empirical thyroidectomy should be considered in select patients for local disease control.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in periocular merkel cell carcinoma: a case report.
T2  - BMC research notes
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for Merkel cell carcinoma recommend performance of the sentinel lymph node biopsy in all patients with clinically negative nodal disease for staging and treatment. Nevertheless, sentinel lymph node biopsy in the periocular region is debated as tumors are typically smaller and lymphatic variability can make performance procedurally problematic.CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a Caucasian patient in their seventies who presented with a 1.0cm periocular Merkel cell carcinoma, who underwent Mohs surgery with a Tenzel flap repair, that was found to have a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy, but who, despite parotidectomy, selective neck dissection, and radiation, succumbed to the disease.CONCLUSIONS: Evidence in both the site-specific and non-specific literature demonstrates: (1) Worsening prognosis with extent of lymph node burden, (2) improvements in our abilities to perform lymphoscintigraphy, (3) locoregional and distant metastatic disease in patients with tumor sizes≤1cm, and (4) significant rates of sentinel lymph node positivity in patients with tumor sizes≤1cm. Our case supports that sentinel lymph node biopsy should be considered in all clinically nodal negative periocular Merkel cell carcinoma, regardless of size, and despite limited site-specific studies on the subject.

TI  - Application of deep convolutional neural networks for ocean front recognition
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean fronts have been a subject of study for many years, a variety of methods and algorithms have been proposed to address the problem of ocean fronts. However, all these existing ocean front recognition methods are built upon human expertise in defining the front based on subjective thresholds of relevant physical variables. This paper proposes a deep learning approach for ocean front recognition that is able to automatically recognize the front. We first investigated four existing deep architectures, i.e., AlexNet, CaffeNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet, for the ocean front recognition task using remote sensing (RS) data. We then propose a deep network with fewer layers compared to existing architecture for the front recognition task. This network has a total of five learnable layers. In addition, we extended the proposed network to recognize and classify the front into strong and weak ones. We evaluated and analyzed the proposed network with two strategies of exploiting the deep model: full-training and fine-tuning. Experiments are conducted on three different RS image datasets, which have different properties. Experimental results show that our model can produce accurate recognition results.

TI  - Deep neural network-based domain adaptation for classification of remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the effectiveness of deep neural network for cross-domain classification of remote sensing images in this paper. In the network, class centroid alignment is utilized as a domain adaptation strategy, making the network able to transfer knowledge from the source domain to target domain on a per-class basis. Since predicted labels of target data should be used to estimate the centroid of each class, we use overall centroid alignment as a coarse domain adaptation method to improve the estimation accuracy. In addition, rectified linear unit is used as the activation function to produce sparse features, which may improve the separation capability. The proposed network can provide both aligned features and an adaptive classifier, as well as obtain label-free classification of target domain data. The experimental results using Hyperion, NCALM, and WorldView-2 remote sensing images demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - New insights into earthquake precursors from InSAR
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We measured ground displacements before and after the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake using multitemporal InSAR techniques to identify seismic precursor signals. We estimated the ground deformation and its temporal evolution by exploiting a large dataset of SAR imagery that spans seventy-two months before and sixteen months after the mainshock. These satellite data show that up to 15 mm of subsidence occurred beginning three years before the mainshock. This deformation occurred within two Quaternary basins that are located close to the epicentral area and are filled with sediments hosting multi-layer aquifers. After the earthquake, the same basins experienced up to 12 mm of uplift over approximately nine months. Before the earthquake, the rocks at depth dilated, and fractures opened. Consequently, fluids migrated into the dilated volume, thereby lowering the groundwater table in the carbonate hydrostructures and in the hydrologically connected multi-layer aquifers within the basins. This process caused the elastic consolidation of the fine-grained sediments within the basins, resulting in the detected subsidence. After the earthquake, the fractures closed, and the deep fluids were squeezed out. The pre-seismic ground displacements were then recovered because the groundwater table rose and natural recharge of the shallow multi-layer aquifers occurred, which caused the observed uplift.

TI  - Pyoderma Gangrenosum after Breast Mastectomy and Primary Rectus Abdominis Flap Reconstruction.
T2  - The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Pyoderma gangrenosum is an intractable disease of unknown cause involving recurrent ulcerative lesions on the skin, and may accompany ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other conditions. Here, we report a rare case of pyoderma gangrenosum in the thoracic abdomen following post-mastectomy reconstructive surgery. A 39-year-old presented at the hospital with a complaint of left papilla erosion. Skin biopsy at the site revealed invasive skin cancer, with Paget-like progression in the cancerous nipple and suspected malignancy of skin appendages. After partial mastectomy including the areola, invasive ductal breast carcinoma was diagnosed. The patient underwent a subsequent full mastectomy with simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsy and primary breast reconstructive surgery using a rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. Two weeks post-surgery, healing of the abdominal surgical wound was found to be delayed, and suture abscess was suspected. Despite localized treatment, an ulcerative lesion developed in the thoracic region, and pyoderma gangrenosum was diagnosed following skin biopsy. After the introduction of steroid pulse therapy, no progression of the lesion was observed. This report describes the disease characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of post-surgical pyoderma gangrenosum and discusses the case in the context of previous literature.

TI  - Triterpenoids from <i>Aglaia abbreviata</i> exert cytotoxicity and multidrug resistant reversal effect in MCF-7/ADM cells via reactive oxygen species induction and P-glycoprotein inhibition
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Triterpenoids from the Aglaia have been shown cytotoxicity on a broad spectrum of human tumor cells. In the present study, we extracted triterpenoids AA-5 (1) and AA-6 (2) from stems of Aglaia abbreviata, and studied their cytotoxicity in multidrug resistant (MDR) MCF-7/ADM cells. After 48 h treatment, AA-5 (1) and AA-6 (2) significantly increased mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) with depressed mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-9 activities. The drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the intracellular antioxidant systems, involving Glutathione S-Transferase p, Glutathione and heme oxygenase-1, were also inhibited via the ROS-depressed Akt/NF-E2-related factor 2 pathway. Furthermore, 2 h-treatment of AA-6 (2) at non-toxic concentrations exhibited MDR reversal effects with no alteration on P-gp expression but increased drug accumulation ability. AA-6 alos demonstrated synergetic effects with classic anti-tumor agents. Moreover, computational modeling studies showed that AA-6 (2) might bind to the modulator site on P-gp and act as an inhibitor, not a substrate of P-gp. Therefore, AA-5 (1) and AA-6 (2) may be effective anti-tumor and reversal agents for the further development of therapeutics against MDR breast cancer.

TI  - A comparison of running kinetics in children with and without genu varus: A cross sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionVarus knee alignment has been identified as a risk factor for the progression of medial knee osteoarthritis. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated yet in children. Thus, the aims of the present study were to examine differences in ground reaction forces, loading rate, impulses, and free moment values during running in children with and without genu varus.MethodsThirty-six boys aged 9-14 volunteered to participate in this study. They were divided in two age-matched groups (genu varus versus healthy controls). Body weight adjusted three dimensional kinetic data (Fx, Fy, Fz) were collected during running at preferred speed using two Kistler force plates for the dominant and non-dominant limb.ResultsIndividuals with knee genu varus produced significantly higher (p = .01; d = 1.09; 95%) body weight adjusted ground reaction forces in the lateral direction (Fx) of the dominant limb compared to controls. On the non-dominant limb, genu varus patients showed significantly higher body weight adjusted ground reaction forces values in the lateral (p = .01; d = 1.08; 86%) and medial (p < .001; d = 1.55; 102%) directions (Fx). Further, genu varus patients demonstrated 55% and 36% greater body weight adjusted loading rates in the dominant (p < .001; d = 2.09) and non-dominant (p < .001; d = 1.02) leg, respectively. No significant between-group differences were observed for adjusted free moment values (p>.05).DiscussionHigher mediolateral ground reaction forces and vertical loading rate amplitudes in boys with genu varus during running at preferred running speed may accelerate the development of progressive joint degeneration in terms of the age at knee osteoarthritis onset. Therefore, practitioners and therapists are advised to conduct balance and strength training programs to improve lower limb alignment and mediolateral control during dynamic movements.

T2  - Zhonghua yi xue za zhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the clinical value of CT lymphography (CT-LG) on the localization and evaluation of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Methods: Thirty-six patients with early-stage breast cancer were enrolled in this study from September 2014 to June 2016 in the First Hospital of Zhengzhou University.The diagnoses were confirmed by puncture or local surgical pathology with negative clinical palpation of axillary lymph nodes, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was planned.The patients received CT-LG examination.The first one or several lymph nodes along the lymph duct draining from the injection site to axilla was/were defined as SLN(s), and the results were compared with the SLNB.Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used to compare the number of SLN detected by CT-LG and SLNB; according to the pathologic results, Student t test or chi-square test was used to compare the differences of the positive SLNs with negative ones. Results: SLNs were successfully identified in all 36 patients, 32 cases (88.9%) had high-quality images (with both SLN and lymphatic vessel visible); 36 SLNs were located by CT-guided wire with a success rate of 100%.A total of 88 SLNs were identified by CT-LG in 36 patients, and 102 SLNs were obtained by SLNB (Z=-2.646, P=0.008). The long-short diameter ratio (L/S) of SLN obtained by SLNB was significantly smaller than that of CT-LG (1.7±0.3 vs 1.9±0.4, t=2.880, P=0.004). Compared with pathology, CT-LG showed 21 positive SLNs and 67 negative SLNs, and the short diameter of positive SLNs was bigger than that of negative ones[(5.9±2.1) vs (4.8±1.8) mm, t=2.235, P=0.028]. Of 67 negative SLNs, 61(91.04%) appeared homogenously contrast agent filling, and 13(61.90%) of the 21 positive SLNs were found filling defect changes, and the differences in filling defect changes between positive and negative SLNs were statistically significant (chi(2)=26.479, P<0.001). Conclusion: CT-LG can accurately locate the SLN for early-stage breast cancer, and both the short diameter and filling defect changes can help evaluate the status of SLN.

TI  - Overview of the 2015 Algodones Sand Dunes field campaign to support sensor intercalibration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several sites from around the world are being used operationally and are suitable for vicarious calibration of space-borne imaging platforms. However, due to the proximity of these sites (e.g., Libya 4), a rigorous characterization of the landscape is not feasible, limiting their utility for sensor intercalibration efforts. Due to its accessibility and similarities to Libya 4, the Algodones Sand Dunes System in California, USA, was identified as a potentially attractive intercalibration site for space-borne, reflective instruments such as Landsat. In March 2015, a 4-day field campaign was conducted to develop an initial characterization of Algodones with a primary goal of assessing its intercalibration potential. Five organizations from the US and Canada collaborated to collect both active and passive airborne image data, spatial and temporal measurements of spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function, and in-situ sand samples from several locations across the Algodones system. The collection activities conducted to support the campaign goal is summarized, including a summary of all instrumentation used, the data collected, and the experiments performed in an effort to characterize the Algodones site.

TI  - Population genomics of virulence genes of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in clinical isolates from Uganda
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum causes a spectrum of malarial disease from asymptomatic to uncomplicated through to severe. Investigations of parasite virulence have associated the expression of distinct variants of the major surface antigen of the blood stages known as PfEMP1 encoded by up to 60 var genes per genome. Looking at the population genomics of var genes in cases of uncomplicated malaria, we set out to determine if there was any evidence of a selective sweep of specific var genes or clonal epidemic structure related to the incidence of uncomplicated disease in children. By sequencing the conserved DBL alpha domain of var genes from six sentinel sites in Uganda we found that the parasites causing uncomplicated P. falciparum disease in children were highly diverse and that every child had a unique var DBLa repertoire. Despite extensive var DBLa diversity and minimal overlap between repertoires, specific DBLa types and groups were conserved at the population level across Uganda. This pattern was the same regardless of the geographic distance or malaria transmission intensity. These data lead us to propose that any parasite can cause uncomplicated malarial disease and that these diverse parasite repertoires are composed of both upsA and non-upsA var gene groups.

TI  - Exact Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria for asymmetric current sheets
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale mission has made in situ diffusion region and kinetic-scale resolution measurements of asymmetric magnetic reconnection for the first time, in the Earth's magnetopause. The principal theoretical tool currently used to model collisionless asymmetric reconnection is particle-in-cell simulations. Many particle-in-cell simulations of asymmetric collisionless reconnection start from an asymmetric Harris-type magnetic field but with distribution functions that are not exact equilibrium solutions of the Vlasov equation. We present new and exact equilibrium solutions of the Vlasov-Maxwell system that are self-consistent with one-dimensional asymmetric current sheets, with an asymmetric Harris-type magnetic field profile, plus a constant nonzero guide field. The distribution functions can be represented as a combination of four shifted Maxwellian distribution functions. This equilibrium describes a magnetic field configuration with more freedom than the previously known exact solution and has different bulk flow properties.Plain Language Summary Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental phenomenon in space science and is currently a subject of intense study. During a reconnection event, stored energy that had been bound up in stressed electromagnetic fields is released in the form of heat and the kinetic energy of particles. The NASA MMS mission is currently making measurements of these phenomena in the Earth's Magnetosphere, with unprecedented levels of accuracy and resolution. Our work presents a theoretical model of a structure in space known as an asymmetric current sheet such as the MMS mission encounters during a reconnection event. The model can be implemented into computer simulations, with which to compare to the results from MMS satellite data. This will help us understand the fundamental physics of asymmetric magnetic reconnection.

TI  - Scaling properties of observed and simulated satellite visible radiances
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Structure functions S-q, which are related to power spectra and used to study turbulence, were computed for GOES-13 visible radiances measured on 16 May 2015 over French Guiana and adjacent Atlantic Ocean. The nested Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) numerical weather prediction (NWP) model was run for the same time and area. Cloud data generated by GEM over (300 km)(2) domains, with one-way nesting ending at horizontal grid-spacing of 0.25 km, were operated on by a 3-D solar radiative transfer model with resulting radiances degraded to GOES-13 resolution (similar to 1 km) and S-q computed for them, too. For GOES-13 radiances, scaling exponents zeta(2) associated with S-2, for separation distances between 5 km and 25 km, were typically > 0.6 for deep convective and marine boundary layer clouds and < 0.4 for shallow cumuli over land. zeta(2) for GEM agreed well with GOES-13 for deep convective clouds. This suggests that the self-organizing properties of deep convection in GEM exhibit realistic geometric features, a potentially important point given the link between cloud structure and precipitation, with the latter being much more difficult to measure and assess than visible radiances. Regarding radiances for GEM's marine boundary layer clouds, their S-q differed markedly from GOES-13's; better resembling fair-weather cumulus. Likewise, GEM's shallow cumuli over land appear to have bypassed the "scattered" fair-weather stage and went straight into more organized convection. Thus, it appears that comparing time series of S-q for geostationary satellite data and corresponding modeled radiances has the potential to benefit assessment of cloud system-resolving models.

TI  - Earth-observing satellite intercomparison using the Radiometric Calibration Test Site at Railroad Valley
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the current ground-based calibration results of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI), using an automated suite of instruments located at Railroad Valley, Nevada, USA. The period of this study is 2012 to 2016 for MODIS, VIIRS, and ETM+, 2013 to 2016 for OLI, and 2015 to 2016 for MSI. The current results show that all sensors agree with the Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) to within +/- 5% in the solar-reflective regime, except for one band on VIIRS that is within +/- 6%. In the case of ETM+ and OLI, the agreement is within +/- 3%, and, in the case of MODIS, the agreement is within +/- 3.5%. MSI agrees with RadCaTS to within +/- 4.5% in all applicable bands.

TI  - Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016
T2  - LANCET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a long time series, this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and inform policy debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2016. This study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) and exposure estimates from 22 717 randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, according to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, we explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, population ageing, trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined.Findings Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not change significantly for four risks, and decreased significantly for 31 risks. Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure and household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose, showed significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were smoking (124.1 million DALYs [95% UI 111.2 million to 137.0 million]), high systolic blood pressure (122.2 million DALYs [110.3 million to 133.3 million], and low birthweight and short gestation (83.0 million DALYs [78.3 million to 87.7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood pressure (89.9 million DALYs [80.9 million to 98.2 million]), high body-mass index (64.8 million DALYs [44.4 million to 87.6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63.8 million DALYs [53.2 million to 76.3 million]). In 2016 in 113 countries, the leading risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking remained among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while low birthweight and short gestation was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of important drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 9.3% (6.9-11.6) decline in deaths and a 10.8% (8.3-13.1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while population ageing accounts for 14.9% (12.7-17.5) of deaths and 6.2% (3.9-8.7) of DALYs, and population growth for 12.4% (10.1-14.9) of deaths and 12.4% (10.1-14.9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to disease burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27.3% (24.9-29.7) of the change in DALYs between 2006 and 2016 can be attributed to declines in exposure to risks.Interpretation Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provide insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk exposure has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular policy attention, due to their large contribution to global disease burden, increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of development. GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve health, risk modification has played a relatively small part in the past decade. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

TI  - New insights about cloud vertical structure from CloudSat and CALIPSO observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Active cloud observations from A-Train's CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites offer new opportunities to examine the vertical structure of hydrometeor layers. We use the 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR merged CloudSat-CALIPSO product to examine global aspects of hydrometeor vertical stratification. We group the data into major cloud vertical structure (CVS) classes based on our interpretation of how clouds in three standard atmospheric layers overlap and provide their global frequency of occurrence. The two most frequent CVS classes are single-layer (per our definition) low and high clouds that represent similar to 53% of cloudy skies, followed by high clouds overlying low clouds, and vertically extensive clouds that occupy near-contiguously a large portion of the troposphere. The prevalence of these configurations changes seasonally and geographically, between daytime and nighttime, and between continents and oceans. The radiative effects of the CVS classes reveal the major radiative warmers and coolers from the perspective of the planet as a whole, the surface, and the atmosphere. Single-layer low clouds dominate planetary and atmospheric cooling and thermal infrared surface warming. We also investigate the consistency between passive and active views of clouds by providing the CVS breakdowns of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud regimes for spatiotemporally coincident MODIS-Aqua (also on the A-Train) and CloudSat-CALIPSO daytime observations. When the analysis is expanded for a more in-depth look at the most heterogeneous of the MODIS cloud regimes, it ultimately confirms previous interpretations of their makeup that did not have the benefit of collocated active observations.Plain Language Summary We use observations from so-called "active" sensors (satellite instruments emitting pulses of radiation toward Earth) in order to derive, classify, and understand how clouds are stratified vertically in the atmosphere. The stratification is important for the Earth's energy budget. We show how the various major cloud vertical structures affect the propagation of solar and thermal radiation. We also examine the composition of recurring cloud systems observed from so-called "passive" sensors (satellite instruments receiving from the Earth naturally reflected or emitted radiation) in terms of the cloud vertical configurations they contain.

TI  - On the diurnal cycle of surface energy fluxes in the North American monsoon region using the WRF-Hydro modeling system
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The diurnal cycles of surface energy fluxes are important drivers of atmospheric boundary layer development and convective precipitation, particularly in regions with heterogeneous land surface conditions such as those under the influence of the North American monsoon (NAM). Characterization of diurnal surface fluxes and their controls has not been well constrained due to the paucity of observations in the NAM region. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the uncoupled WRF-Hydro modeling system in its ability to represent soil moisture, turbulent heat fluxes, and surface temperature observations and compare these to operational analyses from other commonly used land surface models (LSMs). After a rigorous model evaluation, we quantify how the diurnal cycles of surface energy fluxes vary during the warm season for the major ecosystems in a regional basin. We find that the diurnal cycle of latent heat flux is more sensitive to ecosystem type than sensible heat flux due to the response of plant transpiration to variations in soil water content. Furthermore, the peak timing of precipitation affects the shape and magnitude of the diurnal cycle of plant transpiration in water-stressed ecosystems, inducing mesoscale heterogeneity in land surface conditions between the major ecosystems within the basin. Comparisons to other LSMs indicate that ecosystem differences in the diurnal cycle of turbulent fluxes are underestimated in these products. While this study shows how land surface heterogeneity affects the simulated diurnal cycle of turbulent fluxes, additional coupled modeling efforts are needed to identify the potential impacts of these spatial differences on convective precipitation.

TI  - Estimation of global soil respiration by accounting for land-use changes derived from remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil respiration is one of the largest carbon fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems. Estimating global soil respiration is difficult because of its high spatiotemporal variability and sensitivity to land-use change. Satellite monitoring provides useful data for estimating the global carbon budget, but few studies have estimated global soil respiration using satellite data. We provide preliminary insights into the estimation of global soil respiration in 2001 and 2009 using empirically derived soil temperature equations for 17 ecosystems obtained by field studies, as well as. MODIS climate data and land-use maps at a 4-km resolution. The daytime surface temperature from winter to early summer based on the MODIS data tended to be higher than the field-observed soil temperatures in subarctic and temperate ecosystems. The estimated global soil respiration was 94.8 and 93.8 Pg C yr(-1) in 2001 and 2009, respectively. However, the MODIS land-use maps had insufficient spatial resolution to evaluate the effect of land-use change on soil respiration. The spatial variation of soil respiration (Q(10)) values was higher but its spatial variation was lower in high-latitude areas than in other areas. However, Q(10) in tropical areas was more variable and was not accurately estimated (the values were >7.5 or <1.0) because of the low seasonal variation in soil respiration in tropical ecosystems. To solve these problems, it will be necessary to validate our results using a combination of remote sensing data at higher spatial resolution and field observations for many different ecosystems, and it will be necessary to account for the effects of more soil factors in the predictive equations.

TI  - Propensity for erosion and deposition in a deltaic wetland complex: Implications for river management and coastal restoration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mississippi River Delta is one of the most rapidly changing area on Earth, with large areas experiencing land loss and smaller areas experiencing loss. While some of the drivers of these changes are well known (high rates of relative sea level rise, reduced sediment inputs, canal dredging), debate exists about other drivers. One area that has received substantial attention is the role of, "river diversions," areas where sediments and water are diverted from the Mississippi River into degrading wetlands with the hope of reinitiating deltaic land building processes. Some authors have argued that diversions lead to reduced shear strengths of wetland soils that make them more vulnerable to storm driven erosion, while other authors have argued that sediments from river diversions will develop stable land. This study examined this controversy in the Cubits Gap Subdelta, an analogue for a large (>1420 m(3) s(-1)) river diversion by testing the hypothesis that areas of land gain, and/or resilience to erosion occurred in areas that actively received river sediments and as a result had mineral rich soils with high shear strength. To accomplish this, a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was developed for Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The NDWI was calculated from (Blue - SWIR) / (Blue + SWIR), where SWIR is the shorter wavelength, and yielded land/water boundary maps with 30 m resolution. Results indicate that land gain occurred predominantly in the riverside section of this subdelta where sediments were imported from Mississippi River crevasses and/or dredging. Land loss typically occurred in the distal regions of the subdelta, which had lower levels of sediment supply and greater wave exposure. Sediment geotechnical analyses revealed land loss pixels generally correlated sediments with to high organic contents (9.0 +/- 1.9%), water contents (54.8 +/- 3.7%) and salinity (6.5 +/- 2.0 PSU), with low shear strengths (5.7 +/- 0.8 kN m(-2)) and low bulk density (0.6 +/- 0.8 g cm(-3)), whereas land gain pixels generally correlate with low organic content (3.9 +/- 0.6%), water content (38.1 +/- 4.2%) high shear strength (10.9 +/- 4.1 kN m(-2)) and bulk density (1.00 +/- 0.1 g cm(-3)). This study suggests plans to restore the region by partially diverting the flow of the Mississippi River will be most successful if they carry high loads of sediment, and that concerns about the integrity of fresh marsh may be unwarranted if those marshes are sediment rich.

TI  - Co-eruptive subsidence and post-eruptive uplift associated with the 2011-2012 eruption of Puyehue-Cordon Caulle, Chile, revealed by DInSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2011-2012 eruption of the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle volcanic complex, southern Andes (Chile), was associated with complex surface deformation affecting an area of roughly 50 by 50 km. We report here differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) results of pre-, co- and post-eruptive deformation from ENVISAT ASAR, COSMO-Skymed, and ALOS-2/PALSAR scenes acquired between early 2011 and early 2017. No clear pre-eruptive deformation is observed during five months before the eruption, although some patterns could be interpreted as showing inflation occurring between April and May 2011. Co-eruptive interferograms show a complex deformation pattern consisting in a major deflation lobe (120 cm LOS lengthening) centered 10 km NVV of the eruption vent accompanied by smaller uplift and subsidence regions in the vicinity of the vent. Re-inflation began immediately after the end of the eruption. A first pulse lasted 3 years between 2012 and 2015, accumulating similar to 70 cm uplift. We detect here a second pulse, beginning in June 2016 and still ongoing in February 2017, reaching 12 cm in half a year. Inverse modeling with spherical cavity and spheroidal sources locates re-inflation sources at a depth ranging between 8 and 11 km under the surface. It suggests re-filling of the reservoir occurring after the draining of a shallow magma chamber during the 2011-2012 eruption. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A method for quantifying cloud immersion in a tropical mountain forest using time-lapse photography
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the frequency, duration, and elevation range of fog or cloud immersion is essential to estimate cloud water deposition in water budgets and to understand the ecohydrology of cloud forests. The goal of this study was to develop a low-cost and high spatial-coverage method to detect occurrence of cloud immersion within a mountain cloud forest by using time-lapse photography. Trail cameras and temperature/relative humidity sensors were deployed at five sites covering the elevation range from the assumed lifting condensation level to the mountain peaks in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico. Cloud-sensitive image characteristics (contrast, the coefficient of variation and the entropy of pixel luminance, and image colorfulness) were used with a k-means clustering approach to accurately detect cloud-immersed conditions in a time series of images from March 2014 to May 2016. Images provided hydrologically meaningful cloud-immersion information while temperature relative humidity data were used to refine the image analysis using dew point information and provided temperature gradients along the elevation transect. Validation of the image processing method with human judgment based classification generally indicated greater than 90% accuracy. Cloud-immersion frequency averaged 80% at sites above 900 m during nighttime hours and 49% during daytime hours, and was consistent with diurnal patterns of cloud immersion measured in a previous study. Results for the 617 m site demonstrated that cloud immersion in the Luquillo Mountains rarely occurs at the previously-reported cloud base elevation of about 600 m (11% during nighttime hours and 5% during daytime hours). The framework presented in this paper will be used to monitor at a low cost and high spatial resolution the long-term variability of cloud immersion patterns in the Luquillo Mountains, and can be applied to ecohydrology research at other cloud-forest sites or in coastal ecosystems with advective sea fog.

TI  - Integrating land surface phenology with cluster density and size improves spatially explicit models of animal density
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Models of animal density often use coarse landcover categories that homogenize vegetation attributes, thereby limiting specificity of results. Alternatively, models including land surface phenology (LSP) metrics derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery capture continuous time-series data describing plant growth and senescence. LSP metrics may better discriminate the vegetation conditions influencing species habitat and distribution. Additionally, applications modeling animal density often use clusters (i.e., groups of individuals) but omit differences in cluster sizes. Ignoring how cluster size varies with landscape characteristics risks misrepresenting the spatial distribution of an animals' density. Using lesser prairie-chickens (LEPC; Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) as an example, we integrated the spatial distributions of cluster density and cluster size with LSP metrics to better predict its density in Texas, USA. We modeled LEPC cluster density using hierarchical distance sampling and cluster size with zero-truncated generalized linear modeling. Variables included landcover categories, LSP metrics, human infrastructure and topography. Models incorporating LSP metrics received most support and identified conservation areas that landcover models missed. Cluster density associated with LSP metrics, road density, oil and gas well density, topography, and grassland to shrubland ratio. Cluster size associated with topography and LSP metrics. Omitting the spatial distribution of cluster size underestimated LEPC density. Our approach generates geospatial predictions for prioritizing LEPC protection, habitat restoration, and evaluating impacts from development or phenological change. This study demonstrates the utility of integrating LSP metrics, cluster density and cluster size for predicting species density across large and heterogeneous landscapes. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Change detection using Landsat images and an analysis of the linkages between the change and property tax values in the Istanbul Province of Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the Istanbul Province was monitored using Landsat 5 TM, MSS, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI imagery from the years 1986, 2000, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 in order to assess land cover changes in the province. The aim of the study was to classify manmade structures, land, green, and water areas, and to observe the changes in the province using satellite images. After classification, the images were compared in selected years to observe land cover. Moreover, these changes were correlated with the property tax values of Istanbul by years. The findings of the study showed that manmade structure areas increased while vegetation areas decreased due to rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrial and commercial development in Istanbul. These changes also explain the transformation of land from rural and natural areas to residential use, and serve as a tool with which to assess land value increments. Land value capturing is critical for the analysis of the linkages between the changes in land cover, and for assessing land transformation and urban growth. Due to inadequate market data, real estate tax values were used to analyze the linkages between detection changes, land cover, and taxation. In fact, the declared tax values of land owners are generally lower than the actual market values and therefore it is not possible to transfer the value increasing of land in urban areas by using property taxation from the owner to local and central governments. The research results also show that the integration of remote sensing results with real estate market data give us to determine the tax base values of real estate more realistically.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall aim of this study was to evaluate the use of seasonal time-series Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery in estimating forest stand parameters in a heterogeneous Mediterranean environment. Within this framework, the random forest regression algorithm was used to model the relationship between spectral information and tree density, basal area, and wood volume, based on single-date, single-season (dry, wet), and multi-temporal (May-December) imagery. The variable importance (VIMP) measure and the minimal depth (MD) order statistic were also investigated with regard to improved prediction accuracy and the identification of relevant variables. In general, the multi-temporal and dry-season models were more accurate than the single-date models. The models resulting from the MD variable selection from the dry season imagery were the most accurate with a coefficient of determination of up to 0.54 for tree density, 0.72 for basal area, and 0.68 for volume.

TI  - Updating national forest inventory estimates of growing stock volume using hybrid inference
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - International organizations increasingly require estimates of forest parameters to monitor the state of and changes in forest resources, the sustainability of forest practices and the role of forests in the carbon cycle. Most countries rely on data from their national forest inventories (NFI) to produce these estimates. However, because NFI survey years may not match the required reporting years, techniques for updating NFI-based estimates are necessary.The main aim was to develop an unbiased method to update NFI estimates of mean growing stock volume (m3/ha) using models to predict annual plot-level volume change, and to estimate the associated uncertainties. Because the final large area volume estimates were based on plot-level model predictions rather than field observations, hybrid inference was necessary to accommodate both model prediction uncertainty and sampling variation. Specific objectives were to compare modelling approaches, to assess the utility of Landsat data for increasing model prediction accuracy, to select the most accurate method, and to compare model-based and design-based uncertainty components. For four monospecific forest types, data from the 2nd and 3rd Spanish NFI surveys together with site variables and Landsat images were used to construct models to predict NFI information for the year of the 4th NFI survey. Data from the 3rd and 4th surveys were used to assess the accuracy of the model predictions at both plot-level and large area spatial scales.The most accurate method used a set of three models: one to predict the probability of volume removals, one to predict the amount of removed volume, and one to predict gross annual volume. Incorporation of Landsat-based variables in the models increased prediction accuracy. Differences between large area estimates based on plot-level field observations for the 4th NFI survey and estimates based"on the model predictions were minimal for all four forest types. Further, the standard errors of the estimates based on the model predictions were only slightly greater than standard errors based on the field observations. Thus, model predictions of plot-level growing stock volume based on field and satellite image data as auxiliary information can be used to update large area NFI estimates for reporting years for which spectral data are available but field observations are not. Finally, variances of means are underestimated unless hybrid inferential methods are used to incorporate both model prediction uncertainty and sampling variation. For the two forest types for which the two sources of uncertainty were of the same order of magnitude, the under-estimation was non-negligible. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Source modelling of the 2015 Wolf volcano (Galapagos) eruption inferred from Sentinel 1-A DInSAR deformation maps and pre-eruptive ENVISAT time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the surface deformation of the May-July 2015 Wolf volcano (Galapagos) eruption, retrieved through space-borne differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) measurements. To do this, we first examine the ENVISAT SAR acquisitions which imaged the volcano during the 2004-2010 time period, in order to retrieve the pre-eruptive deformations through the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) DInSAR approach. These measurements allow us to focus on the recent volcano dynamics and to constrain the geometry and characteristics of the main deformation source. In particular, our analytic modelling results suggest that a sill-like source, 2.5 km long, 2.0 km wide and located at depth of about 1.5 km from the caldera floor, fits the observed uplift and E-W pattern, in good agreement with other studies that highlight the existence of a flat-topped shallow source. Subsequently, by considering that the main source maintains similar geometrical and kinematical characteristics over time, we analyse the deformation patterns related to the 2015 eruption. In this case, we invert two Sentinel I-A DInSAR maps encompassing the May-July 2015 eruption. The observed deformation can be attributed to a magmatic system with pressure change in a single shallow magma body (sill-like source), and the formation of a circumferential dike feeding the eruptive fissure on the SE rim of the summit caldera.This work provides new insights on thetaldera dynamics of Wolf volcano and confirms the importance of remote sensing data to improve our knowledge of remote volcanic areas.

TI  - Recent unrest (2002-2015) imaged by space geodesy at the highest risk Chilean volcanoes: Villarrica, Llaima, and Calbuco (Southern Andes)
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Villarrica, Llaima, and Calbuco volcanoes are the most active and dangerous volcanoes in the Southern Andes, and we use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations from multiple satellites (ERS-2, ENVISAT, ALOS, RADARSAT-2, COSMO-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1A and ALOS-2) to constrain ground deformation that spans episodes of unrest and eruption at all three volcanoes between 2002 and 2015. We find episodes of ground deformation at each volcano, which we invert using analytic elastic half-space models to make some of the first geophysical inferences about the source depths of potential magma chambers. At Llaima, we interpret that the VEI 2 April 3, 2009 eruption was preceded by similar to 6-15 cm of precursory ground uplift one month before from a source similar to 5 km below the surface on the western side of the edifice. The VEI 2 March 3, 2015 Villarrica eruption was followed by a short lived uplift of 5 cm in the SE part of the volcano from a source depth of similar to 6 km. The VEI 4 April 22-23,2015 Calbuco eruption produced 12 cm of coeruptive subsidence from a source depth 8-11 km and offset similar to 2 km S from the summit. Importantly, we do not find clear evidence that the January 1,2008, the March 3,2015 and April 22,2015 eruptions at Llaima, Villarrica and Calbuco volcanoes were preceded by either transient or continuous ground uplift. There are several possible explanations for the lack of precursory deformation at each volcano - it is possible that any precursory deformation occurred only hours before the eruption (e.g., at Calbuco), pre-eruptive inflation was canceled by co-eruptive subsidence (as we inferred happened during the April 2009 Llaima eruption), the pre-eruptive deformation was too small to be detectable in areas with persistent topography correlated phase delays, pressurized source are deep, or that open-vent volcanoes like Villarrica and Llaima do not pressurize. At all three volcanoes, X and C band interferograms decorrelate in a few weeks due to vegetation, snow and ice, and have persistent atmospheric phase delays that we find cannot be reliably removed with available global weather models. The low number of SAR acquisitions therefore makes it challenging to reliably measure unaliased deformation. We recommend a multi-satellite observing strategy with short repeat periods, frequently acquired high -resolution digital elevation models, and with acquisitions during every satellite overflight that may improve the temporal resolution of measurements.

TI  - Soil class and attribute dynamics and their relationship with natural vegetation based on satellite remote sensing
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of a strategy to reach soil data through vegetation has the potential to improve soil mapping in large areas covered by forests. This study aimed to develop a strategy to identify the relationship between soil information, such as texture, fertility and pedological classes, through vegetation spectral sensing obtained by a satellite sensor. The study area is located in Angola, Africa, covering 20,000 ha. Landsat images corresponding to dry and wet seasons were obtained, atmospheric corrected and transformed into reflectance. We built a mechanism to extract soil information and keep only vegetated areas in images. Afterward, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated and its pixel was linked with soil samples collected in the field (450 points at four depths, A: 0-0.2; B: 0.4-0.6; C: 0.8-1.0; D: 1.0-1.2 m), and the wet analysis was performed. The non-parametric tests were used to verify the NDVI variation according to soil classes and Landsat image acquisition date. Higher correlation values were obtained in the images from 2008, for Al saturation, Al content, and base saturation. Overall, soil attributes best related with vegetation were the ones directly or indirectly involved with Al. The best correlation occurred in the wet season, because vegetation expressed better its relation with soils and water availability. This relation did not vary much at depth. The higher Al content was associated with the development of vegetation adapted to this condition, i.e. a native savanna-type usually occurring in regions of dystrophic soils such as Ferralsols, which presented the highest NDVI mean and were statistically different from the other soil groups. Pedological classes drive water dynamics, which interferes on vegetation. Thus, we found an important relationship between NDVI and soil classes. Depending on the season, soil class varies on the NDVI projection, due to its morphological and attributes configuration. Thus, we conclude that only one soil attribute is not sufficient to drive the NDVI result, but it has to be combined with the soil class. Wet season is indicated as the best period to analyze vegetation in order to reach soil information. The results indicate an important strategy to assist digital soil mapping in vegetated areas.

T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Socioeconomic factors influence access to cancer care and survival. This study investigated the role of socioeconomic status on the risk of breast cancer recurrence and on the delivery of appropriate cancer care (sentinel lymph node biopsy and breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy), by patients' age and hormone receptor status.Methods: 3,462 breast cancer cases diagnosed in 2003-2005 were selected from 7 Italian cancer registries and assigned to a socioeconomic tertile on the basis of the deprivation index of their census tract. Multivariable models were applied to assess the delivery of sentinel lymph node biopsy and of breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy within socioeconomic tertiles.Results: In the 1,893 women younger than 65 years, the 5-year risk of recurrence was higher in the most deprived group than in the least deprived, but this difference was not significant (16.4% vs. 12.9%, log-rank p=0.08); no difference was seen in women >= 65 years. Among the 2,024 women with hormone receptor-positive cancer, the 5-year risk was significantly higher in the most deprived group than in the least deprived one (13.0% vs. 8.9%, p=0.04); no difference was seen in cases of hormone receptor-negative cancer. The most deprived women were less likely than the least deprived women to receive sentinel lymph node biopsy (adjusted odds ratio (ORa), 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.86) and to undergo breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy (ORa=0.66; 95% CI, 0.51-0.86).Conclusions: Socioeconomic inequalities affect the risk of recurrence, among patients with hormone receptor-positive cancer, and the opportunity to receive standard care.

TI  - Validation of a model for ranking aquaculture facilities for risk-based disease surveillance
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A semi-quantitative model for risk ranking of aquaculture facilities in Switzerland with regard to the introduction and spread of Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (VHS) and Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis (IHN) was developed in a previous study (Diserens et al., 2013). The objective of the present study was to validate this model using data collected during field visits on aquaculture sites in four Swiss cantons compared to data collected through a questionnaire in the previous study. A discrepancy between the values obtained with the two different methods was found in 32.8% of the parameters, resulting in a significant difference (p < 0.001) in the risk classification of the facilities. As data gathered exclusively by means of a questionnaire are not of sufficient quality to perform a risk-based surveillance of aquaculture facilities a combination of questionnaires and farm inspections is proposed. A web-based reporting system could be advantageous for the factors which were identified as being more likely to vary over time, in particular for factors considering fish movements, which showed a marginally significant difference in their risk scores (p > 0.1) within a six-month period. Nevertheless, the model proved to be stable over the considered period of time as no substantial fluctuations in the risk categorisation were observed (Kappa agreement of 0.77). Finally, the model proved to be suitable to deliver a reliable risk ranking of Swiss aquaculture facilities according to their risk of getting infected with or spreading of VHS and IHN, as the five facilities that tested positive for these diseases in the last ten years were ranked as medium or high risk. Moreover, because the seven fish farms that were infected with Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) during the same period also belonged to the risk categories medium and high, the classification appeared to correlate with the occurrence of this third viral fish disease.

AB  - In periglacial landscapes, snow dynamics and microtopography have profound implications of freeze-thaw conditions and thermal regime of the ground. We mapped periglacial landforms at Kapp Linne, central Svalbard, where we chose six widespread landforms (solifluction sheet, nivation hollow. palsa and peat in beach ridge depressions, raised marine beach ridge, and exposed bedrock ridge) as study sites. At these six landforms, we studied ground thermal conditions, freeze-thaw cycles, and snow dynamics using a combination of in situ monitoring and C-band radar satellite data in the period 2005-2012. Based on these physical parameters, the six studied landforms can be classified into raised, dry landforms with minor ground ice content and a thin, discontinuous snow cover and into wet landforms with high ice content located in the topographical depressions in-between with medium to thick snow cover. This results in a differential snow-melting period inferred from the C-band radar satellite data, causing the interseasonal and interlandform variability in the onset of ground surface thawing once the ground becomes snow free. Therefore, variability also exists in the period of thawed ground surface conditions. However, the length of the season with thawed ground surface conditions does not determine the mean annual ground surface temperature, it only correlates well with the active layer depths. From the C-band radar satellite data series, measured relative backscatter trends hint toward a decrease in snow cover through time and a more frequent presence of ice layers from mid-winter rain on snow events at Kapp Linn& Svalbard.

TI  - Atmospheric correction over coastal waters using multilayer neural networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Standard atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms work well in open ocean areas where the water inherent optical properties (IOPs) are correlated with pigmented particles. However, the lOPs of turbid coastal waters may independently vary with pigmented particles, suspended inorganic particles, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). In turbid coastal waters standard AC algorithms often exhibit large inaccuracies that may lead to negative water-leaving radiances (L-w) or remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). We introduce a new atmospheric correction algorithm for coastal waters based on a multilayer neural network (MLNN) method. We use a coupled atmosphere-ocean radiative transfer model to simulate the Rayleigh-corrected radiance (L-rc) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the R-rs just above the surface simultaneously, and train a MLNN to derive the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and R-rs directly from the TOA L-rc. The method is validated using both a synthetic dataset and Aerosol Robotic Network - Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) measurements. The SeaDAS NIR algorithm, the SeaDAS NIR/SWIR algorithm, and the MODIS version of the Case 2 regional water - CoastColour (C2RCC) algorithm are also included in the comparison with AERONET-OC measurements. The performance of the AC algorithms is evaluated with four statistical metrics: the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), the average percentage difference (APD), the mean percentage bias, and the root mean square difference (RMSD). The comparison with AERONET-OC measurements shows that the MLNN algorithm significantly improves retrieval of normalized L-w in blue bands (412 nm and 443 nm) and yields minor improvements in green and red bands compared with the other three algorithms. On a global scale, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized L-w by up to 13% in blue bands and by 2-7% in green and red bands when compared with the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm. In highly absorbing coastal waters, such as the Baltic Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized Lw by more than 60% in blue bands compared to the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm, while in highly scattering coastal waters, such as the Black Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD by more than 25%. These results indicate that the MLNN algorithm is suitable for application in turbid coastal waters. Application of the MLNN algorithm to MODIS Aqua images in several coastal areas also shows that it is robust and resilient to contamination due to sunglint or adjacency effects of land and cloud edges. The MLNN algorithm is very fast once the neural network has been properly trained and is therefore suitable for operational use. A significant advantage of the MLNN algorithm is that it does not need SWIR bands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Precipitation-fire linkages in Indonesia (1997-2015)
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, fires have burned annually in Indonesia, yet the strength of the fire season is for a large part modulated by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The two most recent very strong El Nino years were 2015 and 1997. Both years involved high incidences of fire in Indonesia. At present, there is no consistent satellite data stream spanning the full 19-year record, thereby complicating a comparison between these two fire seasons. We have investigated how various fire and precipitation datasets can be merged to better compare the fire dynamics in 1997 and 2015 as well as in intermediary years. We combined nighttime active fire detections from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) World Fire Atlas (WFA) available from 1997 until 2012 and the nighttime subset of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor from 2001 until now. For the overlapping period, MODIS detected about 4 times more fires than ATSR, but this ratio varied spatially. Although the reasons behind this spatial variability remain unclear, the coefficient of determination for the overlapping period was high (R-2 = 0.97, based on monthly data) and allowed for a consistent time series. We then constructed a rainfall time series based on the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP, 1997-2015) and the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Project (TRMM, 1998-2015). Relations between antecedent rainfall and fire activity were not uniform in Indonesia. In southern Sumatra and Kalimantan, we found that 120 days of rainfall accumulation had the highest coefficient of determination with annual fire intensity. In northern Sumatra, this period was only 30 days. Thresholds of 200 and 305mm average rainfall accumulation before each active fire were identified to generate a highincidence fire year in southern Sumatra and southern Kalimantan, respectively. The number of active fires detected in 1997 was 2.2 times higher than in 2015. Assuming the ratio between nighttime and total active fires did not change, the 1997 season was thus about twice as severe as the one in 2015. Although large, the difference is smaller than found in fire emission estimates from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). Besides different rainfall amounts and patterns, the two-fold difference between 1997 and 2015 may be attributed to a weaker El Nino and neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions in the later year. The fraction of fires burning in peatlands was higher in 2015 compared to 1997 (61 and 45 %, respectively). Finally, we found that the nonlinearity between rainfall and fire in Indonesia stems from longer periods without rain in extremely dry years.

TI  - Evaluating fuzzy operators of an object-based image analysis for detecting landslides and their changes
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a method of object-based image analysis (OBIA) for landslide delineation and landslide related change detection from multi-temporal satellite images. It uses both spatial and spectral information on landslides, through spectral analysis, shape analysis, textural measurements using a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and fuzzy logic membership functionality. Following an initial segmentation step, particular combinations of various information layers were investigated to generate objects. This was achieved by applying multi-resolution segmentation to IRS-1D, SPOT-5, and ALOS satellite imagery in sequential steps of feature selection and object classification, and using slope and flow direction derivatives from a digital elevation model together with topographically-oriented gray level co-occurrence matrices. Fuzzy membership values were calculated for 11 different membership functions using 20 landslide objects from a landslide training data. Six fuzzy operators were used for the final classification and the accuracies of the resulting landslide maps were compared. A Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation (FSE) approach was adapted for validation of the results and for an accuracy assessment using the landslide inventory database. The FSE approach revealed that the AND operator performed best with an accuracy of 93.87% for 2005 and 94.74% for 2011, closely followed by the MEAN Arithmetic operator, while the OR and AND (*) operators yielded relatively low accuracies. An object-based change detection was then applied to monitor landslide-related changes that occurred in northern Iran between 2005 and 2011. Knowledge rules to detect possible landslide-related changes were developed by evaluating all possible landslide-related objects for both time steps.

AB  - Increased application of high resolution spatial data such as high resolution satellite or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images from Earth, as well as High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images from Mars, makes it necessary to increase automation techniques capable of extracting detailed geomorphologic elements from such large data sets. Model validation by repeated images in environmental management studies such as climate-related changes as well as increasing access to high-resolution satellite images underline the demand for detailed automatic image-processing techniques in remote sensing. This study presents a methodology based on an unsupervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, known as Self Organizing Maps (SOM), to achieve the semi-automatic extraction of linear features with small footprints on satellite images. SOM is based on competitive learning and is efficient for handling huge data sets. We applied the SOM algorithm to high resolution satellite images of Earth and Mars (Quickbird, Worldview and HiRISE) in order to facilitate and speed up image analysis along with the improvement of the accuracy of results. About 98% overall accuracy and 0.001 quantization error in the recognition of small linear-trending bedforms demonstrate a promising framework.

TI  - Non-tectonic liquefaction-induced large surface displacements in the Aso Valley, Japan, caused by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, revealed by ALOS-2 SAR
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We constructed and analyzed full 3-D ground surface displacement field associated with the 2016 Kumamoto (Japan) earthquake using satellite radar images from ALOS-2. Displacements reflect not only tectonic crustal deformation caused by main earthquake faults but also non-tectonic surface deformations. The largest deformations in the earthquake sequence were found in the Aso Valley, along the NW outer rim of the Mt. Aso caldera. Large, independent surface deformations occurred in three areas with diameters of 500 m-2 km in the Aso Valley, and each area was horizontally displaced by more than 2 m to the NNW. These areas are underlain by thick lake-bottom deposits of saturated silt with low penetration resistance. As the direction of the displacements was parallel to the ground slope in each area, the strong seismic motion of the earthquake most probably induced liquefaction in the lake-bottom deposits and the ground surface slid horizontally along the slope on the liquefied silt. Because the areas of the large displacements are closely related to the thickness and shape of the lake-bottom deposits, amplification of the seismic wave in these deposits likely contributed to the liquefaction. A seismograph installed at the Aso Valley recorded co-seismic movement within several seconds of the main shock, indicating a possibility of the strong seismic motion amplifying the horizontal displacement of this area. On the SSE side of the deformed areas, numerous graben-like ruptures developed. As these ruptures are caused by surface tension during the large horizontal displacement, they are not earthquake fault traces and the process of this deformation is non-tectonic.

TI  - Intelligent hybrid system for dark spot detection using SAR data
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) are the main instrument used to support oil detection systems. In the microwave spectrum, oil slicks are identified as dark spots, regions with low backscatter at sea surface. Automatic and semi-automatic systems were developed to minimize processing time, the occurrence of false alarms and the subjectivity of human interpretation. This study presents an intelligent hybrid system, which integrates automatic and semi-automatic procedures to detect dark spots, in six steps: (I) SAR pre-processing; (II) Image segmentation; (III) Feature extraction and selection; (IV) Automatic clustering analysis; (V) Decision rules and, if needed; (VI) Semi-automatic processing. The results proved that the feature selection is essential to improve the detection capability, keeping only five pattern features to automate the clustering procedure. The semi-automatic method gave back more accurate geometries. The automatic approach erred more including regions, increasing the dark spots area, while the semiautomatic method erred more excluding regions. For well-defined and contrasted dark spots, the performance of the automatic and the semi-automatic methods is equivalent. However, the fully automatic method did not provide acceptable geometries in all cases. For these cases, the intelligent hybrid system was validated, integrating the semi-automatic approach, using compact and simple decision rules to request human intervention when needed. This approach allows for the combining of benefits from each approach, ensuring the quality of the classification when fully automatic procedures are not satisfactory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Monitoring nitrogen pollution in seasonally-pulsed coastal waters requires judicious choice of indicator species
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the sensitivity of algae and hermit crabs to seasonal shifts in the dominance of continuous sewage discharge vs. pulsed inputs of terrestrial material to a subtropical bay. During periods of low rainfall, when sewage was proportionately more important than diffuse loads from adjacent catchments, algae and crabs provided comparable information on the spatial distribution of N pollution. Conversely, during the wet season, when diffuse nitrogen loads from the catchment were of greater importance, the isotope signal of algae de coupled from that of crabs, indexing a greater magnitude of change and a more pronounced spatial gradient. Overall, algae better indexed the short-term impacts of anthropogenic nitrogen pollution whereas the signals provided by crabs provided a longer-term integrated measure of N inputs. Our results demonstrate the value of including multiple taxa with variable traits when monitoring the spatial and temporal extent of nitrogen inputs to coastal waters.

TI  - The shared and unique values of optical, fluorescence, thermal and microwave satellite data for estimating large-scale crop yields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop monitoring and yield estimation are important for both scientific research and practical applications. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for regional and global cropland monitoring, particularly in data-sparse regions that lack reliable ground observations and reporting. The conventional approach of using visible and near-infrared based vegetation index (VI) observations has prevailed for decades since the onset of the global satellite era. However, other satellite data encompass diverse spectral ranges that may contain complementary information on crop growth and yield, but have been largely understudied and underused. Here we conducted one of the first attempts at synergizing multiple satellite data spanning a diverse spectral range, including visible, near-infrared, thermal and microwave, into one framework to estimate crop yield for the U.S. Corn Belt, one of the world's most important food baskets. Specifically, we included MODIS Enhanced VI (EVI), estimated Gross Primary Production based on GOME-2 solar-induced fluorescence (SIF-GPP), thermal-based ALEXI Evapotranspiration (ET), QuikSCAT Ku-band radar backscatter, and AMSR-E X-band passive microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) in this study, benchmarked on USDA county-level crop yield statistics. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), an effective statistical model for dimension reduction, to distinguish commonly shared and unique individual information from the various satellite data and other ancillary climate information for crop yield estimation. In the PLSR model that includes all of the satellite data and climate variables from 2007 to 2009, we assessed the first two major PLSR components and found that the first component (an integrated proxy of crop aboveground biomass) explained 82% variability of modelled crop yield, and the second component (dominated by environmental stresses) explained 15% variability of modelled crop yield. We found that most of the satellite derived metrics (e.g. SIF-GPP, radar back scatter, EVI, VOD, ALEXI-ET) share common information related to aboveground crop biomass (i.e. the first component). For this shared information, the SIF-GPP and backscatter data contain almost the same amount of information as EVI at the county scale. When removing the above shared component from all of the satellite data, we found that EVI and SIF-GPP do not provide much extra information; instead, Ku-band backscatter, thermal-based ALEXI-ET, and X-band VOD provide unique information on environmental stresses that improves overall crop yield predictive skill. In particular, Ku-band backscatter and associated differences between morning and afternoon overpasses contribute unique information on crop growth and environmental stress. Overall, using satellite data from various spectral bands significantly improves regional crop yield predictions. The additional use of ancillary climate data (e.g. precipitation and temperature) further improves model skill, in part because the crop reproductive stage related to harvest index is highly sensitive to environmental stresses but they are not fully captured by the satellite data used in our study. We conclude that using satellite data across various spectral ranges can improve monitoring of large-scale crop growth and yield beyond what can be achieved from individual sensors. These results also inform the synergistic use and development of current and next generation satellite missions, including NASA ECOSTRESS, SMAP, and 000-2, for agricultural applications.(C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A time series of annual land use and land cover maps of China from 1982 to 2013 generated using AVHRR GIMMS NDVI3g data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A time series of annual land use and land cover (LULC) maps that cover an extended period of time is a key dataset for climatological studies investigating land-atmosphere interaction. Change in LULC can influence regional climate by altering the surface roughness, soil moisture, heat flux partition, and terrestrial carbon storage. Although annual global LULC maps are generated from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the earliest MODIS LULC map is for 2001, which limits the potential time period for climatological analyses. This study produced a continuous series of annual LULC maps of China from 1982 to 2013 using random forest classification of 19 phonological metrics derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) third generation NDVI (NDVI3g) data. The classifier was trained using reference data derived from the MODIS land cover type product (MCD12Q1). Based on a comparison with Google Earth images, the overall accuracy of a simplified eight-class version of our 2012 LULC map is 73.8%, which is not significantly different from the accuracy of the MODIS map of the same year. Our maps indicate that for the three decades studied, the area of croplands and forests in China increased, and the area of grasslands decreased. These annual maps of land cover will be an important dataset for future climate studies, and the methodologies used in this study can be applied to other geographical regions where availability of continuous time series of LULC maps is limited.

TI  - Capturing species-level drought responses in a temperate deciduous forest using ratios of photochemical reflectance indices between sunlit and shaded canopies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To classify trees along a spectrum of isohydric to anisohydric behavior is a promising new framework for identifying tree species' sensitivities to drought stress, directly related to the vulnerability of carbon uptake of terrestrial ecosystems with increased hydroclimate variability. Trees with isohydric strategies regulate stomatal conductance to maintain stationary leaf water potential, while trees with anisohydric strategies allow leaf water potential to fall, which in the absence of significant hydraulic cavitation will facilitate greater rates of carbon uptake. Despite the recognition of the gas exchange consequences of isohydric and anisohydric strategies for individual tree species, there have been few studies regarding whether isohydric trees produces distinct spectral signatures under drought stress that can be remotely sensed. Here, we examined the capability of four vegetation indices (PRI, NDVI, NDVI705, and EVI) to capture the differences in spectral responses between isohydric and anisohydric trees within a deciduous forest in central Indiana, USA. Both leaf-level spectral measurements and canopy-scale satellite observations were used to compare peak growing-season spectral signatures between a drought and a non-drought year. At the leaf scale, two vegetation indices (NDVI and NDVI705) failed to capture the drought signal or the divergent isohydric/anisohydric behavior. EVI successfully captured the drought signal at both leaf and canopy scales, but failed to capture the divergent behavior between isohydric and anisohydric tree species during the drought. PRI captured both drought signals and divergent isohydric/anisohydric behavior at both leaf and canopy scales once normalized between sunlit (backward direction images) and shaded (forward direction images) portions of canopy, which indicates drought stress and subsequent photosynthetic down regulation are greater in the sunlit portion of canopy. This study presents a significant step forward in our ability to directly mapping emergent isohydricity at different scales based on divergent spectral signatures between sunlit and shaded canopies.

TI  - Analysis of seasonal effects on forest parameter estimation of Indian deciduous forest using TerraSAR-X PolInSAR acquisitions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - TerraSAR-X/FanDEM-X form the first space-borne interferometer providing full-PoIInSAR acquisitions with a near-zero temporal gap. This paper explores the potential of X-band SAR data for forest height estimation over tropical Indian forests. Unique TanDEM-X data sets with varied spatial baselines are acquired over a tropical, deciduous Indian forest Multiple dual polarimetric and fully polarimetric acquisitions are analysed and the best performance is achieved using fully polarimetric data acquired over both high- and low-biomass forests (r(2) =0.86 and r(2)=0.80 respectively). It is shown for the first time that, for deciduous Indian tropical forests, seasonal changes such as leaf-fall affect the PoIInSAR based height inversion performance. For species exhibiting leaf-fall, acquisition during leaf-on season provides better height inversion accuracy (r(2)=0.75) than for leaf-fall season (r(2)=0.65). Results show consistent PoIInSAR height inversion performance for both high- and low-biomass forests in both natural and managed forest tracts. Spatial baseline is a critical factor for selection of suitable acquisitions for PoIInSAR based height estimation. The effect of spatial baseline on height inversion performance is also discussed.

TI  - Detection of land surface freeze-thaw status on the Tibetan Plateau using passive microwave and thermal infrared remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The freeze/thaw (F/T) cycle plays an important role in climate change and ecology research. Currently, soil F/T monitoring is restricted by low satellite spatial resolution or a relative long revisit cycle, which is one of the main problems in improving F/T monitoring resolution using available satellite data. Because temperature is a key parameter in determining soil FIT status, in this study, relatively high-resolution merged land surface temperature data were obtained using the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) method by blending LSTs retrieved from passive microwave and infrared remotely sensed data. The merged temperature data were then used to downscale the passive microwave brightness temperature from 0.25 degrees to 0.05 degrees. Finally, the merged temperature and downscaled brightness temperature data were applied to discriminate the surface freeze/thaw status. A comparison with in situ data turned out that the downscaled brightness temperature could be used to determine soil F/T status with a total classification accuracy higher than 80%. The total freeze/thaw classification accuracy using merged temperature data was only 59.7%, which can be attributed to the temperature difference between the land surface and soil. After the adjustment with a relationship between soil temperature and land surface temperature, the classification accuracy reached 89.7%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A fast and exhaustive method for heterogeneity and epistasis analysis based on multi-objective optimization.
T2  - Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - MOTIVATION: The existing epistasis analysis approaches have been criticized mainly for their: (i) ignoring heterogeneity during epistasis analysis; (ii) high computational costs; and (iii) volatility of performances and results. Therefore, they will not perform well in general, leading to lack of reproducibility and low power in complex disease association studies. In this work, a fast scheme is proposed to accelerate exhaustive searching based on multi-objective optimization named ESMO for concurrently analyzing heterogeneity and epistasis phenomena. In ESMO, mutual entropy and Bayesian network approaches are combined for evaluating epistatic SNP combinations. In order to be compatible with heterogeneity of complex diseases, we designed an adaptive framework based on non-dominant sort and top k selection algorithm with improved time complexity O(k*M*N) . Moreover, ESMO is accelerated by strategies such as trading space for time, calculation sharing and parallel computing. Finally, ESMO is nonparametric and model-free.RESULTS: We compared ESMO with other recent or classic methods using different evaluating measures. The experimental results show that our method not only can quickly handle epistasis, but also can effectively detect heterogeneity of complex population structures.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/XiongLi2016/ESMO/tree/master/ESMO-common-master .CONTACT: lx_hncs@163.com.

TI  - The Microwave Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (<i>MTVDI</i>) based on <i>AMSR</i>-<i>E</i> brightness temperatures for long-term drought assessment across China (2003-2010)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based drought indices have been proved to be effective and convenient in detecting drought conditions at regional and global scales. However, most current drought indices are based on the visible/near infrared/thermal remote sensing, which might be influenced greatly by cloud, atmospheric water content and rain-fall. Microwave sensors can overcome the shortages of visible/near infrared/thermal remote sensing and show to be another important approach for drought monitoring due to its all-weather working advantages. But to date, the application of microwave vegetation drought indices in drought monitoring has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, for the first time we constructed a microwave derived Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) - MTVDI based on the theory of optical TVDI using the brightness temperatures (Tb) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) onboard Aqua satellite. Firstly, we built a new land surface temperature (Ts) inversion model based on the AMSR-E 18.7 GHz horizontal, 23.8 GHz and 89.0 GHz vertical polarized Tb, and then developed the Microwave Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MNDVI) from the AMSR-E 23.8 GHz Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI). After that, we constructed three versions of MTVDI: original MTVDI using Ts and MNDVI; Imp-MTVDI (Improved MTVDI) using the Ts-T-air (the difference between land surface temperature and air temperature) to replace the Ts; and NonL-MTVDI (Nonlinear MTVDI) using non-linear equation to fit the dry and wet edges, respectively. Finally, we used precipitation, soil moisture (SM) and P/PET (the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) to validate the performances of MTVDI, Imp-MTVDI, NonL-MTVDI, MODIS derived TVDI and MIDI (improved TVDI). The time-series drought assessments across China from 2003 to 2010 indicated that the trends of the proposed MTVDI showed the most negative correlations with the variations of precipitation, P/PET and SM, and showed best performances of significance test in most regions of China. Moreover, the MTVDI could better separate the drought levels in different degrees than MODIS-derived TVDI. However, the proposed MTVDI still has some uncertainties in regions widely covered by desert, Gobi and large water surfaces. In addition, this paper mainly focuses on large spatial scale and long term drought monitoring and only uses satellite data for model validation. Further studies are needed to develop a higher spatial- and temporal-resolution MTVDI for short-term and small spatial-scale drought monitoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ownership is considered as a vital aspect for sustainable management of forest and its associated biodiversity. The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 reported that privately owned forest area are increasing on a global scale, but deforestation was found very active in privately owned hill forest areas of Malaysia. Penang State was purposively chosen as it has been experiencing rapid and radical changes due to urban expansion over the last three decades. In this study, analyses of land-use changes were done by PCI Geomatica using Landsat images from 1991 to 2015, future trends of land-use change were assessed using EXCEL forecast function, and its impact on the surrounding environment were conducted by reviewing already published articles on changing environment of the study area. This study revealed an annual deforestation rate of 1.4% in Penang Island since 1991. Trend analysis forecasted a forest area smaller than the current forest reserves by the year 2039. Impact analysis revealed a rapid biodiversity loss with increasing landslides, mudflows, water pollution, flash flood, and health hazard. An immediate ban over hill-land development is crucial for overall environmental safety. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a lookup-table-based approach to data fusion for seasonal wetlands monitoring: An integrated use of AMSR series, MODIS, and Landsat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Broad scale monitoring of inland waters is essential to research on carbon and water cycles, and for application in the monitoring of disasters including floods and droughts on various spatial and temporal scales. Satellite remote sensing using spatiotemporal data fusion (STF) has recently attracted attention as a way of simultaneously describing spatial heterogeneity and tracking the temporal variability of inland waters. However, existing STF approaches have limitations in describing abrupt temporal changes, integrating "dissimilar" datasets (i.e., fusions between microwave and optical data), and compiling long-term, frequent STF datasets. To overcome these limitations, in this study we developed and evaluated a lookup table (LUT)-based STF, termed database unmixing (DBUX), using multiple types of satellite data (AMSR series, MODIS, and Landsat), and applied it to semi-arid seasonal wetlands in Namibia. The results show that DBUX is: 1) flexible in integrating optical data (MODIS or Landsat) with microwave (AMSR series) and seasonal (day of year) information; 2) able to generate long-term, frequent Landsat-like datasets; and 3) more reliable than an existing approach (spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model; STARFM) for tracking dynamic temporal variations in seasonal wetlands. Water maps retrieved from the resulting STF dataset for the wetlands had a 30-m spatial resolution and a temporal frequency of 1 or 2 days, and the dataset covered from 2002 to 2015. The time series water maps accurately described both seasonal and interannual changes in the wetlands, and could act as a basis for understanding the hydrological features of the region. Further studies are required to enable application of DBUX in other regions, and for other landscapes with different satellite sensor combinations.

TI  - An ecotoxicological approach to evaluate the effects of tourism impacts in the Marine Protected Area of La Maddalena (Sardinia, Italy)
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Marine Protected Area of La Maddalena Archipelago, environmental protection rules and safeguard measures for nautical activities have helped in reducing anthropogenic pressure; however, tourism related activities remain particularly significant in summer. With the aim of evaluating their impacts, the biomarker approach using transplanted Mytilus galloprovincialis as sentinel organisms coupled with POCIS deployment was applied. Mussels, translocated to four marine areas differently impacted by tourism activities, were sampled before, during and after the tourist season. Moreover, endocrine disruptors in passive samplers POCIS and the cellular toxicity of whole POCIS extracts on mussel haemocytes were evaluated to integrate ecotoxicological information. Lysosomal biomarkers, condition index and mortality rate, as well as metals in tissues suggested an alteration of the health status of mussels transplanted to the most impacted sites. The cellular toxicity of POCIS extracts was pointed out, notwithstanding the concentrations of the examined compounds were always below the detection limits.

TI  - 3D spectral analysis in the VNIR-SWIR spectral region as a tool for soil classification
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectroscopy has proven to be an efficient, rapid and low-cost method for soil spectral analysis that can improve on the results obtained from today's traditional methods of conducting soil surveys. Nonetheless, this tool is used mostly in the laboratory and at surface level. The main objective of this paper is to develop a new optical method for characterizing soil profiles, towards improving the efficiency and accuracy of the traditional soil survey. We used airborne hyperspectral data from the AisaFENIX sensor for surface classification and ASD spectral measurements of soil samples for subsurface analysis. A total of 643 soil samples were extracted from 48 cores, each core representing a soil profile. All samples were air-dried, crushed and sieved, and then analyzed by ASD spectrometer under laboratory conditions. Clay content was also measured to provide additional information. The 3D spectral data were analyzed using SAM algorithm, spectral gradient (m), k-means clustering and gley horizon parameter (G) to classify soils and distinguish between soil horizons in each core. The results suggest that these parameters can provide satisfactory results both from laboratory measurements and hyperspectral remote sensing data (R-2 = 0.81 for clay content and R-2 = 0.78 for gleying conditions) in order to distinguish between the soil horizons using 3D spectral information. Moreover, the method is satisfactory for obtaining soil types from 3D spectral sensing as well as evaluating the catena development and other spatial soil distributions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithological mapping in mountainous regions is often impeded by limited accessibility due to relief. This study aims to evaluate (1) the performance of different supervised classification approaches using remote sensing data and (2) the use of additional information such as geomorphology. We exemplify the methodology in the Bardi-Zard area in NE Iraq, a part of the Zagros Fold - Thrust Belt, known for its chromite deposits. We highlighted the improvement of remote sensing geological classification by integrating geomorphic features and spatial information in the classification scheme. We performed a Maximum Likelihood (ML) classification method besides two Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA): Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to allow the joint use of geomorphic features, Band Ratio (BR), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), spatial information (spatial coordinates) and multispectral data of the Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) satellite. The RF algorithm showed reliable results and discriminated serpentinite, talus and terrace deposits, red argillites with conglomerates and limestone, limy conglomerates and limestone conglomerates, tuffites interbedded with basic lavas, limestone and Metamorphosed limestone and reddish green shales. The best overall accuracy (similar to 80%) was achieved by Random Forest (RF) algorithms in the majority of the sixteen tested combination datasets.

TI  - Risk factors for metastatic prostate cancer: A sentinel event case series
T2  - PROSTATE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRoot cause analysis is a technique used to assess systems factors related to sentinel eventsserious adverse events within healthcare systems. This technique is commonly used to identify factors, which allowed these adverse events to occur, to target areas for improvement and to improve health care delivery systems. We sought to apply this technique to men presenting with metastatic prostate cancer (PCa).MethodsWe performed an in-depth case series analysis of 15 patients, who presented with metastatic disease at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center using root cause analysis to refine a list of health system factors that lead to late stage presentation in the current era.ResultsKey factors in late diagnosis of PCa included lack of insurance, lack of routine PSA testing, comorbidities, reticence of patients to follow up actionable PSA, and aggressive disease. Three patients had aggressive disease that would not have been discovered at an early stage in the disease process, despite routine screening. However, analysis of the remaining 12 patients illuminated health system factors led to missing important diagnostic information, which might have led to diagnosis of PCa at a curable stage.ConclusionsThe cases help highlight the need for systems based approaches to early diagnosis of PCa. A heterogeneous group of barriers to early diagnosis were identified in our series of patients including economic, health systems, and cultural factors. These findings underscore the need for individualized approaches to preventing delayed diagnosis of PCa. While limited by our single-institution scope, this approach provides a model for research and quality improvement initiatives to identify modifiable systems factors impeding appropriate diagnoses of PCa.

TI  - Assessing the reliability and consistency of IriSAR and GNSS data for retrieving 3D-displacement rapid changes, the example of the 2015 Piton de la Fournaise eruptions
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - InSAR and GNSS are now the best and most developed techniques in the Earth sciences to track deformation, especially in volcanology. In this study, we assess the reliability and consistency of these two techniques for measuring 3-D ground displacements-and not only the displacement in the direction of the InSAR Line of Sight-on volcanoes during rapid changes. The use of a large amount of satellite data (X, C, L-band as well as right and left looking acquisitions) made it possible to retrieve the 3-D displacement components with an unprecedented accuracy. We carry out this evaluation on the Piton de la Fournaise volcano, where four eruptions occurred in 2015. The comparison between GNSS and InSAR allows us: (i) to describe the deformation pattern associated with these eruptions, (ii) to quantify the discrepancies between InSAR and GNSS, and (iii) to discuss the limits and the complementarities of InSAR and GNSS. The ground deformation patterns associated with the four eruptions of Piton de la Fournaise in 2015 are typical of this volcano, with decimeter ground displacements asymmetrically distributed along the dike path, evidencing a preferential eastward motion, particularly visible thanks to the broad spatial coverage of InSAR Except for the NS component, InSAR and GNSS data are in overall agreement, with most of the GNSS-InSAR residuals <2.5 cm and <5 cm on the EW and vertical component, respectively, i.e. within the error bar of the two methods. Most of the discrepancies on the terminal cone can be attributed to uncorrected atmospheric effects in InSAR. Our study confirms the consistency and the complementarity of the two methods to characterize (i) the 3-D ground deformation distribution in high spatial resolution (InSAR), and (ii) the dynamism (GNSS) associated with eruptive activity.

TI  - High spatial resolution spectral unmixing for mapping ash species across a complex urban environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ash (Fraxinus L.) species are currently threatened by the emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) across a growing area in the eastern US. Accurate mapping of ash species is required to monitor the host resource, predict EAB spread and better understand the short- and long-term effects of EAB on the ash resource. Hyperspectral remote sensing technologies have been used to successfully map forest species, although most efforts are focused on healthy canopies for relatively homogeneous forested stands. This study uses imagery collected by the NASA Goddard LiDAR, Hyperspectral and Thermal (GLiHT) airborne imager to map ash species at the tree level in an EAB infested urban setting. The overall goal of the study is to understand how canopy condition impacts species mapping accuracy and identify data collection and image processing techniques to more accurately map the location of ash species in infested regions.Results indicate that while overall independent validation mapping accuracy of ash and non-ash trees was 81%, correct identification of ash canopies dropped from 62% for vigor 1 trees to 22% for vigor 2 trees. To minimize these errors, we developed a multiple endmember, spectral unmixing technique to overcome challenges presented by a spectrally complicated target in a complex urban environment. This hinges on the use of endmember spectra from trees across a range of canopy condition, including the derivation of vegetation indices to inform the spectral unmixing calibration. This approach was more accurate than calibrations performed using traditional unmixing based only on pure endmember spectra.Implications for this work suggest that urban forest managers may attain more accurate maps by conducting remote sensing data collections prior to infestation while the trees are still healthy. Where this is not possible, mapping efforts must reflect a range of canopy conditions and include vegetation indices concurrent with reflectance data. The resulting ash species maps provide urban forest managers spatially explicit products to help estimate the extent of possible impacts in their communities, guide the implementation of management and monitoring efforts and provide the basis for planning as EAB continues to spread.

TI  - Improving Fmask cloud and cloud shadow detection in mountainous area for Landsats 4-8 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a new algorithm called MFmask (Mountainous Fmask) for automated cloud and cloud shadow detection for Landsats 4-8 images acquired in mountainous areas. The MFmask algorithm, built upon the success of the Fmask algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012; Zhu et al., 2015), is designed for cloud and cloud shadow detection in mountainous areas, where the Fmask algorithm is not performing well. The inputs of the MFmask algorithm include Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, Brightness Temperature (BT), and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Compared to Fmask, MFmask can separate water and land pixels better in mountainous areas with the aid of DEMs. Moreover, MFmask produces better cloud detection results than Fmask in mountainous areas after BT is linearly normalized by DEMs. To provide more accurate cloud shadow detection in mountainous areas, MFmask uses a double-projection approach to better predict cloud shadow shape on slope side. Additionally, MFmask applies a topographic correction to remove terrain shadows and estimates cloud base height with neighboring clouds. Both will reduce the possibility of cloud and cloud shadow mismatch and increase cloud shadow detection accuracy for places with large topographic gradient. To test the performance of the proposed MFmask algorithm, a total of 67 Landsat images acquired in mountainous areas from different parts of the world were selected for assessing the accuracy of cloud detection, in which 15 of them were used for assessing the accuracy of cloud shadow detection. Compared with Fmask, MFmask can provide substantial improvements in cloud and cloud shadow detection accuracies for places with large topographic gradient and also work well for relatively flat terrain.

TI  - Examination of Sentinel 2A multi-spectral instrument (MSI) reflectance anisotropy and the suitability of a general method to normalize MSI reflectance to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2A multi-spectral instrument (MSI) acquires multi-spectral reflective wavelength observations with directional effects due to surface reflectance anisotropy and changes in the solar and viewing geometry. Directional effects were examined by considering two ten day periods of Sentinel-2A data acquired close to the solar principal and orthogonal planes over approximately 20 degrees x 10 degrees of southern Africa. More than 6.6 million (January 2016) and 10.6 million (April 2016) pairs of reflectance observations sensed 3 or 7 days apart in the forward and backscatter directions in overlapping Sentinel-2A orbit swaths were considered. The Sentinel-2A data were projected into the MODIS sinusoidal projection but first had to be registered due to a misregistration issue evident in the overlapping orbits. The top of atmosphere reflectance data were corrected to surface reflectance using the SEN2COR atmospheric correction software. Only pairs of forward and backward reflectance values that were cloud and snow-free, unsaturated, and had no significant change in their 3 or 7 day separation, were considered. The maximum observed Sentinel-2A view zenith angle was 11.93 degrees. Greater BRDF effects were apparent in the January data (acquired close to the solar principal plane) than the April data (acquired close to the orthogonal plane) and at higher view zenith angle. For the January data the average difference between the surface reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges increased with wavelength from 0.035 (blue), 0.047 (green), 0.057 (red), 0.078 (NIR), to about 0.1 (SWIR). These differences may constitute a significant source of noise for certain applications.The suitability of a recently published methodology developed to generate Landsat nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) was examined for Sentinel-2A application. The methodology uses fixed MODIS BRDF spectral parameters and is attractive because it has little sensitivity to the land cover type, condition, or surface disturbance and can be derived in a computationally efficient manner globally. It was applied to the southern Africa Sentinel 2A data and shown to reduce Sentinel-2A BRDF effects. The average difference between the reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges was smaller in the NBAR data than in the corresponding surface reflectance data. Residual BRDF effects in the Sentinel-2A NBAR data occurred likely because of atmospheric correction and sensor calibration errors and inadequacies in the NBAR derivation approach. These issues are discussed with recommendations for future research including global and red-edge Sentinel-2A NBAR derivation that were not considered in this study. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) for volcano monitoring in two dimensions: Opportunities and challenges. Case study Piton de la Fournaise volcano
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides an opportunity for monitoring ground deformation at active volcanoes with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Modern SAR satellites acquire very large volumes of data that no longer can be effectively and efficiently processed and interpreted manually. The development of novel automatic processing methodologies is warranted in order to fully utilize big data. The Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) methodology is an example of the semi-automatic processing system for computing temporally dense two-dimensional, horizontal east-west and vertical time series of ground deformation from ascending and descending SAR imagery acquired by various satellites. Here MSBAS is used for mapping ground deformation at the Piton de la Fournaise volcano (La Reunion Island, France) during the February 2012-April 2016 period from RADARSAT-2 data. Five volcanic eruptions occurred during the June 2014-October 2015 period, producing over 60cm of horizontal and over 30cm of vertical ground deformation, well-resolved in the MSBAS-derived time series. Validation of DInSAR results by comparison with GNSS observations and modeling of the two last and largest eruptions was performed. Validation showed good overall agreement between DInSAR and GNSS observations while revealing the benefits and limitations of both techniques. Modeling of fault and dike geometries attempted to explain the dis-proportionally large eastward motion of the eastern flank of the Piton de la Fournaise volcano that occurred during these eruptions. We demonstrated that the simple elastic model consisting of two dikes and a sliding surface can account for the observed ground deformation. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been used for characterizing and mapping in two relevant ice-free areas in the South Shetland Islands. The objective has been to identify and characterize land surface covers that mainly include periglacial and glacial landforms, using fully polarimetric SAR C band RADARSAT-2 data, on Fildes Peninsula that forms part of King George Island. and Ardley Island. Polarimetric parameters obtained from the SAR data, a selection of field based training and validation sites and a supervised classification approach, using the support vector machine were chosen to determine the spatial distribution of the different landforms. Eight periglacial and glacial landforms were characterized according to their scattering mechanisms using a set of 48 polarimetric parameters. The mapping of the most representative surface covers included colluvial deposits, stone fields and pavements, patterned ground, glacial till and rock outcrops, lakes and glacier ice. The overall accuracy of the results was estimated at 81%, a significant value when mapping areas that are within isolated regions where access is limited. Periglacial surface covers such as stone fields and pavements occupy 25% and patterned ground over 20% of the ice-free areas. These are results that form the basis for an extensive monitoring of the ice-free areas throughout the northern Antarctic Peninsula region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date digital elevation models (DEMs) are important tools for studying mountain hazards. We considered natural hazards related to glacier retreat, debris flows, and snow avalanches in two study areas of the Western Tien-Shan mountains, Uzbekistan. High-resolution DEMs were generated using single TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X datasets. The high quality and actuality of the DEMs were proved through a comparison with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Advanced Spaceborne Emission and Reflection Radiometer, and Topo DEMs, using Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite data as the reference dataset. For the first study area, which had high levels of economic activity, we applied the generated TanDEM-X DEM to an avalanche dynamics simulation using RAMMS software. Verification of the output results showed good agreement with field observations. For the second study area, with a wide spatial distribution of glaciers, we applied the TanDEM-X DEM to an assessment of glacier surface elevation changes. The results can be used to calculate the local mass balance in glacier ablation zones in other areas. Models were applied to estimate the probability of moraine-dammed lake formation and the affected area of a possible debris flow resulting from glacial lake outburst. The natural hazard research methods considered here will minimize costly ground observations in poorly accessible mountains and mitigate the impacts of hazards on the environment of Uzbekistan.

TI  - The relationship between threshold-based and inflexion-based approaches for extraction of land surface phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The inflexion-based and threshold-based approaches are the two most popular approaches for extracting land surface phenology (LSP). The first approach uses inflexion point of the vegetation growth curve to determine the start-of-season (SOS) and end-of-season (EOS), while the second approach identifies SOS and EOS with a predefined percentage of vegetation growth amplitude. These two approaches have long been thought to be independent. In this letter, we investigated the relationship between the two approaches for extracting SOS. It was found that the thresholds at several key points in the inflexion-based approach are constant. The threshold at the inflexion point for SOS and EOS is 9.18% of vegetation growth amplitude. This threshold can link the SOS derived from the two approaches, which made it possible to determine the significant vegetation growth transitions for the threshold-based approach. Other thresholds for SOS retrieval, such as commonly-used 10% and 20% of vegetation growth amplitude, were also analyzed using a global reference NDVI. A high SOS difference between the two approaches indicates a slow vegetation growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - High-resolution InSAR constraints on flood-related subsidence and evaporite dissolution along the Dead Sea shores: Interplay between hydrology and rheology
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinkhole generation and land subsidence are commonly attributed to dissolution of subsurface layers by under saturated groundwater and formation of cavities. Along the Dead Sea (DS) shorelines, this process also involves seasonal flash floods that are drained into the subsurface by existing and newly formed sinkholes. We quantify the contribution of flash-floods to salt dissolution and land subsidence using high-resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Subsidence rates during a 3-year period (2012-2015) were calculated from 57 COSMO SkyMed X-band interferograms bracketing major flood events and intra-flood periods in 21 sinkhole sites. The sites are located within channels and alluvial fans along the western shores of the Dead Sea, Israel. The observed subsidence reaches maximum rates of similar to 2.5 mm/day, accumulating in specific sites to 500 mm/year. In most of the sinkhole sites a gradual increase in the annual subsidence rate is observed during the 3-year study period. Three different modes of response to floods were observed: (1) sites where floodwater is not directly channeled into sinkholes do not respond to floods; (2) sites adjacent to active channels with sinkholes are unaffected by specific floods but their subsidence rates increase gradually from early winter to mid-summer, and decay gradually until the following winter; and (3) sites in active channels with sinkholes are characterized by an abrupt increase in subsidence rates immediately after each flood (by a factor of up to 20) and by a subsequent quasi-exponential subsidence decay over periods of several months. In these latter sites, subsidence rates after each flood are temporally correlated with alternating groundwater levels in adjacent boreholes. The rapid rise in groundwater head following floods increases the hydraulic gradient of the under-saturated groundwater and hence also the groundwater discharge and the dissolution rate of the subsurface salt layer. A subsequent quasi exponential water level drop results in similar deceleration in dissolution and subsidence rates, with a similar characteristic decay time of about 150 days. The observed subsidence decay pattern may also be explained by viscoelastic relaxation of the overburden in response to instantaneously-formed dissolution cavities. Utilizing a Kelvin viscoelastic model, we show that the contribution of this process is most probably < 30% of the total observed subsidence and is sensitive to the sediment mechanical properties. On a broader scale, this study demonstrates how high-resolution InSAR measurements can improve our understanding of subsurface dissolution and subsidence processes and provide independent constraints on the mechanical properties of heterogeneous alluvial sediments.

TI  - Age-Related Differences in Influenza B Infection by Lineage in a Community-Based Sentinel System, 2010-2011 to 2015-2016, Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Age-related differences in influenza B lineage detection were explored in the community-based Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) from 2010-2011 to 2015-2016. Whereas >80% of B(Victoria) cases were <40 years old, B(Yamagata) cases showed a bimodal age distribution with 27% who were <20 years old and 61% who were 30-64 years old, but with a notable gap in cases between 20 and 29 years old (4%). Overall, the median age was 20 years lower for B(Victoria) vs B(Yamagata) cases (20 vs 40 years; P < .01). Additional phylodynamic and immuno-epidemiological research is needed to understand age-related variation in influenza B risk by lineage, with potential implications for prevention and control across the lifespan.

TI  - Assessing spatial and temporal patterns in land surface phenology for the Australian Alps (2000-2014)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevation is a key environmental factor influencing both biological and ecological phenomena in mountain environments. Mountains are useful areas for studying impacts associated with climatic change, as their significant biological diversity often varies in conjunction with elevation. While previous studies have used remote sensing to quantify the impacts of elevation differences on land surface phenology descriptors in mountains, they have focused almost exclusively on the Northern Hemisphere. This study fills this gap by presenting a 15-year phenological time-series for the Australian Alps derived using data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Phenological descriptors were estimated from the MODIS time-series and they corresponded with the start, end and duration of the growing period (SGP, EGP and DGP, respectively) for the major vegetation communities in the Australian Alps. Results indicated that the descriptor corresponding with the start of the growing period was more sensitive to changes in elevation, while the results for the end of the growing period descriptor were more uniform, particularly at lower elevations. For all but the highest elevation areas in the Australian Alps, the results indicated an overall trend towards an earlier start and later end to the growing period, culminating in a longer duration of the growing period. These findings are consistent with those previously reported in the literature, though they are likely influenced by the fire history of the alpine areas., (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Understanding the temporal behavior of crops using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2-like data for agricultural applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop monitoring information is essential for food security and to improve our understanding of the role of agriculture on climate change, among others. Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10 days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel -2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described. This study points out the interest of SAR data and particularly the VH/VV ratio, which is poorly documented in previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detecting high and low-intensity fires in Alaska using VIIRS I-band data: An improved operational approach for high latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imagery provide timely information for wildfire detection, monitoring, and characterization at the global scale. However, in Alaskan boreal forest fires, their lower effectiveness in detecting residual fire once the high-intensity fire front has passed limits their practical use for regional or local fire management decisions. Using data acquired during Alaska's 2016 fire season, we analyzed the performance of the MODIS-based MOD14/MYD14, and the more recent VIIRS I-band active fire products. A comparison with the fire perimeter and properties data published by the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center (AICC) shows that both MODIS and VIIRS fire products successfully detect all fires larger than approximately 200-300 ha. For fires smaller than this threshold, the VIIRS I-band product offers higher detection likelihood. To map burn areas containing both low- and high-intensity active fire, we developed the VIIRS I-band Fire Detection Algorithm for High Latitudes (VIFDAHL). We apply this algorithm to regions of known Alaskan boreal forest fires and validate it using events mapped by fire management agencies and detected on closely-timed Landsat imagery. We find that for Alaska, an example of a high-latitude region, VIFDAHL more accurately captures the fire spread, can differentiate well between low and high-intensity fires, and can detect 30-90% more fire pixels compared to the MODIS and VIIRS global fire products.

TI  - Surface deformation induced by magmatic processes at Pacaya Volcano, Guatemala revealed by InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Pacaya Volcano, Guatemala is a continuously active, basaltic volcano with an unstable western flank. Despite continuous activity since 1961, a lack of high temporal resolution geodetic surveying has prevented detailed modeling of Pacaya's underlying magmatic plumbing system. A new, temporally dense dataset of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) RADARSAT-2 images, spanning December 2012 to March 2014, show magmatic deformation before and during major eruptions in January and March 2014. Inversion of InSAR surface displacements using simple analytical forward models suggest that three magma bodies are responsible for the observed deformation: (1) a similar to 4 km deep spherical reservoir located northwest of the summit, (2) a similar to 0.4 km deep spherical source located directly west of the summit, and (3) a shallow dike below the summit. Periods of heightened volcanic activity are instigated by magma pulses at depth, resulting in rapid inflation of the edifice. We observe an intrusion cycle at Pacaya that consists of deflation of one or both magma reservoirs followed by dike intrusion. Intrusion volumes are proportional to reservoir volume loss and do not always result in an eruption. Periods of increased activity culminate with larger dike-fed eruptions. Large eruptions are followed by inter eruptive periods marked by a decrease in crater explosions and a lack of detected deformation. Co-eruptive flank motion appears to have initiated a new stage of volcanic rifting at Pacaya defined by repeated NW-SE oriented dike intrusions. This creates a positive feedback relationship whereby magmatic forcing from eruptive dike intrusions induce flank motion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A post-classification change detection method based on iterative slow feature analysis and Bayesian soft fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-classification with multi-temporal remote sensing images is one of the most popular change detection methods, providing the detailed "from-to" change information in real applications. However, due to the fact that it neglects the temporal correlation between corresponding pixels in multi-temporal images, the post-classification approach usually suffers from an accumulation of misclassification errors. In order to solve this problem, previous studies have separated the change and non-change candidates with change vector analysis, and they have only updated the classes of the changed pixels with the post-classification; however, this approach with thresholding loses the continuous change intensity information, where larger values indicate higher probability to be changed. Therefore, in this paper, a new post-classification method with iterative slow feature analysis (ISFA) and Bayesian soft fusion is proposed to obtain reliable and accurate change detection maps. The proposed method consists of three main steps: 1) independent classification is implemented to obtain the class probability for each image; 2) the ISFA algorithm is used to obtain the continuous change probability map of multi-temporal images, where the value of each pixel indicates the probability to be changed; and 3) based on Bayesian theory, the a posteriori probabilities for the class combinations of coupled pixels are calmlated to integrate the class probability with the change probability, which is named as Bayesian soft fusion. The class combination with the maximum a posteriori probability is then determined as the change detection result. In addition, a class probability filter is proposed to avoid the false alarms caused by the spectral variation within the same class. Two experiments with multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images indicated that the proposed method achieves a clearly higher change detection accuracy than the current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method based on Bayesian theory and ISFA was also verified to have the ability to improve the change detection rate and reduce the false alarms at the same time. Given its effectiveness and flexibility, the proposed method could be widely applied in land-use/land-cover change detection and monitoring at a large scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Evaluating the effect of remote sensing image spatial resolution on soil exchangeable potassium prediction models in smallholder farm settings
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Major end users of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) such as policy makers and agricultural extension workers are faced with choosing the appropriate remote sensing data. The objective of this research is to analyze the spatial resolution effects of different remote sensing images on soil prediction models in two smallholder farms in Southern India called Kothapally (Telangana State), and Masuti (Karnataka State), and provide empirical guidelines to choose the appropriate remote sensing images in DSM. Bayesian kriging (BK) was utilized to characterize the spatial pattern of exchangeable potassium (K-ex) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) at different spatial resolutions by incorporating spectral indices from Landsat 8 (30 m), RapidEye (5 m), and WorldView-2/GeoEye-1/Pleiades-1A images (2 m). Some spectral indices such as band reflectances, band ratios, Crust Index and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index from multiple images showed relatively strong correlations with soil K-ex in two study areas. The research also suggested that fine spatial resolution WorldView-2/GeoEye-1/Pleiades-IA-based and RapidEye-based soil prediction models would not necessarily have higher prediction performance than coarse spatial resolution Landsat 8-based soil prediction models. The end users of DSM in smallholder farm settings need select the appropriate spectral indices and consider different factors such as the spatial resolution, band width, spectral resolution, temporal frequency, cost, and processing time of different remote sensing images. Overall, remote sensing-based Digital Soil Mapping has potential to be promoted to smallholder farm settings all over the world and help smallholder farmers implement sustainable and field-specific soil nutrient management scheme.

TI  - Continental-scale quantification of post-fire vegetation greenness recovery in temperate and boreal North America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge and information of post-fire vegetation recovery are essential for our understanding of ecosystem stability and resilience in response to present and future disturbances. Although previous studies have examined the post-fire vegetation recovery at landscape and regional levels, the lack of continent-wide analysis limits our understanding of fire effect on vegetation recovery across ecoregions and climate zones. With advanced technology in satellite observations as well as large-scale database development, it is possible for us to explore the large-scale effect of concurrent and lagged responses of terrestrial ecosystems to fire disturbances. In this study, we investigated the recovery of vegetation greenness in the early post-fire period in North America by integrating two national-level fire perimeter datasets and multiple Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. We developed a new algorithm to estimate fire effect on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by comparing fire pixels with their surrounding unburned pixels. Our results showed the fire effect on needleleaf trees was stronger than on other vegetation types, and the high-latitude ecoregions had larger NDVI reduction and longer recovery time than the mid-latitude ecoregions. We also found the variations in vegetation composition and fire severity can explain a large fraction of post-fire vegetation greenness recovery. Our satellite-based analysis showed a longer NDVI recovery time than the existing estimates, which indicates a stronger fire effect on ecosystems than previously thought. Findings in this study indicate that more sophisticated parameterization schemes of fire severity and post-fire vegetation recovery are needed for the vegetation-fire models to better simulate the terrestrial carbon cycling and climate-ecosystem feedbacks.

TI  - Snow thickness estimation on first-year sea ice using microwave and optical remote sensing with melt modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow cover on first-year sea ice plays a paramount role in thermodynamics by modulating sea ice ablation and accretion processes. However, meteoric accumulation and redistribution of snow on first-year sea ice is highly stochastic over space and time, which makes it a poorly understood parameter. In this study, a region of late winter snow thickness on first-year sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is estimated using time series spaceborne C-band microwave scatterometer and optical MODIS data and a simple snow melt model. Results show good correspondence between the modeled snow thickness and remotely sensed dates of melt onset and pond onset. The mean snowmelt duration for 20 study sites is 24.6 +/- 1.2 days, and the estimated mean snow thickness is 14.7 +/- 3.0 cm. The overall performance of the model reveals a RMSE of 4.0 cm and a mean bias of 0.3 cm. The methodology shows promise; particularly because it can easily be scaled up in order to estimate snow thickness on seasonal sea ice on a regional basis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The quality of invasive breast cancer care for low reimbursement rate patients: A retrospective study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Though evidence-based treatments have been recommended for breast cancer, underuse of the treatments was still observed. To certain extent, patients' access to care, which can be enhanced by increasing the coverage of health insurance, could account for the current underuse in recommended care. This study aimed to examine the association between different proportions of reimbursement and quality of recommended breast cancer care, as well as length of hospital stay. In this retrospective study, 3669 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 1 June, 2011 and 30 June, 2013 were recruited. Seven quality indicators from preoperative diagnosis procedures to adjuvant therapy and one composite indicator were selected as dependent variables. Logistic regression and generalized linear models were used to explore the association between quality of care and length of hospital stay with different reimbursement rates. Compared with UEBMI (urban employment basic medical insurance), which represented high level reimbursement rate, patients with lower rates of reimbursement were less likely to receive core biopsy, HER-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) testing, BCS (breast conserving surgery), SLNB (sentinel lymph nodes biopsy), adjuvant therapy and hormonal treatment. No significant difference in preoperative length of hospital stay was observed among the three insurance schemes, however URBMI (urban resident basic medical insurance) insured patients stayed longer for total length of hospital stay. Significant disparities in utilization of evidence-based breast cancer care among patients with different proportions of reimbursement were observed. Patients with lower rate of reimbursement were less likely to receive recommended care. Our findings could provide important support for further healthcare reform and quality improvement in breast cancer care.

TI  - Finite element modelling of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake through the joint exploitation of DInSAR measurements and geologic-structural information
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the co-seismic effects of the Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake through a Finite Element modelling approach that jointly exploits space-borne DInSAR deformation measurements and geologic-structural information. Our model permits to retrieve the coseismic displacements with a very good accuracy and to confirm the finding of earlier studies suggesting that the slip reaches a maximum value of about 7 mat a depth of 7-15 km along the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) and occurs in an area about 30 km northern of Kathmandu. In particular, the main-shock ruptured the deep part of the seismogenic zone of MHT, with rather small displacement values retrieved along the splay faults (Main Frontal Thrust - MFT; Main Boundary Thrust - MBT) in the southern region. A relevant aspect of our results is the imaging of about 3 m of displacement in correspondence to the shallow portion of the Main Central Thrust (MCT) to the north and of the Munsiari/Mahabharat Thrust (MT) to the south; this finding may be associated to a possible mechanism for accommodating the MHT-sourced deformation on the adjacent thrusts, highlighting a passive role of the hinterland structures as receiver faults of the displacements transferred from earthquakes originating on the MHT. In addition, the proposed model allow us to map the stress field distribution (evaluated through von Mises failure criteria) associated to the main seismic event; this result is in good agreement with the hypocentral distribution and mechanism of the investigated aftershocks.

TI  - Assessment of teleseismically-determined source parameters for the April 25, 2015 M<sub>w</sub> 7.9 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake and the May 12, 2015 M<sub>w</sub> 7.2 aftershock
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On April 25, 2015 a major (M-w 7.9) thrust earthquake ruptured the deeper portion of the seismogenic plate boundary beneath Nepal along which India is underthrusting Eurasia. An Mw 72 aftershock on May 12, 2015 extended the eastern, down-dip edge df the rupture. These destructive events caused about 9000 fatalities and 23,000 injuries. The overall rupture zone is about 170 km long and 40-80 km wide. This region of the plate boundary previously experienced a large earthquake in 1833, and in 1934 a larger M-s 8.0 event located to the east ruptured all the way to the surface. The Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) on which slip occurred in 2015 has a very low dip angle of similar to 6 degrees, and the depth of the mainshock slip distribution is very shallow, extending from similar to 7 to similar to 18 km. The shallow dip and depth present challenges for resolving faulting characteristics using teleseismic data. We analyze global teleseismic signals for the mainshock and aftershock to estimate source parameters, evaluating the stability of various procedures used for remotely characterizing kinematics of such shallow faulting. Back-projection and finite-fault slip inversion are used to assess the spatio-temporal rupture history and evidence for frequency-dependent radiation along dip. Slip zone width constraints from near-field geodetic observations are imposed on the preferred models to overcome some limitations of purely teleseismic methods. Radiated energy, stress drop and moment rate functions are determined for both events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we use the R-j(i) criterion, which takes into account both data misfit and the contribution from data noise, to determine dip angle. Synthetic tests show dip angle estimates with the criterion are more accurate and robust than those with data misfit minimization. We applied this R-j(i) criterion to the determination of the dip angle of the 2015 M-w 7.9 Gorkha Nepal earthquake using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, The results show that the event ruptured to the north of Kathmandu with a maximum slip value of 5.8 m and a dip angle of 9.5 degrees. We also calculated the coulomb failure stress changes resolved onto the receiver faults that are generally consistent with the fault geometry of this event, suggesting the possible triggering relation to aftershocks with low dip angles and a zone of seismic potential located to the west of the rupture zone.

TI  - Paleoseismic evidence of the CE 1505 (?) and CE 1803 earthquakes from the foothill zone of the Kumaon Himalaya along the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT), India
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of understanding earthquake sources in India and Nepal was underscored by the disastrous 2015 earthquakes of 25 April Gorkha (Mw 7.8) and 12 May Kodari (Mw 7.3, aftershock) in Nepal. The Kumaon-Garhwal segment experienced strong earthquakes in CE 1505 and CE 1803, probably along the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT). Of these, the CE 1505 was the greatest earthquake reported from the region in historical chronicles. However, no surface ruptures related to either of 1505 or 1803 have been identified from the Kumaon-Garhwal segment, and an ambiguity remained about their ruptures dispite recent reports of CE 1505 surface rupture in Western Nepal.We used high-resolution satellite (CARTOSAT-1) data for mapping active fault traces and carried out paleoseismic studies to identify paleo-earthquakes along the HFT. A trench excavated across the Kaladungi Fault (KF), a branching fault of HFT, revealed evidence of at least three earthquakes. Event I (the oldest) occurred between BCE 467 and CE 570; Event II occurred between CE 1294-1587. We infer that the Event II was the most likely historically-reported, great Himalayan earthquake of CE 1505. Event HI occurred between CE 1750-1932, and may represent the large magnitude CE 1803 (7.5 > Mw < 8.0) earthquake. Our findings not only help in understanding the frontal fault dynamics, but also may aid seismic hazard evaluation in India and Nepal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Source modeling of the 2015 Mw 7.8 Nepal (Gorkha) earthquake sequence: Implications for geodynamics and earthquake hazards
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gorkha earthquake on April 25th, 2015 was a long anticipated, low-angle thrust-faulting event on the shallow decollement between the India and Eurasia plates. We present a detailed multiple-event hypocenter relocation analysis of the Mw 7.8 Gorkha Nepal earthquake sequence, constrained by local seismic stations, and a geodetic rupture model based on InSAR and GPS data. We integrate these observations to place the Gorkha earthquake sequence into a seismotectonic context and evaluate potential earthquake hazard. Major results from this study include (1) a comprehensive catalog of calibrated hypocenters for the Gorkha earthquake sequence; (2) the Gorkha earthquake ruptured a similar to 150 x 60 km patch of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), the decollement defining the plate boundary at depth, over an area surrounding but predominantly north of the capital city of Kathmandu (3) the distribution of aftershock seismicity surrounds the mainshock maximum slip patch; (4) aftershocks occur at or below the mainshock rupture plane with depths generally increasing to the north beneath the higher Himalaya, possibly outlining a 10-15 km thick subduction channel between the overriding Eurasian and subducting Indian plates; (5) the largest Mw 7.3 aftershock and the highest concentration of aftershocks occurred to the southeast the mainshock rupture, on a segment of the MHT decollement that was positively stressed towards failure; (6) the near surface portion of the MHT south of Kathmandu shows no aftershocks or slip during the mainshocic. Results from this study characterize the details of the Gorkha earthquake sequence and provide constraints on where earthquake hazard remains high, and thus where future, damaging earthquakes may occur in this densely populated region. Up-dip segments of the MHT should be considered to be high hazard for future damaging earthquakes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Object-based quality evaluation procedure for fused remote sensing imagery
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite sensors usually provide two types of data: panchromatic and multispectral images which are characterized by their high spatial resolution and high spectral resolution respectively. In this context, the fusion techniques or pansharpening consist of merging these different aspects to obtain a fused (or pan-sharpened) image with high spatial and spectral resolutions.In this paper, a new quality assessment scheme for pan-sharpened remote sensing imagery is proposed. The methodology described extracts the segments of the images to constitute the basic elements of the measuring quality methodology. This new strategy overcomes traditional pixel-based perspectives, approaching an evaluation by human observers. The results of its application to a set of fused images show that an object-based assessment is consistent in terms of quality determination of both the spectral and spatial properties of remote sensing images.

TI  - Fusion of Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A data for land cover mapping: a case study in the lower Magdalena region, Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover-land use (LCLU) classification tasks can take advantage of the fusion of radar and optical remote sensing data, leading generally to increase mapping accuracy. Here we propose a methodological approach to fuse information from the new European Space Agency Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for accurate land cover mapping of a portion of the Lower Magdalena region, Colombia. Data pre-processing was carried out using the European Space Agency's Sentinel Application Platform and the SEN2COR toolboxes. LCLU classification was performed following an object-based and spectral classification approach, exploiting also vegetation indices. A comparison of classification performance using three commonly used classification algorithms was performed. The radar and visible-near infrared integrated dataset classified with a Support Vector Machine algorithm produce the most accurate LCLU map, showing an overall classification accuracy of 88.75%, and a Kappa coefficient of 0.86. The proposed mapping approach has the main advantages of combining the all-weather capability of the radar sensor, spectrally rich information in the visible-near infrared spectrum, with the short revisit period of both satellites. The mapping results represent an important step toward future tasks of aboveground biomass and carbon estimation in the region.

TI  - Effect of Axillary Dissection vs No Axillary Dissection on 10-Year Overall Survival Among Women With Invasive Breast Cancer and Sentinel Node Metastasis The ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 (ACOSOG Z0011) trial were first reported in 2005 with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Longer follow-up was necessary because the majority of the patients had estrogen receptor-positive tumors that may recur later in the disease course (the ACOSOG is now part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology).OBJECTIVE To determine whether the 10-year overall survival of patients with sentinel lymph node metastases treated with breast-conserving therapy and sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alone without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is noninferior to that of women treated with axillary dissection.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The ACOSOG Z0011 phase 3 randomized clinical trial enrolled patients from May 1999 to December 2004 at 115 sites (both academic and community medical centers). The last date of follow-up was September 29, 2015, in the ACOSOG Z0011 (Alliance) trial. Eligible patients were women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases.INTERVENTIONS All patients had planned lumpectomy, planned tangential whole-breast irradiation, and adjuvant systemic therapy. Third-field radiation was prohibited.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was overall survival with a noninferiority hazard ratio (HR) margin of 1.3. The secondary outcome was disease-free survival.RESULTS Among 891 women who were randomized (median age, 55 years), 856 (96%) completed the trial (446 in the SLND alone group and 445 in the ALND group). At a median follow-up of 9.3 years (interquartile range, 6.93-10.34 years), the 10-year overall survival was 86.3% in the SLND alone group and 83.6% in the ALND group (HR, 0.85 [1-sided 95% CI, 0-1.16]; noninferiority P =.02). The 10-year disease-free survival was 80.2% in the SLND alone group and 78.2% in the ALND group (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62-1.17]; P =.32). Between year 5 and year 10, 1 regional recurrence was seen in the SLND alone group vs none in the ALND group. Ten-year regional recurrence did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women with T1 or T2 invasive primary breast cancer, no palpable axillary adenopathy, and 1 or 2 sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases, 10-year overall survival for patients treated with sentinel lymph node dissection alone was noninferior to overall survival for those treated with axillary lymph node dissection. These findings do not support routine use of axillary lymph node dissection in this patient population based on 10-year outcomes.

TI  - Atmospheric processes affecting the separation of volcanic ash and SO<sub>2</sub> in volcanic eruptions: inferences from the May 2011 Grimsvotn eruption
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The separation of volcanic ash and sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas is sometimes observed during volcanic eruptions. The exact conditions under which separation occurs are not fully understood but the phenomenon is of importance because of the effects volcanic emissions have on aviation, on the environment, and on the earth's radiation balance. The eruption of Grimsvotn, a subglacial volcano under the Vatnajokull glacier in Iceland during 21-28 May 2011 produced one of the most spectacular examples of ash and SO2 separation, which led to errors in the forecasting of ash in the atmosphere over northern Europe. Satellite data from several sources coupled with meteorological wind data and photographic evidence suggest that the eruption column was unable to sustain itself, resulting in a large deposition of ash, which left a low-level ash-rich atmospheric plume moving southwards and then eastwards towards the southern Scandinavian coast and a high-level predominantly SO2 plume travelling northwards and then spreading eastwards and westwards. Here we provide observational and modelling perspectives on the separation of ash and SO2 and present quantitative estimates of the masses of ash and SO2 that erupted, the directions of transport, and the likely impacts. We hypothesise that a partial column collapse or "sloughing" fed with ash from pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) occurred during the early stage of the eruption, leading to an ash-laden gravity intrusion that was swept southwards, separated from the main column. Our model suggests that water-mediated aggregation caused enhanced ash removal because of the plentiful supply of source water from melted glacial ice and from entrained atmospheric water. The analysis also suggests that ash and SO2 should be treated with separate source terms, leading to improvements in forecasting the movement of both types of emissions.

TI  - Conservation performance of different conservation governance regimes in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - State-controlled protected areas (PAs) have dominated conservation strategies globally, yet their performance relative to other governance regimes is rarely assessed comprehensively. Furthermore, performance indicators of forest PAs are typically restricted to deforestation, although the extent of forest degradation is greater. We address these shortfalls through an empirical impact evaluation of state PAs, Indigenous Territories (ITs), and civil society and private Conservation Concessions (CCs) on deforestation and degradation throughout the Peruvian Amazon. We integrated remote-sensing data with environmental and socio-economic datasets, and used propensity-score matching to assess: (i) how deforestation and degradation varied across governance regimes between 2006-2011; (ii) their proximate drivers; and (iii) whether state PAs, CCs and ITs avoided deforestation and degradation compared with logging and mining concessions, and the unprotected landscape. CCs, state PAs, and ITs all avoided deforestation and degradation compared to analogous areas in the unprotected landscape. CCs and ITs were on average more effective in this respect than state PAs, showing that local governance can be equally or more effective than centralized state regimes. However, there were no consistent differences between conservation governance regimes when matched to logging and mining concessions. Future impact assessments would therefore benefit from further disentangling governance regimes across unprotected land.

TI  - Recent changes in terrestrial water storage in the Upper Nile Basin: an evaluation of commonly used gridded GRACE products
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite data monitor large-scale changes in total terrestrial water storage (Delta TWS), providing an invaluable tool where in situ observations are limited. Substantial uncertainty remains, however, in the amplitude of GRACE gravity signals and the disaggregation of TWS into individual terrestrial water stores (e.g. groundwater storage). Here, we test the phase and amplitude of three GRACE Delta TWS signals from five commonly used gridded products (i.e. NASA's GRCTellus: CSR, JPL, GFZ; JPL-Mascons; GRGS GRACE) using in situ data and modelled soil moisture from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) in two sub-basins (LVB: Lake Victoria Basin; LKB: Lake Kyoga Basin) of the Upper Nile Basin. The analysis extends from January 2003 to December 2012, but focuses on a large and accurately observed reduction in Delta TWS of 83 km(3) from 2003 to 2006 in the Lake Victoria Basin. We reveal substantial variability in current GRACE products to quantify the reduction of Delta TWS in Lake Victoria that ranges from 80 km(3) (JPL-Mascons) to 69 and 31 km(3) for GRGS and GRCTellus respectively. Representation of the phase in TWS in the Upper Nile Basin by GRACE products varies but is generally robust with GRGS, JPL-Mascons, and GRCTellus (ensemble mean of CSR, JPL, and GFZ time-series data), explaining 90, 84, and 75% of the variance respectively in "in situ" or "bottom-up" Delta TWS in the LVB. Resolution of changes in groundwater storage (Delta GWS) from GRACE Delta TWS is greatly constrained by both uncertainty in changes in soil-moisture storage (Delta SMS) modelled by GLDAS LSMs (CLM, NOAH, VIC) and the low annual amplitudes in Delta GWS (e.g. 1.8-4.9 cm) observed in deeply weathered crystalline rocks underlying the Upper Nile Basin. Our study highlights the substantial uncertainty in the amplitude of Delta TWS that can result from different data-processing strategies in commonly used, gridded GRACE products; this uncertainty is disregarded in analyses of Delta TWS and individual stores applying a single GRACE product.

TI  - Overall Low Extended-Spectrum Cephalosporin Resistance but high Azithromycin Resistance in <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> in 24 European Countries, 2015
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Surveillance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae antimicrobial susceptibility in Europe is performed through the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP), which additionally provides data to inform the European gonorrhoea treatment guideline; currently recommending ceftriaxone 500 mg plus azithromycin 2 g as first-line therapy. We present antimicrobial susceptibility data from 24 European countries in 2015, linked to epidemiological data of patients, and compare the results to Euro-GASP data from previous years.Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by MIC gradient strips or agar dilution methodology was performed on 2134 N. gonorrhoeae isolates and interpreted using EUCAST breakpoints. Patient variables associated with resistance were established using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs).Results: In 2015, 1.7% of isolates were cefixime resistant compared to 2.0% in 2014. Ceftriaxone resistance was detected in only one (0.05%) isolate in 2015, compared with five (0.2%) in 2014. Azithromycin resistance was detected in 7.1% of isolates in 2015 (7.9% in 2014), and five (0.2%) isolates displayed high-level azithromycin resistance (MIC = 256 mg/L) compared with one (0.05%) in 2014. Ciprofloxacin resistance remained high (49.4%, vs. 50.7% in 2014). Cefixime resistance significantly increased among heterosexual males (4.1% vs. 1.7% in 2014), which was mainly attributable to data from two countries with high cefixime resistance (similar to 11%), however rates among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) and females continued to decline to 0.5% and 1%, respectively. Azithromycin resistance in MSM and heterosexual males was higher (both 8.1%) than in females (4.9% vs. 2.2% in 2014). The association between azithromycin resistance and previous gonorrhoea infection, observed in 2014, continued in 2015 (OR 2.1, CI 1.2-3.5, p < 0.01).Conclusions: The 2015 Euro-GASP sentinel system revealed high, but stable azithromycin resistance and low overall resistance to ceftriaxone and cefixime. The low cephalosporin resistance may be attributable to the effectiveness of the currently recommended first-line dual antimicrobial therapy; however the high azithromycin resistance threatens the effectiveness of this therapeutic regimen. Whether the global use of azithromycin in mono-or dual antimicrobial therapy of gonorrhoea is contributing to the global increases in azithromycin resistance remains to be elucidated. The increasing cefixime resistance in heterosexual males also needs close monitoring.

TI  - Distribution, morphology, and morphometry of circular mounds in the elongated basin of northern Terra Sirenum, Mars
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An elongated, flat-floored basin, located in the northern part of Terra Sirenum on Mars, holds numerous enigmatic mounds (100 m wide) on the surface of its floor. We investigated their geological context, spatial distribution, morphological characteristics, and morphometric parameters by analyzing a variety of current remote sensing data sets of Mars. Over 700 mounds are identified; mapping of the mounds shows the spatial density of about 21 per 100 km2 and appearances of several clusters, coalescence, and/or alignment. Most of the mounds have smoother surface textures in contrast to the rugged surrounding terrain. Some of the mounds display depressions on their summits, meter-sized boulders on their flanks, and distinct lobate features. We also perform high-resolution topographic analysis on 50 isolated mounds, which reveals that their heights range from 6 to 43 m with a mean of 18 m and average flank slopes of most mounds are below 10. These characteristics are consistent with the deposition and extension of mud slurries with mud breccia and gases extruded from subsurface, almost equivalent to terrestrial mud volcanism. If so, both abundance of groundwater and abrupt increase in pore fluid pressure are necessary for triggering mud eruption. Absolute crater retention ages suggest that the floor of the basin located among middle Noachian-aged highland terrains has been resurfaced during the Late Hesperian Epoch. Because of cross-cutting relationships with the basin and the mounds superposed on the basin floor, the faults and fissures (part of Memnonia Fossae) are thought to have formed during and/or after the period of mound formation. Compressional stress fields which likely formed Memnonia Fossae and Mangala Valles, expected from the dike emplacement model of Wilson and Head (JGR 107: 1-1-1-24, 2002), may have facilitated undercompaction or overpressurization of subsurface fluids, focused pore fluids beneath the basin, and opened conduits along faults for upwelling voluminous sediments and fluids.

TI  - Hepatitis B virus and HIV co-infection among pregnant women in Rwanda
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects people worldwide but the local burden especially in pregnant women and their new born babies is unknown. In Rwanda HIV-infected individuals who are also infected with HBV are supposed to be initiated on ART immediately. HBV is easily transmitted from mother to child during delivery. We sought to estimate the prevalence of chronic HBV infection among pregnant women attending ante-natal clinic (ANC) in Rwanda and to determine factors associated with HBV and HIV co-infection.Methods: This study used a cross-sectional survey, targeting pregnant women in sentinel sites. Pregnant women were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HIV infection. A series of tests were done to ensure high sensitivity. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of HBV-HIV co-infection among those collected during ANC sentinel surveillance, these included: age, marital status, education level, occupation, residence, pregnancy and syphilis infection.Results: The prevalence of HBsAg among 13,121 pregnant women was 3.7% (95% CI: 3.4-4.0%) and was similar among different socio-demographic characteristics that were assessed. The proportion of HIV-infection among HBsAg-positive pregnant women was 4.1% [95% CI: 2.5-6.3%]. The prevalence of HBV-HIV co-infection was higher among women aged 15-24 years compared to those women aged 25-49 years [aOR = 6.9 (95% CI: 1.8-27.0)]. Women residing in urban areas seemed having HBV-HIV co-infection compared with women residing in rural areas [aOR = 4.3 (95% CI: 1.2-16.4)]. Women with more than two pregnancies were potentially having the coinfection compared to those with two or less (aOR = 6.9 (95% CI: 1.7-27.8). Women with RPR-positive test were seemed associated with HBV-HIV co-infection (aOR = 24.9 (95% CI: 5.0-122.9).Conclusion: Chronic HBV infection is a public health problem among pregnant women in Rwanda. Understanding that HBV-HIV co-infection may be more prominent in younger women from urban residences will help inform and strengthen HBV prevention and treatment programmes among HIV-infected pregnant women, which is crucial to this population.

TI  - Historic global biomass burning emissions for CMIP6 (BB4CMIP) based on merging satellite observations with proxies and fire models (1750-2015)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires have influenced atmospheric composition and climate since the rise of vascular plants, and satellite data have shown the overall global extent of fires. Our knowledge of historic fire emissions has progressively improved over the past decades due mostly to the development of new proxies and the improvement of fire models. Currently, there is a suite of proxies including sedimentary charcoal records, measurements of fire-emitted trace gases and black carbon stored in ice and firn, and visibility observations. These proxies provide opportunities to extrapolate emission estimates back in time based on satellite data starting in 1997, but each proxy has strengths and weaknesses regarding, for example, the spatial and temporal extents over which they are representative. We developed a new historic biomass burning emissions dataset starting in 1750 that merges the satellite record with several existing proxies and uses the average of six models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) protocol to estimate emissions when the available proxies had limited coverage. According to our approach, global biomass burning emissions were relatively constant, with 10-year averages varying between 1.8 and 2.3 PgC yr(-1). Carbon emissions increased only slightly over the full time period and peaked during the 1990s after which they decreased gradually. There is substantial uncertainty in these estimates, and patterns varied depending on choices regarding data representation, especially on regional scales. The observed pattern in fire carbon emissions is for a large part driven by African fires, which accounted for 58% of global fire carbon emissions. African fire emissions declined since about 1950 due to conversion of savanna to cropland, and this decrease is partially compensated for by increasing emissions in deforestation zones of South America and Asia. These global fire emission estimates are mostly suited for global analyses and will be used in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations.

TI  - Fusion of satellite-based imager and sounder data to construct supplementary high spatial resolution narrowband IR radiances
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polar-orbiting weather satellite platforms generally include an imager and a sounder. With a data fusion method that uses these sensors, we demonstrate the ability to construct infrared (IR) absorption narrowband radiances at imager resolution. While a sensor such as MODIS has multiple IR absorption bands, the current visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) imager has only IR window bands. We show fusion results for IR radiances at 4.52 mu m (CO2), 6.72 mu m (H2O), and 13.94 mu m (CO2) by comparing MODIS observed and constructed radiances for these bands. Both regional and global results are analyzed, with radiance differences tending to be fairly low and unbiased. Similar bands are constructed from VIIRS and CrIS data, with regional and global results shown. With this approach, it will be possible to improve continuity in derived cloud products over the generations of polar-orbiting weather satellite sensors and continue applications that require IR absorption bands.

TI  - Large-scale vegetation responses to terrestrial moisture storage changes
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a useful tool for studying vegetation activity and ecosystem performance at a large spatial scale. In this study we use the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) total water storage (TWS) estimates to examine temporal variability of the NDVI across Australia. We aim to demonstrate a new method that reveals the moisture dependence of vegetation cover at different temporal resolutions. Time series of monthly GRACE TWS anomalies are decomposed into different temporal frequencies using a discrete wavelet transform and analysed against time series of the NDVI anomalies in a stepwise regression. The results show that combinations of different frequencies of decomposed GRACE TWS data explain NDVI temporal variations better than raw GRACE TWS alone. Generally, the NDVI appears to be more sensitive to interannual changes in water storage than shorter changes, though grassland-dominated areas are sensitive to higher-frequencies of water-storage changes. Different types of vegetation, defined by areas of land use type, show distinct differences in how they respond to the changes in water storage, which is generally consistent with our physical understanding. This unique method provides useful insight into how the NDVI is affected by changes in water storage at different temporal scales across land use types.

TI  - Exceptional retreat of Novaya Zemlya's marine-terminating outlet glaciers between 2000 and 2013
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Novaya Zemlya (NVZ) has experienced rapid ice loss and accelerated marine-terminating glacier retreat during the past 2 decades. However, it is unknown whether this retreat is exceptional longer term and/or whether it has persisted since 2010. Investigating this is vital, as dynamic thinning may contribute substantially to ice loss from NVZ, but is not currently included in sea level rise predictions. Here, we use remotely sensed data to assess controls on NVZ glacier retreat between 1973/76 and 2015. Glaciers that terminate into lakes or the ocean receded 3.5 times faster than those that terminate on land. Between 2000 and 2013, retreat rates were significantly higher on marine-terminating outlet glaciers than during the previous 27 years, and we observe widespread slowdown in retreat, and even advance, between 2013 and 2015. There were some common patterns in the timing of glacier retreat, but the magnitude varied between individual glaciers. Rapid retreat between 2000 and 2013 corresponds to a period of significantly warmer air temperatures and reduced sea ice concentrations, and to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). We need to assess the impact of this accelerated retreat on dynamic ice losses from NVZ to accurately quantify its future sea level rise contribution.

TI  - A global view of shifting cultivation: Recent, current, and future extent
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosaic landscapes under shifting cultivation, with their dynamic mix of managed and natural land covers, often fall through the cracks in remote sensing-based land cover and land use classifications, as these are unable to adequately capture such landscapes' dynamic nature and complex spectral and spatial signatures. But information about such landscapes is urgently needed to improve the outcomes of global earth system modelling and large-scale carbon and greenhouse gas accounting. This study combines existing global Landsatbased deforestation data covering the years 2000 to 2014 with very high-resolution satellite imagery to visually detect the specific spatio-temporal pattern of shifting cultivation at a onedegree cell resolution worldwide. The accuracy levels of our classification were high with an overall accuracy above 87%. We estimate the current global extent of shifting cultivation and compare it to other current global mapping endeavors as well as results of literature searches. Based on an expert survey, we make a first attempt at estimating past trends as well as possible future trends in the global distribution of shifting cultivation until the end of the 21st century. With 62% of the investigated one-degree cells in the humid and sub-humid tropics currently showing signs of shifting cultivation-the majority in the Americas (41%) and Africa (37%)-this form of cultivation remains widespread, and it would be wrong to speak of its general global demise in the last decades. We estimate that shifting cultivation landscapes currently cover roughly 280 million hectares worldwide, including both cultivated fields and fallows. While only an approximation, this estimate is clearly smaller than the areas mentioned in the literature which range up to 1,000 million hectares. Based on our expert survey and historical trends we estimate a possible strong decrease in shifting cultivation over the next decades, raising issues of livelihood security and resilience among people currently depending on shifting cultivation.

TI  - Evaluating the role of land cover and climate uncertainties in computing gross primary production in Hawaiian Island ecosystems
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) is the Earth's largest carbon flux into the terrestrial biosphere and plays a critical role in regulating atmospheric chemistry and global climate. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-MOD17 data product is a widely used remote sensing-based model that provides global estimates of spatiotemporal trends in GPP. When the MOD17 algorithm is applied to regional scale heterogeneous landscapes, input data from coarse resolution land cover and climate products may increase uncertainty in GPP estimates, especially in high productivity tropical ecosystems. We examined the influence of using locally specific land cover and high-resolution local climate input data on MOD17 estimates of GPP for the State of Hawaii, a heterogeneous and discontinuous tropical landscape. Replacing the global land cover data input product (MOD12Q1) with Hawaiispecific land cover data reduced statewide GPP estimates by similar to 8%, primarily because the Hawaii-specific land cover map had less vegetated land area compared to the global land cover product. Replacing coarse resolution GMAO climate data with Hawaii-specific high-resolution climate data also reduced statewide GPP estimates by similar to 8% because of the higher spatial variability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the Hawaii-specific climate data. The combined use of both Hawaii-specific land cover and high-resolution Hawaii climate data inputs reduced statewide GPP by similar to 16%, suggesting equal and independent influence on MOD17 GPP estimates. Our sensitivity analyses within a heterogeneous tropical landscape suggest that refined global land cover and climate data sets may contribute to an enhanced MOD17 product at a variety of spatial scales.

TI  - Precise intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsies guided by lymphatic drainage in breast cancer
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to present a novel surgical method for intraoperative precise sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and to determine its clinical efficacy and sensitivity in breast cancer patients. The sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were preoperatively evaluated by axillary ultrasound. The intraoperative detection of SLNs was guided by lymphatic drainage pathway. The lymphatic vessels and SLNs were visualized. During operation, we searched for all the true SLNs (trSLNs), para-SLNs (paSLNs) and post-SLNs (poSLNs) followed lymphatic drainage ducts. After precisely locating the lymphatic channels and lymph node, all the lymph nodes that firstly receive lymphatic drainage are designated as trSLNs. We precisely distinguished the trSLNs, paSLNs and poSLNs. We found the average number of trSLNs ranged from1 to 6. In addition, we assessed the novel technique in a total of 125 breast cancer patients. trSLNs were successfully identified in all patients (detection rate: 100 %). The accuracy of trSLNs is 99.2%. Data from our study strongly suggest that our method is a feasible and effective for the detection of precise trSLNs in breast cancer with real-time observations.

TI  - Protocol for Usability Testing and Validation of the ISO Draft International Standard 19223 for Lung Ventilators.
T2  - JMIR research protocols
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians, such as respiratory therapists and physicians, are often required to set up pieces of medical equipment that use inconsistent terminology. Current lung ventilator terminology that is used by different manufacturers contributes to the risk of usage errors, and in turn the risk of ventilator-associated lung injuries and other conditions. Human factors and communication issues are often associated with ventilator-related sentinel events, and inconsistent ventilator terminology compounds these issues. This paper describes our proposed protocol, which will be implemented at the University of Waterloo, Canada when this project is externally funded.OBJECTIVE: We propose to determine whether a standardized vocabulary improves the ease of use, safety, and utility as it relates to the usability of medical devices, compared to legacy medical devices from multiple manufacturers, which use different terms.METHODS: We hypothesize that usage errors by clinicians will be lower when standardization is consistently applied by all manufacturers. The proposed study will experimentally examine the impact of standardized nomenclature on performance declines in the use of an unfamiliar ventilator product in clinically relevant scenarios. Participants will be respiratory therapy practitioners and trainees, and we propose studying approximately 60 participants.RESULTS: The work reported here is in the proposal phase. Once the protocol is implemented, we will report the results in a follow-up paper.CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study will help us better understand the effects of standardization on medical device usability. The study will also help identify any terms in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Draft International Standard (DIS) 19223 that may be associated with recurrent errors. Amendments to the standard will be proposed if recurrent errors are identified. This report contributes a protocol that can be used to assess the effect of standardization in any given domain that involves equipment, multiple manufacturers, inconsistent vocabulary, symbology, audio tones, or patterns in interface navigation. Second, the protocol can be used to experimentally evaluate the ISO DIS 19223 for its effectiveness, as researchers around the world may wish to conduct such tests and compare results.

TI  - Growing season carries stronger contributions to <i>albedo</i> dynamics on the Tibetan plateau
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau has experienced higher-than-global-average climate warming in recent decades, resulting in many significant changes in ecosystem structure and function. Among them is albedo, which bridges the causes and consequences of land surface processes and climate. The plateau is covered by snow/ice and vegetation in the non-growing season (nGS) and growing season (GS), respectively. Based on the MODIS products, we investigated snow/ice cover and vegetation greenness in relation to the spatiotemporal changes of albedo on the Tibetan Plateau from 2000 through 2013. A synchronous relationship was found between the change in GSNDVI and GSalbedo over time and across the Tibetan landscapes. We found that the annual average albedo had a decreasing trend, but that the albedo had slightly increased during the nGS and decreased during the GS. Across the landscapes, the nGSalbedo fluctuated in a synchronous pattern with snow/ice cover. Temporally, monthly snow/ice coverage also had a high correspondence with albedo, except in April and October. We detected clear dependencies of albedo on elevation. With the rise in altitude, the nGSalbedo decreased below 4000 m, but increased for elevations of 4500 - 5500 m. Above 5500 m, the nGSalbedo decreased, which was in accordance with the decreased amount of snow/ice coverage and the increased soil moisture on the plateau. More importantly, the decreasing albedo in the most recent decade appeared to be caused primarily by lowered growing season albedo.

TI  - A biophysical approach using water deficit factor for daily estimations of evapotranspiration and CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in Mediterranean environments
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimations of ecosystem-level evapotranspiration (ET) and CO2 uptake in water-limited environments are scarce and scaling up ground-level measurements is not straightforward. A biophysical approach using remote sensing (RS) and meteorological data (RS-Met) is adjusted to extreme high-energy water-limited Mediterranean ecosystems that suffer from continuous stress conditions to provide daily estimations of ET and CO2 uptake (measured as gross primary production, GPP) at a spatial resolution of 250 m. The RS-Met was adjusted using a seasonal water deficit factor (fWD) based on daily rainfall, temperature and radiation data. We validated our adjusted RS-Met with eddy covariance flux measurements using a newly developed mobile lab system and the single active FLUXNET station operating in this region (Yatir pine forest station) at a total of seven forest and non-forest sites across a climatic transect in Israel (280-770mmyr (-1)) RS-Met was also compared to the satelliteborne MODIS-based ET and GPP products (MOD16 and MOD17, respectively) at these sites.Results show that the inclusion of the fWD significantly improved the model, with R = 0.64-0.91 for the ET-adjusted model (compared to 0.05-0.80 for the unadjusted model) and R = 0.72-0.92 for the adjusted GPP model (compared to R = 0.56-0.90 of the non-adjusted model). The RS-Met (with the fWD) successfully tracked observed changes in ET and GPP between dry and wet seasons across the sites. ET and GPP estimates from the adjusted RS-Met also agreed well with eddy covariance estimates on an annual timescale at the FLUXNET station of Yatir (266 +/- 61 vs. 257 +/- 58mmyr 1 and 765 +/- 112 vs. 748 +/- 124 gCm(-2)yr(-1) for ET and GPP, respectively). Comparison with MODIS products showed consistently lower estimates from the MODIS-based models, particularly at the forest sites. Using the adjusted RS-Met, we show that afforestation significantly increased the water use efficiency (the ratio of carbon uptake to ET) in this region, with the positive effect decreasing when moving from dry to more humid environments, strengthening the importance of drylands afforestation. This simple yet robust biophysical approach shows promise for reliable ecosystem-level estimations of ET and CO2 uptake in extreme high-energy water limited environments.

TI  - Locating distributed faulting: Contributions from InSAR imaging to Probabilistic Fault Displacement Hazard Analysis (PFDHA)
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction of location and amount of slip for distributed faulting associated to strong earthquakes is a recently explored issue with major implications in terms of hazard assessment. Currently, the best practice involves the applications of Probabilistic Fault Displacement Hazard Analysis (PFDHA) whose results fit sufficiently well real data in the near-range of the primary fault but show considerable inaccuracies in the far-range. We believe that this inaccuracy descends from the biased earthquake databases used for regression analysis, whose data, relative to old earthquakes, were largely collected only by field surveys focused close to the primary fault (i.e., near-range).Remotely-sensed data (i.e., Interferometric Radar Imaging - InSAR) offer the opportunity to precisely measure the surface deformation induced by strong earthquakes and thus to explore its possible relation with distributed faulting. We analyze the L'Aquila earthquake case study (29th April, 2009, Mw 6.3) and explore the correlation between location and slip on distributed faulting and InSAR-derived deformation field. We find a significant correlation between occurrence of distributed faulting and profile curvature of the dislocation field, in spite of the distance from the primary fault. Moreover, distributed faults tend to occur within the area deformed by the earthquake, as imaged by InSAR data and whose extent is directly proportional to the earthquake magnitude (Mw), according to a dataset of 30 recent earthquakes.We then propose that these observations have to be incorporated into the present PFDHA practice as limit boundaries to possible scenarios of probabilistic analysis and that an integrated use of field-based and remotely data collection have to be implemented, following strong earthquakes.

TI  - The Oceanic Biological Pump: Rapid carbon transfer to depth at Continental Margins during Winter
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The oceanic biological pump is responsible for the important transfer of CO2-C as POC "Particulate Organic Carbon" to the deep sea. It plays a decisive role in the Earth's carbon cycle and significant effort is spent to quantify its strength. In this study we used synchronized daily time-series data of surface chlorophyll-a concentrations from the NASA's MODIS satellite in combination with hourly to daily observations from sea surface buoys and from an Internet Operated Vehicle (IOV) on the seafloor within Barkley Canyon (Northeast Pacific) to investigate the importance of winter processes in the export of fresh phytodetritus. The results indicate that phytoplankton pulses during winter can be as important in POC transfer to depth as the pulses associated with spring and summer blooms. Short winter phytoplankton pulses were observed to disappear from surface waters after low-pressure systems affected the area. Pulses of chlorophyll reached the IOV, at 870 m depth on the canyon seafloor, 12-72 hours later. These observed short pulses of biological carbon production regularly observed in the region from December to March have not been considered a significant component of the biological pump when compared with the denser summer productivity blooms.

TI  - Multi-decadal analysis of root-zone soil moisture applying the exponential filter across CONUS
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applied the exponential filter to produce an estimate of root-zone soil moisture (RZSM). Four types of microwave-based, surface satellite soil moisture were used. The core remotely sensed data for this study came from NASA's long-lasting AMSR-E mission. Additionally, three other products were obtained from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (CCI). These datasets were blended based on all available satellite observations (CCI-active, CCI-passive, and CCI-combined). All of these products were 0.25 degrees and taken daily. We applied the filter to produce a soil moisture index (SWI) that others have successfully used to estimate RZSM. The only unknown in this approach was the characteristic time of soil moisture variation (T). We examined five different eras (1997-2002; 2002-2005; 2005-2008; 2008-2011; 2011-2014) that represented periods with different satellite data sensors. SWI values were compared with in situ soil moisture data from the International Soil Moisture Network at a depth ranging from 20 to 25 cm. Selected networks included the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program (25 cm), Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN; 20.32 cm), SNOwpack TELemetry (SNOTEL; 20.32 cm), and the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN; 20 cm). We selected in situ stations that had reasonable completeness. These datasets were used to filter out periods with freezing temperatures and rainfall using data from the Parameter elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). Additionally, we only examined sites where surface and root-zone soil moisture had a reasonably high lagged r value (r > 0.5).The unknown T value was constrained based on two approaches: optimization of root mean square error (RMSE) and calculation based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value. Both approaches yielded comparable results; although, as to be expected, the optimization approach generally outperformed NDVI-based estimates. The best results were noted at stations that had an absolute bias within 10 %. SWI estimates were more impacted by the in situ network than the surface satellite product used to drive the exponential filter. The average Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSs) for ARM ranged from -0.1 to 0.3 and were similar to the results obtained from the USCRN network (0.20.3). NS values from the SCAN and SNOTEL networks were slightly higher (0.1-0.5). These results indicated that this approach had some skill in providing an estimate of RZSM. In terms of RMSE (in volumetric soil moisture), ARM values actually outperformed those from other networks (0.02-0.04). SCAN and USCRN RMSE average values ranged from 0.04 to 0.06 and SNOTEL average RMSE values were higher (0.05-0.07). These values were close to 0.04, which is the baseline value for accuracy designated for many satellite soil moisture missions.

TI  - Active tectonics and geomorphology of the Gaenserndorf Terrace in the Central Vienna Basin (Austria)
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the central Vienna Basin, the area north of the River Danube is dominated by large river terraces consisting mainly of coarse sandy gravels and sand deposited by the Danube and the Morava River. IRSL dating for the terrace body yielded minimum ages from about 200 to 300 ka. The terrace deposits are locally covered with loess and aeolian sand of the last glacial period revealing OSL/IRSL ages of about 15 ka.The terraces are dissected by a system of normal faults. One of these faults, the Aderklaa-Bockfliess Fault, was investigated in 2014 by paleoseismological trenching. Eventually, the exact fault location and its vertical offset of 10 m were defined by combining electrical resistivity measurements and the analysis of remote sensing data.In addition, at the northern part of this so-called Gaenserndorf terrace, high-resolution digital terrain models based on LIDAR measurements show landforms comparable with relief features resulting from permafrost degradation. Large elongated and clam-shaped depressions are interpreted as basins of former thermokarst lakes. Current dry valleys are interpreted as the Pleistocene drainages of the terrace surface. The cryogenic morphology is preserved only in the elevated parts of the terrace and therefore in the footwall of the bounding normal faults. In contrast, Quaternary basins of the hanging wall are filled with up to 40 m thick Pleistocene and Holocene growth strata. Therefore, most characteristics of the recent geomorphology can be interpreted as a result of overlapping neotectonic processes and permafrost degeneration during the Pleistocene.

TI  - Analysis of HIV prevalence among pregnant women in Liangshan Prefecture, China, from 2009 to 2015
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundYi people make up about 50% of the population in Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China, but accounted for 88.07% of new HIV cases in the prefecture from 2011 to 2013. This study evaluated HIV prevalence in pregnant women of Liangshan Prefecture using HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) data over the period of 2009 to 2015.MethodsXichang, Zhaojue County, and Butuo County were selected as HSS sites. We investigated the temporal trends in HIV prevalence in these areas, and the association between demographic and behavioral characteristics and risk of HIV infection.ResultsData on a total of 2797 pregnant women in Xichang and 3983 pregnant women in Zhaojue and Butuo was collected for the period 2009 to 2015. There was a fluctuating HIV prevalence among pregnant women of Xichang, with a rate of 0.75% in 2015 (chi(2) (trend) = 2.27, P = 0.13). HIV prevalence among pregnant women of Zhaojue and Butuo was consistently high, varying between 3.4% (9/267, 2011) and 10.3% (82/796, 2012) over the period of 2010 to 2015 (chi(2) (trend) = 0.12, P = 0.73). In Xichang, we found that Yi ethnicity (OR = 11.37, 95% CI = 2.92-44.25) and a husband who used drugs (OR = 32.13, 95% CI = 5.33-193.67) were significantly associated with HIV risk in pregnant women. For Zhaojue and Butuo, we observed that pregnant women had a higher risk of HIV infection when they were over 30 years old (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.17-2.52), when they had a higher number of previous births, when their husbands had a history of migrating for work (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.16- 2.08),and when they had a history of other sexually transmitted infections (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.16-2.08). Compared to those with a primary school education or below, pregnant women with a secondary or high school education level had a lower risk of HIV infection (OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.09-0.89).ConclusionOur results indicate that there is a serious HIV epidemic among pregnant Yi women, especially for those with less education, more past births, or a husband with a history of out-migrating for work or STD infection.

TI  - Potential of pest regulation by insectivorous birds in Mediterranean woody crops.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Regulation of agricultural pests managing their natural enemies represents an alternative to chemical pesticides. We assessed the potential of insectivorous birds as pest regulators in woody crops located in central Spain. A total of 417 nest boxes installed in five field study sites (one vineyard, two fruit orchards, and two olive groves) were monitored for use and breeding of insectivorous birds and other species for four consecutive years (2013 [plus or minus] 2016). At all field sites except the two olive groves, where birds never occupied the nest boxes, predation experiments were conducted with Greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) sentinel caterpillars, and food consumption by birds was estimated. Nesting of insectivorous birds, chiefly Great tit (Parus major), and sparrows (Passer domesticus and P. montanus) increased over time, averaging 60% per field site in the vineyard and fruit orchards by the fourth year. Use of nest boxes by sparrows and by Garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) was high at the fruit orchards (70%) and the vineyard (30%), respectively. Micro-habitat characteristics (nest box level) and meso-habitat characteristics (patch level) strongly affected use of nest boxes and bird breeding (i.e. number of laid eggs and produced chicks) in different years. Distance to natural or semi-natural vegetation did not consistently affect bird breeding, nor did we see consistent evidence of competition between adjacent breeding birds. Predation rates of sentinel caterpillars were approximately one-third higher near boxes with nesting birds (31.51 [plus or minus] 43.13%) than at paired distant areas without nest boxes (22.45% [plus or minus] 38.58%). Food consumption by insectivorous birds per ha and breeding season were conservatively estimated to range from 0.02 kg in one fruit orchard to 0.15 kg in the vineyard. We conclude that installation of nest boxes in Mediterranean woody crops enhances populations of insectivorous birds that regulate pests, but that the effects are moderate and highly context-dependent.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the prevalence and drug resistance of mycoplasma pneumoniae in patients with community-acquired pneumonia during 2011-2015 in Beijing. Methods: Totally 2 272 mycoplasma pneumoniae samples were collected from patients with community-acquired pneumonia in 5 sentinel hospitals during 2011-2015. Mycoplasma pneumoniae were detected by real-time PCR. 142 copies of positive samples with Ct value under 30 were cultured to get the strains so that the genotypes based on the P1 gene sequence and the drug resistance based on the in vitro drug resistance test could be conducted. chi(2) test was used to compare the detection rates of mycoplasma pneumoniae among different age groups and different onset-phase. Results: The positive rate of mycoplasma pneumoniae was 13.6%(308 cases). The positive rate in groups aging (5-14), (15-24) and ≥60 years old were separately 24.4% (67/275), 24.4% (38/156) and 3.9% (28/727) (chi(2)=1.22, P<0.001). The annual detection rate of mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2011-2015 were 14.6% (73/501), 10.2% (36/353), 26.4% (101/383), 10.3% (41/398), 9.0% (57/637),respectively (chi(2)=72.65, P<0.001). Seasonally, the peak of positive rate was between October and December (17.5%, 122/699) and the lowest positive rate was between April and June (8.6%, 43/502). 36 strains were isolated from 142 swabs and 23 (63.9%) were P1-Ⅰ and 13 (36.1%) were P1-Ⅱ by genotyping. All isolates were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and gatifloxacin) and tetracycline. All P1-Ⅱ strains were susceptible to macrolides while most of the P1-Ⅰ strains (22 strains) were macrolide-resistant. Conclusion: People aging (5-14) and (15-24) years old were more susceptible to mycoplasma pneumoniae in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Beijing between 2011 and 2015. The highest positive rate of mycoplasma pneumoniae was in 2013 and the case distributed in all seasons. The major popular genotype was P1-Ⅰ, whose strains were mostly macrolide-resistant.

TI  - Evaluating operational AVHRR sea surface temperature data at the coastline using surfers
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential climate variable that can be measured routinely from Earth Observation (EO) with high temporal and spatial coverage. To evaluate its suitability for an application, it is critical to know the accuracy and precision (performance) of the EO SST data. This requires comparisons with co-located and concomitant in situ data. Owing to a relatively large network of in situ platforms there is a good understanding of the performance of EO SST data in the open ocean. However, at the coastline this performance is not well known, impeded by a lack of in situ data. Here, we used in situ SST measurements collected by a group of surfers over a three year period in the coastal waters of the UK and Ireland, to improve our understanding of the performance of EO SST data at the coastline. At two beaches near the city of Plymouth, UK, the in situ SST measurements collected by the surfers were compared with in situ SST collected from two autonomous buoys located similar to 7 km and similar to 33 km from the coastline, and showed good agreement, with discrepancies consistent with the spatial separation of the sites. The in situ SST measurements collected by the surfers around the coastline, and those collected offshore by the two autonomous buoys, were used to evaluate the performance of operational Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) EO SST data. Results indicate: (i) a significant reduction in the performance of AVHRR at retrieving SST at the coastline, with root mean square errors in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 degrees C depending on the temporal difference between match-ups, significantly higher than those at the two offshore stations (0.4 to 0.6 degrees C); (ii) a systematic negative bias in the AVHRR retrievals of approximately 1 degrees C at the coastline, not observed at the two offshore stations; and (iii) an increase in the root mean square error at the coastline when the temporal difference between match-ups exceeded three hours. Harnessing new solutions to improve in situ sampling coverage at the coastline, such as tagging surfers with sensors, can improve our understanding of the performance of EO SST data in coastal regions, helping inform users interested in EO SST products for coastal applications. Yet, validating EO SST products using in situ SST data at the coastline is challenged by difficulties reconciling the two measurements, which are provided at different spatial scales in a dynamic and complex environment.

TI  - Water exchange between Algeciras Bay and the Strait of Gibraltar: A study based on HF coastal radar
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses the water mass exchanges at subinertial scale between Algeciras Bay and the adjacent Strait of Gibraltar. The mechanisms triggering this exchange process is investigated with the aid of recently-acquired data on surface currents obtained using a system of HF coastal radars deployed on the eastern side of the Strait, and remotely-sensed images of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll from the MODIS sensor of the Aqua satellite. HF radar data on surface currents are analyzed by the application of real empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition, which produces three EOF modes explaining more than 70% of the variance of the surface currents at the mouth of the Bay (modes 2, 3, and 6). Mode 2 is related to the fluctuations of the Atlantic Jet in the central zone of the Strait, mainly due to a combined effect of the atmospheric pressure fluctuations in the Western Mediterranean Sea and local wind in the eastern side of the Strait; mode 3 is related to the coastal currents induced by zonal wind forcing on the north-western coast of the Strait and Alboran Sea; and mode 6 seems to be related to water transport induced by winds blowing with a significant north component into and out of the Bay.

TI  - RADARSAT-2-based digital elevation models derived from InSAR for high latitudes of northern Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of digital elevation models (DEMs) plays an important role in many terrain-related applications, particular in high northern latitudes where there is uncertainty in DEMs. Using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar techniques, this study examined how different RADARSAT-2 beam modes can be used to generate DEMs with high accuracy. Using a conventional interferometry method, the Spotlight DEM shows the highest accuracy among all studied DEM products, with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) ranging from 13.9 to 17.4 m, followed by the F0W3 DEM and U26W2 DEM. The error sources in DEM generation due to uncertainty in perpendicular baseline and atmospheric delay are likely more important than the random phase noise caused by volume scattering and environmental changes during synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions. The small baselines subset (SBAS) method did not significantly improve DEM quality due to the limitation of the number of SAR images in this study. The integration of both Spotlight conventional DEMs and SBAS DEM considerably improved results yielding high-quality DEMs for the study area, with an RMSE of 9.7 m. Further studies are necessary to quantitatively evaluate the effects of surface motion as well as the orbital and atmospheric errors on the DEM accuracy. The Slave River Delta in the Northwest Territories of Canada was used as a test case. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Evaluating multiple causes of persistent low microwave backscatter from Amazon forests after the 2005 drought
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia has experienced large-scale regional droughts that affect forest productivity and biomass stocks. Space-borne remote sensing provides basin-wide data on impacts of meteorological anomalies, an important complement to relatively limited ground observations across the Amazon's vast and remote humid tropical forests. Morning overpass QuikScat Ku-band microwave backscatter from the forest canopy was anomalously low during the 2005 drought, relative to the full instrument record of 1999-2009, and low morning backscatter persisted for 2006-2009, after which the instrument failed. The persistent low backscatter has been suggested to be indicative of increased forest vulnerability to future drought. To better ascribe the cause of the low post-drought backscatter, we analyzed multiyear, gridded remote sensing data sets of precipitation, land surface temperature, forest cover and forest cover loss, and microwave backscatter over the 2005 drought region in the southwestern Amazon Basin (4 degrees-12 degrees S,66 degrees-76 degrees W) and in adjacent 8 degrees x10 degrees regions to the north and east. We found moderate to weak correlations with the spatial distribution of persistent low backscatter for variables related to three groups of forest impacts: the 2005 drought itself, loss of forest cover, and warmer and drier dry seasons in the post-drought vs. the pre-drought years. However, these variables explained only about one quarter of the variability in depressed backscatter across the southwestern drought region. Our findings indicate that drought impact is a complex phenomenon and that better understanding can only come from more extensive ground data and/or analysis of frequent, spatially-comprehensive, high-resolution data or imagery before and after droughts.

TI  - Prognostic relevance of an epigenetic biomarker panel in sentinel lymph nodes from colon cancer patients
T2  - CLINICAL EPIGENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Patients with early colorectal cancer (stages I-II) generally have a good prognosis, but a subgroup of 15-20% experiences relapse and eventually die of disease. Occult metastases have been suggested as a marker for increased risk of recurrence in patients with node-negative disease. Using a previously identified, highly accurate epigenetic biomarker panel for early detection of colorectal tumors, we aimed at evaluating the prognostic value of occult metastases in sentinel lymph nodes of colon cancer patients.Results: The biomarker panel was analyzed by quantitative methylation-specific PCR in primary tumors and 783 sentinel lymph nodes from 201 patients. The panel status in sentinel lymph nodes showed a strong association with lymph node stage (P = 8.2E-17). Compared with routine lymph node diagnostics, the biomarker panel had a sensitivity of 79% (31/39). Interestingly, among 162 patients with negative lymph nodes from routine diagnostics, 13 (8%) were positive for the biomarker panel. Colon cancer patients with high sentinel lymph node methylation had an inferior prognosis (5-year overall survival P = 3.0E-4; time to recurrence P = 3.1E-4), although not significant. The same trend was observed in multivariate analyses (P = 1.4E-1 and P = 6.7E-2, respectively). Occult sentinel lymph node metastases were not detected in early stage (I-II) colon cancer patients who experienced relapse.Conclusions: Colon cancer patients with high sentinel lymph node methylation of the analyzed epigenetic biomarker panel had an inferior prognosis, although not significant in multivariate analyses. Occult metastases in TNM stage II patients that experienced relapse were not detected.

TI  - Application of carbon nanoparticles in laparoscopic sentinel lymph node detection in patients with early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate the value of carbon nanoparticles in identifying sentinel lymph nodes in earlystage cervical cancer.MethodsFrom January 2014 to January 2016, 40 patients with cervical cancer stage IA2-IIA, based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 criteria, were included in this study. The normal cervix around the tumor was injected with a total of 1 mL of carbon nanoparticles (CNP) at 3 and 9 o'clock. All patients then underwent laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection and radical hysterectomy. The black-dyed sentinel lymph nodes were removed for routine pathological examination and immunohistochemical staining.ResultsAmong the 40 patients, 38 patients had at least one sentinel lymph node (SLN). The detection rate was 95% (38/40). One hundred seventy-three SLNs were detected with an average of 3.9 SLNs per side. 25 positive lymph nodes, which included 21 positive SLNs, were detected in 8 (20%) patients. Sentinel lymph nodes were localized in the obturator (47.97%), internal lilac (13.87%), external lilac (26.59%), parametrial (1.16%), and common iliac (8.67%) regions. The sensitivity of the SLN detection was 100% (5/5), the accuracy was 97.37% (37/38), and the negative predictive value was 100.0% and the false negative rate was 0%.ConclusionsSentinel lymph nodes can be used to accurately predict the pathological state of pelvic lymph nodes in early cervical cancer. The detection rates and accuracy of sentinel lymph node were high. Carbon nanoparticles can be used to trace the sentinel lymph node in early cervical cancer.

TI  - Potential Risk Areas of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in South-Eastern Iran: A Vector of Dengue Fever, Zika, and Chikungunya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The possibility of the rapid and global spread of Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, and dengue fever by Aedes albopictus is well documented and may be facilitated by changes in climate. To avert and manage health risks, climatic and topographic information can be used to model and forecast which areas may be most prone to the establishment of Ae. albopictus. We aimed to weigh and prioritize the predictive value of various meteorological and climatic variables on distributions of Ae. albopictus in south-eastern Iran using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. Out of eight factors used to predict the presence of Ae. albopictus, the highest weighted were land use, followed by temperature, altitude, and precipitation. The inconsistency of this analysis was 0.03 with no missing judgments. The areas predicted to be most at risk of Ae. albopictus-borne diseases were mapped using Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing data. Five-year (2011-2015) meteorological data was collected from 11 meteorological stations and other data was acquired from Landsat and Terra satellite images. Southernmost regions were at greatest risk of Ae. albopictus colonization as well as more urban sites connected by provincial roads. This is the first study in Iran to determine the regional probability of Ae. albopictus establishment. Monitoring and collection of Ae. albopictus from the environment confirmed our projections, though on-going field work is necessary to track the spread of this vector of life-threatening disease.

TI  - mTORC2 Signaling Selectively Regulates the Generation and Function of Tissue-Resident Peritoneal Macrophages
T2  - CELL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tissue-resident macrophages play critical roles in sentinel and homeostatic functions as well as in promoting inflammation and immunity. It has become clear that the generation of these cells is highly dependent upon tissue-specific cues derived from the microenvironment that, in turn, regulate unique differentiation programs. Recently, a role for GATA6 has emerged in the differentiation programming of resident peritoneal macrophages. We identify a critical role for mTOR in integrating cues from the tissue microenvironment in regulating differentiation and metabolic reprogramming. Specifically, inhibition of mTORC2 leads to enhanced GATA6 expression in a FOXO1 dependent fashion. Functionally, inhibition of mTORC2 promotes peritoneal resident macrophage generation in the resolution phase during zymosan-induced peritonitis. Also, mTORC2-deficient peritoneal resident macrophages displayed increased functionality and metabolic reprogramming. Notably, mTORC2 activation distinguishes tissue-resident macrophage proliferation and differentiation from that of M2 macrophages. Overall, our data implicate a selective role for mTORC2 in the differentiation of tissue-resident macrophages.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of aeolian desertification dynamics-A case study in north Shanxi of China (1975 to 2015)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aeolian desertification is one of the serious environmental issues in North Shanxi Province. Accurately assessing aeolian desertification dynamics and its causes is essential to formulate an effective strategy for combating aeolian desertification. Here, we adopted remote sensing (RS) images from four periods (1975, 1990, 2000, and 2015) to classify the intensity of aeolian desertified land (ADL). Four intensity grades (i.e., light, moderate, severe, and extremely severe) were categorized based on a series of indices. Then, the RS images were further interpreted coupled with the local climate and socioeconomic data to evaluate ADL and its driving force. Results showed that there were 3941.16, 5389.92, 7526.38, and 3752.74 km(2) of ADL in the above 4 periods, accounting for 28.56%, 39.06%, 54.53%, and 27.19% of the total study area, respectively. ADL experienced three major development stages: slower expansion during 1975-1990 at a rate of 96.58 km(2)/year, rapid expansion during 1990-2000 of 213.65 km(2)/year, and a reversion during 2000-2015 with a net decrease of 251.58 km(2)/year. The ADL development in north Shanxi was a result of mutual interaction between natural factors and human activities. It is also noted that the human activities were identified as the dominant driving force.

TI  - Analysis of water level variation of lakes and reservoirs in Xinjiang, China using ICESat laser altimetry data (2003-2009)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilizes ICESat Release 33 GLA14 data to analyse water level variation of Xinjiang's lakes and reservoirs from 2003 to 2009. By using Landsat images, lakes and reservoirs with area larger than 1 km 2 are numerically delineated with a software tool. Based on ICESat observations, we analyse the characteristics of water level variation in different geographic environments, as well as investigate the reasons for the variation. Results indicate that climatic warming contributes to rising water levels in lakes in mountainous areas, especially for lakes that are recharged by snow and glacial melting. For lakes in oases, the water levels are affected jointly by human activity and climate change, while the water levels of reservoirs are mainly affected by human activity. Comparing the annual average rates of water levels, those of lakes are higher than those of reservoirs in oasis areas. The main reasons for the decreasing water levels in desert regions are the reduction of recharged runoff and high evaporation. By analysing the variation of water levels and water volume in different geologic environments, it is found that water level and volume increased in mountainous regions, and decreased in oasis regions and desert regions. Finding also demonstrate that decreasing volume is greater than increasing volume, which results in decreasing total volume of Xinjiang lakes and reservoirs.

TI  - Near-source high-rate GPS, strong motion and InSAR observations to image the 2015 Lefkada (Greece) Earthquake rupture history
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2015/11/17 Lefkada (Greece) earthquake ruptured a segment of the Cephalonia Transform Fault (CTF) where probably the penultimate major event was in 1948. Using near-source strong motion and high sampling rate GPS data and Sentinel-1A SAR images on two tracks, we performed the inversion for the geometry, slip distribution and rupture history of the causative fault with a three-step self-consistent procedure, in which every step provided input parameters for the next one. Our preferred model results in a similar to 70 degrees ESE-dipping and similar to 13 degrees N-striking fault plane, with a strike-slip mechanism (rake similar to 169 degrees) in agreement with the CTF tectonic regime. This model shows a bilateral propagation spanning similar to 9 s with the activation of three main slip patches, characterized by rise time and peak slip velocity in the ranges 2.5-3.5 s and 1.4-2.4 m/s, respectively, corresponding to 1.2-1.8 m of slip which is mainly concentrated in the shallower (< 10 km) southern half of the causative fault. The inferred slip distribution and the resulting seismic moment (M-0 = 1.05 x 10(19) N m) suggest a magnitude of M-w 6.6. Our best solution suggests that the occurrence of large (M-w > 6) earthquakes to the northern and to the southern boundaries of the 2015 causative fault cannot be excluded.

TI  - Combined retrieval of Arctic liquid water cloud and surface snow properties using airborne spectral solar remote sensing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The passive solar remote sensing of cloud properties over highly reflecting ground is challenging, mostly due to the low contrast between the cloud reflectivity and that of the underlying surfaces (sea ice and snow). Uncertainties in the retrieved cloud optical thickness tau and cloud droplet effective radius r(eff);(C) may arise from uncertainties in the assumed spectral surface albedo, which is mainly determined by the generally unknown effective snow grain size r(eff;S). Therefore, in a first step the effects of the assumed snow grain size are systematically quantified for the conventional bispectral retrieval technique of tau and r(eff;C) for liquid water clouds. In general, the impact of uncertainties of r(eff;S) is largest for small snow grain sizes. While the uncertainties of retrieved tau are independent of the cloud optical thickness and solar zenith angle, the bias of retrieved r(eff;C) increases for optically thin clouds and high Sun. The largest deviations between the retrieved and true original values are found with 83% for tau and 62% for r(eff;C).In the second part of the paper a retrieval method is presented that simultaneously derives all three parameters (tau, r(eff;C), r(eff;S)) and therefore accounts for changes in the snow grain size. Ratios of spectral cloud reflectivity measurements at the three wavelengths lambda(1) = 1040 nm (sensitive to r(eff;S)), lambda(2) = 1650 nm (sensitive to tau), and lambda(3) = 2100 nm (sensitive to r(eff;C)) are combined in a trispectral retrieval algorithm. In a feasibility study, spectral cloud reflectivity measurements collected by the Spectral Modular Airborne Radiation measurement sysTem (SMART) during the research campaign Vertical Distribution of Ice in Arctic Mixed-Phase Clouds (VERDI, April/May 2012) were used to test the retrieval procedure. Two cases of observations above the Canadian Beau-fort Sea, one with dense snow-covered sea ice and another with a distinct snow-covered sea ice edge are analysed. The retrieved values of tau, r(eff;C), and r (eff;S) show a continuous transition of cloud properties across snow-covered sea ice and open water and are consistent with estimates based on satellite data. It is shown that the uncertainties of the trispectral retrieval increase for high values of tau, and low r(eff;S) but nevertheless allow the effective snow grain size in cloud-covered areas to be estimated.

TI  - JRAero: the Japanese Reanalysis for Aerosol v1.0
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A global aerosol reanalysis product named the Japanese Reanalysis for Aerosol (JRAero) was constructed by the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) of the Japan Meteorological Agency. The reanalysis employs a global aerosol transport model developed by MRI and a twodimensional variational data assimilation method. It assimilates maps of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from MODIS onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites every 6 h and has a TL159 horizontal resolution (approximately 1.1 degrees x 1.1 degrees). This paper describes the aerosol transport model, the data assimilation system, the observation data, and the setup of the reanalysis and examines its quality with AOD observations.Comparisons with MODIS AODs that were used for the assimilation showed that the reanalysis showed much better agreement than the free run (without assimilation) of the aerosol model and improved under-and overestimation in the free run, thus confirming the accuracy of the data assimilation system. The reanalysis had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.05, a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.96, a mean fractional error (MFE) of 23.7 %, a mean fractional bias (MFB) of 2.8 %, and an index of agreement (IOA) of 0.98. The better agreement of the first guess, compared to the free run, indicates that aerosol fields obtained by the reanalysis can improve short-term forecasts.AOD fields from the reanalysis also agreed well with monthly averaged global AODs obtained by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) (RMSE = 0.08, R = 0 : 90, MFE = 28.1 %, MFB = 0.6 %, and IOA = 0.93). Site-by-site comparison showed that the reanalysis was considerably better than the free run; RMSE was less than 0.10 at 86.4% of the 181 AERONET sites, R was greater than 0.90 at 40.7% of the sites, and IOA was greater than 0.90 at 43.4% of the sites. However, the reanalysis tended to have a negative bias at urban sites (in particular, megacities in industrializ-ing countries) and a positive bias at mountain sites, possibly because of insufficient anthropogenic emissions data, the coarse model resolution, and the difference in representativeness between satellite and ground-based observations.

TI  - Maximum entropy modeling risk of anthrax in the Republic of Kazakhstan
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to zone the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan (RK) into risk categories according to the probability of anthrax emergence in farm animals as stipulated by the re-activation of preserved natural foci.We used historical data on anthrax morbidity in farm animals during the period 1933 2014, collected by the veterinary service of the RK. The database covers the entire territory of the RK and contains 4058 anthrax outbreaks tied to 1798 unique locations.Considering the strongly pronounced natural focality of anthrax, we employed environmental niche modeling (Maxent) to reveal patterns in the outbreaks' linkages to specific combinations of environmental factors. The set of bioclimatic factors BIOCLIM, derived from remote sensing data, the altitude above sea level, the land cover type, the maximum green vegetation fraction (MGVF) and the soil type were examined as explanatory variables.The model demonstrated good predictive ability, while the MGVF, the bioclimatic variables reflecting precipitation level and humidity, and the soil type were found to contribute most significantly to the model.A continuous probability surface was obtained that reflects the suitability of the study area for the emergence of anthrax outbreaks. The surface was turned into a categorical risk map by averaging the probabilities within the administrative divisions at the 2nd level and putting them into four categories of risk, namely: low, medium, high and very high risk zones, where very high risk refers to more than 50% suitability to the disease re-emergence and low risk refers to less than 10% suitability. The map indicated increased risk of anthrax re-emergence in the districts along the northern, eastern and south-eastern borders of the country.It was recommended that the national veterinary service uses the risk map for the development of contra-epizootic measures aimed at the prevention of anthrax re-emergence in historically affected regions of the RK. The map can also be considered when developing large-scale construction projects in the areas comprising preserved soil foci of anthrax. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The use of cartographic modeling to assess the impacts of coastal flooding: a case study of Port Said Governorate, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-set coastal areas are expected to aggravate inundation on account of sea level rise (SLR). The present study is planned to appraise the impacts of coastal flooding in Port Said city, Egypt by using remote sensing, GIS, and cartographic modeling techniques. To accomplish this scope, Landsat 8-OLI image dated 2016 and SRTM 1Arc-Second Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used. Landsat image was classified into seven land use and land cover (LULC) classes by using remote sensing and GIS's software. Different inundation scenarios 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0-m coastal elevation were used to figure the influence of SLR on the study area. Estimation of potential losses under SLR was made by overlaying the expected scenarios on land use. The inundation areas under the expected SLR scenarios of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 m were estimated at 827.49, 1072.67, and 1179.41 km(2), respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that expected coastal flooding scenarios will lead up to serious impacts on LULC classes and coastal features in the study area.

TI  - Competitive Employment Outcomes Among Veterans in VHA Therapeutic and Supported Employment Services Programs
T2  - PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The study assessed whether receiving specific types of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Therapeutic and Supported Employment Services (TSES) between fiscal years (FYs) 2006 and 2010 (a time frame that encompasses the Great Recession) was associated with obtaining competitive employment among veterans with mental illnesses.Methods: The sample included 38,199 veterans discharged from the VHA's TSES program in FY 2006 through FY 2010. On the basis of program monitoring forms completed by TSES clinicians and workload data, veterans were classified as having received one main type of employment service: supported employment (SE), transitional work in the community (TW-community), transitional work in a Department of Veterans Affairs medical center (TW-VA), incentive therapy or sheltered workshop (IT/SW), and no main type of employment service.Results: Compared with veterans who received TW-VA, those who received SE (odds ratio [OR]=1.25) or TW-community OR=1.24) were more likely to be competitively employed (p<.001), and veterans who received IT/SW were less likely (OR=.85) (p<.001). The predicted probabilities for obtaining competitive employment ranged from 27.2% (IT/SW) to 34.9% (SE). Odds of achieving competitive employment (ORs=.60-.97) were significantly lower during the years of the Great Recession (2007-2009) and in the subsequent year (2010), compared with the year prior (p<.001 to <.05).Conclusions: Although rates of competitive employment were modest across all types of services, community-based employment services were associated with higher odds of achieving competitive employment, compared with services based in a medical center. The Great Recession negatively affected the likelihood of achieving competitive employment, regardless of the employment service received.

TI  - Indigenous arthropod natural enemies of the invasive brown marmorated stink bug in North America and Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the establishment of the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in North America and Europe, there has been a large, multi-group effort to characterize the composition and impact of the indigenous community of arthropod natural enemies attacking this invasive pest. In this review, we combine 98 indigenous natural enemy datasets spanning a variety of sampling methods, habitats, and geographic areas. To date, the vast majority of H. halys biological control research has focused on the egg stage, using sentinel egg masses to characterize indigenous parasitoid and predator communities and their contribution to H. halys egg mortality. Although egg parasitism and predation levels by indigenous natural enemies are low (typically <10% each) in most surveys, total egg mortality attributable to natural enemies can be higher (typically between 5 and 25%; up to 83%)-even though these values were likely underestimated in most cases because some mortality due to biological control was not recognized. In North America, where the most data are available, it appears that the relative prevalence of different indigenous parasitoid species varies among habitat types, particularly between crop and non-crop habitats. Predator species responsible for egg mortality are much less commonly identified, but appear to include a wide variety of generalist chewing and sucking predators. To date, studies of natural enemies attacking H. halys nymphs and adults are relatively rare. Based on our review, we identify a number of key research gaps and suggest several directions for future research.

TI  - Snowmelt runoff prediction under changing climate in the Himalayan cryosphere: A case of Gilgit River Basin
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are serious concerns of rise in temperatures over snowy and glacierized Himalayan region that may eventually affect future river flows of Indus river system. It is therefore necessary to predict snow and glacier melt runoff to manage future water resource of Upper Indus Basin (UIB). The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) coupled with MODIS remote sensing data was employed in this study to predict daily discharges of Gilgit River in the Karakoram Range. The SRM was calibrated successfully and then simulation was made over four years i.e. 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 achieving coefficient of model efficiency of 0.96, 0.86, 0.9 and 0.94 respectively. The scenarios of precipitation and mean temperature developed from regional climate model PRECIS were used in SRM model to predict future flows of Gilgit River. The increase of 3 degrees C in mean annual temperature by the end of 21th century may result in increase of 35-40% in Gilgit River flows. The expected increase in the surface runoff from the snow and glacier melt demands better water conservation and management for irrigation and hydel-power generation in the Indus basin in future.

TI  - Optimal Weight Design Approach for the Geometrically-Constrained Matching of Satellite Stereo Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an optimal weighting approach for combined image matching of high-resolution satellite stereo images (HRSI). When the rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) for a pair of stereo images are available, some geometric constraints can be combined in image matching equations. Combining least squares image matching (LSM) equations with geometric constraints equations necessitates determining the appropriate weights for different types of observations. The common terms between the two sets of equations are the image coordinates of the corresponding points in the search image. Considering the fact that the RPCs of a stereo pair are produced in compliance with the coplanarity condition, geometric constraints are expected to play an important role in the image matching process. In this study, in order to control the impacts of the imposed constraint, optimal weights for observations were assigned through equalizing their average redundancy numbers. For a detailed assessment of the proposed approach, a pair of CARTOSAT-1 sub-images, along with their precise RPCs, were used. On top of obtaining different matching results, the dimension of the error ellipses of the intersection points in the object space were compared. It was shown through analysis that the geometric mean of the semi-minor and semi-major axis by our method was reduced 0.17 times relative to the unit weighting approach.

TI  - SLNB in cutaneous SCC: A review of the current state of literature and the direction for the future
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The concept of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been universally accepted for melanoma, however, remains controversial for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We performed a quantitative review on 260 cases of SCC that had a SLNB. The positivity rate was found to be 14.6%. Literature was qualitatively reviewed to determine whether a positive SLNB has any bearing on prognosis in SCC cases, finding a significant relationship between poor prognosis and a positive SLN (P=0.0082).

TI  - A MODIS-based automated flood monitoring system for southeast asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood disasters in Southeast Asia result in significant loss of life and economic damage. Remote sensing information systems designed to spatially and temporally monitor floods can help governments and international agencies formulate effective disaster response strategies during a flood and ultimately alleviate impacts to population, infrastructure, and agriculture. Recent destructive flood events in the Lower Mekong River Basin occurred in 2000, 2011, 2013, and 2016 (http://ffw.mrcmekong.org/historical_rec.htm, April 24, 2017).The large spatial distribution of flooded areas and lack of proper gauge data in the region makes accurate monitoring and assessment of impacts of floods difficult. Here, we discuss the utility of applying satellite-based Earth observations for improving flood inundation monitoring over the flood-prone Lower Mekong River Basin. We present a methodology for determining near real-time surface water extent associated with current and historic flood events by training surface water classifiers from 8-day, 250-m Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data spanning the length of the MODIS satellite record. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) signature of permanent water bodies (MOD44W; Carroll et al., 2009) is used to train surface water classifiers which are applied to a time period of interest. From this, an operational nowcast flood detection component is produced using twice daily imagery acquired at 3-h latency which performs image compositing routines to minimize cloud cover. Case studies and accuracy assessments against radar-based observations for historic flood events are presented. The customizable system has been transferred to regional organizations and near real-time derived surface water products are made available through a web interface platform. Results highlight the potential of near real-time observation and impact assessment systems to serve as effective decision support tools for governments, international agencies, and disaster responders.

TI  - Is there a role for sentinel node biopsy in the pre-operative ultrasound positive axilla?
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Axillary management in breast cancer is becoming increasingly conservative. This approach is based on the identification of low axillary burden on sentinel node biopsy (SNB). The modern practice of routine pre-operative axillary ultrasound has meant that patients are 'fast tracked' to axillary node clearance (ANC) in the presence of a histologically confirmed positive axilla. This practice reduces the number of patients undergoing SNB compared to the original trials, which evaluated the role of SNB, and those assessing safety of omission of ANC in low axillary burden. The risk of depriving patients with low axillary burden the opportunity to avoid ANC as a consequence of pre-operative ultrasound is discussed.

M3  - Article
AB  - Culex coronator is a Neotropical mosquito species that was first described in Trinidad in the early 20th century. Since then, the species has been discovered from Patagonia to the southern USA. A single adult female Cx. coronator was collected on November 1, 2016, in Suffolk, VA, in a BG-Sentinel 2 (R) trap during routine mosquito surveillance. This represents the 1st record of this species in the state of Virginia and the northernmost record in the USA. Based on male specimens examined from Texas and Mississippi, Cx. coronator sensu stricto seems to be the only species from the complex expanding into the southeastern USA. A comprehensive review of the available literature from the southern and southeastern USA is provided describing trapping methods, ecological, and biological information.

TI  - Elective unilateral nodal irradiation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A paradigm shift
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a long-standing convention to irradiate the great majority of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) electively to both sides of the neck, to reduce the theoretically increased risk of contralateral regional failure (cRF). With the currently available diagnostic imaging techniques this treatment paradigm means, in our opinion, an overtreatment in considerable proportion of these patients. From all the published studies (n = 11, with 1116 patients treated in total), the incidence of cRF in patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated to one side of the neck is 2.4%. The incidence was higher in patients with tumours involving the midline (12.1%). The low incidence of cRF was also seen in patients with HNSCC treated by local excision combined with unilateral neck dissection or sentinel node procedure. It seems clear from the aggregated data of these studies that a less conservative approach with regard to the selection of patients for unilateral elective nodal irradiation is justified. The fear of leaving the contralateral neck untreated in well-selected groups of patients with HNSCC needs nowadays to be mitigated since the incidence of cRF in lateralised tumours extending to but not crossing the midline is low. Furthermore, the obviously improved diagnostic imaging nowadays could help us to guide the selection of considerable proportion of patients with lateralised HNSCC for unilateral elective nodal irradiation with significant reduction of radiation-related toxicity and improved quality of life.

TI  - Land Surface Phenology and Seasonality Using Cool Earthlight in Croplands of Eastern Africa and the Linkages to Crop Production
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Across Eastern Africa, croplands cover 45 million ha. The regional economy is heavily dependent on small holder traditional rain-fed peasant agriculture (up to 90%), which is vulnerable to extreme weather events such as drought and floods that leads to food insecurity. Agricultural production in the region is moisture limited. Weather station data are scarce and access is limited, while optical satellite data are obscured by heavy clouds limiting their value to study cropland dynamics. Here, we characterized cropland dynamics in Eastern Africa for 2003-2015 using precipitation data from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and a passive microwave dataset of land surface variables that blends data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) from 2002 to 2011 with data from AMSR2 from 2012 to 2015 with a Chinese microwave radiometer to fill the gap. These time series were analyzed in terms of either cumulative precipitable water vapor-days (CVDs) or cumulative actual evapotranspiration-days (CETaDs), rather than as days of the year. Time series of the land surface variables displayed unimodal seasonality at study sites in Ethiopia and South Sudan, in contrast to bimodality at sites in Tanzania. Interannual moisture variability was at its highest at the beginning of the growing season affecting planting times of crops, while it was lowest at the time of peak moisture. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from the simple surface energy balance (SSEB) model was sensitive to track both unimodal and bimodal rainfall patterns. ETa as a function of CETaD was better fitted by a quadratic model (r(2) > 0.8) than precipitable water vapor was by CVDs (r(2) > 0.6). Moisture time to peak (MTP) for the land surface variables showed strong, logical correspondence among variables (r(2) > 0.73). Land surface parameters responded to El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole forcings. Area under the curve of the diel difference in vegetation optical depth showed correspondence to crop production and yield data collected by local offices, but not to the data reported at the national scale. A long-term seasonal Mann-Kendall rainfall trend showed a significant decrease for Ethiopia, while the decrement was not significant for Tanzania. While there is significant potential for passive microwave data to augment cropland status and food security monitoring efforts in the region, more research is needed before these data can be used in an operational environment.

TI  - Outcomes and Cost Analysis of Surveillance Strategies After Initial Treatment for Women With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a survival or cost benefit dependent on detection strategy of recurrent ovarian cancer (ie, imaging, physical examination findings, report of symptoms, or rising cancer antigen 125 [CA-125] levels).Methods/Materials A retrospective chart review of 112 ovarian cancer patients was conducted, and method of detection of recurrent disease was determined from medical records. The following primary outcomes were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression model: progression-free survival (PFS) after diagnosis of recurrence and time to death after diagnosis of recurrence (overall survival [OS]). Several approaches to disease surveillance were proposed, and a cost model was applied.Results Median time to recurrence was 13.5 months. Overall, 6.3% presented with only physical examination findings; 24.1%, with elevating CA-125 levels; 34.8%, with imaging; and 32.1%, with symptoms. Most patients presenting with recurrent disease diagnosed by rising CA-125 were white (62.9%); those with imaging and symptomatic recurrences were blacks (56.4% and 57.1%, respectively). There was a small but not statistically significant OS benefit for recurrence detected via CA-125 (P = 0.85; OS per detection method: PE, 20.7 months; CA-125, 26.8 months; imaging, 17.8 months; and symptoms, 6.6 months). We modeled costs of surveillance in our patient cohort; up to 40.8% of cases of ovarian cancer recurrences would have been missed if no imaging were obtained during surveillance.Conclusions Results indicate minimal differences in PFS and statistically insignificant differences in OS, depending on detection method. Notably, black patients with Medicaid presented most often with symptomatic recurrences, which surprisingly did not affect patient OS and PFS; and interestingly, pr\ivate or self-pay insurance was associated with decreased OS among black patients. From our cost analysis, we estimate that the most cost-effective surveillance strategy for the first year costs $9.2 million annually and includes office visit biannually, biannual CA-125 levels, and annual asymptomatic imaging.

AB  - Climatic changes, especially rainfall, affect the distribution and densities of mosquitoes. This study was carried out to determine mosquito species composition and mosquito density, in addition to describing mosquito aquatic habitats in EnNuhud Town, capital of West Kordofan State, Sudan. A cross-sectional survey of Anopheline mosquito larval habitats was conducted in EnNahud Town (8 blocks/sentinel sites) during July 2014 to June 2015. Larvae were collected using the standard dipping technique; while adults were collected using pyrethrum-sprayed sheet method. The habitats observed were broken pipes, bricks traditional factories (Kaminas), pools and swamps formed after rainfall. A total of 2,482 Anopheline mosquito larvae were collected. Of these, 2,449 (98.7%) were morphologically identified as Anopheles gambiae s.l, 33 (1.3%) as A. rufipes. A. arabiensis was found in all blocks. While A. rufipes, was found in one block (Algady block). The high mosquito larval densities indicated that EnNahud Town inhabitants are at risk of mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria. Therefore, malaria control program targeting both the immatures and adults should be enhanced, especially during the rainy-season.

TI  - Radio-guided sentinel lymph node detection and lymph node mapping in invasive urinary bladder cancer: a prospective clinical study
T2  - BJU INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo investigate the possibility of detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) in patients with urinary bladder cancer (BCa) intra-operatively and whether the histopathological status of the identified SNs reflected that of the lymphatic field.Patients and MethodsWe studied 103 patients with BCa pathological stage T1-T4 who were treated with cystectomy and pelvic lymph node (LN) dissection during 2005-2011 at the Department of Urology, Linkoping University Hospital. Radioactive tracer Nanocoll 70 MBq and blue dye were injected into the bladder wall around the primary tumour before surgery. SNs were detected ex vivo during the operation with a handheld Geiger probe (Gamma Detection System; Neoprobe Corp., Dublin, OH, USA). All LNs were formalin-fixed, sectioned three times, mounted on slides and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. An experienced uropathologist evaluated the slides.ResultsThe mean age of the patients was 69 years, and 80 (77%) were male. Pathological staging was T1-12 (12%), T2-20 (19%), T3-48 (47%) and T4-23 (22%). A mean (range) number of 31 (7-68) nodes per patient were examined, totalling 3 253 nodes. LN metastases were found in 41 patients (40%). SNs were detected in 83 of the 103 patients (80%). Sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastatic disease by SN biopsy (SNB) varied between LN stations, with average values of 67% and 90%, respectively. LN metastatic density (LNMD) had a significant prognostic impact; a value of >= 8% was significantly related to shorter survival. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) occurred in 65% of patients (n = 67) and was significantly associated with shorter cancer-specific survival (P < 0.001).ConclusionWe conclude that SNB is not a reliable technique for peri-operative localization of LN metastases during cystectomy for BCa; however, LNMD has a significant prognostic value in BCa and may be useful in the clinical context and in BCa oncological and surgical research. LVI was also found to be a prognostic factor.

TI  - Surgical Management of Periocular Cancers: High- and Low-Risk Features Drive Treatment
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Recent advances in the treatment of eyelid tumors have centered on the excision, evaluation of margins, role of sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjunctive/adjuvant systemic and radiation therapy. The purpose of this review is to elaborate on these advances.Recent Findings Mohs excision of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma continues to provide the greatest success in complete excision of the cancer, especially in those cases of high-risk disease including medial canthal location and recurrent disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has proven useful in the assessment of early regional metastasis in sebaceous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. The pathologic finding of perineural invasion is a high-risk feature in all periocular cancers, and adjuvant therapy should be considered. Targeted therapy shows great potential in situations that are not amenable to complete excision without sacrificing the globe.Summary Identification of high-and low-risk features in eyelid cancers allows a stratified approach to treatment. While high-risk features may require adjuvant therapy, larger margins, and sentinel lymph node biopsy, low-risk features may allow topical therapy to adequately address the condition. Monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors show great promise in the treatment of extensive disease.

TI  - Cournot vs. Walras: A reappraisal through simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Best-reply behavior in Cournot oligopolies generally leads to Cournot-Nash equilibrium, but imitative behavior selects the Walrasian equilibrium as the unique stochastically stable state. Previous work (Alos-Ferrer, 2004) showed that in the presence of memory, imitative behavior leads to a non-trivial dynamics selecting all quantities between the Cournot and Walrasian outcomes. However, the scope of previous results was limited to specific assumptions on demand and cost functions, and did not provide information on the shape of the distribution of outcomes. We use computational simulations to address these limitations. We show that the selection result for non-trivial memory holds beyond the set of well-behaved Cournot games previously analyzed. Further, we find that, in Cournot games, the limit distribution of long-run outcomes is highly skewed towards the Walrasian quantity. Although longer memory increases the importance of the Cournot equilibrium, the competitive outcome remains the dominant prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A pattern-based classification system has recently been proposed for invasive endocervical adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is predictive of the risk for lymph node metastases (LNM). The main utility of the system lies in separating cases with very low risk for LNM (pattern A) from those with higher risk (pattern B and C). Different growth patterns (GPs) are found in pattern C cases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of GP on the behavior of pattern C EAC. By reevaluating 189 pattern C EACs, we documented 6 architectural GPs: diffuse destructive (DD), confluent (CON), extensive linear destructive (ELD), band-like lymphocytic infiltrate (BLL), solid (SOL), and micropapillary (MP). When an EAC had an appreciable second component (50%) the designation of a mixed EAC was used. We found 32 (17%) tumors to be DD, 23 (12%) CON, 27 (14%) ELD, 9 (5%) SOL, 7 (4%) BLL, and 7 (4%) micropapillary. A total of 84 (44%) EACs were mixed (DD+CON). All micropapillary EACs had LNM versus none of the patients with EAC with an ELD GP (P=0.002). Recurrent disease was seen in 44% of EACs with a DD GP, whereas 0% of EACs with BLL GP developed recurrent disease. Mixed (DD+CON) tumors had a significantly worse 6-year overall survival. This study demonstrated that not all pattern C EACs have an aggressive behavior. These patients should be treated with radical hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Mapping of the Invasive Species <i>Hakea sericea</i> Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and WorldView-2 Imagery and an Object-Oriented Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plants are non-native species that establish and spread in their new location, generating a negative impact on the local ecosystem and representing one of the most important causes of the extinction of local species. The first step for the control of invasion should be directed at understanding and quantification of their location, extent and evolution, namely the monitoring of the phenomenon. In this sense, the techniques and methods of remote sensing can be very useful. The aim of this paper was to identify and quantify the areas covered by the invasive plant Hakea sericea using high spatial resolution images obtained from aerial platforms (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: UAV/drone) and orbital platforms (WorldView-2: WV2), following an object-oriented image analysis approach. The results showed that both data were suitable. WV2reached user and producer accuracies greater than 93% (Estimate of Kappa (KHAT): 0.95), while the classifications with the UAV orthophotographs obtained accuracies higher than 75% (KHAT: 0.51). The most suitable data to use as input consisted of using all of the multispectral bands that were available for each image. The addition of textural features did not increase the accuracies for the Hakea sericea class, but it did for the general classification using WV2.

TI  - New insight of the geological structures and tectonic framework of Ahnet and northwestern part of Tin Zaouatine terranes (western Hoggar, Algeria) constraints from aeromagnetic, gamma ray, and remote sensing data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ahnet and Tin Zaouatine terranes are located in the southern sector of the Algerian Desert and are part of the Tuareg Shield, which was built up during east-west shortening (Pan-African orogeny). This paper presents a new 1/200,000 geological and tectonic map of the Tin Tanet Firt sheet map (mainly of the Ahnet terrane and the northwestern part of the Tin Zaouatine terrane). Enhancement and processing of multispectral satellite data (Landsat 7 ETM+) combined with field campaign and airborne geophysics was used to discriminate geological lithologies and tectonic structures. We define six geological domains: (i) Palaeozoic formation and Cambrian continental facies and plutonic rocks, (ii) Late-to postorogenic plutonic rocks, (iii) synchronous orogenic plutonic rocks, (iv) Neoproterozoic formation, (v) Mesoproterozoic volcanics, metasedimentary rocks, and associated plutonic rocks, and (vi) Late Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks. Airborne magnetic data and textural features derived from remote sensing and fieldwork allow us to identify faults and shear zones that affect the whole studied terrane. Interpreted tectonic lines and foliation paths leads us to suggest a deformation model which involves two deformation pahses: an older N-S to NNE-SSW shortening D1 and a younger D2 defined by the N-S trend and a compressional character revealed in the Ahnet terrane and Camp Zohra Complex domain which is considered a continuum deformation split into three phases that affect and form structures of the whole Ahnet and the northwestern part of Tin Zaouatine terranes at the Pan-African orogeny. The most recent stress field recorded in this region is expressed as NE-SW strike-slip faults.

TI  - Predict the potential fishing grounds for Kilka (<i>Clupeonella</i> spp.) fishes in southern part of the Caspian Sea using maximum entropy models and remotely sensed satellite data
T2  - Iranian Journal of Ichthyology
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past two decades, total catch of the Caspian Kilka have reached to a crisis point. The present study aimed to predict the Kilka Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) across Iranian waters of southern region of the Caspian Sea. The potential fishing zones of Kilka fishes were modelled using MaxEnt and fishing points' data in the Anzali and Babolsar ports. Two year-catch (2015 to 2016) geographical points and raster environmental images were provided to produce a map for Kilka PFZ. The selected environmental variables were, night time Sea Surface Temperature, Chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity. According to the results, prediction could be made using the environmental factors for Kilka PFZ with high accuracy (AUC=0.96; SD=0.01) with NSST having the highest impact on the predictions.

TI  - On the divergence of potential and actual evapotranspiration trends: An assessment across alternate global datasets
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is a key variable in hydrology, playing an important role in water and energy balance of the land surface. There has been speculation on the direction of trend in potential and actual evapotranspiration (PET and AET) resulting from rising global temperatures, in both observational and derived records representing the historical climate. In this study, PET and AET trends of eight different global model datasets where analyzed over two time periods: from 2003 to 2012 (short term) and from 1980 to 2012 (multidecadal), to identify regions where the trends coincide or differ and to study the reasons behind these changes. The short-term analysis showed considerable uncertainty exists on the detection and direction of significant trends on both PET and AET. There was little agreement among the datasets about the direction of the global trends. The multidecadal study showed much more consistent trends throughout the datasets, particularly in relation to positive significant PET trends. During this period, the global PET mean increased 0.091 mm month(-1) yr(-1), while the global AET rose at 0.045 mm month(-1) yr(-1). Much of the opposite PET/AET trends can be attributed to changes in the precipitation. Most of the regions which present these trends are water-limited and present strong correlations between AET and precipitation trends. Some energy-limited regions showed an increasing gap between PET and AET, suggesting the influence of additional variables controlling AET.

TI  - Estimation of GRACE water storage components by temporal decomposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has been in operation since 2002. Water storage estimates are calculated from gravity anomalies detected by the operating satellites and although not the true resolution, can be presented as 100 km x 100 km data cells if appropriate scaling functions are applied. Estimating total water storage has shown to be highly useful in detecting hydrological variations and trends. However, a limitation is that GRACE does not provide information as to where the water is stored in the vertical profile. We aim to partition the total water storage from GRACE into water storage components. We use a wavelet filter to decompose the GRACE data and partition it into various water storage components including soil water and groundwater. Storage components from the Australian Water Resources Assessment (AWRA) model are used as a reference for the decompositions of total storage data across Australia. Results show a clear improvement in using decomposed GRACE data instead of raw GRACE data when compared against total water storage outputs from the AWRA model. The method has potential to improve GRACE applications including a means to test various large scale hydrological models as well as helping to analyse floods, droughts and other hydrological conditions.

TI  - Assessment of changes in formations of non-forest woody vegetation in southern Denmark based on airborne LiDAR
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing technology that uses light in the form of pulses to measure the range between a sensor and the Earth's surface. Recent increase in availability of airborne LiDAR scanning (ALS) data providing national coverage with high point densities has opened a wide range of possibilities for monitoring landscape elements and their changes at broad geographical extent. We assessed the dynamics of the spatial extent of non-forest woody vegetation (NFW) in a study area of approx. 2500 km(2) in southern Jutland, Denmark, based on two acquisitions of ALS data for 2006 and 2014 in combination with other spatial data. Our results show a net-increase (4.8%) in the total area of NFW. Furthermore, this net change comprises of both areas with a decrease and areas with an increase of NFW. An accuracy assessment based on visual interpretation of aerial photos indicates high accuracy (>95%) in the delineation of NFW without changes during the study period. For NFW that changed between 2006 and 2014,accuracies were lower (90 and 82% in removed and new features, respectively), which is probably due to lower point densities of the 2006 ALS data (0.5 pts./m(2)) compared to the 2014 data (4-5 pts./m(2)). We conclude that ALS data, if combined with other spatial data, in principle are highly suitable for detailed assessment of changes in landscape features, such as formations of NFW at broad geographical extent. However, in change assessment based on multi-temporal ALS data with different point densities errors occur, particularly when examining small or narrow NFW objects.

TI  - Improving Identification of Areas for Ecological Restoration for Conservation by Integrating USLE and MCDA in a GIS-Environment: A Pilot Study in a Priority Region Northern Mexico
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature conservation is critical for securing an adequate supplying of environmental services to humans. Paradoxically, financial resources for conservation are normally scarce and, forest ecosystem restoration activities are expensive. So, a careful and detailed planning is vital for optimizing economic funds when ecosystems restoration practices are implemented. In this work, we developed a methodology to find physically-degraded sites in order to determine both, urgency and feasibility to carry out ecological forest restoration activities in the Priority Region for Conservation Xilitla in the state of San Luis Potosi (Mexico). Both, Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) were integrated together by using climatic, soil, remotely-sensed, and proximity data at a 30 m spatial resolution. The results indicated that, more than 80% of the bare soil land in the protected area is under several conditions that lead to feasible ecosystem restoration. This methodology can be further applied to know about the spatial location of soil degraded sites when planning forest restoration practices in natural protected areas.

TI  - Classifying building occupancy using building laws and geospatial information: A case study in Bangkok
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Classifying building occupancy types helps build inventory databases, which are important in disaster management. These databases are used to estimate disaster loss and vulnerable to disaster. Oftentimes, this information is gathered via remote sensing data, which can help determine the shape of buildings. However, in order to be helpful, such records require precise occupancy information to support pre-disaster preparation and post-disaster recovery planning. Collecting this information is time-consuming and costly, especially in developing countries with limited resources, such as Thailand. This study offers a potential solution to these hurdles, using a combination of building construction laws and regulations on building occupancy and geospatial data to develop a new methodology for developing a database of building occupancy classification data. The results reveal that this method is effective in classifying urban building occupancy, with more than 75% overall accuracy. Therefore, these methods can be useful in the disaster management of national or local governments in countries where the means to collect such data is limited.

TI  - Accelerated losses of protected forests from gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gold mining in Amazonia involves forest removal, soil excavation, and the use of liquid mercury, which together pose a major threat to biodiversity, water quality, forest carbon stocks, and human health. Within the global biodiversity hotspot ofMadre de Dios, Peru, gold mining has continued despite numerous 2012 government decrees and enforcement actions against it. Mining is now also thought to have entered federally protected areas, but the rates of miner encroachment are unknown. Here, we utilize high-resolution remote sensing to assess annual changes in gold mining extent from 1999 to 2016 throughout theMadre de Dios region, including the high-diversity Tambopata National Reserve and buffer zone. Regionally, gold mining-related losses of forest averaged 4437 ha yr(-1). A temporary downward inflection in the annual growth rate of mining-related forest loss following 2012 government action was followed by a near doubling of the deforestation rate from mining in 2013-2014. The total estimated area of gold mining throughout the region increased about 40% between 2012 and 2016, including in the Tambopata National Reserve. Our results reveal an urgent need for more socio-environmental effort and law enforcement action to combat illegal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon.

TI  - Cytokine production in mammary adenocarcinoma and its microenvironmental cells in patients with or without metastases in regional lymph nodes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMMUNOPATHOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Letter
AB  - In recent years, the concept of formation of a sufficiently autonomous cytokine network in a malignant tumour has emerged. In this regard, the data on the role of this network and its signalling pathways in the process of metastasis are an interesting topic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro cytokine-producing potential of mammary adenocarcinoma (MAC; and cells of its microenvironment) from patients with or without metastases in regional lymph nodes (LNs). By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of culture supernatants, we studied the cytokine production by biopsy samples of MAC: spontaneous and stimulated by polyclonal activators (PAs: phytohaemagglutinin, concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide). The levels of spontaneous production of interleukin (IL)-10 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the amounts of IL-2, IL-10, G-CSF and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) produced during stimulation by PAs, as well as the index of stimulation by polyclonal activators (ISPA) for IL-2 production, were lower for MAC with LN metastasis than for MAC without LN metastasis. The levels of spontaneous production of IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma and the ISPA for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production were higher for MAC with LN metastasis. There were only three pairwise correlations between the produced cytokines that were specific to MAC with LN metastasis: IL-2 and IFN-gamma, IL-6 and GM-CSF, and IL-8 and GM-CSF. There were 10 pairwise correlations between the produced cytokines that were specific to nonmetastasising MAC:IL-6 and IL-10, IL-6 and MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-10, IL-8 and MCP-1, IL-10 and G-CSF, IL-10 and MCP-1, IFN-gamma and MCP-1, MCP-1 and G-CSF, G-CSF and IL-1Ra, and GM-CSF and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Our data indicate that metastatic tumours show desynchronisation of many pathways of induction and synthesis of cytokines that are characteristic of nonmetastatic tumours.

TI  - Calibration of the Water Cloud Model at C-Band for Winter Crop Fields and Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In a perspective to develop an inversion approach for estimating surface soil moisture of crop fields from Sentinel-1/2 data (radar and optical sensors), the Water Cloud Model (WCM) was calibrated from C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values collected over crops fields and grasslands. The soil contribution that depends on soil moisture and surface roughness (in addition to SAR instrumental parameters) was simulated using the physical backscattering model IEM (Integral Equation Model). The vegetation descriptor used in the WCM is the NDVI because it can be directly calculated from optical images. A large dataset consisting of radar backscattered signal in Vertical transmit and Vertical receive (VV) and Vertical transmit and Horizontal receive (VH) polarizations with wide range of incidence angle, soil moisture, surface roughness, and NDVI-values was used. It was collected over two agricultural study sites. Results show that the soil contribution to the total radar backscattered signal is lower in VH than in VV because VH is more sensitive to vegetation cover. Thus, the use of VH alone or in addition to VV for retrieving the soil moisture is not advantageous in presence of well-developed vegetation cover.

TI  - SELECTION OF PARAMETERS AND ARCHITECTURE OF MULTILAYER PERCEPTRONS FOR PREDICTING ICE COVERAGE OF LAKES
T2  - Ekologia (Bratislava)
M3  - Article
AB  - The ice cover on lakes is one of the most influential factors in the lakes' winter aquatic ecosystem. The paper presents a method for predicting ice coverage of lakes by means of multilayer perceptrons. This approach is based on historical data on the ice coverage of lakes taking Lake Onega as an example. The daily time series of ice coverage of Lake Onega for 2004-2017 was collected by means of satellite data analysis of snow and ice cover of the Northern Hemisphere. Input signals parameters for the multilayer perceptrons aimed at predicting ice coverage of lakes are based on the correlation analysis of this time series. The results of training of multilayer perceptrons showed that perceptrons with architectures of 3-2-1 within the Freeze-up phase (arithmetic mean of the mean square errors for training epoch (MSE) over bar = 0.0155) and 3-6-1 within the Break-up phase ((MSE) over bar = 0.0105) have the least mean-squared error for the last training epoch. Tests within the holdout samples prove that multilayer perceptrons give more adequate and reliable prediction of the ice coverage of Lake Onega (mean-squared prediction error MSPE = 0.0076) comparing with statistical methods such as linear regression, moving average and autoregressive analyses of the first and second order.

TI  - Geometric features of LOS data derived by SAR PSI technologies and the three-dimensional data fusion
T2  - ACTA GEODAETICA ET GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the satellite SAR persistent scatterer interferometry can already estimate surface changes with a near to 1 mm theoretical precision limit. However, the ascending and descending acquisitions of available SAR services cannot provide three-dimensional changes routinely, though the slow deformation processes are basically three-dimensional (3D). In this paper the geometric features of ascending and descending SAR data and possible fusion with geodetic data are summarised. All the geometric equations are introduced, which are necessary to derive the two characteristic changes in the observation plain defined by ascending and descending unit vectors pointing to SAR satellite positions. The unambiguously derivable characteristic changes can be transformed into vertical and east changes, but they may be biased by possible north displacement. The geometric features of symmetric and asymmetric acquisitions are also investigated. Monte-Carlo simulation is used to investigate the precision of two estimated components. It is experienced that the precisions are not sensitive to one degree standard deviations of positional angles. The Gauss-Markov model of least square adjustment method is used to derive only the statistical properties of reasonable data fusion which can contribute to the 3D applications. Although complementary satellites, which are already proposed in the literature, could provide precise autonomous solutions, in the practise GNSS and levelling data can be used for direct data fusion. Whereas, even errorless levelled high changes cannot contribute to the proper estimation of northern components, GNSS derived changes are the best candidates, which can be interpolated or measured directly. Moreover, these two techniques can properly compensate the weaknesses of each other. The interferometric SAR techniques are not sensitive enough to the north changes, but can contribute to the precision of height estimation, which are the weakest components of the GNSS technique. This statement is valid if the standard deviations of combined data are comparable. For test computations the geometric parameters of available Sentinel-1A images are used, which cover the area of the Szechenyi Istvan Geophysical Observatory, where experimental integrated geodetic benchmark is located combining ascending and descending backscatterers with the possibility of the GNSS, gravimetric and traditional geodetic measurements, as well.

TI  - Characteristics and origins of air pollutants and carbonaceous aerosols during wintertime haze episodes at a rural site in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - China has frequently suffered regional-scale haze pollution in recent years. In this study, real-time observation data such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O-3 were used to analyze wintertime haze events at a rural site (Dongshan) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). 3-hour resolution organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were also measured to further investigate the sources of PM2.5. The hybrid receptor models were used to identify source regions of PM2.5. The results showed that both regional transport and local emissions significantly contribute to air pollution at Dongshan during haze periods. The source areas affecting high PM2.5 concentrations were mainly located in nearby urbanized provinces (i.e., Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang) and industrial provinces (i.e., Shandong and Hebei) in eastern China. Furthermore, open biomass-burning emissions in south China (i.e., Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong and Fujian) decreased regional air quality, which was supported by MODIS fire spots and receptor models. During clean periods, air masses were originated from remote regions such as Mongolia and oceanic areas (i.e., the Yellow Sea and the East Sea). Enhanced secondary organic carbon (SOC) formation was found under long-range transport when OC aging was favorable. Contrarily, relatively low SOC formation was found when the site was dominated by local emissions. In addition to local emissions, high PM2.5 concentrations at Dongshan were apparently affected by either regional or long-range transport, which were characterized by relatively low and high wind speeds, respectively. It is necessary to implement the emission control strategies for the industrial and urbanized areas. (C) 2017 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control.

TI  - Effects of long-term rainfall decline on the structure and functioning of Hawaiian forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is altering the dynamics of terrestrial vegetation, with consequences for the functioning of Earth's biomes and the provisioning of ecosystem services. Changes in forest dynamics due to drought events or short-term drying trends have been described at different ecological scales, but few observational studies have determined the relative effects of short-and long-term precipitation trends (e.g. decade and century, respectively) on forest canopy structure and functioning. Using gridded annual precipitation maps from 1920 to 2012, and temporal data from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), we present evidence for a large-scale decline in forest canopy volume (area vs. height) and greenness (a metric of photosynthetic function) driven by a long-term drying trend on Hawaii island. Decreases in canopy greenness were observed in step with shorter-term (10 y) precipitation declines, but decreases in greenness were two-fold greater where longer-term (similar to 100 y) precipitation declines had occurred. Canopy volume mainly reduced where long-term precipitation declines occurred. We conclude that long-term precipitation trends critically impact forest canopy structure and functioning, which likely has cascading consequences for numerous ecological processes such as subcanopy light availability, species interactions, carbon storage, and animal habitat.

TI  - A new method for crop classification combining time series of radar images and crop phenology information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land cover is characterized by strong variations within relatively short time intervals. These dynamics are challenging for land cover classifications on the one hand, but deliver crucial information that can be used to improve the classifiers performance on the other hand. Since up to date mapping of crops is crucial to assess the impact of agricultural land use on the ecosystems, an accurate and complete classification of crop types is of high importance. In the presented study, a new multitemporal data based classification approach was developed that incorporates knowledge about the phenological changes on crop lands. It identifies phenological sequence patterns (PSP) of the crop types based on a dense stack of Sentinel-1 data and accurate information about the plant's phenology. The performance of the developed methodology has been tested for two different vegetation seasons using over 200 ground truth fields located in northern Germany. The results showed that a dense time series of Sentinel-1 images allowed for high classification accuracies of grasslands, maize, canola, sugar beets and potatoes (F1-score above 0.8) using PSP as well as standard (Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood) classification method. The PSP approach clearly outperformed standard methods for cereal crops, especially for spring barley where the F1-score varied between zero and 0.43 for standard approaches, while PSP achieved values as high as 0.74 and 0.79 for both vegetation seasons. The PSP based approach also outperformed for oat, winter barley and rye. Furthermore, the PSP classification is more resilient to differences in farming management and conditions of growth since it takes information about each crop types' growing stage and its growing period into consideration. The results also indicate, that the PSP approach was more sensitive to subtle changes such as the proportion of weeds within a field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intensive care medicine research agenda on invasive fungal infection in critically ill patients
T2  - INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To describe concisely the current standards of care, major recent advances, common beliefs that have been contradicted by recent trials, areas of uncertainty, and clinical studies that need to be performed over the next decade and their expected outcomes with regard to Candida and Aspergillus infections in non-neutropenic patients in the ICU setting.Methods: A systematic review of the medical literature taking account of national and international guidelines and expert opinion.Results: Severe invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are becoming increasingly frequent in critically ill patients. Approximately 80% of IFIs are due to Candida spp. and 0.3-19% to Aspergillus spp. Recent observations emphasize the necessity of building a worldwide sentinel network to monitor the emergence of new fungal species and changes in susceptibility. Robust data on the attributable mortality are essential for the design of clinical studies with mortality endpoints. Although early antifungal therapy for Candida has been recommended in patients with risk factors, sepsis of unknown cause, and positive Candida serum biomarkers [beta-1 -> 3-D-glucan (BDG) and Candida albicans germ tube antibody (CAGTA)], its usefulness and influence on outcome need to be confirmed. Future studies may specifically address the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with abdominal candidiasis. Better knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of antifungal molecules and tissue penetration is a key issue for intensivists. Regarding invasive aspergillosis, further investigation is needed to determine its incidence in the ICU, its relationship with influenza outbreaks, the clinical impact of rapid diagnosis, and the significance of combination treatment.Conclusions: Fundamental questions regarding IFI have to be addressed over the next decade. The clinical studies described in this research agenda should provide a template and set priorities for the clinical investigations that need to be performed.

TI  - Fibroblasts: The Unknown Sentinels Eliciting Immune Responses Against Microorganisms.
T2  - European journal of microbiology & immunology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Fibroblasts are present in all tissues but predominantly in connective tissues. Some of their functions include contractility, locomotion, collagen and elastin fiber production, and the regulation and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Also, fibroblasts act as sentinels to produce inflammatory mediators in response to several microorganisms. There is evidence that fibroblasts can synthesize toll-like receptors (TLRs), antimicrobial peptides, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which are important molecules involved in innate immune response against microorganisms. Fibroblasts can express TLRs (TLR-1 to TLR-10) to sense microbial components or microorganisms. They can synthesize antimicrobial peptides, such as LL-37, defensins hBD-1, and hBD-2, molecules that perform antimicrobial activity. Also, they can produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFalpha, INFgamma, IL-6, IL-12p70, and IL-10; other chemokines, such as CCL1, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10, and CX3CL1; and the growth factors granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to induce and recruit inflammatory cells. According to their immunological attributes, we can conclude that fibroblasts are sentinel cells that recognize pathogens, induce the recruitment of inflammatory cells via cytokines and growth factors, and release antimicrobial peptides, complying with the characteristics of real sentinels.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Recurrent Melanoma: A Multicenter Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 70th Annual Cancer Symposium of the Society-of-Surgical-Oncology
CL  - Seattle, WA
AB  - Background. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is routinely performed for primary cutaneous melanomas; however, limited data exist for SLNB after locally recurrent (LR) or in-transit (IT) melanoma.Methods. Data from three centers performing SLNB for LR/IT melanoma (1997 to the present) were reviewed, with the aim of assessing (1) success rate; (2) SLNB positivity; and (3) prognostic value of SLNB in this population.Results. The study cohort included 107 patients. Management of the primary melanoma included prior SLNB for 56 patients (52%), of whom 10 (18%) were positive and 12 had complete lymph node dissections (CLNDs). In the present study, SLNB was performed for IT disease (48/107, 45%) or LR melanoma (59/107, 55%). A sentinel lymph node (SLN) was removed in 96% (103/107) of cases. Nodes were not removed for four patients due to lymphoscintigraphy failures (2) or nodes not found during surgery (2). SLNB was positive in 41 patients (40%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 31.5-50.5), of whom 35 (88%) had CLND, with 13 (37%) having positive nonsentinel nodes. Median time to disease progression after LR/IT metastasis was 1.4 years (95% CI 0.75-2.0) for patients with a positive SLNB, and 5.9 years (95% CI 1.7-10.2) in SLNB-negative patients (p = 0.18). There was a trend towards improved overall survival for patients with a negative SLNB (p = 0.06).Conclusion. SLNB can be successful in patients with LR/IT melanoma, even if prior SLNB was performed. In this population, the rates of SLNB positivity and nonsentinel node metastases were 40% and 37%, respectively. SLNB may guide management and prognosis after LR/IT disease.

TI  - Improved reliability of serological tools for the diagnosis of West Nile fever in horses within Europe
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile Fever is a zoonotic disease caused by a mosquito-borne flavivirus, WNV. By its clinical sensitivity to the disease, the horse is a useful sentinel of infection. Because of the virus' low-level, short-term viraemia in horses, the primary tools used to diagnose WNV are serological tests. Inter-laboratory proficiency tests (ILPTs) were held in 2010 and 2013 to evaluate WNV serological diagnostic tools suited for the European network of National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for equine diseases. These ILPTs were designed to evaluate the laboratories' and methods' performances in detecting WNV infection in horses through serology. The detection of WNV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by ELISA is widely used in Europe, with 17 NRLs in 2010 and 20 NRLs in 2013 using IgG WNV assays. Thanks to the development of new commercial IgM capture kits, WNV IgM capture ELISAs were rapidly implemented in NRLs between 2010 (4 NRLs) and 2013 (13 NRLs). The use of kits allowed the quick standardisation of WNV IgG and IgM detection assays in NRLs with more than 95% (20/21) and 100% (13/13) of satisfactory results respectively in 2013. Conversely, virus neutralisation tests (VNTs) were implemented in 33% (7/21) of NRLs in 2013 and their low sensitivity was evidenced in 29% (2/7) of NRLs during this ILPT. A comparison of serological diagnostic methods highlighted the higher sensitivity of IgG ELISAs compared to WNV VNTs. They also revealed that the low specificity of IgG ELISA kits meant that it could detect animals infected with other flaviviruses. In contrast VNT and IgM ELISA assays were highly specific and did not detect antibodies against related flaviviruses. These results argue in favour of the need for and development of new, specific serological diagnostic assays that could be easily transferred to partner laboratories.

T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the external ear have a significant rate of metastasis. The purpose of this study was to present analyzed factors associated with auricular SCC metastasis in order to identify a group that may benefit from sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all operable SCCs between 2009 and 2014. The association between high-risk features and metastasis were analyzed.Results: One hundred eighty-nine auricular SCCs were excised. Local recurrence was noted in 11% and 9.5% developed metastases. Cartilage, perineural, and lymphovascular invasion were significantly associated with metastasis, as were increased tumor depth and diameter (P <.001). All patients with metastasis developed nodal disease.Conclusion: Factors, including poor differentiation, perineural, cartilage, and lymphovascular invasion, are associated with auricular SCC metastasis. Patients with 2 or more high-risk features may benefit from SLNB in order to identify and treat early nodal disease and possibly reduce the risk of further spread.

TI  - Mapping Vulnerable Urban Areas Affected by Slow-Moving Landslides Using Sentinel-1 InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are widespread natural hazards that generate considerable damage and economic losses worldwide. Detecting terrain movements caused by these phenomena and characterizing affected urban areas is critical to reduce their impact. Here we present a fast and simple methodology to create maps of vulnerable buildings affected by slow-moving landslides, based on two parameters: (1) the deformation rate associated to each building, measured from Sentinel-1 SAR data, and (2) the building damage generated by the landslide movement and recorded during a field campaign. We apply this method to Arcos de la Frontera, a monumental town in South Spain affected by a slow-moving landslide that has caused severe damage to buildings, forcing the evacuation of some of them. Our results show that maximum deformation rates of 4 cm/year in the line-of-sight (LOS) of the satellite, affects La Verbena, a newly-developed area, and displacements are mostly horizontal, as expected for a planar-landslide. Our building damage assessment reveals that most of the building blocks in La Verbena present moderate to severe damages. According to our vulnerability scale, 93% of the building blocks analysed present high vulnerability and, thus, should be the focus of more in-depth local studies to evaluate the serviceability of buildings, prior to adopting the necessary mitigation measures to reduce or cope with the negative consequences of this landslide. This methodology can be applied to slow-moving landslides worldwide thanks to the global availability of Sentinel-1 SAR data.

TI  - Commercial Off-the-Shelf Digital Cameras on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Multitemporal Monitoring of Vegetation Reflectance and NDVI
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with one unaltered and one near infrared-modified commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) camera. Radiometrically calibrated orthomosaics were generated for 17 dates, from which digital numbers were corrected to surface reflectance and to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Validation against ground measurements showed that 84%-90% of the variation in the ground reflectance and 95%-96% of the variation in the ground NDVI could be explained by the UAV-retrieved reflectance and NDVI, respectively. Comparisons against Landsat 8 data showed relationships of 0.73 <= R-2 >= 0.84 for reflectance and 0.86 <= R-2 >= 0.89 for NDVI. It was not possible to generate a fully consistent time series of reflectance, due to variable illumination conditions during acquisition on some dates. However, the calculation of NDVI resulted in a more stable UAV time series, which was consistent with a Landsat series of NDVI extracted over a deciduous and evergreen woodland. The results confirm that COTS cameras, following calibration, can yield accurate reflectance estimates (under stable within-flight illumination conditions), and that consistent NDVI time series can be acquired in very variable illumination conditions. Such methods have significant potential in providing flexible, low-cost approaches to vegetation monitoring at fine spatial resolution and for user-controlled revisit periods.

T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context The ability to detect ecological networks in landscapes is of utmost importance for managing biodiversity and planning corridors.Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate the information provided by a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image for landscape connectivity modeling compared to aerial photographs (APs).Methods We present a novel method that integrates habitat suitability derived from remote sensing imagery into a connectivity model to explain species abundance. More precisely, we compared how two resistance maps constructed using landscape and/or local metrics derived from AP or SAR imagery yield different connectivity values (based on graph theory), considering hedgerow networks and forest carabid beetle species as a model.Results We found that resistance maps using landscape and local metrics derived from SAR imagery improve landscape connectivity measures. The SAR model is the most informative, explaining 58% of the variance in forest carabid beetle abundance. This model calculates resistance values associated with homogeneous patches within hedgerows according to their suitability (canopy cover density and landscape grain) for the model species.Conclusions Our approach combines two important methods in landscape ecology: the construction of resistance maps and the use of buffers around sampling points to determine the importance of landscape factors. This study was carried out through an interdisciplinary approach involving remote sensing scientists and landscape ecologists. This study is a step forward in developing landscape metrics from satellites to monitor biodiversity.

The Brays Bayouwatershed (BBW) is a heavily urbanized and densely populated watershed located mostly in Harris County, TX. The objectives of our study are (1) to analyze and interpret the spatial and temporal land use and land cover changes in BBW and (2) to determine nutrient, heavy metal, and bacterial contamination in the Brays Bayou. Water and sediment samples were collected from selected sampling locations along the Brays Bayou and analyzed for various nutrient and metal concentrations. Bacterial analysis was conducted to enumerate the fecal coliform bacteria in water samples. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images sampled from over three decades (19802010) for the BBW study area were processed and analyzed for land use and land cover changes. Our remote sensing analysis revealed that the BBW lost about 28.4% (9463 acres) vegetation during the period of 1984 to 2010. The loss in vegetative areas resulted in increased impervious surface areas. In sediment samples, increasing trends for Al, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn were observed towards the downstream of Brays Bayou. Lead concentrations were found at the highest concentration (70 mg/kg) in certain Brays Bayou sampling locations. Escherichia coli concentrations decreased towards the downstream of Brays Bayou and were found below 200 maximum probable numbers/100 ml. Integration of remote sensing along with the chemical and biological analysis helped to understand the impact of land cover changes on the bayou water quality.

TI  - Subserosal uterine injection of blue dye for the identification of the sentinel node in patients with endometrial cancer: a feasibility study
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To define the detection rate, sensitivity, and negative predictive value (NPV) of the sentinel node technique in patients with endometrial cancer.Patients with endometrial cancer after informed consent underwent subserosal injection of blue dye during hysterectomy in a tertiary gynae/oncology department between 2010 and 2014. The procedure was performed in all cases by the same team including two gynae/oncologist consultants and one trainee. All relevant perioperative clinicopathological characteristics of the population were recorded prospectively. The identified sentinel nodes were removed separately and a completion bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy followed in all cases. Simple statistics were used to calculate the sensitivity and NPV of the method on per patient basis.Fifty-four patients were included in this study. At least one sentinel node was mapped in 46 patients yielding a detection rate of 85.2%. Bilateral detection of sentinel nodes was accomplished in only 31 patients (57.4%). The mean number of sentinel nodes was 2.6 per patient and the commonest site of identification was the external iliac artery and vein area (66%). Six patients (11%) had a positive lymph node, and in five of them, this was the sentinel one yielding a sensitivity of 83.3% and an NPV of 97.5%. The overall detection rate improved significantly after the first 15 cases; however, this was not the case for the bilateral detection rate.Our study is in accordance with previous studies of sentinel node in endometrial cancer and further demonstrates and enhances the confidence in the technique. In the current era of an ongoing debate on whether a systematic lymphadenectomy in patients with endometrial cancer is still necessary, we believe that the sentinel node is an acceptable alternative and should be applied routinely in tertiary centres following a strict algorithm.

TI  - <i>BCR</i>-<i>ABL1</i>-like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: From bench to bedside
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) occurs in approximately 1: 1500 children and is less frequently found in adults. The most common immunophenotype of ALL is the B cell lineage and within B cell precursor ALL, specific genetic aberrations define subtypes with distinct biological and clinical characteristics. With more advanced genetic analysis methods such as whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, novel genetic subtypes have recently been discovered. One novel class of genetic aberrations comprises tyrosine kinase-activating lesions, including translocations and rearrangements of tyrosine kinase and cytokine receptor genes. These newly discovered genetic aberrations are harder to detect by standard diagnostic methods such as karyotyping, fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) because they are diverse and often cryptic. These lesions involve one of several tyrosine kinase genes (among others, v-abl Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 1 (ABL1), v-abl Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2 (ABL2), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta polypeptide (PDGFRB)), each of which can be fused to up to 15 partner genes. Together, they compose 2-3% of B cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL), which is similar in size to the well-known fusion gene BCR-ABL1 subtype. These so-called BCR-ABL1-like fusions are mutually exclusive with the sentinel translocations in BCP-ALL (BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements) and have the promising prospect to be sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors similar to BCR-ABL1. In this review, we discuss the types of tyrosine kinase-activating lesions discovered, and the preclinical and clinical evidence for the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of this novel subtype of ALL.

M3  - Article
AB  - Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can impair sexual health. Surveillance and study data were used to provide an overview over STIs in Germany. We estimated 3900 new HIV diagnoses in 2015. Of newly diagnosed infections, 57% were attributed to men who have sex with men (MSM). It was further estimated that there were 3200 new HIV infections and 84,700 people living with HIV in 2015. A total of 6834 syphilis infections were recorded in 2015, which corresponds to an increase of 149% since 2009. The incidence in men was 16-times higher than in women. Of syphilis infections, 85% could be attributed to MSM. Antimicrobial resistance of gonococci against the broad-spectrum antibiotic cefixime decreased between 2014 and 2016 after a change of therapy guidelines and remained stable on a low level regarding the antibiotic ceftriaxone. After an increase of resistance against the antibiotic azithromycin to 11.3% in 2015, we observed a decreasing trend in 2016. Between 2013 and 2015, 2,355,336 chlamydia tests were reported through the chlamydia sentinel network. Of these, 92.5% of samples were from women. Uptake for screening for women < 25 years was 11.3% in 2015, with 5.0% positive chlamydia tests. In a cross-sectional study among women aged 20-25 years, a prevalence of human papilloma virus (HPV) of 38.1% was observed. A total of 30.5% of 15-year-old women were vaccinated against HPV in 2014. Data suggest that STIs represent a high burden of disease. Knowledge of STI prevention should be improved by targeted education campaigns. Extending existing offers for counselling and testing through cooperation between different health sectors would improve early diagnosis and treatment of STIs.

TI  - Paracas dust storms: Sources, trajectories and associated meteorological conditions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms that develop along the Pisco-Ica desert in Southern Peru, locally known as "Paracas" winds have ecological, health and economic repercussions. Here we identify dust sources through MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery and analyze HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particles Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model trajectories and dispersion patterns, along with concomitant synoptic-scale meteorological conditions from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR). Additionally, surface pressure data from the hourly METeorological Aerodrome Report (METAR) at Arica (18.5 degrees S, 70.3 degrees W) and Pisco (13.7 degrees S, 76.2 degrees W) were used to calculate Alongshore (sea-level) Pressure Gradient (APG) anomalies during Paracas dust storms, their duration and associated wind-speeds and wind directions. This study provides a review on the occurrence and strength of the Paracas dust storms as reported in the Pisco airfield for five-year period and their correspondence with MODIS true-color imagery in terms of dust-emission source areas. Our results show that most of the particle fluxes moving into the Ica-Pisco desert area during Paracas wind events originate over the coastal zone, where strong winds forced by steep APGs develop as the axis of a deep mid-troposphere trough sets in along north-central Chile. Direct relationships between Paracas wind intensity, number of active dust-emission sources and APGs are also documented, although the scarcity of simultaneous METAR/MODIS data for clearly observed MODIS dust plumes prevents any significant statistical inference. Synoptic-scale meteorological composites from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data show that Paracas wind events (steep APGs) are mostly associated with the strengthening of anticyclonic conditions in northern Chile, that can be attributed to cold air advection associated with the incoming trough. Compared to the MODIS images, HYSPLIT outputs were able to spatially reproduce trajectories and dust dispersion plumes during the Paracas wind storms. HYSPLIT trajectories revealed that part of the wind-eroded lithological material can be transported downwind several kilometers along the Peruvian coast and also deposited over the nearby coastal ocean, giving support to the presence of an aeolian signal in continental shelf sediments, of great importance for paleoenvironmental studies.

TI  - Prediction of Forest Canopy and Surface Fuels from Lidar and Satellite Time Series Data in a Bark Beetle-Affected Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire behavior depends on the type, quantity, and condition of fuels, and the effect that bark beetle outbreaks have on fuels is a topic of current research and debate. Remote sensing can provide estimates of fuels across landscapes, although few studies have estimated surface fuels from remote sensing data. Here we predicted and mapped field-measured canopy and surface fuels from light detection and ranging (lidar) and Landsat time series explanatory variables via random forest (RF) modeling across a coniferous montane forest in Colorado, USA, which was affected by mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) approximately six years prior. We examined relationships between mapped fuels and the severity of tree mortality with correlation tests. RF models explained 59%, 48%, 35%, and 70% of the variation in available canopy fuel, canopy bulk density, canopy base height, and canopy height, respectively (percent root-mean-square error (% RMSE) = 12-54%). Surface fuels were predicted less accurately, with models explaining 24%, 28%, 32%, and 30% of the variation in litter and duff, 1 to 100-h, 1000-h, and total surface fuels, respectively (% RMSE = 37-98%). Fuel metrics were negatively correlated with the severity of tree mortality, except canopy base height, which increased with greater tree mortality. Our results showed how bark beetle-caused tree mortality significantly reduced canopy fuels in our study area. We demonstrated that lidar and Landsat time series data contain substantial information about canopy and surface fuels and can be used for large-scale efforts to monitor and map fuel loads for fire behavior modeling at a landscape scale.

TI  - Use of indirect lymphography to identify sentinel lymph node in dogs: a pilot study in 30 tumours
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports the clinical value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with indirect lymphography (IL) using iodized oil (IO) as a marker injected preoperatively around the site of the primary tumour and radiography or tomodensitometry for imaging. Surgical extirpation of the node was performed following peritumoural injection of methylene blue (MB). Twenty nine dogs affected by 30 palpable solid tumours were prospectively studied. SLNs were identified by IL in 96.6% of the IL studies. IL followed by MB studies were performed in 25 dogs (26 studies). In these studies, agreement between IL and MB was observed in 84.6%. One dog had a minor complication following IO injection. This protocol represents an attractive alternative to scintigraphy for SLN mapping. This less technically demanding protocol may provide a wider access to SLN identification for application in veterinary oncology.

TI  - Microbubble detection and ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy of axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AIMS: To assess the feasibility of undertaking microbubble-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and determine its sensitivity in detecting metastases. Patient experience and the impact of VAB on subsequent axillary surgery were also evaluated.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a normal axillary ultrasound or benign core biopsy planned for surgical SLN biopsy were recruited. Part 1 of the study was used to establish the technique of ultrasound microbubble contrast to detect the SLN. In Part 2 microbubble detection of the SLN was followed by 13 G VAB. All patients subsequently had surgical histological correlation.RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-nine patients were recruited: 36 to Part 1 and 103 to Part 2. Of the 100 patients in Part 2 included for analysis, 82 (82%) underwent successful biopsy. Sensitivity for detecting metastases was 58.8% (95% confidence interval: 32.9%, 81.6%). The procedure was generally well tolerated; however, VAB interfered adversely with subsequent surgical SLN biopsy with surgeons reporting moderate or severe interference in 48% of patients and an additional 8.3% with complete failure of SLNB.CONCLUSION: It is possible to perform VAB of microbubble-detected SLNs. Although the sensitivity for detecting metastases was reasonable, the adverse effect on subsequent surgery was significant. (C) 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Edyn: Dynamic Signaling of Changes to Forests Using Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Charts
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote detection of forest disturbance remains a key area of interest for scientists and land managers. Subtle disturbances such as drought, disease, insect activity, and thinning harvests have a significant impact on carbon budgeting and forest productivity, but current change detection algorithms struggle to accurately identify them, especially over decadal timeframes. We introduce an algorithm called Edyn, which inputs a time series of residuals from harmonic regression into a control chart to signal low-magnitude, consistent deviations from the curve as disturbances. After signaling, Edyn retrains a new baseline curve. We compared Edyn with its parent algorithm (EWMACD-Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Change Detection) on over 3500 visually interpreted Landsat pixels from across the contiguous USA, with reference data for timing and type of disturbance. For disturbed forested pixels, Edyn had a mean per-pixel commission error of 31.1% and omission error of 70.0%, while commission and omission errors for EWMACD were 39.9% and 65.2%, respectively. Edyn had significantly less overall error than EWMACD (F-1 = 0.19 versus F-1 = 0.13). These patterns generally held for all of the reference data, including a direct comparison to other contemporary change detection algorithms, wherein Edyn and EWMACD were found to have lower omission error rates for a category of subtle changes over long periods.

TI  - Whitecap Coverage Dependence on Wind and Wave Statistics as Observed during SO GasEx and HiWinGS
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Concurrent wavefield and turbulent flux measurements acquired during the Southern Ocean ( SO) Gas Exchange (GasEx) and the High Wind Speed Gas Exchange Study (HiWinGS) projects permit evaluation of the dependence of the whitecap coverage W on wind speed, wave age, wave steepness, mean square slope, and wind-wave and breaking Reynolds numbers. The W was determined from over 600 high-frequency visible imagery recordings of 20min each. Wave statistics were computed from in situ and remotely sensed data as well as from a WAVEWATCH III hindcast. The first shipborne estimates of W under sustained 10-m neutral wind speeds U10N of 25ms(-1) were obtained during HiWinGS. These measurements suggest that W levels off at high wind speed, not exceeding 10% when averaged over 20 min. Combining wind speed and wave height in the form of the wind-wave Reynolds number resulted in closely agreeing models for both datasets, individually and combined. These are also in good agreement with two previous studies. When expressing W in terms of wavefield statistics only or wave age, larger scatter is observed and/or there is little agreement between SO GasEx, HiWinGS, and previously published data. The wind speed-only parameterizations deduced from the SO GasEx and HiWinGS datasets agree closely and capture more of the observed W variability than Reynolds number parameterizations. However, these wind speed- only models do not agree as well with previous studies than the wind-wave Reynolds numbers.

TI  - Temporal patterns in species zonation in a mangrove forest in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, using a time series of Landsat imagery
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series analysis of Landsat imagery was used to evaluate trends in species zonation in a restored mangrove forest in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Dating back throughout the primary expansion of the forest, the Landsat archive provides a unique opportunity to examine the evolution of a restored forest in all stages of maturity. Through temporal trend analysis, areas of the forest were divided into four development stages: Pre-mangrove water, initial mangrove colonization, a period dominated by Sonneratia spp., and the arrival and zonation of secondary species. Field inventory data was used in conjunction with satellite data to investigate the geomorphic and hydrologic influences behind the species zonation. We hypothesize that the development of Sonneratia spp. facilitates initial sedimentation. The trees mature at higher soil elevations and a region develops with low forest density, high light availability, and reduced tidal inundation. Multi-species zonation then develops through the timely exploitation of the geomorphic conditions suitable for the establishment of secondary species.

TI  - Field Data Analysis and Weather Scenario of a Downburst Event in Livorno, Italy, on 1 October 2012
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean is a "hot spot'' for the genesis of different types of severe weather events, including potentially damaging wind phenomena like downbursts, whose occurrence and evolution in this geographical region have not been documented in the literature. This paper is part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between atmospheric scientists and wind engineers with the objective of conducting a comprehensive analysis of the field measurements and weather scenarios related to nonsynoptic wind systems in this area. The downburst that struck the Livorno coast of Italy at about 1310 local time 1 October 2012 is investigated as a relevant test case for such severe wind events. The wind velocity records detected by ultrasonic anemometers, part of a monitoring network created for the European "Wind and Ports'' and "Wind, Ports and Sea'' projects, are analyzed and decomposed in order to inspect the main statistical features of this transient event. The analysis of the meteorological precursors to this event is carried out making use of model analyses, standard in situ measurements, remote sensing techniques, proxy data, and direct observations. The results obtained bring new insights into a downburst's onset and detection in the Mediterranean, its evolution at the local scale, and possible connections to specific synoptic-scale weather conditions like secondary cyclogenesis in the lee of the Alps.

TI  - On the dynamics of the Sri Lanka Dome in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - East of Sri Lanka, in the northern Indian Ocean, a cold dome, known as the Sri Lanka Dome (SLD), develops during southwest monsoon season (June-September). The SLD first forms around May, matures in July, and decays around September, in association with the strong cyclonic wind stress curl. In this study, the structure and dynamics of SLD in response to the climatic events such as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) are examined. Our results reveal that these climatic events modulated the subsurface temperature variability in the thermocline at similar to 100 m depth, whose signature was also evident in the satellite-derived sea surface height (SSH) anomaly in the SLD region. We find that the mechanisms for the formation of SLD are consistent with previous research, and there is year-to-year variability in the SLD dynamics. This study also reveals that the atmospheric parameters including vertical wind shear and midtropospheric relative humidity are high over the SLD region and adjacent southern Bay of Bengal and show an upward (increasing) trend over the decades. This has impacted the atmospheric parameters over the northern Bay of Bengal over the decades and as a consequence the total number of monsoon depressions (June-September) decreased over the decades from 1980 to 2015, as reported by the India Meteorological Department, New Delhi. Thus, the new insight emerged from this study is the variability in the cyclogenesis and the occurrence of total number of monsoon depressions over northern Bay of Bengal over the decades is much related to the SLD dynamics.

TI  - Detecting Drought-Induced Tree Mortality in Sierra Nevada Forests with Time Series of Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A five-year drought in California led to a significant increase in tree mortality in the Sierra Nevada forests from 2012 to 2016. Landscape level monitoring of forest health and tree dieback is critical for vegetation and disaster management strategies. We examined the capability of multispectral imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in detecting and explaining the impacts of the recent severe drought in Sierra Nevada forests. Remote sensing metrics were developed to represent baseline forest health conditions and drought stress using time series of MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) and a water index. We used Random Forest algorithms, trained with forest aerial detection surveys data, to detect tree mortality based on the remote sensing metrics and topographical variables. Map estimates of tree mortality demonstrated that our two-stage Random Forest models were capable of detecting the spatial patterns and severity of tree mortality, with an overall producer's accuracy of 96.3% for the classification Random Forest (CRF) and a RMSE of 7.19 dead trees per acre for the regression Random Forest (RRF). The overall omission errors of the CRF ranged from 19% for the severe mortality class to 27% for the low mortality class. Interpretations of the models revealed that forests with higher productivity preceding the onset of drought were more vulnerable to drought stress and, consequently, more likely to experience tree mortality. This method highlights the importance of incorporating baseline forest health data and measurements of drought stress in understanding forest response to severe drought.

TI  - Variable Case Detection and Many Unreported Cases of Surgical-Site Infection Following Colon Surgery and Abdominal Hysterectomy in a Statewide Validation
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To assess hospital surgical-site infection (SSI) identification and reporting following colon surgery and abdominal hysterectomy via a statewide external validationMETHODS Infection preventionists (IPs) from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) performed on-site SSI validation for surgical procedures performed in hospitals that voluntarily participated. Validation involved chart review of SSI cases previously reported by hospitals plus review of patient records flagged for review by claims codes suggestive of SSI. We assessed the sensitivity of traditional surveillance and the added benefit of claims-based surveillance. We also evaluated the positive predictive value of claims-based surveillance (ie, workload efficiency).RESULTS Upon validation review, CDPH IPs identified 239 SSIs following colon surgery at 42 hospitals and 76 SSIs following abdominal hysterectomy at 34 hospitals. For colon surgery, traditional surveillance had a sensitivity of 50% (47% for deep incisional or organ/space [DI/OS] SSI), compared to 84% (88% for DI/OS SSI) for claims-based surveillance. For abdominal hysterectomy, traditional surveillance had a sensitivity of 68% (67% for DI/OS SSI) compared to 74% (78% for DI/OS SSI) for claims-based surveillance. Claims-based surveillance was also efficient, with 1 SSI identified for every 2 patients flagged for review who had undergone abdominal hysterectomy and for every 2.6 patients flagged for review who had undergone colon surgery. Overall, CDPH identified previously unreported SSIs in 74% of validation hospitals performing colon surgery and 35% of validation hospitals performing abdominal hysterectomy.CONCLUSIONS Claims-based surveillance is a standardized approach that hospitals can use to augment traditional surveillance methods and health departments can use for external validation.

TI  - Changes on land cover and soil usage: case study in Progreso Hidalgo, Estado de Mexico
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays the decrease in the ongoing profitability of Progreso Hidalgo and its low productive capacity in agriculture have caused changes in land cover and vegetation (agricultural conversion) mainly due to the implementation of agriculture based on greenhouses. The main objective of this research paper is to analyze changes on land cover and land use which took place from 2000-2007 and from 2007-2015 by using land cover and vegetation maps that came up as the result of interdependent visual interpretation of cartographic items, in order to understand the changing process and dynamics of land use in this place. The maps that were obtained faced a process of cartographic validation to know the level of thematic reliability and by means of overlapping them the indexes of change, the indexes of Braimon and change rates were established. According to the results, it can be stated that for the period between 2000 and 2007 there was a decrease in two forms of agriculture (irrigated and rainfed) and in an area of forest. Also, there was a loss of 23.04 ha of agriculture and 16.76 ha of forest. On the other hand, there was an increase in the area intended for greenhouses, with a total of 5.19 ha. For the period between 2007 and 2015, agriculture had a depletion of 18.71 ha, whereas greenhouses have taken up 14.39 ha. The depletion of this area widely used for agriculture has come as the result of the implementation and expansion of new areas designated to greenhouses, which are basically conditioned by environmental factors (protection of crops and soil conditions) as well as socioeconomic factors (government programs, accessibility, amount of production and its commercialization).

TI  - Getting More Power from Your Flowers: Multi-Functional Flower Strips Enhance Pollinators and Pest Control Agents in Apple Orchards
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flower strips are commonly recommended to boost biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services (e.g., pollination and pest control) on farmland. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regards the extent to which they deliver on these aims. Here, we tested the efficacy of flower strips that targeted different subsets of beneficial arthropods (pollinators and natural enemies) and their ecosystem services in cider apple orchards. Treatments included mixes that specifically targeted: (1) pollinators ('concealed-nectar plants'); (2) natural enemies ('open-nectar plants'); or (3) both groups concurrently (i.e., 'multi-functional' mix). Flower strips were established in alleyways of four orchards and compared to control alleyways (no flowers). Pollinator (e.g., bees) and natural enemy (e.g., parasitoid wasps, predatory flies and beetles) visitation to flower strips, alongside measures of pest control (aphid colony densities, sentinel prey predation), and fruit production, were monitored in orchards over two consecutive growing seasons. Targeted flower strips attracted either pollinators or natural enemies, whereas mixed flower strips attracted both groups in similar abundance to targeted mixes. Natural enemy densities on apple trees were higher in plots containing open-nectar plants compared to other treatments, but effects were stronger for non-aphidophagous taxa. Predation of sentinel prey was enhanced in all flowering plots compared to controls but pest aphid densities and fruit yield were unaffected by flower strips. We conclude that 'multi-functional' flower strips that contain flowering plant species with opposing floral traits can provide nectar and pollen for both pollinators and natural enemies, but further work is required to understand their potential for improving pest control services and yield in cider apple orchards.

TI  - Precise Sensor Orientation of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery With the Strip Constraint
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve precise sensor orientation of high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI), ground control points (GCPs) or height models are necessary to remove biases in orientation parameters. However, measuring GCPs is costly, laborious, and time consuming. We cannot even acquire well-defined GCPs in some areas. In this paper, a strip constraint model is established according to the geometric invariance that the biases of image points remain the same in dividing a strip image into standard images. Based on the rational function model and the strip constraint model, a feasible sensor orientation approach for HRSI with the strip constraint is presented. Through the use of the strip constraint, the bias compensation parameters of each standard image in the strip can be solved simultaneously with sparse GCPs. This approach remains effective even when the intermediate standard images in the strip are unavailable. Experimental results of the three ZiYuan-3 data sets show that two GCPs in the first image and two GCPs in the last image are sufficient for the sensor orientation of all the standard images in the strip. An orientation accuracy that is better than 1.1 pixels can be achieved in each standard image. Moreover, the inconsistent errors of tie points between adjacent standard images can also be reduced to less than 0.1 pixel. This result can guarantee that the generated complete digital orthophoto map of the whole strip is geometrically seamless.

TI  - Frontline Science: Nasal epithelial GM-CSF contributes to TLR5-mediated modulation of airway dendritic cells and subsequent IgA response
T2  - JOURNAL OF LEUKOCYTE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flagellin, as a TLR5 agonist, is an established mucosal adjuvant for enhancing mucosal IgA responses by i.n. immunization. Nasal epithelial cells (NECs) are the first sentinel cells to be exposed to antigen and adjuvant in i.n. immunization, and it is suggested that they play an important role in the mucosal adjuvant activity of flagellin. However, the molecular mechanism leading to modulation and the response by flagellin-activated NECs remain unknown. We aimed to identify the soluble mediator(s) from flagellin-activated NECs that modulate the functions of airway dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance subsequent IgA response. In vitro studies showed that compared with the TLR4 agonist LPS, flagellin directly triggered slight up-regulation of CD80 on airway DCs but was insufficient to affect CD86 expression and DC-mediated IgA response. With the use of an in vitro system for culturing mouse primary NECs (mNECs), we demonstrated that flagellin-activated mNECs could functionally modulate airway DCs, which manifested as significant up-regulation of CD80/CD86 and enhancement of IgA production. The functional modulation of airway DCs was dependent on TLR5 activation of mNECs rather than direct TLR5 activation of airway DCs. With the use of cytokine array and antibody-blocking assays, we further identified that GM-CSF, a cytokine secreted from TLR5-activated mNECs, contributes to the activation of mNECs to airway DCs and subsequent IgA enhancement. In vivo blocking experiments confirmed that GM-CSF is an important factor in recombinant flagellin derived from Salmonella typhi (FliC)-induced airway DC activation and antigen-specific IgA enhancement. Our data directly demonstrate that nasal epithelial GM-CSF contributes to TLR5-mediated modulation of airway DCs and a subsequent IgA response.

TI  - Somatic Testing on Gynecological Cancers Improve the Identification of Lynch Syndrome
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Recent data from the literature indicate gynecological cancers (GCs) as sentinel cancers for a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (LS). Clinical approaches to identifying LS have low sensitivity, whereas somatic tests on GCs may be a more sensitive and cost-effective strategy.Methods A series of 78 GCs belonging to 74 patients sent to the Genetic Counselling Service were investigated using microsatellite instability, immunohistochemical expression of mismatch repair (MMR) genes, and MLH1 promoter methylation.Results The presence of microsatellite instability was observed in 67.5% of GCs, and the absence of immunohistochemical expression of at least 1 of the 4 MMR proteins was observed in 71.4% of GCs, showing 96.1% concordance between the methods. Methylation analysis using methylation specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification performed on 35 samples revealed MLH1 promoter hypermethylation in 18 cases (54%). Molecular analysis identified 36 LS carriers of MMR variants (27 pathogenetic and 9 variants of uncertain significance), and, interestingly, 3 LS patients had MLH1 methylated GC. With regard to histological features, LS-related GCs included endocervical cancers and also histological types different from the endometrioid cancers. The presence of peritumoral lymphocytes in GCs was statistically associated with LS tumors.Conclusions Somatic analysis is a useful strategy to distinguish sporadic from LS GC. Our data allow the identification of a subset of LS patients otherwise unrecognized on the basis of clinical or family history alone. In addition, our results indicate that some clinicopathological features including age of GC diagnosis; presence of peritumoral lymphocytes; isthmic, endocervical sites, and body mass index value could be useful criteria to select patients for genetic counseling.

TI  - Use of the ROLL technique for lumpectomy in non-palpable breast lesions
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficiency of radioguided occult lesion localising in non-palpable breast lesions (NPBL) compared to the surgical wire technique.Method: A prospective study was conducted on 161 women with NPBL, of whom 80 marked with the wire (group 1), whereas 81 women were marked with an intratumour injection of Tc-99m-nanocoloid (group 2). The NPBL were located by ultrasound or stereotactic guidance. The lumpectomies were performed following the wire direction in group 1, and with the aid of a gamma-probe in group 2. Surgical margins were then checked, determining the need of extension if the margin was less than 5 mm in the intra-surgical study, and less than 2 mm in the deferred study. Data were collected on the mean number detected by surgery, surgical margins, number of extensions, presence of residual tumour in the extension, second surgeries, lumpectomy volume, as well as total resected volume, volume/tumour ratio, and complications.Results: No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the mean number detected, surgical margins, number of extensions, presence of residual tumour in the extension, second surgeries, lumpectomy volume, total resected volume, volume/tumour ratio or complications. The multivariate analysis showed the determining factors of the resected volume were the radiological guidance technique, as well as the surgeon.Conclusions: The radioguided occult lesion localising technique helps in the detection and resection of NPBL with the same efficiency as the surgical wire, and adds the possibility of sentinel node detection in the same surgery. The determining factors of the resected volume were the radiological guidance technique and the surgeon. (C) 2017 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. y SEMNIM. All rights reserved.

TI  - A mangrove forest map of China in 2015: Analysis of time series Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-1A imagery in Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rapid losses of mangrove forests caused by anthropogenic disturbances and climate change, accurate and contemporary maps of mangrove forests are needed to understand how mangrove ecosystems are changing and establish plans for sustainable management. In this study, a new classification algorithm was developed using the biophysical characteristics of mangrove forests in China. More specifically, these forests were mapped by identifying: (1) greenness, canopy coverage, and tidal inundation from time series Landsat data, and (2) elevation, slope, and intersection-with-sea criterion. The annual mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was found to be a key variable in determining the classification thresholds of greenness, canopy coverage, and tidal inundation of mangrove forests, which are greatly affected by tide dynamics. In addition, the integration of Sentinel-1A VH band and modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) shows great potential in identifying yearlong tidal and fresh water bodies, which is related to mangrove forests. This algorithm was developed using 6 typical Regions of Interest (ROIs) as algorithm training and was run on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform to process 1941 Landsat images (25 Path/Row) and 586 Sentinel-1A images circa 2015. The resultant mangrove forest map of China at 30 m spatial resolution has an overall/users/producer's accuracy greater than 95% when validated with ground reference data. In 2015, China's mangrove forests had a total area of 20,303 ha, about 92% of which was in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangdong, and Hainan Provinces. This study has demonstrated the potential of using the GEE platform, time series Landsat and Sentine-1A SAR images to identify and map mangrove forests along the coastal zones. The resultant mangrove forest maps are likely to be useful for the sustainable management and ecological assessments of mangrove forests in China.

TI  - Extraction of Glacial Lake Outlines in Tibet Plateau Using Landsat 8 Imagery and Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are among the most serious natural hazards in high mountain regions in the last several decades. The recent global warming has caused dramatic glacial lake changes and increased potential GLOF risk, particularly in Tibet Plateau (TP). Thus there is a pressing need to understand area and spatial distribution of glacial lakes at a large scale. Current efforts about glacial lake mapping in TP region is limited by spurious detections in the heterogeneous backgrounds. The nonlocal active contour algorithm, which takes full consideration of the regional heterogeneity in image, has been effectively applied in the field of medical image segmentation, but has not been tested at large scale of glaciated area yet. Moreover, the improved radiometric resolution and geographic coverage from Landsat 8 provides an opportunity to map glacial lakes. This study evaluated the potential of Landsat 8 images on annual glacial lake mapping in TP region which was characterized by various complex water conditions. The Google Earth Engine based cloud computing effectively facilitated the processing of a complete time series of Landsat 8 imagery from 2015 (156 path/rows and approximately 3580 scenes). Characteristics of glacial lake distribution were analyzed from aspects of size classes and elevation. Our results demonstrate that these strategies and methods automatically produce highly reliable glacial lake extents across the entire TP region, and are potentially applicable to other large-scale glacial lake mapping projects.

TI  - Challenges to quantitative applications of Landsat observations for the urban thermal environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the launch of its first satellite in 1972, the Landsat program has operated continuously for more than forty years. A large data archive collected by the Landsat program significantly benefits both the academic community and society. Thermal imagery from Landsat sensors, provided with relatively high spatial resolution, is suitable for monitoring urban thermal environment. Growing use of Landsat data in monitoring urban thermal environment is demonstrated by increasing publications on this subject, especially over the last decade. Urban thermal environment is usually delineated by land surface temperature (LST). However, the quantitative and accurate estimation of LST from Landsat data is still a challenge, especially for urban areas. This paper will discuss the main challenges for urban LST retrieval, including urban surface emissivity, atmospheric correction, radiometric calibration, and validation. In addition, we will discuss general challenges confronting the continuity of quantitative applications of Landsat observations. These challenges arise mainly from the scan line corrector failure of the Landsat 7 ETM+ and channel differences among sensors. Based on these investigations, the concerns are to: (1) show general users the limitation and possible uncertainty of the retrieved urban LST from the single thermal channel of Landsat sensors; (2) emphasize efforts which should be done for the quantitative applications of Landsat data; and (3) understand the potential challenges for the continuity of Landsat observation (i.e., thermal infrared) for global change monitoring, while several climate data record programs being in progress.

TI  - Robust Feature Matching Method for SAR and Optical Images by Using Gaussian-Gamma-Shaped Bi-Windows-Based Descriptor and Geometric Constraint
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the matching reliability of multi-sensor imagery is one of the most challenging issues in recent years, particularly for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images. It is difficult to deal with the noise influence, geometric distortions, and nonlinear radiometric difference between SAR and optical images. In this paper, a method for SAR and optical images matching is proposed. First, interest points that are robust to speckle noise in SAR images are detected by improving the original phase-congruency-based detector. Second, feature descriptors are constructed for all interest points by combining a new Gaussian-Gamma-shaped bi-windows-based gradient operator and the histogram of oriented gradient pattern. Third, descriptor similarity and geometrical relationship are combined to constrain the matching processing. Finally, an approach based on global and local constraints is proposed to eliminate outliers. In the experiments, SAR images including COSMO-Skymed, RADARSAT-2, TerraSAR-X and HJ-1C images, and optical images including ZY-3 and Google Earth images are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides significant improvements in the number of correct matches and matching precision compared with the state-of-the-art SIFT-like methods. Near 1 pixel registration accuracy is obtained based on the matching results of the proposed method.

TI  - Environmental efficiency analysis of the Yangtze River Economic Zone using super efficiency data envelopment analysis (SEDEA) and tobit models
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental efficiency (EE) assessment is an efficient way to evaluate the degree of coordination between economy and environment. Most of the studies measured country- or region-level EEs, while the EE disparities among cities were not well investigated. By incorporating the socioeconomic and remote sensing data, this study measured the static and dynamic EEs of 11 provinces and 131 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Zone (YREZ) in China based on a super efficiency data envelopment analysis (SEDEA) and Malmquist index (MI) methods during 2003-2014. The influential factors of EE imbalance in the YREZ area were explored by the panel tobit model. Results show that large gaps exist in city's environmental efficiency. Cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) show higher EEs than that in the Chengyu Urban Agglomeration (CUA) and Urban Agglomeration in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (UAMR) areas. 15 cities have an EE below 0.2 and only 2 cities above 1 in 2014. The overall average EE exhibited a declining trend during 2003-2014. The number of cities below the average environmental efficiency increased from 70 (53.4%) to 83 (63.4%) over the time period studied. The MI results indicate that management and scale optimization level is the main factor hindering total factor productivity (TFP) growth. The tobit experiment reveals that GDP per capita played a negative impact on EE for most of the YREZ area during 2003-2014. The degree of opening up and industrial structure acted positively on city's environmental efficiency. These conclusions may be a helpful reference for decision makers to coordinate the economy and environment in the YREZ area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Precision estimation of the angular resolution of terrestrial laser scanners
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Angular resolution is the key factor governing the level of identifiable detail within a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point cloud; its uncertainty is related to the sensitivity of distinguishing fine details. The angular resolution was evaluated using the precision of the sampling angle and laser-spot diameter of 14 commercially available TLS systems (both pulse- and phase-based). To verify the effectiveness of the developed angular-resolution precision assessment method, a Riegl VZ-400 and a Surphaser 25HSX TLS were used to scan a sculptured Chinese character. The results show that a Riegl VZ-400 can identify detail better than a Surphaser 25HSX. The proposed assessment method is useful for determining the sensitivity of a TLS when recording finely detailed object features.

TI  - Use of remote sensing data in comprehending an extremely unusual flooding event over southwest Bangladesh
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the natural disasters that affect the livelihood of the people living in the floodplains, like Bangladesh. Here, we proposed to employ SAR satellite images in assessing the flood extent and crop damage with the hydrometeorological observations in the southwestern region of Bangladesh. We observed that the unusual flood of the year 2000 was the combined effect of the huge amount of rainfall in the local areas as well as oncoming water flows from West Bengal in India. During late monsoon of 2000, we experienced that the amount of rainfall was in several magnitudes (250-450%) than the expected over the region. Bangladesh, one of the largest deltas in the world, in general experienced recurrent flood events from the spill of the three mighty rivers in every year. However, we observed that during 2000 the river situation was slightly above the average year conditions and below the moderate level of flood warning conditions, indicating non-riverine flooding. Therefore, we used the SAR images in delineating the flood extent and its damages for the standing aman crops. We observed that the flood extent mapping was having more than 95% agreements with the ground data and crop damage information was about 75% in agreement with the government estimates. The flood extent and crop damage map was found to be useful during the unprecedented flood in the southwestern region of Bangladesh. The use of near real-time SAR imageries thus would be helpful in developing strategies for flood management and disaster mitigation activities and could be utilized on a regular basis.

TI  - MAPPING SOUTH BALTIC NEAR-SHORE BATHYMETRY USING SENTINEL-2 OBSERVATIONS
T2  - POLISH MARITIME RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most promising new applications of remote observation satellite systems (RO) is the near-shore bathymetry estimation based on spaceborn multispectral imageries. In recent years, many experiments aiming to estimate bathymetry in optically shallow water with the use of remote optical observations have been presented. In this paper, optimal models of satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) for relatively turbid waters of the South Baltic Sea were presented. The obtained results were analysed in terms of depth error estimation, spatial distribution, and overall quality. The models were calibrated based on sounding (in-situ) data obtained by a single-beam echo sounder, which was retrieved from the Maritime Office in Gdynia, Poland. The remote observations for this study were delivered by the recently deployed European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite observation system. A detailed analysis of the obtained results has shown that the tested methods can be successfully applied for the South Baltic region at depths of 12-18 meters. However, significant limitations were observed. The performed experiments have revealed that the error of model calibration, expressed in meters (RMSE), equals up to 10-20% of the real depth and is, generally, case dependent. To overcome this drawback, a novel indicator of determining the maximal SDB depth was proposed. What is important, the proposed SDB quality indicator is derived only on the basis of remotely registered data and therefore can be applied operationally.

TI  - Satellite monitoring of cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom frequency in recreational waters and drinking water sources
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHAB) cause extensive problems in lakes worldwide, including human and ecological health risks, anoxia and fish kills, and taste and odor problems. CyanoHABs are a particular concern in both recreational waters and drinking water sources because of their dense biomass and the risk of exposure to toxins. Successful cyanoHAB assessment using satellites may provide an indicator for human and ecological health protection. In this study, methods were developed to assess the utility of satellite technology for detecting cyanoHAB frequency of occurrence at locations of potential management interest. The European Space Agency's MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) was evaluated to prepare for the equivalent series of Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Imagers (OLCI) launched in 2016 as part of the Copernicus program. Based on the 2012 National Lakes Assessment site evaluation guidelines and National Hydrography Dataset, the continental United States contains 275,897 lakes and reservoirs > 1 ha in area. Results from this study show that 5.6% of waterbodies were resolvable by satellites with 300 m single-pixel resolution and 0.7% of waterbodies were resolvable when a three by three pixel (3 x 3-pixel) array was applied based on minimum Euclidian distance from shore. Satellite data were spatially joined to U.S. public water surface intake (PWSI) locations, where single-pixel resolution resolved 57% of the PWSI locations and a 3 x 3 pixel array resolved 33% of the PWSI locations. Recreational and drinking water sources in Florida and Ohio were ranked from 2008 through 2011 by cyanoHAB frequency above the World Health Organization's (WHO) high threshold for risk of 100,000 cells mL(-1). The ranking identified waterbodies with values above the WHO high threshold, where Lake Apopka, FL (99.1%) and Grand Lake St. Marys, OH (83%) had the highest observed bloom frequencies per region. The method presented here may indicate locations with high exposure to cyanoHABs and therefore can be used to assist in prioritizing management resources and actions for recreational and drinking water sources.

TI  - Mapping and assessing crop diversity in the irrigated Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop diversity (e.g. the number of agricultural crop types and the level of evenness in area distribution) in the agricultural systems of arid Central Asia has recently been increased mainly to achieve food security of the rural population, however, not throughout the irrigation system. Site-specific factors that promote or hamper crop diversification after the dissolvent of the Soviet Union have hardly been assessed yet. While tapping the potential of remote sensing, the objective was to map and explain spatial patterns of current crop diversity by the example of the irrigated agricultural landscapes of the Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan. Multi-temporal Landsat and RapidEye satellite data formed the basis for creating annual and multi-annual crop maps for 2010-2012 while using supervised classifications. Applying the Simpson index of diversity (SID) to circular buffers with radii of 1.5 and 5 km elucidated the spatial distribution of crop diversity at both the local and landscape spatial scales. A variable importance analysis, rooted in the conditional forest algorithm, investigated potential environmental and socioeconomic drivers of the spatial patterns of crop diversity. Overall accuracy of the annual crop maps ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 whilst the SID varied between 0.1 and 0.85. The findings confirmed the existence of areas under monocultures as well as of crop diverse patches. Higher crop diversity occurred in the more distal parts of the irrigation system and sparsely settled areas, especially due to orchards. In contrast, in water-secure and densely settled areas, cotton-wheat rotations dominated due to the state interventions in crop cultivation. Distances to irrigation infrastructure, settlements and the road network influenced crop diversity the most. Spatial explicit information on crop diversity per se has the potential to support policymaking and spatial planning towards crop diversification. Driver analysis as exemplified at the study region in Uzbekistan can help reaching the declared policy to increase crop diversity throughout the country and even beyond. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - 18F-FDG PET/CT in preoperative staging of vulvar cancer patients: is it really effective?
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in preoperative staging of vulvar cancer patients.29 pts (69 years, range 51-88) with vulvar cancer (clinical apparent stage I-II), underwent preoperative FDG-PET/CT scan followed by radical vulvectomy and bilateral (or monolateral in case of tumor >2cm from midline) inguinal lymphadenectomy +/- sentinel node biopsy. PET/CT images were analyzed in consensus and correlated to histological findings according to a pt-based and a groinbased analyses. SUVmax of the nodal uptake of each inguinal area (if present) was calculated and correlated to histological findings. The presence of distant metastases was also considered and confirmed.PET/CT analysis in consensus resulted negative at the inguinal LN level in 17 pts (10 true negative, 7 false negative) and positive in 12 pts (7 true positive, 5 false positive). Incidence of LN metastases resulted 48%. On pt-based analysis, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and negative and positive predictive value of PET/CT in detecting LN metastases were 50%, 67%, 59%, 59%, and 58%, respectively. On a groin-based analysis, considering overall 50 LN-sites, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and negative and positive predictive value of PET/CT were 53%, 85%, 73%, 67%, and 76%, respectively. The mean value of SUVmax was 6.1 (range 0.7-16.2) for metastatic nodes, whereas 1.6 (range 0.7 - 5.4) for negative lymph-nodes (P=.007). PET/CT detected pelvic (n=1) and both pelvic/paraortic (n=1) nodal metastases.In clinical early stage vulvar cancer FDG PET/CT showed low sensitivity and moderate specificity for N-staging; therefore, it is not an accurate tool for the nodal status assessment. PET/CT may not be cost-effective in detecting the rare event of distant metastases, but further studies are needed.

TI  - Leaf chlorophyll content as a proxy for leaf photosynthetic capacity
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the accuracy of estimates of forest carbon exchange is a central priority for understanding ecosystem response to increased atmospheric CO2 levels and improving carbon cycle modelling. However, the spatially continuous parameterization of photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax) at global scales and appropriate temporal intervals within terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) remains unresolved. This research investigates the use of biochemical parameters for modelling leaf photosynthetic capacity within a deciduous forest. Particular attention is given to the impacts of seasonality on both leaf biophysical variables and physiological processes, and their interdependent relationships. Four deciduous tree species were sampled across three growing seasons (2013-2015), approximately every 10 days for leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(Leaf)) and canopy structure. Leaf nitrogen (N-Area) was also measured during 2014. Leaf photosynthesis was measured during 2014-2015 using a Li-6400 gas-exchange system, with A-Ci curves to model Vcmax. Results showed that seasonality and variations between species resulted in weak relationships between Vcmax normalized to 25 degrees C (Vcmax(25)) and N-Area (R-2 = 0.62, P < 0.001), whereas Chl(Leaf) demonstrated a much stronger correlation with Vcmax(25) (R-2 = 0.78, P < 0.001). The relationship between Chl(Leaf) and N-Area was also weak (R-2 = 0.47, P < 0.001), possibly due to the dynamic partitioning of nitrogen, between and within photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic fractions. The spatial and temporal variability of Vcmax(25) was mapped using Landsat TM/ETM satellite data across the forest site, using physical models to derive Chl(Leaf). TBMs largely treat photosynthetic parameters as either fixed constants or varying according to leaf nitrogen content. This research challenges assumptions that simple N-Area-Vcmax(25) relationships can reliably be used to constrain photosynthetic capacity in TBMs, even within the same plant functional type. It is suggested that Chl(Leaf) provides a more accurate, direct proxy for Vcmax(25) and is also more easily retrievable from satellite data. These results have important implications for carbon modelling within deciduous ecosystems.

TI  - Associations between multiple green space measures and birth weight across two US cities
T2  - HEALTH & PLACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Several measures of green space exposure have been used in epidemiological research, but their relevance to health, and representation of exposure pathways, remains unclear. Here we examine the relationships between multiple urban green space metrics and associations with term birth weight across two diverse US cities.Methods: We used Vital Statistics data to create a birth cohort from 2005 to 2009 in the cities of Portland, Oregon (n = 90,265) and Austin, Texas (n = 88,807). These cities have similar green space levels but very different population and contextual characteristics. Green space metrics derived from mother's full residential address using multiple buffer distances (50-1000 m) included: Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), % tree cover, % green space, % street tree buffering, and access to parks (using US EPA EnviroAtlas Data). Correlation between green space metrics were assessed and mixed models were used to determine associations with term birth weight, controlling for a comprehensive set of individual and neighborhood factors. City-specific models were run to determine how contextual and population differences affected green space associations with birth weight.Results: We observed moderate to high degrees of correlation between different green space metrics (except park access), with similar patterns between cities. Unadjusted associations demonstrated consistent protective effects of NDVI, % green space, % tree cover, and % street tree buffering for most buffer sizes on birth weight; however, in fully adjusted models most metrics were no longer statistically significant and no clear patterns remained. For example, in Austin the difference in birth weight for the highest versus lowest quartile of % green space within 50 m was 38.3 g (95% CI: 30.4, 46.1) in unadjusted and -1.5 g (98% CI: -8.8, 6.3) in adjusted models compared to 55.7 g (95% CI: 47.9, -63.6) and 12.9 g (95% CI: 4.4, 21.4) in Portland. Maternal race, ethnicity and education had the largest impact on reducing green space and birth weight associations. However, consistent positive associations were observed for the high density areas of both cities using several green space metrics at small buffer distances.Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of understanding the individual and contextual factors that may confound and/or modify green space and birth weight associations.

TI  - A prediction tool incorporating the biomarker S-100B for patient selection for completion lymph node dissection in stage III melanoma
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in sentinel node (SN)-positive melanoma patients is accompanied with morbidity, while about 80% yield no additional metastases in non-sentinel nodes (NSNs). A prediction tool for NSN involvement could be of assistance in patient selection for CLND. This study investigated which parameters predict NSN-positivity, and whether the biomarker S-100B improves the accuracy of a prediction model.Methods: Recorded clinicopathologic factors were tested for their association with NSN-positivity in 110 SN-positive patients who underwent CLND. A prediction model was developed with multivariable logistic regression, incorporating all predictive factors. Five models were compared for their predictive power by calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC). A weighted risk score, 'S-100B Non Sentinel Node Risk Score' (SN-SNORS), was derived for the model with the highest AUC. Besides, a nomogram was developed as visual representation.Results: NSN-positivity was present in 24 (21.8%) patients. Sex, ulceration, number of harvested SNs, number of positive SNs, and S-100B value were independently associated with NSN-positivity. The AUC for the model including all these factors was 0.78 (95%CI 0.69-0.88). SN-SNORS was the sum of scores for the five parameters. Scores of <= 9.5, 10-11.5, and >= 12 were associated with low (0%), intermediate (21.0%) and high (43.2%) risk of NSN involvement.Conclusions: A prediction tool based on five parameters, including the biomarker S-100B, showed accurate risk stratification for NSN-involvement in SN-positive melanoma patients. If validated in future studies, this tool could help to identify patients with low risk for NSN-involvement.

TI  - Urban roughness parameters estimation from globally available datasets for mesoscale modeling in megacities
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Approaches to understanding urban atmospheric phenomena in cities include mesoscale models coupled with urban canopy models (UCMs). To improve the accuracy of these models, urban morphological parameters of higher spatial resolution are necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach to derive 1-km scale urban parameters from globally available satellite images of Landsat 8, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010), and nighttime light (NL) images from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) for use in numerical weather models. Empirical equations derived from linear fittings were used to calculate urban geometric parameter plane area index from satellite images, which were then compared with values derived from real plane area index. To calculate urban geometric parameters average building height, an artificial neural network fitting was conducted. From the basic urban geometric parameters, other necessary urban parameters were derived. After validating the method, a weather simulation was conducted using the derived parameters for Jakarta, Indonesia. Results showed that urban parameters made from global datasets could improve the performance of the single-layer urban canopy model; and these estimated parameters can be used as a substitute when actual building information are lacking.

TI  - Assessing very high resolution UAV imagery for monitoring forest health during a simulated disease outbreak
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research into remote sensing tools for monitoring physiological stress caused by biotic and abiotic factors is critical for maintaining healthy and highly-productive plantation forests. Significant research has focussed on assessing forest health using remotely sensed data from satellites and manned aircraft. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may provide new tools for improved forest health monitoring by providing data with very high temporal and spatial resolutions. These platforms also pose unique challenges and methods for health assessments must be validated before use. In this research, we simulated a disease outbreak in mature Pinus radiata D. Don trees using targeted application of herbicide. The objective was to acquire a time-series simulated disease expression dataset to develop methods for monitoring physiological stress from a UAV platform. Time-series multi-spectral imagery was acquired using a UAV flown over a trial at regular intervals. Traditional field-based health assessments of crown health (density) and needle health (discolouration) were carried out simultaneously by experienced forest health experts. Our results showed that multi-spectral imagery collected from a UAV is useful for identifying physiological stress in mature plantation trees even during the early stages of tree stress. We found that physiological stress could be detected earliest in data from the red edge and near infra-red bands. In contrast to previous findings, red edge data did not offer earlier detection of physiological stress than the near infra-red data. A non-parametric approach was used to model physiological stress based on spectral indices and was found to provide good classification accuracy (weighted kappa = 0.694). This model can be used to map physiological stress based on high-resolution multi -spectral data. (C) 2017 Scion (New Zealand Forest Research Institute).

TI  - AXILLARY LYMPH NODE SONOGRAPHIC FEATURES AND BREAST TUMOR CHARACTERISTICS AS PREDICTORS OF MALIGNANCY: A NOMOGRAM TO PREDICT RISK
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to build a mathematical model to predict the probability of axillary lymph node metastasis based on the ultrasonographic features of axillary lymph nodes and the tumor characteristics. We included 74 patients (75 axillae) with invasive breast cancer who underwent axillary ultrasonography ipsilateral to the tumor and fine-needle aspiration of one selected lymph node. Lymph node pathology results from sentinel lymph node biopsy or surgical dissection were correlated with lymph node ultrasonographic data and with the cytologic findings of fine-needle aspiration. Our mathematical model of prediction risk of lymph node metastasis included only pre-surgical data from logistic regression analysis: lymph node cortical thickness (p = 0.005), presurgical tumor size (p = 0.030), menopausal status (p = 0.017), histologic type (p = 0.034) and tumor location (p = 0.011). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model was 0.848, reflecting an excellent discrimination of the model. This nomogram may assist in the choice of the optimal axillary approach. (E-mail: pakissue@gmail.com) (C) 2017 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

TI  - The phenotype and function of preterm infant monocytes: implications for susceptibility to infection
T2  - JOURNAL OF LEUKOCYTE BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Review on preterm infant monocytes and how developmental immaturity of these cells may contribute to preterm infants' susceptibility to infections. The extreme vulnerability of preterm infants to invasive microbial infections has been attributed to immature innate immune defenses. Monocytes are important innate immune sentinel cells critical in the defense against infection in blood. They achieve this via diverse mechanisms that include pathogen recognition receptor- and inflammasome-mediated detection of microbes, migration into infected tissues, and differentiation into M phi s and dendritic cells, initiation of the inflammatory cascade by free radicals and cytokine/chemokine production, pathogen clearance by phagocytosis and intracellular killing, and the removal of apoptotic cells. Relatively little is known about these cells in preterm infants, especially about how their phenotype adapts to changes in the microbial environment during the immediate postnatal period. Overall, preterm monocytes exhibit attenuated proinflammatory cytokine responses following stimulation by whole bacterial or specific microbial components in vitro. These attenuated cytokine responses cannot be explained by a lack of intracellular signaling events downstream of pattern recognition receptors. This hyporesponsiveness also contrasts with mature, term-like phagocytosis capabilities detectable even in the most premature infant. Finally, human data on the effects of fetal chorioamnionitis on monocyte biology are incomplete and inconsistent. In this review, we present an integrated view of human studies focused on monocyte functions in preterm infants. We discuss how a developmental immaturity of these cells may contribute to preterm infants' susceptibility to infections.

AB  - Comparing Piketty's inequality generating mechanism (r>g) to Marx's circuits of capital underscores a central difference: Marx wanted to replace capitalism while Piketty merely wants to fix it by taxing the rich. Piketty's discussion of slavery reifies human chattel's role in economic history. The failure to exclude the income of supermanagers as a return to labor may lead to an understatement of the inequality Piketty describes. Similarly, a brief mention of the environment without analysis of the wealth obtained from its abuse also understates the growth of inequality.

TI  - Traits of "Lebensphilosophie" in the Thought of Maria Zambrano
T2  - PENSAMIENTO
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the common points between the thought of Maria Zambrano and the so called "Lebensphilosophie", a concept that brings together different philosophical trends emerged in Germany and France in the nineteenth century, and among whose most prominent representatives in Spain were Unamuno and Ortega y Gasset. Some of the traits of "Lebensphilosophie" can also be found in Maria Zambrano, particularly in some of her central categories of thought. The first part of this work addresses this issue; the second part focuses on her notion of piety, which is defined in her work as a knowledge referred to a specific vision of reality, of what is different and of mystery. The author deciphers the meaning of piety according to her notion through repeated references to the legacy of an expanded religious worldview. In this display, a close relationship with some of the main motivations and intellectual concerns of "Lebensphilosophie" is revealed.

TI  - Spectral model for long-term computation of thermodynamics and potential evaporation in shallow wetlands
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Altiplanic wetlands are unique ecosystems located in the elevated plateaus of Chile, Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia. These ecosystems are under threat due to changes in land use, groundwater extractions, and climate change that will modify the water balance through changes in precipitation and evaporation rates. Long-term prediction of the fate of aquatic ecosystems imposes computational constraints that make finding a solution impossible in some cases. In this article, we present a spectral model for long-term simulations of the thermodynamics of shallow wetlands in the limit case when the water depth tends to zero. This spectral model solves for water and sediment temperature, as well as heat, momentum, and mass exchanged with the atmosphere. The parameters of the model (water depth, thermal properties of the sediments, and surface albedo) and the atmospheric downscaling were calibrated using the MODIS product of the land surface temperature. Moreover, the performance of the daily evaporation rates predicted by the model was evaluated against daily pan evaporation data measured between 1964 and 2012. The spectral model was able to correctly represent both seasonal fluctuation and climatic trends observed in daily evaporation rates. It is concluded that the spectral model presented in this article is a suitable tool for assessing the global climate change effects on shallow wetlands whose thermodynamics is forced by heat exchanges with the atmosphere and modulated by the heat-reservoir role of the sediments.

TI  - Spectral analysis of amazon canopy phenology during the dry season using a tower hyperspectral camera and modis observations
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The association between spectral reflectance and canopy processes remains challenging for quantifying large-scale canopy phenological cycles in tropical forests. In this study, we used a tower-mounted hyper spectral camera in an eastern Amazon forest to assess how canopy spectral signals of three species are linked with phenological processes in the 2012 dry season. We explored different approaches to disentangle the spectral components of canopy phenology processes and analyze their variations over time using 17 images acquired by the camera. The methods included linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA); principal component analysis (PCA); continuum removal (CR); and first-order derivative analysis. In addition, three vegetation indices potentially sensitive to leaf flushing, leaf loss and leaf area index (LAI) were calculated: the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the entitled Green-Red Normalized Difference (GRND) index. We inspected also the consistency of the camera observations using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and available phenological data on new leaf production and LAI of young, mature and old leaves simulated by a leaf demography-ontogeny model. The results showed a diversity of phenological responses during the 2012 dry season with related changes in canopy structure and greenness values. Because of the differences in timing and intensity of leaf flushing and leaf shedding, Erisma uncinatum, Manilkara huberi and Chamaecrista xinguensis presented different green vegetation (GV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) SMA fractions; distinct PCA scores; changes in depth, width and area of the 681-nm chlorophyll absorption band; and variations over time in the EVI, GRND and NDVI. At the end of dry season, GV increased for Erisma uncinatum, while NPV increased for Chamaecrista xinguensis. For Manilkara huberi, the NPV first increased in the beginning of August and then decreased toward September with new foliage. Variations in red-edge position were not statistically significant between the species and across dates at the 95% confidence level. The camera data were affected by view-illumination effects, which reduced the SMA shade fraction over time. When MODIS data were corrected for these effects using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC), we observed an EVI increase toward September that closely tracked the modeled LAI of mature leaves (3-5 months). Compared to the EVI, the GRND was a better indicator of leaf flushing because the modeled production of new leaves peaked in August and then declined in September following the GRND closely. While the EVI was more related to changes in mature leaf area, the GRND was more associated with new leaf flushing. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - Object-based change detection using semivariogram indices derived from NDVI images: The environmental disaster in Mariana, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA E AGROTECNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based change detection is a powerful analysis tool for remote sensing data, but few studies consider the potential of temporal semivariogram indices for mapping land-cover changes using object-based approaches. In this study, we explored and evaluated the performance of semivariogram indices calculated from remote sensing imagery, using the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) to detect changes in spatial features related to land cover caused by a disastrous 2015 dam failure in Brazil's Mariana district. We calculated the NDVI from Landsat 8 images acquired before and after the disaster, then created objects by multiresolution segmentation analysis based on post-disaster images. Experimental semivariograms were computed within the image objects and semivariogram indices were calculated and selected by principal component analysis. We used the selected indices as input data to a support vector machine algorithm for classifying change and no-change classes. The selected semivariogram indices showed their effectiveness as input data for object-based change detection analysis, producing highly accurate maps of areas affected by post-dam-failure flooding in the region. This approach can be used in many other contexts for rapid and accurate assessment of such land-cover changes.

TI  - Sea Ice Drift Tracking From Sequential SAR Images Using Accelerated-KAZE Features
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a feature-tracking algorithm for sea ice drift retrieval from a pair of sequential satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The method is based on feature tracking comprising feature detection, description, and matching steps. The approach exploits the benefits of nonlinear multiscale image representations using accelerated-KAZE (A-KAZE) features, a method that detects and describes image features in an anisotropic scale space. We evaluated several state-of-the-art feature-based algorithms, including A-KAZE, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and a very fast feature extractor that computes binary descriptors known as Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) on dual polarized Sentinel-1A C-SAR extra wide swath mode data over the Arctic. The A-KAZE approach outperforms both ORB and SIFT up to an order of magnitude in ice drift. The experimental results showed high relevance of the proposed algorithm for retrieval of ice drift at subkilometre resolution from a pair of SAR images with 100-m pixel size. From this paper, we found that feature tracking using nonlinear scale-spaces is preferable due to its high efficiency against noise with respect to image features compared with other existing feature tracking alternatives that make use of Gaussian or linear scale spaces.

TI  - Biophysical and socio-economic causes for increasing fallow land in Tamil Nadu
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The question of increasing fallow land assumes significance at national and international levels due to the decline in net cultivated area and increasing population. Biophysical characteristics of farmland and socio-economic conditions of farmers are responsible for the increasing fallow. This study was carried out to assess the extent of permanent fallow and identify causes for its increase. High-resolution remote sensing data were used to identify fallow land in two identified blocks of south India, viz. Nanguneri and Kangeyam. The land resources were characterized, and the specific biophysical and socio-economic factors responsible for the increasing fallow land were assessed. Multiple regression analysis was carried out to identify the factors responsible for increasing fallows. Soil parameters such as erosion, soil texture, soil depth and available nitrogen contributed significantly (P>0.05) to the increase in fallow land. The size of farm holding, number of farm fragments, distance from the road in Nanguneri and farm size and the distance to the nearest town in Kangeyam were socio-economic factors that had a strong effect (P>0.01) on increasing the fallow land. Variable importance rankings in random forest analysis indicated that soil erosion and soil pH had the largest impact on the decision to fallow land in Nanguneri and Kangeyam blocks, respectively. Based on biophysical and socio-economic constraints, the land resources of fallow land were evaluated for other alternate land use options and policy measures were suggested.

TI  - Indocyanine Green versus Radiotracer with or without Blue Dye for Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Stage >IB1 Cervical Cancer (>2 cm)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To compare sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in women with cervical cancer stage >IB1 (tumor size >2 cm) using indocyanine green (ICG) versus the standard technique using radioisotope technetium 99m radiocolloid (Tc99(m)) radiotracer with or without blue dye.Design: European multicenter, retrospective observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Setting: Four academic medical centers.Patients: Ninety-five women with stage IB1 cervical cancer (>2 cm) who underwent SLN mapping with Tc99(m) with or without blue dye or ICG and radical hysterectomy.Intervention: The detection rate and bilateral mapping rate were compared between ICG and standard Tc99(m) radiotracer with or without blue dye. Lymphadenectomy was performed, and the false-negative rate was assessed.Measurements and Main Results: Forty-seven patients underwent SLN mapping with Tc99(m) with or without blue dye, and 48 did so with ICG. All patients underwent radical hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy between 2008 and 2016. The overall detection rate of SLN mapping was 91.5% for Tc99(m) with or without blue dye and 100% for ICG. A 91.7% rate of bilateral migration was achieved for ICG, significantly higher than the 66% obtained with Tc99(m) with or without blue dye (p = .025). Nine of the 23 SLN-positive patients (39.1%) were diagnosed exclusively as a result of the ultra staging used to identify micrometastases or isolated tumor cells only.Conclusions: In advanced cervical cancer (stage IB1 >2 cm), the detection rate and bilateral migration rate on real-time fluorescent SLN mapping were higher with ICG than with Tc99(m) radiotracer with or without blue dye. SLN mapping and ultra staging can provide additional information for nodal staging in advanced cervical cancer. In this setting, ICG is a promising tool for mapping, appearing less affected by higher disease stage compared with traditional methods. (C) 2017 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Natural biological control of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> by native egg parasitoids: a multi-year survey in northern Delaware
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Halyomorpha halys (Stal) is a highly polyphagous plant pest native to eastern Asia. Since its accidental introduction to the USA in the mid-1990s, it has spread across North America and caused serious economic damages. Chemical control has been a widely applied management strategy which is not sustainable on a long-term basis. A nine-year survey using sentinel and naturally laid H. halys was conducted to investigate the extent of natural biological control by parasitoids in managed and non-managed landscapes in northern Delaware, USA. Naturally laid egg masses of native pentatomids were collected to compare the resident parasitoid complex to the one attacking H. halys eggs. Mean parasitism rates of sentinel eggs were below 6% in any given year of the survey with a grand mean of 1.79%. Parasitism of naturally laid H. halys eggs was higher than that of sentinel eggs, but there was no significant difference in parasitism between years and the grand mean was 4.31%. Parasitoid species richness on sentinel and naturally laid H. halys eggs was similar but both were lower than the richness on native pentatomid eggs. H. halys eggs were parasitized by eight species in the genera Anastatus, Trissolcus, Telenomus, and Ooencyrtus. The level of parasitism by native egg parasitoids is insufficient to provide long-term control of H. halys. Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead), an Asian egg parasitoid that has been recovered in the USA in several locations since 2014, may be the most promising candidate for long-term biological control of H. halys.

TI  - Temporal Interpolation of Satellite-Derived Leaf Area Index Time Series by Introducing Spatial-Temporal Constraints for Heterogeneous Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) time series are critical for modeling land surface process. In this study, we present an interpolation algorithm to predict the missing data in LAI time series for ecosystems with high within-ecosystem heterogeneity, particularly heterogeneous grasslands. The algorithm is based on spatial-temporal constraints, i.e., the missing data in the LAI time series of a pixel are predicted by the phenological links with other pixels. To address the uncertainties in the construction and selection of reference curves in a heterogeneous landscape, the algorithm constructs a reference dataset for each missing data in the LAI time series from all pixels showing very strong linear phenological links with the target pixel within a region. We also use an iterative process to update the available spatial-temporal constraints. We tested the algorithm with an eight-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product in the Songnen grasslands, Northeast China in 2010 and 2011. The validation dataset was generated based on high quality time series by artificially adding data gaps. The algorithm achieved high overall interpolation accuracies with high coefficient of determination R-2 (>0.9) and low root mean square error (RMSE) (<0.2) in both dry (2010) and wet (2011) years. The algorithm showed advantages in predicting missing data for different seasons and proportions of missing data versus the algorithm that uses regional average LAI curve as a reference. These results suggest that the proposed algorithm could more effectively characterize spatial-temporal constraint information in heterogeneous grasslands for temporal interpolation.

TI  - Geomechanical Characterization and Stability Analysis of the Bedrock Underlying the Costa Concordia Cruise Ship
T2  - ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The shipwreck of the Costa Concordia cruise ship, which ran aground on 13 January 2012 on the northwestern coast of Giglio Island (Italy), required continuous monitoring of the position and movement of the vessel to guarantee the security of workers and rescuers operating around and within the wreck and to support shipwreck removal operations. Furthermore, understanding the geomechanical properties and stability behaviour of the coastal rock mass and rocky seabed underlying the ship was of similar importance. To assess the stability conditions of the ship, a ground-based monitoring system was installed in front of the wreck. The network included a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) device, which was used to perform remote semiautomatic geomechanical characterization of the observed rock mass. Using TLS survey techniques, three main discontinuity sets were identified in the granitic rock mass of Giglio Island. Furthermore, a multibeam bathymetric survey was used to qualitatively characterize the seabed. To integrate the processed TLS data and quantitatively describe the rock mass quality, a subsequent field survey was carried out to provide a rock mass geomechanical evaluation (from very good to moderate quality). Based on the acquired information, kinematic and stability analyses were performed to create a spatial prediction of rock failure mechanisms in the study area. The obtained kinematic hazard index values were generally low; only the plane failure index reached slightly higher values. The general stability of the rock mass was confirmed by the stability analysis, which yielded a high safety factor value (approximately 12).

TI  - Understanding How Low-Level Clouds and Fog Modify the Diurnal Cycle of Orographic Precipitation Using In Situ and Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite orographic precipitation estimates exhibit large errors with space-time structure tied to landform. Observations in the Southern Appalachian Mountains (SAM) suggest that low-level clouds and fog (LLCF) amplify mid-day rainfall via seeder-feeder interactions (SFI) at both high and low elevations. Here, a rainfall microphysics model constrained by fog observations was used first to reveal that fast SFI (2-5 min time-scales) modify the rain drop size distributions by increasing coalescence efficiency among small drops (<0.7 mm diameter), whereas competition between coalescence and filament-only breakup dominates for larger drops (3-5 mm diameter). The net result is a large increase in the number concentrations of intermediate size raindrops in the 0.7-3 mm range and up to a ten-fold increase in rainfall intensity. Next, a 10-year climatology of satellite observations was developed to map LLCF. Combined estimates from CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) and CloudSat products reveal persistent shallower cloud base heights at high elevations enveloping the terrain. The regional cloud top height climatology derived from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) shows high-frequency daytime LLCF over mountain ridges in the warm season shifting to river valleys at nighttime. In fall and winter, LLCF patterns define a cloud-shadow region east of the continental divide, consistent with downwind rain-shadow effects. Optical and microphysical properties from collocated MODIS and ground ceilometers indicate small values of vertically integrated cloud water path (CWP < 100 g/m(2)), optical thickness (COT < 15), and particle effective radius (CER) < 15 m near cloud top whereas surface observed CER similar to 25 m changes to similar to 150 m and higher prior to the mid-day rainfall. The vertical stratification of LLCF microphysics and SFI at low levels pose a significant challenge to satellite-based remote sensing in complex topography.

TI  - Forest sector carbon analyses support land management planning and projects: assessing the influence of anthropogenic and natural factors
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of forest carbon stocks on public lands is critical to maintaining or enhancing carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Acknowledging this, an array of federal regulations and policies have emerged that requires US National Forests to report baseline carbon stocks and changes due to disturbance and management and assess how management activities and forest plans affect carbon stocks. To address these requirements with the best-available science, we compiled empirical and remotely sensed data covering the National Forests (one fifth of the area of US forest land) and analyzed this information using a carbon modeling framework. We demonstrate how integration of various data and models provides a comprehensive evaluation of key drivers of observed carbon trends, for individual National Forests. The models in this framework complement each other with different strengths: the Carbon Calculation Tool uses inventory data to report baseline carbon stocks; the Forest Carbon Management Framework integrates inventory data, disturbance histories, and growth and yield trajectories to report relative effects of disturbances on carbon stocks; and the Integrated Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon Model incorporates disturbance, climate, and atmospheric data to determine their relative impacts on forest carbon accumulation and loss. We report results for several National Forests across the USA and compare their carbon dynamics. Results show that recent disturbances are causing some forests to transition from carbon sinks to sources, particularly in the West. Meanwhile, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen deposition are consistently increasing carbon stocks, partially offsetting declines due to disturbances and aging. Climate variability introduces concomitant interannual variability in net carbon uptake or release. Targeting forest disturbance and post-disturbance regrowth is critical to management objectives that involve maintaining or enhancing future carbon sequestration.

TI  - Three-Year Analysis of Value and Utilization After Development of an Ultrasound-Based Orthopedic Injection Clinic
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sonography is an effective method of diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal conditions, and the use of ultrasound has been shown to improve the accuracy, safety, and efficacy of both therapeutic and diagnostic injections. In 2012, we established an injection clinic at our institution to address our growing need for diagnostic and therapeutic injections. Methods: We performed an analysis of value and utilization following the development of an orthopedic injection clinic. This included an evaluation of the cost of materials, equipment, and training required to develop and run the clinic, and an analysis of the services rendered and relative value units (RVUs) generated over 3 fiscal years (FYs). Results: The cost to develop the clinic was $42,498.30. The cost to run the clinic thereafter was $16.90 to $21.60 per injection. By the end of FY 2012, 60% of providers performed at least 1 injection under ultrasound guidance. Every successive year thereafter, 100% of providers were using ultrasound guidance. In FY 2012, we performed 738 injections, 5.4% used ultrasound guidance and generated a total of 1,786.36 RVUs. In FY 2013, we performed 1,814 injections, 17.6% used ultrasound guidance, and generated a total of 7,224.5 RVUs. In FY 2014, we performed 2,821 injections, 25.2% used ultrasound guidance, and generated 13,786.82 RVUs. RVUs generated solely from ultrasound guided injections were 463.2 (2012), 3,694 (2013), 8,221.8 (2014). Injection accuracy was at least 98%. Average time until injection was 0 days. Conclusion: The cost to start an injection clinic is modest, with the potential for large annual growth and early return on investment, and can generate significant revenue by recapturing RVUs that would otherwise be lost to outside referrals. Furthermore, it helps to increase clinic throughput, maximize services rendered during a single patient visit improving the overall quality of their encounter, expands the clinical practice of our midlevel providers, offloads clinical time for surgical providers, and can help expedite clinical decision making.

TI  - An Integrated Examination of AMSR2 Products Over Ocean
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated processing and analysis are presented for oceanic retrievals of precipitation, sea ice concentration, columnar water vapor and cloud water, sea surface temperature, and near-surface wind from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-2 (AMSR2) sensor. By developing a common algorithmic framework and permitting iterative interaction between historically separate science algorithms, ambiguous and contradictory retrieval results are minimized. The integration also serves to improve each algorithm individually, decreasing reliance on ancillary datasets. Case studies are presented that exemplify both ongoing challenges for these retrievals and potential research uses of such an integrated satellite product. Two cases are presented each for precipitation at high latitudes and marginal sea ice detection, with analysis supplemented by satellite data from CloudSat profiles and Himawari-8 imagery. Detection and retrieval of snowfall remains a challenge, while light rainfall detection can be aided by a variational algorithm. Sea ice concentrations below 20% cause disagreements, but the algorithms otherwise agree well on the sea ice edge. Potential mitigation strategies for ambiguous areas of light rainfall and marginal sea ice are discussed. The analysis demonstrates potential avenues for future algorithm development, but also some physical limitations of remote sensing with the AMSR2 frequencies.

TI  - Fire regimes and forest resilience: alternative vegetation states in the West African tropics
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Terrestrial ecosystems, including tropical forests, are hypothesized to have tipping points beyond which environmental change triggers rapid and radical shifts to novel alternative states.Objective We explored the overarching hypothesis that fire-mediated alternative stable states exist in the semi-deciduous tropical forest zone of Ghana, and that increased fire activity has pushed some forests to a new state in which a novel ecosystem with low tree density is maintained by fire.Methods We combined a 30-year time series of remotely-sensed data with field measurements to assess land cover trends, the effects of fire on forest vegetation, and the reciprocal effects of vegetation change on fire regimes, in four forest reserves. We analyzed precipitation trends to determine if shifts in vegetation and fire regime reflected a shift to a drier climate.Results Two of the reserves experienced forest loss, were impacted by frequent fires, and transitioned to a vegetation community dominated by shrubs and grasses, which was maintained by fire-vegetation feedbacks. The other two reserves experienced less fire, retained higher levels of forest cover, and resisted fire encroachment from surrounding agricultural areas. Precipitation remained relatively stable, suggesting a hysteresis effect in which different vegetation states and fire regimes coexist within a similar climate.Conclusion There is potential for human land use and fire to create novel and persistent non-forest vegetation communities in areas that are climatically suitable for tropical forests. These disturbance-mediated regime shifts should be taken into account when assessing future trajectories of forest landscape change in West Africa.

TI  - Personalized axillary dissection: the number of excised lymph nodes of nodal-positive breast cancer patients has no significant impact on relapse-free and overall survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for the staging of clinically node-negative breast cancer patients (BCP), demonstrating equivalent survival to ALND while resulting in reduced morbidity. ALND has remained the standard of care for the majority of BCP with clinical axillary metastases or metastases found on SLN biopsy. More recently, it is debated whether ALND could be avoided not only in SLN-negative BCP but also in selected SLN-positive disease or even in all patients. This analysis of pN+ BCP shows the impact of the number of excised lymph nodes on RFS and OAS adjusted by age, tumor size, intrinsic subtypes and adjuvant systemic therapy.Methods In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we investigated data from 2992 pN+ primary BCP recruited from 17 participating certified breast cancer centers in Germany between 2001 and 2008 within the BRENDA study group.Results The median number of excised lymph nodes was 17. The number of excised lymph nodes was neither significant for RFS (p = 0.085) nor for OAS (p = 0.285). Adjustments were made for age, tumor size and intrinsic subtypes. The most important significant parameters for RFS were intrinsic subtypes (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p < 0.001) and for OAS age (p < 0.001) and intrinsic subtypes (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in RFS and OAS in any subgroup stratified by the number of excised lymph nodes. Only for T3/T4 tumors, there is a very small significant advantage of ALND for RFS but not for OAS. After adjusting in addition by guideline adherence of adjuvant systemic therapy (AST), intrinsic subtypes and guideline-adherent AST are the most important significant (p < 0.001) parameters for RFS and OAS.Conclusions The number of excised lymph nodes of pN+ BCP neither correlates with RFS nor with OAS. Survival of pN+ BCP is primarily determined by the biology and the guideline-adherent AST based on the corresponding intrinsic subtypes. These results support the omission of a radical ALND at least for pN+ patients scheduled for breast-conserving surgery (not mastectomy), provided they receive whole breast irradiation and guideline-adherent AST.

TI  - PREDICTIVE META-REGRESSIONS RELATING MERCURY TISSUE CONCENTRATIONS OF FRESHWATER PISCIVOROUS MAMMALS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a pollutant of global concern. Sentinel species such as river otter (Lontra canadensis) and mink (Neovison vison) are often used to monitor environmental concentrations in freshwater ecosystems. Tissue total Hg (THg) concentrations are frequently used as biomarkers of exposure. However, there is no comprehensive model relating Hg tissue concentrations in different tissues, making interstudy comparisons challenging. Our objective was to establish conversion factors relating fur, brain, liver, kidney, and muscle THg concentrations using mean concentrations and standard errors reported in the literature. We used data from more than 6000 samples, pooled across 16 studies and 96 sampling sites in North America and Europe. Sixteen regressions were derived for the river otter and mink models, which were statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval and yielded high explained variances. The models were validated using an external data set of individually measured THg tissue concentrations. The validated conversions were used to evaluate the current fur Hg screening guidelines of 20 mu g/g and 30 mu g/g. At both of these fur concentrations, brain concentrations are of concern for altering brain neurochemistry. Wesuggest a more conservative fur Hg screening guideline of 15 mu g/g to protect sensitive furbearers. The conversion factors can be used to predict internal organ THg concentrations from fur measurements, eliminating the need for invasive tissue sampling. (C) 2017 SETAC

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether progressive tinnitus management Level 3 skills education workshops conducted at the Bay Pines and Boston Veterans Affairs hospitals result in consistent use of the presented tinnitus management strategies by patients 1-5 years after completing the workshops.Method: In fiscal year (FY) 2015, the tinnitus workshop follow-up form was mailed to all veterans who completed the Level 3 workshops between FY 2010 and FY 2014. Data were compiled to determine which, if any, of the skills taught in the workshops were being used 1-5 years after completion of the workshops and the impact on quality-of-life indicators.Results: All self-management skills were being utilized up to 5 years postcompletion; therapeutic sound was utilized the most. The majority of patients reported an improved ability to manage reactions to tinnitus and improved quality-of-life indicators. Over 90% of patients from both sites recommended the program to others with tinnitus.Conclusion: The self-management skills taught in the progressive tinnitus management Level 3 workshops are sustained over time even when limited resources prevent the full complement of workshops or the involvement of mental health services. The workshops can also be successfully implemented through remote delivery via videoconferencing (telehealth).

TI  - Noncompliance to a Postoperative Algorithm Using Feeding Readiness Assessments Prolonged Length of Stay at a Pediatric Heart Institute.
T2  - Pediatric quality & safety
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Variable compliance to postoperative feeding algorithms after pediatric cardiac surgery may be associated with suboptimal growth, decreased parental satisfaction, and prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS). Our heart center performed an audit of compliance to a previously introduced postoperative feeding algorithm to guide quality improvement efforts. We hypothesized that algorithm noncompliance would be associated with increased LOS.METHODS: We retrospectively identified children ≤ 3 months admitted for their first cardiac surgery between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016. The algorithm uses objective oral feeding readiness assessments (FRA). At the end of a predefined evaluation period, a "sentinel" FRA score is assigned. The sentinel FRA and FRA trend guide decisions to pursue gastrostomy tube (GT) or oral-only feeds. Among those who reached the sentinel FRA, we defined compliance as ≤ 3 days before pursuing GT or oral-only feeds once indicated by the algorithm.RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were included. Forty-nine complied with the algorithm (71%), and 45 received GT (65.2%). Noncompliers had significantly longer LOS (34 versus 25 days; P = 0.01). Among GT recipients, noncompliers waited 6 additional days for a GT compared with compliers (P ≤ 0.001). Subjective decisions to extend oral feeding trials or await results of a swallow study were associated with algorithm noncompliance.CONCLUSIONS: This audit of compliance to a feeding algorithm after pediatric cardiac surgery highlighted variability of practice, including relying on subjective appraisals of feeding skills over objective FRAs. This variability was associated with increased LOS and can be hypothesis-generating for future quality improvement efforts.

TI  - Apple orchard phenology response to desiccation and temperature changes in Urmia Lake region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural production activities, such as those for various fruits and cereals, play a significant role in the local economy and food security of the Urmia Lake region. In particular, this region has thousands of hectares of apple orchards, which have an important socioeconomic impact on the life of people. Climate and land cover changes over the past several decades threaten the apple orchards phenology (AOP). Recent studies have emphasized the effect of temperature on plant phenology; however, they have overlooked the influence of land cover changes, such as Lake Desiccation, on plant phenology. Meanwhile, how climate change and Lake Desiccation will affect the AOP is still not very well understood. Therefore, in this study, we used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) extracted from remote sensing images acquired by the MODIS sensor spanning from 2003 to 2014, in order to extract the AOP events. Furthermore, we used a random forest regression (RFR) for analyzing the relationship between temperature changes/Lake Desiccation and AOP. The results revealed that EVI is a very useful tool for estimating the AOP with a mean root-mean-square error of 6.25 days. Moreover, there is a linear trend toward the early start of season in this region. The end of season (EOS) and the growing season length have also increased in the areas closer to the lake until 2008. This seems that the delayed EOS in the area closest to Urmia Lake has been associated with the lake microclimate since 2008.

TI  - Morphotectonic controls of groundwater flow regime and relating environmental impacts in Northwest Sinai, Egypt
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequent appearance of some hydroenvironmental hazard features, such as waterlogging and soil salinization along the susceptible zones at Northwest Sinai area (NWSA), has put serious challenges and obstacles for a correct and efficient land use planning of this region, for several decades. Although previous studies have shown that the whole region of Northern Sinai is greatly affected by the tectonic movements associated with the Syrian Arc folding system (SAS), NWSA is barren of any obvious surficial structures. The current work aims to investigate the effect of subsurface tectonic features on the hydrogeologic regime of NWSA.Hydrogeological and remote sensing data were integrated with ground geophysical gravity and magnetic measurements, using the geographic information system. Data integration asserts the role played by buried tectonic features not only in governing the landforms of the upper water-bearing quaternary formations but also in controlling their flow regime.Two major subsurface structures were identified through interpreting the geophysical measurements. A buried domelike structure, dominating the central part of the mapped area, coincides with the radial flow pattern observed on the water table map. At the southwestern corner of the study area, an elevated groundwater level, caused by continuous groundwater accumulation at the discharge boundary, is superimposing a subsurface block-faulted depression. The waterlogging features ( saturation of the soil by groundwater and inundation of local depressions due to rising of water table) dominating the discharge lowlands of NWSA support the conclusion that a buried block-faulted structure exerts a strong influence on the thickness and groundwater flow regime of the shallow quaternary aquifer.

TI  - Application of Dual-Polarimetry SAR Images in Multitemporal InSAR Processing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be used to estimate the dominant scattering mechanism of targets in a stack of SAR data and to improve the performance of SAR interferometric methods for deformation studies. In this letter, we developed a polarimetric form of amplitude difference dispersion (ADD) criterion for time-series analysis of pixels in which interferometric noise shows negligible decorrelation in time and space in small baseline algorithm. The polarimetric form of ADD is then optimized in order to find the optimum scattering mechanism of the pixels, which in turn is used to produce new interferograms with better quality than single-pol SAR interferograms. The selected candidates are then combined with temporal coherency criterion for final phase stability analysis in full-resolution interferograms. Our experimental results derived from a data set of 17 dual polarizations X-band SAR images (HH/VV) acquired by TerraSAR-X shows that using optimum scattering mechanism in the small baseline method improves the number of pixel candidates for deformation analysis by about 2.5 times in comparison with the results obtained from single-channel SAR data. The number of final pixels increases by about 1.5 times in comparison with HH and VV in small baseline analysis. Comparison between persistent scatterer (PS) and small baseline methods shows that with regards to the number of pixels with optimum scattering mechanism, the small baseline algorithm detects 10% more pixels than PS in agricultural regions. In urban regions, however, the PS method identifies nearly 8% more coherent pixels than small baseline approach.

TI  - Spatial Disaggregation of Latent Heat Flux Using Contextual Models over India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of latent heat flux at the agricultural field scale is required for proper water management. The current generation thermal sensors except Landsat-8 provide data on the order of 1000 m. The aim of this study is to test three approaches based on contextual models using only remote sensing datasets for the disaggregation of latent heat flux over India. The first two approaches are, respectively, based on the estimation of the evaporative fraction (EF) and solar radiation ratio at coarser resolution and disaggregating them to yield the latent heat flux at a finer resolution. The third approach is based on disaggregation of the thermal data and estimating a finer resolution latent heat flux. The three approaches were tested using MODIS datasets and the validation was done using the Bowen Ratio energy balance observations at five sites across India. From the validation, it was observed that the first two approaches performed similarly and better than the third approach at all five sites. The third approach, based on the disaggregation of the thermal data, yielded larger errors. In addition to better performance, the second approach based on the disaggregation of solar radiation ratio was simpler and required lesser data processing than the other approaches. In addition, the first two approaches captured the spatial pattern of latent heat flux without introducing any artefacts in the final output.

TI  - Litho-structural analysis of eastern part of Ilesha schist belt, Southwestern Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ilesha schist belt is an excellent example of high strain shear belt within basement complex of southwestern Nigeria which is part of the larger West African Shield. The Ilesha schist belt is characterised by metasediment-metavolcanic, migmatite-gneiss and older granite rocks and the occurrence of a Shear zone which has been traced to and correlated with the central Hoggar Neoproterozoic shear zone as part of the Trans-Saharan Belt. Although the area is interesting in terms of geologic-tectonic setting, however, detailed geological assessment and structural interpretation of features in this area is lacking due accessibility problem.For these reasons we applied principal component analysis (PCA) and band ratio (BR) techniques on Landsat 8 OLI data for lithological discrimination while for structural interpretation, filtering techniques of edge enhancement and edge detection was applied on digital elevation model (DEM) acquired by shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) sensor. The PCA outperform BR for discrimination between quartzite and granite which are the most exposed rock units in the area. For structural interpretation, DEM was used to generate shaded relief model and edge maps which enable detailed structural interpretation. Geologic fieldwork was further conducted to validate structures and units identified from image processing. Based image interpretation, three deformation events were identified. The first event (D1) which is majorly a ductile deformation produced foliations and folds whose axial planes trend in NNE-SSW. The second event (D2) resulted in reactivation and rotation of the D1 structures particularly the folds in the NE-SW. The third event (D3) produced a transgressive deformation starting with the ductile deformation resulting in the development of sigmoidal structures oriented in NE-SW to E-W direction and the brittle deformation occurring at later stages producing fractures oriented in the E-W to NE-SW directions.These results have important implications in terms of regional tectonics and geological mapping as well as in land-use planning and other areas such as hydrogeology or geotechnics.

TI  - Geometrical feature analysis and disaster assessment of the Xinmo landslide based on remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - At 5:39 am on June 24, 2017, a landslide occurred in the village of Xinmo in Maoxian County, Aba Tibet and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture (Sichuan Province, Southwest China). On June 25, aerial images were acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and a digital elevation model (DEM) was processed. Landslide geometrical features were then analyzed. These are the front and rear edge elevation, accumulation area and horizontal sliding distance. Then, the volume and the spatial distribution of the thickness of the deposit were calculated from the difference between the DEM available before the landslide, and the UAV-derived DEM collected after the landslide. Also, the disaster was assessed using high-resolution satellite images acquired before the landslide. These include QuickBird, Pleiades-1 and GF-2 images with spatial resolutions of 0.65 m, 0.70 m, and 0.80 m, respectively, and the aerial images acquired from the UAV after the landslide with a spatial resolution of 0.1 m. According to the analysis, the area of the landslide was 1.62 km(2), and the volume of the landslide was 7.70 +/- 1.46 million m(3). The average thickness of the landslide accumulation was approximately 8 m. The landslide destroyed a total of 103 buildings. The area of destroyed farmlands was 2.53 ha, and the orchard area was reduced by 28.67 ha. A 2-km section of Songpinggou River was blocked and a 2.1-km section of township road No. 104 was buried. Constrained by the terrain conditions, densely populated and more economically developed areas in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River basin are mainly located in the bottom of the valleys. This is a dangerous area regarding landslide, debris flow and flash flood events. Therefore, in mountainous, high-risk disaster areas, it is important to carefully select residential sites to avoid a large number of casualties.

TI  - The Tropical Forests of Conrad and His British Contemporaries, in the Context of Aristotle and T.H. Huxley
T2  - CONRADIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article seeks to explain the prevalence and significance of tropical forest settings and symbolism in the fiction of Joseph Conrad and other authors. It follows up the argument made by Corinne J. Saunders in The Forest of Medieval Romance (1993) that literary forests were once used to explore the concept of unordered matter and to integrate it into the Christian worldview. The contention of this article is that Darwinian ideas and waning religious belief in late-nineteenth-century Britain prompted renewed anxieties about chaotic nature, and thus a revival of the convention of the tangled wilderness. While many Victorian-Edwardian authors conjure fallen but redeemable jungles as a way of staving off the materialism of natural selection and justifying the purposive alternative of Lamarckian evolutionary theory, Conrad's forest is more unorthodox, ambiguous, and far less encouraging.

TI  - The Performance of Airborne C-Band PolInSAR Data on Forest Growth Stage Types Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a classification scheme for forest growth stage types and other cover types using a support vector machine (SVM) based on the Polarimetric SAR Interferometric (PolInSAR) data acquired by Chinese Multidimensional Space Joint-observation SAR (MSJosSAR) system. Firstly, polarimetric, texture, and coherence features were calculated from the PolInSAR data. Secondly, the capabilities of the polarimetric, texture, and coherence features in land use/cover classification were quantified independently through histograms. Following this, the polarimetric features were used for the classification of land use/cover types, followed by a combination of texture and coherence features. Finally, the three classification results were validated against test samples using the confusion matrix. It was shown that, with the integration of texture and coherence features, the producer's accuracy for afforested land, young forest land, medium forest land, and near-mature forest land improved by 6%, 31%, 11%, and 6%, respectively, compared with the former experiment using solely polarimetric features. Our study indicates that the forest and non-forest lands can be discriminated by the polarimetric features, which also play an important role in the separation between afforested land and other forest types as well as medium forest land and near-mature forest land. The texture features further discriminate afforested land and other forest types, while the coherence features obviously improved the separation of young forest land and medium forest land. This paper provides an effective way of identifying various land use/cover types, especially for distinguishing forest growth stages with SAR data. It would be of great interest in regions with frequent cloud coverage and limited optical data for the monitoring of land use/cover types.

TI  - A directed matched filtering algorithm (DMF) for discriminating hydrothermal alteration zones using the ASTER remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduced a different procedure to implement matched filtering algorithm (MF) on the ASTER images to obtain the distribution map of alteration minerals in the northwestern part of the Kerman Cenozoic Magmatic Arc (KCMA). This region contains many areas with porphyry copper mineralization such as Meiduk, Abdar, Kader, Godekolvari, Iju, Serenu, Chahfiroozeh and Parkam. Also argillization, sericitization and propylitization are the most common types of hydrothermal alteration in the area. Matched filtering results were provided for alteration minerals with a matched filtering score, called MF image. To identify the pixels which contain only one material (endmember), an appropriate threshold value should be used to the MF image. The chosen threshold classifies a MF image into background and target pixels. This article argues that the current thresholding process (the choice of a threshold) shows misclassification for MF image. To address the issue, this paper introduced the directed matched filtering (DMF) algorithm in which a spectral signature-based filter (SSF) was used instead of the thresholding process. SSF is a user-defined rule package which contains numeral descriptions about the spectral reflectance of alteration minerals. On the other hand, the spectral bands are defined by an upper and lower limit in SSF filter for each alteration minerals. SSF was developed for chlorite, kaolinite, alunite, and muscovite minerals to map alteration zones. The validation proved that, at first: selecting a contiguous range of ME values could not identify desirable results, second: unexpectedly, considerable frequency of pure pixels was observed in the MF scores less than threshold value. Also, the comparison between DMF results and field studies showed an accuracy of 88.51%.

TI  - Phytoplankton light absorption and the package effect in relation to photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments in the northern tip of Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the variability in the spectral absorption of phytoplankton in Antarctic waters. A large in situ data set comprising phytoplankton pigments and hyperspectral absorption was measured in the northern tip of Antarctic Peninsula during 2013 and 2014 summers at several depths. A proxy of package effect was estimated from the phytoplankton absorption spectra, independently of chlorophyll a. Variations in the concentration of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments were discernible by changes in this metric but not in the chlorophyll a specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton. The fucoxanthin to chlorophyll a ratio correlated positively to package effect due to an increase in cell size of phytoplankton (diatoms) and increasing fucoxanthin content per cell to maximize light harvesting in depth. The package effect was found to covary inversely with photoprotective pigments relative to chlorophyll a, partially due to their contribution to enhance absorption in the blue part of the spectrum. Using a cluster analysis (k-means algorithm) on the phytoplankton absorption spectra, we illustrate the capacity to identify a regular increase in the degree of package effect. This approach can be useful to classify the phytoplankton assemblages in Antarctic waters according to different degrees of pigment packaging, each one related to a specific pigment composition. Our results demonstrate the potential for this classification at different temporal and spatial scales from ocean color satellite data. This should improve our understanding of deviations in global bio-optical algorithms when applied to the Southern Ocean.

TI  - TOPOGRAPHIC ASPECTS IN THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DYNAMIC OF NET RADIATION
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The measurements obtained by remote sensing are influenced by issues related to relief. Based on that, this paper aims to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of the net radiation (Rn), considering the influence of topographic parameters on it, in Edgardia Experimental Farm (FEE). It was used the methodology based on the SEBAL algorithm (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) to estimate the net radiation by orbital images. In order to assess the topographic influence on the computing of net radiation, three methodologies were applied: without topographic correction (RnSem), cosine correction (RnCos) and C correction (RnC). These methodologies were applied on 21 images of the orbital platform Landsat-5/TM, from 1985 up to 2010. Due to the complex relief of the FEE, the cosine correction did not show effectiveness on the attenuation of topographic influence. For the values of RnC, we noticed an average reduction of 5.97% for the standard deviation, relative to the images without correction. These results show the importance of considering the relief, to achieve higher accuracies on the estimation of biophysical parameters with orbital images.

TI  - Diversity of Flea (Siphonaptera) Parasites on Red Foxes <i>(Vulpes vulpes)</i> in Romania
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes (L.)) are widespread across Europe, tolerant of synanthropic ecosystems, and susceptible to diseases potentially shared with humans and other animals. We describe flea fauna on red foxes in Romania, a large, ecologically diverse country, in part because fleas may serve as an indicator of the risk of spillover of vector-borne disease. We found 912 individual fleas of seven species on the 305 foxes assessed, for an infestation prevalence of 49.5%. Mean flea load per fox was 5.8 (range 0-44 fleas), and flea detections were most abundant in fall and early spring. Fleas included generalists (Ctenocephalides canis (Curtis), 32.6% of all fleas), Ct. felis (Bouche , 0.1%), and Pulex irritans L. (29.9%), the fox specialist Chaetopsylla globiceps (Taschenberg, 32.5%), mesocarnivore fleas Paraceras melis Walker (3.2%) and Ch. trichosa Kohaut (1.5%), and the small mammal flea Ctenophthalmus assimilis (Taschenberg, 0.1%), which is rarely or never reported from carnivores. There were significantly more female than male Ch. globiceps, Ct. canis, and Pu. irritans, and these three species were the most broadly distributed geographically. Diversity indices suggested reduced diversity in mountainous areas above 700 m. When compared to other flea studies on foxes in Europe, Romania had flea diversity near the median of reports, which was unexpected given Romania's high ecological diversity. Notably absent prey specialists, compared to other studies, include Archaeopsylla erinacei (Bouche ) and Spilopsyllus cuniculi (Dale). Further studies of possible disease agents in fox fleas could help elucidate possible risks of vector-borne disease in foxes, domestic animals, and humans as well.

TI  - Impacts of Sample Design for Validation Data on the Accuracy of Feedforward Neural Network Classification
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation data are often used to evaluate the performance of a trained neural network and used in the selection of a network deemed optimal for the task at-hand. Optimality is commonly assessed with a measure, such as overall classification accuracy. The latter is often calculated directly from a confusion matrix showing the counts of cases in the validation set with particular labelling properties. The sample design used to form the validation set can, however, influence the estimated magnitude of the accuracy. Commonly, the validation set is formed with a stratified sample to give balanced classes, but also via random sampling, which reflects class abundance. It is suggested that if the ultimate aim is to accurately classify a dataset in which the classes do vary in abundance, a validation set formed via random, rather than stratified, sampling is preferred. This is illustrated with the classification of simulated and remotely-sensed datasets. With both datasets, statistically significant differences in the accuracy with which the data could be classified arose from the use of validation sets formed via random and stratified sampling (z = 2.7 and 1.9 for the simulated and real datasets respectively, for both p < 0.05%). The accuracy of the classifications that used a stratified sample in validation were smaller, a result of cases of an abundant class being commissioned into a rarer class. Simple means to address the issue are suggested.

TI  - Prognostic Value of the Staging System for Eyelid Tumors in the 7th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual
T2  - OPHTHALMIC PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: To determine the prognostic value of the staging criteria for eyelid tumors in the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual and to determine, for each type of eyelid tumor, which AJCC T categories are associated with increased risk of nodal metastasis and thus potential usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy.Methods: Systematic review and analysis of articles found by searching PubMed and Google Scholar using the search terms "AJCC," "eyelid," "carcinoma," and "melanoma."Results: Rates of local recurrence, regional nodal metastasis, and distant metastasis were approximately 7% to 10%, 1% to 9%, and 0% to 0.8%, respectively, for eyelid squamous cell carcinoma; 5% to 6%, 8% to 23%, and 2% and 14%, respectively, for eyelid sebaceous carcinoma; 10%, 10% to 22%, and 19% to 22%, respectively, for eyelid Merkel cell carcinoma (when staged according to the criteria for eyelid carcinoma as opposed to Merkel cell carcinoma), 14%, 5%, and 0%, respectively, for eyelid sweat gland carcinoma; and 2%, 9%, and 6%, respectively, for eyelid melanoma. Overall, the risks of local recurrence and regional nodal and distant metastasis appeared to increase with increasing AJCC T category, although not statistically significant in all studies. Clinical T2b or greater T category was significantly associated with increased risk of nodal metastasis for eyelid squamous cell carcinomas, sebaceous carcinomas, Merkel cell carcinomas (staged with eyelid carcinoma criteria), sweat gland carcinomas, and melanomas. Clinical T3 or greater T category was significantly associated with distant metastasis for eyelid carcinomas and melanomas.Conclusion: For eyelid carcinomas and eyelid melanomas, AJCC 7th edition T category correlates with the risks of nodal and distant metastasis, with T2b and larger tumors associated with highest risk of nodal metastasis. Patients with T2b or larger tumors may be candidates for sentinel lymph node biopsy or close nodal surveillance.

TI  - Corneal Fibroblasts as Sentinel Cells and Local Immune Modulators in Infectious Keratitis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The cornea serves as a barrier to protect the eye against external insults including microbial pathogens and antigens. Bacterial infection of the cornea often results in corneal melting and scarring that can lead to severe visual impairment. Not only live bacteria but also their components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria contribute to the development of inflammation and subsequent corneal damage in infectious keratitis. We describe the important role played by corneal stromal fibroblasts (activated keratocytes) as sentinel cells, immune modulators, and effector cells in infectious keratitis. Corneal fibroblasts sense bacterial infection through Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated detection of a complex of LPS with soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) and LPS binding protein present in tear fluid. The cells then initiate innate immune responses including the expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules that promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells necessary for elimination of the infecting bacteria. Infiltrated neutrophils are activated by corneal stromal collagen and release mediators that stimulate the production of pro-matrix metalloproteinases by corneal fibroblasts. Elastase produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) activates these released metalloproteinases, resulting in the degradation of stromal collagen. The modulation of corneal fibroblast activation and of the interaction of these cells with inflammatory cells and bacteria is thus important to minimize corneal scarring during treatment of infectious keratitis. Pharmacological agents that are able to restrain such activities of corneal fibroblasts without allowing bacterial growth represent a potential novel treatment option for prevention of excessive scarring and tissue destruction in the cornea.

AB  - This review paper focuses on joint modelling and interpretation of electromagnetic data and other geophysical and petrological observables. In particular, integrated geophysical-petrological modelling approaches, where the electrical conductivity and other physical properties of rocks are required to be linked by the common subsurface thermochemical conditions within a self-consistent thermodynamic framework, are reviewed. The paper gives an overview of the main geophysical electromagnetic techniques/data sets employed in lithospheric and mantle imaging including recent advances using satellite data, and an up-to-date summary of the most relevant laboratory experiments regarding the electrical conductivity of upper mantle minerals for various temperature-pressure-water conditions. The sensitivity of electrical conductivity and other geophysical parameters (density, seismic velocities) of mantle rocks to changes in temperature and composition are presented based on a Monte Carlo method parameter exploration. Finally, a case study in Central Tibet is presented where both seismological (long-period surface wave phase velocities) and electromagnetic (magnetotelluric) data-simultaneously including the constraints offered by topography, surface heat flow and mantle xenoliths-have been integrated. The modelling is based on a self-consistent petrological-geophysical thermodynamic framework where mantle properties are calculated as a function of temperature, pressure, and composition. The Tibetan case study offers an excellent opportunity to illustrate the different and complementary sensitivities of the various data sets used and to show how integrated thermochemical models of the lithosphere can help understand settings with a complex tectonic evolution.

TI  - Synergetic Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data for Soil Moisture Mapping at 100 m Resolution
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent deployment of ESA's Sentinel operational satellites has established a new paradigm for remote sensing applications. In this context, Sentinel-1 radar images have made it possible to retrieve surface soil moisture with a high spatial and temporal resolution. This paper presents two methodologies for the retrieval of soil moisture from remotely-sensed SAR images, with a spatial resolution of 100 m. These algorithms are based on the interpretation of Sentinel-1 data recorded in the VV polarization, which is combined with Sentinel-2 optical data for the analysis of vegetation effects over a site in Urgell (Catalunya, Spain). The first algorithm has already been applied to observations in West Africa by Zribi et al., 2008, using low spatial resolution ERS scatterometer data, and is based on change detection approach. In the present study, this approach is applied to Sentinel-1 data and optimizes the inversion process by taking advantage of the high repeat frequency of the Sentinel observations. The second algorithm relies on a new method, based on the difference between backscattered Sentinel-1 radar signals observed on two consecutive days, expressed as a function of NDVI optical index. Both methods are applied to almost 1.5 years of satellite data (July 2015-November 2016), and are validated using field data acquired at a study site. This leads to an RMS error in volumetric moisture of approximately 0.087 m(3)/m(3) and 0.059 m(3)/m(3) for the first and second methods, respectively. No site calibrations are needed with these techniques, and they can be applied to any vegetation-covered area for which time series of SAR data have been recorded.

TI  - Sea ice classification in the Weddell Sea based on scatterometer data
T2  - Advances in Polar Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice type is an important factor for accurately calculating sea ice parameters such as sea ice concentration, sea ice area and sea ice thickness using satellite remote sensing data. In this study, sea ice in the Weddell Sea was classified from scatterometer data by the histogram threshold method and the Spreen model method, and evaluated and validated with the Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt) sea ice type ship-based observations. The results show that the two methods can both distinguish multi-year (MY) ice and first-year (FY) ice during the ice growth season, and that the histogram threshold method has a relatively larger MY ice classification extent than the Spreen model. The classification accuracy of the histogram threshold method is 77.8%, while the Spreen model method accuracy is 80.3% compared with the ship-based observations, thus indicating that the Spreen model method is better for discriminating MY ice from FY ice from scatterometer data. These results provide a basis and reference for further retrieval of long-time sea ice type information for the whole Antarctica.

TI  - Groin sentinel node biopsy and <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET/CT-supported preoperative lymph node assessment in cN0 patients with vulvar cancer currently unfit for minimally invasive inguinal surgery: The GroSNaPET study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The study aims were: 1) to verify the role of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in a subset of patients with clinical N0 (cN0) invasive vulvar cancer (VC) who were still candidates for radical inguinal surgery according to the current guidelines; 2) to investigate whether a preoperative F-18-FDG PET/CT (PET/CT) evaluation could improve the selection of node negative patients.Methods: From July 2013 to July 2016, all patients with VC admitted to our Division were evaluated by standard imaging and clinical exam. Among the patients assessed as cN0 we enrolled those unsuitable for SNB, due to: T > 4 cm, multifocal tumors, complete tumor diagnostic excision, contralateral nodal involvement and local recurrence. A preoperative PET/CT was performed. For each patient surgery included SNB, performed using a combined technique (radiotracer plus blue dye), followed by standard inguino-femoral lymphadenectomy. The reference standard was histopathology.Results: Forty-seven patients entered the study for a total of 73 groins. Histopathology revealed 12 metastatic SNs in 9 groins. No false negative SNs were found (NPV 100%). PET/CT showed a negative predictive value of 93%.Conclusions: Our data suggest that SNB is accurate and safe even in cN0 patients currently excluded from this procedure, providing that a careful preoperative selection is performed. PET/CT allows a reliable assessment of LN status and may be an effective support for the selection of patients who are safe candidates for SNB.

T2  - Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The essential aim of oncology surgery including breast cancer is to remove the malignant tumour and lymph nodes. For many decades, dissection of axillary lymph nodes has been a common part of mastectomy, virtually the only surgical procedure in breast cancer treatment until the 90ies of the previous century. Although mastectomy has been replaced with breast preserving procedures, axillary dissection remained an integral part of the surgery. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has introduced a revolutionary change in breast cancer treatment in the axilla, replacing dissection in clinically negative axillary nodes. As a result, the number of radical procedures in the axilla was significantly limited, as well as the incidence of serious complications that may have a negative impact on the quality of life of the patients. As shown by other studies, the number of dissections can be reduced even further. Subsequent axillary dissection is unnecessary where the sentinel nodes contain only malignant cells, micrometastases and even a limited number of macrometastases. SLNB can also be used in a selected group of patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Key words: breast carcinoma - axillary dissection - sentinel lymph node - micrometastases - macrometastases.

TI  - Identification of Landslide Susceptible Villages around Kalsubai Region, Western Ghats of Maharashtra using Geospatial Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy rainfall triggered landslides are on the rise along the Western Ghats making it a matter of priority to identify landslide-prone areas well in advance. The present effort is aimed at identifying landslide susceptible villages (LSV) around the Kalsubai region of Deccan volcanic province (DVP), Maharashtra, India from 8 weighted landslide parameters- rainfall, slope, lithology, land use and land cover (LULC), soil properties, relative relief, aspect and lineament. These parameters were combined with advanced remote sensing (RS) data and processed in geographical information system (GIS) as well as in image processing software, which are an integral part of geospatial techniques. Out of the total 59 villages, the study identified 9 villages are situated in very high, 13 in high, 12 in moderate, 11 in low and 14 in very low risk zones. Our data reveals incessant heavy rains and steep slopes are the dominant factors in triggering landslides, exacerbated by anthropogenic activity prevalent in the study area. The spatial and non-spatial database created will help to take effective steps in preventing and/or mitigating landslide disasters in the study area. The methodology can be applied to identify other landslide prone areas in a cost effective way.

M3  - Article
AB  - A brief description of the MTVZA-GYa microwave radiometer installed on the Meteor-M No. 2 Russian polar orbiting meteorological satellite is presented. The procedures of bias correction and quality control indispensable in satellite data assimilation are considered. The operational system of global data assimilation by the Hydrometcenter of Russia is briefly described. Results of numerical experiments on the assimilation of MTVZA-GYa observations in six temperature-sensitive channels are given. It is demonstrated that the assimilation of these data significantly improves the accuracy of short-range weather forecasts in the Southern Hemisphere. The effect of the use of MTVZA-GY data in the Northern Hemisphere is neutral.

TI  - GOFP: A Geometric-Optical Model for Forest Plantations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geometric-optical (GO) model suitable for forest plantation (GOFP) is a GO model for forest plantations at the stand level developed in this study based on a four-scale GO model a Geometric-Optical Model for Sloping Terrains-II (GOST2), which simulates the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for natural forest canopies. In most previous GO models, tree distributions are often assumed to meet the Poisson or Neyman model in a forest; therefore, these models are suitable for simulating BRDF for natural forest canopies. However, in forest plantations, tree distributions are proven to meet the hypergeometric model rather than the Poisson or Neyman model at the stand level. GOFP, in which the tree distributions are described using the hypergeometric model, is proposed to simulate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) of forest plantations at the stand level. The area ratios of the four scene components (sunlit foliage, sunlit ground, shaded foliage, and shaded ground) of GOFP compare well with those simulated by a 3-D canopy visualization technique. A comparison is also made against discrete anisotropic radiative transfer, showing that GOFP has the ability to simulate BRF of forest plantations. Another comparison is made against operational land imager and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer surface reflectance, showing that GOFP with the hypergeometric model outperforms GOST2 with the Poisson and Neyman models. The results further show that the differences in BRFs between GOFP and GOST2 pronouncedly increase with the difference between the reflectance of sunlit foliage (RT) and the reflectance of sunlit ground (RG), as well as the distances among trees and the number of crowns in a forest plantation, suggesting that GOFP significantly outperforms GOST2 for simulating BRF of forest plantations.

TI  - Assessment of marine weather forecasts over the Indian sector of Southern Ocean
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean ( SO) is one of the important regions where significant processes and feedbacks of the Earth's climate take place. Expeditions to the SO provide useful data for improving global weather/climate simulations and understanding many processes. Some of the uncertainties in these weather/climate models arise during the first few days of simulation/forecast and do not grow much further. NCMRWF issued real-time five day weather forecasts of mean sea level pressure, surface winds, winds at 500 hPa & 850 hPa and rainfall, daily to NCAOR to provide guidance for their expedition to Indian sector of SO during the austral summer of 2014-2015. Evaluation of the skill of these forecasts indicates possible error growth in the atmospheric model at shorter time scales. The error growth is assessed using the model analysis/reanalysis, satellite data and observations made during the expedition. The observed variability of sub-seasonal rainfall associated with mid-latitude systems is seen to exhibit eastward propagations and are well reproduced in the model forecasts. All cyclonic disturbances including the sub-polar lows and tropical cyclones that occurred during this period were well captured in the model forecasts. Overall, this model performs reasonably well over the Indian sector of the SO in medium range time scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

TI  - Diurnal Air Temperature Modeling Based on the Land Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The air temperature is an essential variable in many applications related to Earth science. Sporadic spatial distribution of weather stations causes a low spatial resolution of measured air temperatures. This study focused on modeling the air diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) based on the land surface temperature (LST) DTC. The air DTC model parameters were estimated from LST DTC model parameters by a regression analysis. Here, the LST obtained from the INSAT-3D geostationary satellite and the air temperature extracted from weather stations were used within the time frame of 4 March 2015 to 22 May 2017 across Iran. Constant parameters of the air DTC model for each weather station were estimated based on an experimental approach over the time period. Results showed these parameters decrease as elevation increases. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for three hours sampling were calculated. The MAE and RMSE ranges were between [0.1, 4] degrees C and [0.1, 3.3] degrees C, respectively. Additionally, 95% of MAEs and RMSEs were less than 2.9 degrees C and 2.4 degrees C values, correspondingly. The range of the mean values of MAEs and RMSEs for a three-hour sampling time were [-0.29, 0.6] degrees C and [2, 2.11] degrees C. The DTC model results showed a meaningful statistical fitting in both air DTCs modeled from LST and weather station-based DTCs. The variability of mean error and RMSE in different land covers and elevation classes were also investigated. In spite of the complex behavior of the environmental variables in the study area, the model error bar did not show significantly biased estimations for various classes. Therefore, the developed model was less sensitive to variations of land covers and elevation changes. It can be conclude that the coefficients of regression between LST and air DTC could model properly the environmental factors.

TI  - Determination of grassland use intensity based on multi-temporal remote sensing data and ecological indicators
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland use intensity and its impact on biodiversity and water pollution is a topic of growing interest. In ecological studies, intensity of use has been assessed by means of three indicators: i) mowing frequency, ii) grazing intensity, and iii) fertilization input. A multidimensional approach is key for the understanding of intensification effects in terrestrial and water ecosystems. Remote sensing is a powerful tool to monitor management indicators. Nevertheless, interdependencies between remote sensing methods and between indicators require new approaches to assess intensity of use. The objective of this study is to monitor ecological indicators of land use intensity based on multispectral imagery using a multidimensional approach. We performed a multi-temporal analysis using a series of RapidEye images within a growing season in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in 2013. We defined mowing frequency classes distinguishing spectral changes between pairs of images. The analysis of the whole image sequence within the growing season helped differentiate grazing intensities. Furthermore, we analysed the suitability of modelled livestock density based on remote sensing derived products to determine fertilizer input. Three grassland management practices were distinguished: i) medium intensive (46%), ii) low intensive (37%), and iii) high intensive (17%). We discuss the combination of high mowing frequency and fields with high grazing intensity to define areas prone to nutrient surpluses. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimation of interrelated indicators of grassland use intensity could be carried out preserving independence between methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the volume, fat mass, and lean mass in both upper and lower limbs measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in melanoma patients with melanoma-related limb lymphedema.Methods and Results: Four hundred thirty-one patients who had undergone surgical treatment with wide local excision and unilateral axillary or inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or complete lymph node dissection participated in a survey, and they underwent clinical examination and measurements of their upper or lower limbs with DXA. Limb lymphedema was diagnosed on the basis of history and characteristic physical findings on the clinical examination. The inter-limb differences in volume, fat mass, and lean mass measured with DXA were categorized as none/mild, moderate, or severe according to reference values (taking handedness into account for the upper limbs). Of the 431 patients, 109 (25%) had clinical melanoma-related limb lymphedema corresponding to 23 (10%) who had undergone axillary nodal surgery and 86 (45%) who had undergone inguinal nodal surgery. The majority of patients developed lymphedema within the first year (90%) after surgery, and the majority of lymphedemas were categorized as mild. The increase in the volume of limbs with lymphedema was primarily due to an increase in fat mass.Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of melanoma-related limb lymphedema. The increase in volume in the limb with lymphedema is primarily due to an increase in fat mass. This increase in fat mass in limbs with lymphedema is important for the understanding of the pathophysiology and may be important in the treatment of lymphedema.

TI  - Evaluation of Remote-Sensing-Based Landslide Inventories for Hazard Assessment in Southern Kyrgyzstan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large areas in southern Kyrgyzstan are subjected to high and ongoing landslide activity; however, an objective and systematic assessment of landslide susceptibility at a regional level has not yet been conducted. In this paper, we investigate the contribution that remote sensing can provide to facilitate a quantitative landslide hazard assessment at a regional scale under the condition of data scarcity. We performed a landslide susceptibility and hazard assessment based on a multi-temporal landslide inventory that was derived from a 30-year time series of satellite remote sensing data using an automated identification approach. To evaluate the effect of the resulting inventory on the landslide susceptibility assessment, we calculated an alternative susceptibility model using a historical inventory that was derived by an expert through combining visual interpretation of remote sensing data with already existing knowledge on landslide activity in this region. For both susceptibility models, the same predisposing factors were used: geology, stream power index, absolute height, aspect and slope. A comparison of the two models revealed that using the multi-temporal landslide inventory covering the 30-year period results in model coefficients and susceptibility values that more strongly reflect the properties of the most recent landslide activity. Overall, both susceptibility maps present the highest susceptibility values for similar regions and are characterized by acceptable to high predictive performances. We conclude that the results of the automated landslide detection provide a suitable landslide inventory for a reliable large-area landslide susceptibility assessment. We also used the temporal information of the automatically detected multi-temporal landslide inventory to assess the temporal component of landslide hazard in the form of exceedance probability. The results show the great potential of satellite remote sensing for deriving detailed and systematic spatio-temporal information on landslide occurrences, which can significantly improve landslide susceptibility and hazard assessment at a regional scale, particularly in data-scarce regions such as Kyrgyzstan.

AB  - The Geological Map of Colombia 2015 summarizes the superficial geological information of Colombia. It is the final product of a process of integration and generalization of the cartographic information of the existing geological maps published by the Colombian Geological Survey complemented by the interpretation of remote sensing imagery of previously unmapped areas. Harmonization was controlled using remote sensing imagery such as Landsat TM and DEM shaded relief images. Geological units represented were defined according to chronostratigraphic-lithostratigraphic criteria. The Geological Map of Colombia 2015 is presented in two sheets and includes: the information of 240 geological maps at a scale of 1:100, 000; updating was carried out by means of consultation of scientific papers published until October 2014; a "Radiometric Dating Catalog of Colombia in ArcGIS and Google Earth" has been attached; across border harmonization and adjustments with the geological maps of Peru and Brazil were the result of feedback discussions during international meetings; the inset Map of the Tectonic Framework of NW South America and the Caribbean was elaborated making use of displacement vectors based on GPS data updated until 2014; the chronostratigraphic units patterns were created with a font, and the map presentation is in Google Earth.

TI  - Urban heat island mesoscale modelling study for the Budapest agglomeration area using the WRF model
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper evaluates modelled surface urban heat island intensities (SUHI) and other essential urban meteorology-related variables for Budapest(located in the central part of the Carpathian Basin). This analysis uses the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with updated surface characteristics databases (i.e. land use, albedo, topography, emissivity, soil texture). The horizontal resolution of the newly created land use-land cover (LULC) database is around 90 m, and is compiled on the basis of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Earth satellite images. The urban classes of the new LULC database have been expanded to five, and the urban parameter spatial distribution database was also created. Three simulations with different LULC databases (MODIS, USGS, and newly defined OSM) are validated against remotely-sensed observations (MODIS Land Surface Temperature Product). The results from the WRF using the OSM (WRF/OSM) show the best agreement with the observations both in rural and urban areas, in contrast to the simulation using the USGS LULC, which results in the greatest errors. According to the mean normalised bias calculations, the WRF/OSM simulation estimates the lowest bias in urban areas, nevertheless, an overestimation can be detected over the surrounding rural areas, which results in weaker SUHI intensity.

TI  - North Africa and Saudi Arabia Day/Night Sandstorm Survey (NASCube)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary platform equipped with the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument provides observations of the Earth every 15 min since 2004. Based on those measurements, we present a new method called North African Sandstorm Survey (NASCube) to: (i) generate day/night remote sensing images in order to detect sandstorms over the Sahara and Saudi Arabia; and (ii) estimate day and night aerosol optical depth (AOD). This paper presents a method to create true color day and night images from the SEVIRI instrument level 1.5 products and the complete operational data processing system to detect sandstorms and quantify the AOD over the desert areas of North Africa and Saudi Arabia. The designed retrieval algorithms are essentially based on the use of artificial neural networks (ANN), which seems to be well suited to this issue. Our methods are validated against two different datasets, namely the Deep Blue NASA moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) product and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) acquisitions located in desert areas. It is shown that NASCube products deliver better estimations for high AOD (>0.2) over land areas than Deep Blue products. The open-public web platform will help researchers to identify, quantify and retrieve the impact of sandstorms over desert regions.

TI  - Assessing the relevance of a multiplexed methodology for proteomic biomarker measurement in the invertebrate species <i>Gammarus fossarum</i>: A physiological and ecotoxicological study
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, a protein sequence database was built specifically for the sentinel non-model species Gommarus fosswurn using a proteogenomics approach. A quantitative multiplexed targeted proteomics assay (using Selected Reaction Monitoring mass spectrometry) was then developed for a fast and simultaneous quantification of dozens of biomarker peptides specific of this freshwater sentinel crustacean species. In order to assess the relevance of this breakthrough methodology in ecotoxicology, the response patterns of a panel of 26 peptides reporting for 20 proteins from the Gammarus fossarum proteome with putative key functional roles (homeostasis, osmoregulation, nutrition, reproduction, molting,...) were recorded through male and female reproductive cycles and after exposure to environmental concentrations of cadmium and lead in laboratory-controlled conditions. Based on these results, we validated the implication of annotated vtg-like peptides in the oogenesis process, and the implication of Na+/K+ ATPase proteins in the molt cycle of organisms. Upon metal (cadmium and lead) contamination, peptides belonging to proteins annotated as involved in antioxidant and detoxification functions, immunity and molting were significantly down-regulated. Overall, this multiplex assay allowed gaining relevant insights upon disruption of different main functions in the sentinel species Gammarus fossarurn. This breakthrough methodology in ecotoxicology offers a valid and high throughput alternative to currently used protocols, paving the way for future practical applications of proteogenomics-derived protein biomarkers in chemical risk assessment and environmental monitoring.

TI  - An integrated remote sensing and GIS approach for monitoring areas affected by selective logging: A case study in northern Mato Grosso, Brazilian Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover disturbances due to processes such as logging and forest fires are a widespread issue especially in the tropics, and have heavily affected forest biomass and functioning in the Brazilian Amazon in the past decades. Satellite remote sensing has played a key role for assessing logging activities in this region; however, there are still remaining challenges regarding the quantification and monitoring of these processes affecting forested lands. In this study, we propose a new method for monitoring areas affected by selective logging in one of the hotspots of Mato Grosso state in the Brazilian Amazon, based on a combination of object-based and pixel-based classification approaches applied on remote sensing data. Logging intensity and changes over time are assessed within grid cells of 300 m x 300 m spatial resolution. Our method encompassed three main steps: (1) mapping forest/non-forest areas through an object-based classification approach applied to a temporal series of Landsat images during the period 2000-2015, (2) mapping yearly logging activities from soil fraction images on the same Landsat data series, and (3) integrating information from previous steps within a regular grid-cell of 300 m x 300 m in order to monitor disturbance intensities over this 15-years period. The overall accuracy of the baseline forest/non-forest mask (year 2000) and of the undisturbed vs disturbed forest (for selected years) were 93% and 84% respectively. Our results indicate that annual forest disturbance rates, mainly due to logging activities, were higher than annual deforestation rates during the whole period of study. The deforested areas correspond to circa 25% of the areas affected by forest disturbances. Deforestation rates were highest from 2001 to 2005 and then decreased considerably after 2006. In contrast, the annual forest disturbance rates show high temporal variability with a slow decrease over the 15-year period, resulting in a significant increase of the ratio between disturbed and deforested areas. Although the majority of the areas, which have been affected by selective logging during the period 2000-2014, were not deforested by 2015, more than 70% of the deforested areas in 2015 had been at least once identified as disturbed forest during that period.

TI  - Rumor Has It: The Adoption of Unverified Information in Conflict Zones
T2  - INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rumors run rite in areas affected by political instability and conflict. Their adoption plays a key role in igniting many forms of violence, including riots ethnic conflict, genocide, and war. While unverified at the time of transmission, some rumors are widely treated as truth, while others are dismissed as implausible or fake. What factors lead individuals to embrace rumors and other forms of unverified information? This article presents a new theoretical framework for understanding individual receptivity to rumors and tests it using original survey data gathered in insurgency-affected areas of Thailand and the Philippines. We find wide variation in rumor adoption, and argue that three factors drive individuals to embrace rumors: worldview, threat perception, and prior exposure. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find no evidence that commonly cited factors including education, income, age, and gender determine individual receptivity to rumors. We also explore the implications of belief in rumors on conflict dynamics. We find that greater receptivity to rumors correlates with the belief that ongoing conflict is intractable. This suggests that rumors can not only help spark political violence, but also impede its resolution. Our findings shed light on the complex interaction between worldview and unverified information in shaping popular beliefs and through them, political contention and competition in conflict areas and beyond.

TI  - Indirect computed tomography lymphangiography with aqueous contrast for evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in dogs with tumors of the head
T2  - VETERINARY RADIOLOGY & ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node evaluation is widely used in human medicine to evaluate the first lymph node(s) to which a tumor drains. Sentinel lymph node biopsy allows avoidance of extensive lymphadenectomies in cases where the sentinel lymph node is negative for metastasis, thereby reducing patient morbidity. It has been shown that regional lymph nodes are not always the sentinel lymph node, thus identification and sampling of sentinel lymph nodes allows for more accurate staging, which is critical for treatment and prognostication in dogs with cancer. The objective of this prospective, pilot study was to determine if indirect computed tomography (CT) lymphangiography with aqueous contrast agent would successfully allow identification of sentinel lymph nodes in dogs with masses on the head. Eighteen dogs underwent CT lymphangiography. The sentinel lymph node was successfully identified within 3 min of contrast injection in 16 dogs (89%). Compression of lymphatic vessels from endotracheal tube ties and/or the patient's own body weight delayed or prevented identification of sentinel lymph nodes in two dogs (11%). Computed tomography lymphangiography with aqueous contrast can be used successfully to rapidly identify sentinel lymph nodes in dogs with masses on the head.

AB  - Aim of the study is to assess the development of a structured sentinel system for oral health data collection at national level. Furthermore, this pilot study aims to investigate the prevalence data on dentinal sensitivity pain collected through a nationwide network of epidemiological sentinels (dental hygienists). Each sentinel was given a specific number of examinees and periodicity of data collection. Overall, 116 adults were recruited from 19 Regions, 42,24% male and 57,76% female, with a mean age of 26. DH result was consistent with literature data, being 45%. All sentinel completed the standard forms and assured a good compliance. The overall good customer satisfaction assures adhesion of the sentinels to the procedure, and the regular data collection. The pilot study proved the effectiveness of a structured nationwide network of epidemiological sentinels (dental hygienists) for oral health data collection at national level. This methodology can be an essential starting point for periodic comparative studies.

TI  - Care patterns and changes in treatment for nonmetastatic breast cancer in 2013-2014 versus 2005: a population-based high-resolution study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on recent trends in patterns of care for breast cancer patients are scarce. This study aims to examine the patterns and trends in the treatment of women with nonmetastatic breast cancer according to major recommended treatment options. A population-based study was carried out in Navarra, Spain, including all women with a primary invasive nonmetastasized breast cancer, diagnosed in 2005 and in 2013-2014. We compared patients' characteristics and treatment patterns between periods. Factors associated with receipt of recommended treatment were examined by multivariate logistic regression. Of the 719 patients included, 90% received guideline-adherent locoregional treatment. Over the two periods, there was an increasing use of sentinel lymph node biopsy as opposed to axillary lymph node dissection as the first axillary procedure. Among women with oestrogen receptor-positive tumours, 96% received endocrine therapy. The proportion of high-risk patients who were treated with chemotherapy increased between the two periods from 65 to 74% (P = 0.079) and, among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive tumours, the receipt of targeted treatment increased from 37 to 72% (P < 0.001). The main factors associated independently with a lower probability of receiving recommended treatment were age 70 years or older for all treatment modalities and comorbidity for locoregional treatment and chemotherapy. The proportion of women with breast cancer who received treatment according to recent European guidelines in Navarra has increased from 2005 to 2013-2014, resulting in a high level of adherence to standard care. Most failures in adherence to these standards are related to older age or comorbidities. Copyright (c) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Water vapor variation and the effect of aerosols in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the annual and seasonal trends in precipitable water vapor (PWV) and surface temperature (T-s) over China from 1979 to 2015, and the relationships between PWV and T-s and between PWV and aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD), using data from radiosonde stations, weather stations and multiple satellite observations. The results revealed a positive PWV trend between 1979 and 1999, and a negative PWV trend between 2000 and 2015. Analysis of the differences in the PWV trend among different stations types showed that the magnitude of the trends were in the order main urban stations > provincial capital stations > suburb stations, suggesting that anthropogenic activities have a strong influence on the PWV trend. The MOD exhibited a significant positive trend in most regions of China from 2005 to 2015 (confidence level 95%). Using spatial correlation analysis, we showed that PWV trend derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations is correlated with T-s, with an annual correlation coefficient of 0.596. In addition, the spatial correlation between PWV and MOD showed a negative relationship, with the highest correlation coefficients of -0.76 and -0.71 observed in mid-eastern China and central northwest China, respectively, suggesting that the increase in AAOD in recent years may be one of the reasons for the decrease in PWV since the 2000s in China.

TI  - Relationship between land use and land classification in the Tahtali Dam Protection Basin (Izmir, Turkey)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The study aims to assess the relationship between land use and the land classes in the Tahtali Dam Protection Basinin terms of sustainable use of natural resources.Methodology: Landsat satellite images were used to determine the current land use and remote sensing was employed to process these images.Results: Land capability classification demonstrates the natural potential of an area. Class I, II, and III lands that are agriculturally important cover 30% of the basin. Class IV, Class VI, and Class VII lands account for 6%, 21%, and 42% of the basin, respectively. Class V lands covered a very small area in the basin and they were not taken into consideration. Finally, Class VIII lands take up merely 1% of the area. The most important kinds of land use in the basin are forests-maquis-garrigues (62.8%), fields (28.7%), residential areas (3.5%), greenhouses (2.3%), and water surface areas (2.7%). There is a mismatch between the land capability classes and their use. In fact, 31% (of 200 km(2)) of the Tahtali Dam Protection Basin is misused. Failure to use lands in line with their capability classes gives rise to certain adverse consequences. Indeed, severe erosion in 54% of the basin takes place in sloping areas devoid of vegetation. Residential waste, intensive use of pesticides-chemical fertilizers, and large industrial facilities pollute dam water and cause land degradation (Pollution levels are higher than that of Class II water).Interpretation: In order to prevent degradation, pollution and siltation of the dam, lands should be used properly and sustainable alternative methods (organic farming, ecological tourism, etc.) should be adopted by locals, particularly the farming industry. An autonomous "Tahtali Dam Protection Basin Forestry Center" that can ensure interinstitutional cooperation should be created.

TI  - Assessing Urban Expansion and Livelihoods in Thailand's Transitional Spaces through Combined Ethnography and Landsat Data
T2  - HUMAN ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Thailand's decentralization policies have sought to increase urbanization and development in provinces outside Bangkok. Provincial and district government offices increasingly formulate local development strategies that draw on concepts of sustainability, livelihood rights, and market opportunities. Despite such local shifts in policy, urban sprawl has created environmental degradation and natural resource competition among different stakeholders within transitional rural-urban spaces. Furthermore, urban expansion has encumbered agrarian families' abilities to fully provision their households. This article examines how agrarian families in Thailand's northeastern (Isaan) region understand state development and urban encroachment and how these families reconfigure livelihood strategies and labor mobilities under changing sociopolitical and environmental conditions. The combination of Landsat data on urban encroachment and ethnographic exploration of the broader shifts in sociopolitical systems that valorize certain economies allows for a deeper understanding of the formation of "permanently temporary" and "continually circular" migration among agrarian households. The article highlights how mobilities research can contribute to informed development policies in Thailand, thereby confronting the low-quality outcomes traditionally associated with peri-urbanization.

TI  - An expert system model for mapping tropical wetlands and peatlands reveals South America as the largest contributor
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important providers of ecosystem services and key regulators of climate change. They positively contribute to global warming through their greenhouse gas emissions, and negatively through the accumulation of organic material in histosols, particularly in peatlands. Our understanding of wetlands' services is currently constrained by limited knowledge on their distribution, extent, volume, interannual flood variability and disturbance levels. We present an expert system approach to estimate wetland and peatland areas, depths and volumes, which relies on three biophysical indices related to wetland and peat formation: (1) long-term water supply exceeding atmospheric water demand; (2) annually or seasonally water-logged soils; and (3) a geomorphological position where water is supplied and retained. Tropical and subtropical wetlands estimates reach 4.7 million km(2) (Mkm(2)). In line with current understanding, the American continent is the major contributor (45%), and Brazil, with its Amazonian interfluvial region, contains the largest tropical wetland area (800,720 km(2)). Our model suggests, however, unprecedented extents and volumes of peatland in the tropics (1.7 Mkm(2) and 7,268 (6,076-7,368) km(3)), which more than threefold current estimates. Unlike current understanding, our estimates suggest that South America and not Asia contributes the most to tropical peatland area and volume (ca. 44% for both) partly related to some yet unaccounted extended deep deposits but mainly to extended but shallow peat in the Amazon Basin. Brazil leads the peatland area and volume contribution. Asia hosts 38% of both tropical peat area and volume with Indonesia as the main regional contributor and still the holder of the deepest and most extended peat areas in the tropics. Africa hosts more peat than previously reported but climatic and topographic contexts leave it as the least peat-forming continent. Our results suggest large biases in our current understanding of the distribution, area and volumes of tropical peat and their continental contributions.

TI  - An Enhanced IT2FCM*Algorithm Integrating Spectral Indices and Spatial Information for Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing Image Clustering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interval type-2 fuzzy c-means (IT2FCM) clustering methods for remote-sensing data classification are based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets and can effectively handle uncertainty of membership grade. However, most of these methods neglect the spatial information when they are used in image clustering. The spatial information and spectral indices are useful in remote-sensing data classification. Thus, determining how to integrate them into IT2FCM to improve the quality and accuracy of the classification is very important. This paper proposes an enhanced IT2FCM* (EnIT2FCM*) algorithm by combining spatial information and spectral indices for remote-sensing data classification. First, the new comprehensive spatial information is defined as the combination of the local spatial distance and attribute distance or membership-grade distance. Then, a novel distance metric is proposed by combining this new spatial information and the selected spectral indices; these selected spectral indices are treated as another dataset in this distance metric. To test the effectiveness of the EnIT2FCM* algorithm, four typical validity indices along with the confusion matrix and kappa coefficient are used. The experimental results show that the spatial information definition proposed here is effective, and some spectral indices and their combinations improve the performance of the EnIT2FCM*. Thus, the selection of suitable spectral indices is crucial, and the combination of soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI(sh)) is the best choice of spectral indices for this method.

TI  - Estimating ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Beijing using a satellite-based geographically and temporally weighted regression model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most time-sequenced ambient air pollution data in China is published through daily Air Quality Index (AQI). However, few studies have used the AQI data to calibrate satellite-based estimates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles no greater than 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) concentrations, partly because the AQI-derived PM2.5 is not continuously obtained each day. Taking Beijing as an example, we developed a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model that can account for spatial and temporal variability in the relationship between the non-continuous AQI-derived PM2.5 and satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD). The GTWR model, which uses AOD values with a 3-km spatial resolution obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), meteorological fields, and land-use variables as predictors, was fitted seasonally from April 2013 to March 2015. After being cross-validated against ground observations, the coefficient of determination (R-2) of PM2.5 ranged from 0.36 to 0.75, with a mean value of 0.58. The GTWR model outperforms several conventional models, such as the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, temporally weighted regression (TWR) model, and linear mixed-effects (LME) model. Compared to a previous spatiotemporal model, the two-stage (LME + GWR) model, the GTWR model may be more feasible. When the number of daily records is >= 5, there is no obvious difference in prediction accuracy (cross-validated R-2 both valued at 0.68). However, when the number of daily records is <5, the GTWR model performs much better (cross-validated R-2 of 0.45 and 0.08). Our estimates indicate that the gridded annual mean PM2.5 values range from 62 to 110 mu g/m(3), denoting strong spatial variation. We find that when available, continuous daily PM2.5 observations can significantly improve model performance and therefore facilitate the estimation of surface PM2.5 concentrations at urban scales. The GTWR model may serve as a reference for studying regions where continuous air pollution data are limited. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determination of sensitive biotopes using GIS: A case study in Mediterranean coastal region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to analyze biotopes sensitivity in Samandag coastal zone in Mediterranean coastal region of Turkey. The study was carried out to map the biotopes using object-oriented classification and to determine sensitivity of these biotopes using rareness and re-establishment ability.Methodology: The study was performed with the help of remote sensing and geographic information system in three stages, i.e., obtaining data, creating map of biotopes using object-oriented classification using ALOS AVNIR imagery assisted with field verification and determination of biotope sensitivity to human disturbance. The sensitivity assessment was based on two parameters, i.e., rareness and reestablishment ability of biotopes.Results: As a result of classification, biotope types were divided as cultural areas and semi-natural areas. Cultural areas; commercial area, settlement (garden houses, multi-story), protected area, agriculture (annual), horticulture, semi-natural areas; forest, bare rock, coastal dunes, dry streambed, river banks, meadow, shrubs, wetland meadow. The results showed that the majority of biotopes in Samandag coastal zone were either very sensitive or sensitive to human disturbance. Agricultural activities and construction on the coastal zone have threatened the wildlife, especially species of Caretta caretta and Chelonia mycias and some of the endangered plants.Interpretation: The wise use of coastal resources and reduction of anthropogenic pressure is possible through planning based on ecological data integrated of social and economic system. only the comprehensive plan of action could help to protect these dunes

TI  - A novel technique for tumor localization and targeted lymphatic mapping in early-stage lung cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate safety and feasibility of navigational bronchoscopy (NB)-guided near-infrared (NIR) localization of small, ill-defined lung lesions and sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) for accurate staging in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods: Patients with known or suspected stage I NSCLC were enrolled in a prospective pilot trial for lesion localization and SLN mapping via NB-guided NIR marking. Successful localization, SLN detection rates, histopathologic status of SLN versus overall nodes, and concordance to initial clinical stage were measured. Ex vivo confirmation of NIR+ SLNs and adverse events were recorded.Results: Twelve patients underwent NB-guided marking with indocyanine green of lung lesions ranging in size from 0.4 to 2.2 cm and located 0.1 to 3 cm from the pleural surface. An NIR+ "tattoo'' was identified in all cases. Ten patients were diagnosed with NSCLC and 9 SLNs were identified in 8 of the 10 patients, resulting in an 80% SLN detection rate. SLN pathologic status was 100% sensitive and specific for overall nodal status with no false-negative results. Despite previous nodal sampling, one patient was found to have metastatic disease in the SLN alone, a 12.5% rate of disease upstaging with NIR SLN mapping. SLN were detectable for up to 3 hours, allowing time for obtaining a tissue diagnosis and surgical resection. There were no adverse events associated with NB-labeling or indocyanine green dye itself.Conclusions: NB-guided NIR lesion localization and SLN identification was safe and feasible. This minimally invasive image-guided technique may permit the accurate localization and nodal staging of early stage lung cancers.

TI  - Hurricane Isaac storm surges off Florida observed by Jason-1 and Jason-2 satellite altimeters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Storm surges can cause damage to properties and loss of life in coastal communities. Thus it is important to enhance our capabilities of observing, understanding and forecasting storm surges for mitigating damage and loss. Previous studies have shown that cross-shelf altimetric sea surface height profiles can be used to determine storm surge features. In this study we combine satellite altimetry with tide-gauge data to study storm surge features off Florida in the Gulf of Mexico during Hurricane Isaac 2012. Satellite observations show a storm surge of about 0.8 m near Cedar Key and Apalachicola decreasing westward and southward in the early morning of August 28, 2012 (UTC), consistent with tide-gauge measurements. Our analysis of satellite data reveals that the storm surge propagates northward from Naples to Cedar Key with a phase speed of 14-16 m/s and a cross-shelf decay scale of 190-220 km, in approximate agreement with the estimates from tide-gauge data. In contrast, an analysis of tide-gauge data reveals that the storm surge propagates westward from Apalachicola to Pensacola with a phase speed of 6-7 m/s and a cross-shelf decay scale of about 85 km. It is further shown that the post-storm sea level variations at these stations are associated with first-mode continental shelf waves. The present study shows that along-shelf altimetric sea surface height profiles can be useful to observe and understand storm surge features as cross-shelf ones demonstrated previously, of importance to improvement of storm surge forecasting. It suggests that a constellation of altimeter missions especially with wide-swath altimetry could be suited to monitor storm surges. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - HREC Members' Personal Values Influence Decision Making in Contentious Cases
T2  - ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article identifies 14 contentious issues faced by Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs). The authors argue that HREC members will respond variably to these issues based on their own fundamental values and worldview. In particular, we propose that personal interpretations of current ethics regulations and HREC members' attitudes to consequentialism, Kantianism, and utilitarianism in some cases affect their responses to contentious research issues. We seek to promote understanding of how personal and professional backgrounds of HREC reviewers influence their approaches to value-laden issues embedded in ethics applications. Taking the form of a literature review, our contribution highlights the need for further exploration of how HREC members make decisions, and what factors influence the outcomes of ethics applications.

TI  - Spatial Scale Gap Filling Using an Unmanned Aerial System: A Statistical Downscaling Method for Applications in Precision Agriculture
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of satellite-borne observations in precision agriculture (PA) are often limited due to the coarse spatial resolution of satellite imagery. This paper uses high-resolution airborne observations to increase the spatial resolution of satellite data for related applications in PA. A new variational downscaling scheme is presented that uses coincident aerial imagery products from "AggieAir", an unmanned aerial system, to increase the spatial resolution of Landsat satellite data. This approach is primarily tested for downscaling individual band Landsat images that can be used to derive normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface soil moisture (SSM). Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate promising capabilities of the downscaling approach enabling effective increase of the spatial resolution of Landsat imageries by orders of 2 to 4. Specifically, the downscaling scheme retrieved the missing high-resolution feature of the imageries and reduced the root mean squared error by 15, 11, and 10 percent in visual, near infrared, and thermal infrared bands, respectively. This metric is reduced by 9% in the derived NDVI and remains negligibly for the soil moisture products.

TI  - Phylogeography of Coxsackievirus A16 Reveals Global Transmission Pathways and Recent Emergence and Spread of a Recombinant Genogroup
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16; Picornaviridae) is an enterovirus (EV) type associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. To investigate the spatial spread of CV-A16, we used viral sequence data sampled during a prospective sentinel surveillance of HFMD in France (2010 to 2014) and phylogenetic reconstruction. A data set of 168 VP1 sequences was assembled with 416 publicly available sequences of various geographic origins. The CV-A16 sequences reported were assigned to two clades, genogroup B and a previously uncharacterized clade D. The time origins of clades B and D were assessed in 1978 (1973 to 1981) and 2004 (2001 to 2007), respectively. The shape of the global CV-A16 phylogeny indicated worldwide cocirculation of genetically distinct virus lineages over time and across geographic regions. Phylogenetic tree topologies and Bayes factor analysis indicated virus migration. Virus transportation events in clade B within Europe and Asia and between countries of the two geographic regions were assessed. The sustained transmission of clade D viruses over 4 years was analyzed at the township level in France and traced back to Peru in South America. Comparative genomics provided evidence of recombination between CV-A16 clades B and D and suggested an intertype recombinant origin for clade D. Time-resolved phylogenies and HFMD surveillance data indicated that CV-A16 persistence is sustained by continuing virus migration at different geographic scales, from community transmission to virus transportation between distant countries. The results showed a significant impact of virus movements on the epidemiological dynamics of HFMD that could have implications for disease prevention.IMPORTANCE Coxsackievirus A16 is one of the most prevalent enterovirus types in hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks reported in Southeast Asia. This study is based on epidemiological and viral data on HFMD caused by CV-A16 in a European country. The phylogeographic data complemented the syndromic surveillance with virus migration patterns between geographic regions in France. The results show how viral evolutionary dynamics and global virus spread interact to shape the worldwide pattern of an EV disease. CV-A16 transmission is driven by movements of infected individuals at different geographic levels: within a country (local dynamics), between neighboring countries (regional dynamics), and between distant countries (transcontinental dynamics). The results are consistent with our earlier data on EV-A71 and confirm the epidemiological interconnection of Asia and Europe with regard to EV infections.

TI  - Uncovering the spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover change and fragmentation of mangroves in the Ca Mau peninsula, Vietnam using multi-temporal SPOT satellite imagery (2004-2013)
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests provide vital ecosystem services for millions of people living in coastal communities. The expansion of aquaculture production and urbanization have been identified as major causes of mangrove clearance in South-East Asia. The Ca Mau peninsula in Vietnam is leading the country in shrimp aquaculture and at the same time, the region is home to the largest remaining mangrove forests. This study aims to assess the spatial and temporal mangrove forest dynamics in Ngoc Hien district in Ca Mau. Land cover change and fragmentation are quantified using remote sensing imagery consisting of a series of SPOT5 scenes from 2004, 2009 and 2013. The results indicate a high turnover of land cover change, with close to half of the mangrove forests being affected by land cover changes between 2004 and 2014. Net changes in mangrove forest are found to average -0.34% annually, characterized by deforestation between 2004 and 2009 and afforestation of between 2009 and 2013. Fragmentation remains a plausible threat; approximately 35.4% of the mangrove forests in Ngoc Hien are part of interior 'core' forests. Forest zones with different regulation regimes play a significant role in shaping the geographic distribution of mangrove forest changes. The insights into recent mangrove forest dynamics facilitate the informed discussion on improving future protection of the mangrove forests abiding anthropogenic pressures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Giant tortoise habitats under increasing drought conditions on Aldabra Atoll-Ecological indicators to monitor rainfall anomalies and related vegetation activity
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aldabra Atoll has the largest population of giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) in the world. As such an important biological resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we calculated the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969-2013. We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought months per year today compared with about two months per year in the 1970s (t = 2.884, p = 0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between 2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra's vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the habitat composition across the atoll.

TI  - Mapping burned areas using dense time-series of Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Complete and accurate burned area data are needed to document patterns of fires, to quantify relationships between the patterns and drivers of fire occurrence, and to assess the impacts of fires on human and natural systems. Unfortunately, in many areas existing fire occurrence datasets are known to be incomplete. Consequently, the need to systematically collect burned area information has been recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which have both called for the production of essential climate variables (ECVs), including information about burned area. In this paper, we present an algorithm that identifies burned areas in dense time-series of Landsat data to produce the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) products. The algorithm uses gradient boosted regression models to generate burn probability surfaces using band values and spectral indices from individual Landsat scenes, lagged reference conditions, and change metrics between the scene and reference predictors. Burn classifications are generated from the burn probability surfaces using pixel-level thresholding in combination with a region growing process. The algorithm can be applied anywhere Landsat and training data are available. For this study, BAECV products were generated for the conterminous United States from 1984 through 2015. These products consist of pixel-level burn probabilities for each Landsat scene, in addition to, annual composites including: the maximum burn probability and a burn classification. We compared the BAECV burn classification products to the existing Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED; 1997-2015) and Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS; 1984-2013) data. We found that the BAECV products mapped 36% more burned area than the GFED and 116% more burned area than MTBS. Differences between the BAECV products and the GFED were especially high in the West and East where the BAECV products mapped 32% and 88% more burned area, respectively. However, the BAECV products found less burned area than the GFED in regions with frequent agricultural fires. Compared to the MTBS data, the BAECV products identified 31% more burned area in the West, 312% more in the Great Plains, and 233% more in the East. Most pixels in the MTBS data were detected by the BAECV, regardless of burn severity. The BAECV products document patterns of fire similar to those in the GFED but also showed patterns of fire that are not well characterized by the existing MTBS data. We anticipate the BAECV products will be useful to studies that seek to understand past patterns of fire occurrence, the drivers that created them, and the impacts fires have on natural and human systems.

TI  - Effects of land use/cover change on regional land surface temperatures: severe warming from drying Toshka lakes, the Western Desert of Egypt
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Toshka depression in the Western Desert of Egypt witnessed big floods in late 1990s from the Nile River behind the High Dam, where many lakes were formed. By the year 2003, the lakes attained their maximum spatial extent. Concurrently, a huge agricultural project was designed to reshape the landscape of the Western Desert and to construct new communities outside the Nile Valley. Unfortunately, after 2003 the lakes started drying and by 2015 most of these lakes were disappeared with symptoms of soil degradation by salt crusting. The main objective of this study was to address the change in land surface temperatures (LST) resulted from the emergence and disappearance of these lakes as the main land use/land cover (LULC) change in the region. The study was performed using remote sensing and GIS. LST data were extracted using 299 satellite images acquired from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product for the period between 2003 and 2015. Results point out to the occurrence of a severe heat island caused by soil degradation due to wetting and drying of desert soils. The mean LST increased from 37.7 degrees C in 2003 to 42.11 degrees C in 2015. The primary outcome of this study is that human interference with the hydrologic setting of this hot desert is the reason for interrupting the land energy fluxes and budget. There are undoubtedly physical, ecological and social impacts of this regional warming.

TI  - Solar resource assessment for rural electrification and industrial development in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico)
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The global solar resource in Mexico should be assessed to develop its industry and rural electrification. The aim of this work is to present an assessment of global solar radiation from meteorological stations and satellite data, which have been validated and provide extensive coverage, in order to develop a methodology to use these data with acceptable accuracy. A statistical method is presented to determinate the global solar resource in the Yucatan Peninsula; linear regression, determination coefficient (R-2) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) have been used. The performance of this correlation shows the accuracy of data used. The relationship between 7 Automatic Meteorological Station (AMSs) of the National Meteorological Service (NMS) of Mexico which belongs to the Comisidn Nacional del Agua (CAN) of Mexico and 6 meteorological stations from the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agricolas y Pecuarias (INIFAP) versus 13 points from Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SMSE) of the Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC) which belongs to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the same geographic position was accomplished. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to perform 13 maps of average solar global resource showing areas and months with high solar global resource. The North and West of the Yucatan Peninsula have a solar resource greater than 5.8 kW h/m(2)/day. The months with the highest resource are April and May. These data open new perspectives for rural electrification and industrial development in the Yucatan Peninsula.

TI  - Site fidelity and movement of a small-bodied fish species, the rainbow darter (<i>Etheostoma caeruleum</i>): Implications for environmental effects assessment
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-bodied fish species are commonly used for the assessment of environmental effects because they are short lived, abundant, and they mature early. Although they are generally considered to be less mobile than larger bodied species, relatively little is known about their movement patterns. In this study, we tagged 3,001 rainbow darters (Etheostoma caeruleum) (76mm) in the upper Grand River of southern Ontario with visible implant alpha tags and elastomers in 3 riffles. Five hundred sixty-five fish were recaptured over 4 recapture events (including spawning and nonspawning periods) over a spatial extent of 1900m. The rainbow darter demonstrated high site fidelity having a median movement of 5m and with 85% staying within the riffle in which they were originally tagged. Most movements occurred during the spawning period, where males moved at a greater frequency and had a tendency to move longer distances (up to 975m). There was also a bias in the direction of movement, which was dependent on the recapture season. Overall, the high site fidelity of the rainbow darter makes it a candidate, sentinel species for the assessment of environmental effects.

TI  - How Does Culture Matter in the Face of Globalization?
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Globalization has made exposure to multiple cultures not only possible, but often necessary and unavoidable. This article focuses on how people react and adapt to increasing globalization and multiculturalism. We posit that reactions to multiculturalism and intercultural contact are not universal and are themselves shaped by cultural experiences. That is, culture provides a frame of reference for reconciling and negotiating the inflow of foreign cultures and peoples. Although exposure to foreign cultures can widen one's worldview, thereby enhancing creativity and reducing prejudice, intercultural contact can also bring about negative exclusionary responses such as aversion, disgust, and defensiveness. We explore how culture and individual differences, such as a belief in racial essentialism, critically shape reactions to intercultural contact. Our discussion sheds light on recent geopolitical and societal shifts that reflect an increased backlash against rising globalization and cultural diversity.

TI  - Probability of vertical transmission of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> estimated from national registry data
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Chlamydia trachomatis colonisation is common in pregnant women, and it has been claimed that mother-to-child transmission may occur in 10%-70% of deliveries. C. trachomatis infections are nevertheless rarely encountered in infants in clinical practice. In order to evaluate the reason for this discrepancy, we designed a nationwide study of the C. trachomatis vertical transmission.Methods Children with a possible C. trachomatis infection were identified from two national health registries in 1996-2011. Copies of the children's medical records were reviewed and maternal serum bank samples obtained during the index pregnancies were analysed for C. trachomatis antibodies. The risk of vertical transmission was calculated using data from two earlier studies in which nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) positivity and seroconversion rates among women in the general population were reported.Results Altogether 206 children had a possible C. trachomatis infection, which represents 0.22 per 1000 live births (95% CI 0.19 to 0.25). The risk of vertical transmission among the estimated 24 901 NAAT-positive mothers was 0.8% (95% CI 0.7 to 0.9). Based on the annual seroconversion rate of maternal antitrachomatis antibodies, the risk of vertical transmission was 1.8% (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0). Altogether 35% of the maternal serum samples obtained in the first trimester of a pregnancy leading to a C. trachomatis infection in the infant were negative, implying that the infection was acquired during pregnancy.Conclusions C. trachomatis infections in infants were rare, with a population-based occurrence of 0.22 per 1000 live births. The risk of vertical transmission of C. trachomatis in the population was <2%, which is significantly lower than reported earlier.

TI  - Effects of temporally external auxiliary data on model-based inference
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the benefits of model-based inference relative to design-based inference is that probability samples are not required which means that models can be constructed using data external to the area of interest. Although "external" usually means spatially or geographically external, it could also be used in the temporal sense that the model is constructed using data whose dates are temporally external to the dates of the data to which the model is applied. This study focuses on assessing the effects of such temporally external application data on model-based inference using remotely sensed auxiliary information. The study area was in Burkina Faso, and the variable of interest was firewood volume (m(3)/ha). A sample of 160 field plots was selected from the population and measured, and auxiliary datasets from Landsat 8 were acquired. Models were fit using weighted least squares; the population mean, mu, was estimated; and the variance of the population mean,Var((mu) over cap), was estimated using both an analytical variance estimator, <(<(V)over cap>)over bar>(mu) over cap (an), and an empirical bootstrap estimator, V (mu) over cap (boot). The estimates, (mu) over cap and (Var) over cap(mu) over cap, were compared for models constructed using calibration and application data of the same date and models constructed using calibration and application data whose dates differed. The primary results were twofold. First, for cases for which the dates of the model calibration and application data were the same, (mu) over cap, <(<(V)over cap>)over bar>(mu) over cap (an), V (mu) over cap (boot) and (Bias) over cap(mu) over cap were similar across datasets. These results suggest that the particular date of the dataset from which the calibration and application data are obtained may be mostly arbitrary assuming the relation between the dependent and independent variables does not change over time. Second, for a model for which the calibration and application data were obtained from temporally different datasets, (mu) over cap (an), V (mu) over cap (boot), and (Bias) over cap(mu) over cap were all greater than when the calibration and application data were not temporally different. Further, the criterion for screening candidate models must be based on estimation of (mu) over cap and (Var) over cap(mu) over cap rather than the model prediction accuracy or goodness of fit. The adverse effects of differing dates for the calibration and application data were exacerbated as the difference in dates increased. Finally, because the temporal differences also affected the analytical variance calculation, the bootstrapping procedure is recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Anatomical Study of Temporal Fat Compartments and its Clinical Application for Temporal Fat Grafting
T2  - AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Low satisfaction rates and severe complications are two major limitations for temporal hollowing augmentation using autologous fat grafting. Despite fat compartments in temporal region have been reported, its clinical applied anatomy for fat grafting have not been the subject of studies that show its benefits objectively and statistically.Objectives: To investigate temporal fat compartments and relative neurovascular structures in cadavers, developing a safe and effective fat grafting technique for temporal hollowing augmentation.Methods: The study was conducted on 8 cadavers (16 temples). The tissue layers, fat compartments, ligaments, and neurovascular structures in the temporal region were analysed. The variables were the number and location of sentinel veins, perforator vessels of the middle temporal vein. Measurements were taken with a digital calliper. Results: Two separate fat compartments, the lateral temporal-cheek fat compartment and lateral orbital fat compartment, were found in the subcutaneous layer, and two separate septum compartments, the upper and lower temporal compartment, were found in the loose areolar tissue layer. One sentinel vein and 1 to 6 perforator vessels were found to travel through the subcutaneous tissue layer, traverse the overlapping tissue layers in the lower temporal septum region, and finally join in the middle temporal vein.Conclusions: The four fat compartments in the temporal region are ideal receipt sites for fat grafting. The medial border of the junction of the hairline and temporal line is a safe and effective cannula entry site for temporal fat grafting. The anterior half of the lower temporal compartment is a "zone of caution" for temporal fat grafting.

TI  - Feature Selection Solution with High Dimensionality and Low-Sample Size for Land Cover Classification in Object-Based Image Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover information extraction through object-based image analysis (OBIA) has become an important trend in remote sensing, thanks to the increasing availability of high-resolution imagery. Segmented objects have a large number of features that cause high-dimension and low-sample size problems in the classification process. In this study, on the basis of a partial least squares generalized linear regression (PLSGLR), we propose a group corrected PLSGLR, known as G-PLSGLR, that aims to reduce the redundancy of object features for land cover identifications. Using Gaofen-2 images, the area of interest was segmented and sampled to generate small sample-size training datasets with 51 object features. The features selected by G-PLSGLR were compared against a guided regularized random forest (GRRF) in metrics of reduction rate, feature redundancy, and accuracy assessment of classification. Three indicators of overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), and producer's accuracy (PA) were applied for accuracy assessment in this paper. The result shows that the G-PLSGLR achieved a reduction rate of 9.27 with a feature redundancy of 0.29, and a value of OA 90.63%. The GRRF achieved a reduction rate of 1.61 with a feature redundancy of 0.42, and a value of OA 85.56%. The PA of each land cover category was more than 95% using features selected by G-PLSGLR, while the PA ranged from 77 to 96% using features selected by GRRF. The UA of G-PLSGLR-selected features ranged from 70 to 80% except for grass land and bare land, which achieved 10% higher UA than GRRF-selected features. The G-PLSGLR method we proposed has the advantages of a large reduction rate, low feature redundancy, and high classification performance, which can be applied in OBIA-based land cover classification.

TI  - Fractures system within Qusaiba shale outcrop and its relationship to the lithological properties, Qasim area, Central Saudi Arabia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The basal Qusaiba hot shale member of Qalibah Formation is considered to be an important source rock in the Paleozoic petroleum system of Saudi Arabia and an exploration target for tight shale as one of the Unconventional resources of petroleum. This work has been carried out to understand the fractures network of Qusaiba shale member in outcrops located to the west of Qusayba' village in Al-Qasim area, Central Saudi Arabia. The main objective of this study is to understand the distribution of natural fractures over different lithological units. Description data sheets were used for the detailed lithological description of Qusaiba shale member on two outcrops. Spot-7 and Landsat ETM+ satellite images were used for lineament mapping and analyses on a regional scale in a GIS environment. Fractures characterization in outcrop-scale was conducted by using linear scanline method. Qusaiba shale member in the study area consists of 5 main lithofacies, divided based on their sedimentary structures and petrographical properties, from base to top in the outcrops, the lithofacies are; fissile shale, very fine-grained micaceous siltstone, bioturbated mudstone, very fine to fine-grained hummocky cross-stratified sandstone, and fine to medium-grained low/high angle cross-stratified sandstone lithofacies. Lineaments interpretation of the Spot-7 and Landsat ETM+ satellite images showed two major directions in the study area; 320 that could be related to Najd fault system and 20 that could be related to the extensional activities which took place after Amar collision. Fractures are much denser in the fissile shale and mudstone lithofacies than sandstones lithofacies, and average spacing is smaller in the fissile shale and mudstone lithofacies than sandstones lithofacies. Lineaments and large-scale fractures are NonStratabound fractures and they deal with the area as one big mechanical unit, but small-scale fractures are Stratabound fractures that propose different mechanical units within Qusaiba shale member in the study area. The fractures network in the study area has a wide range of properties related to fractures density, length, spacing, height, and termination degree. The conceptual multi-scale model divides the fractures in the study area into 4 orders depending on the available data that have been observed from satellite images and field. The multi-scale fractures model that was generated in this study could help to understand the distribution of stratigraphically controlled fractures when integrated with flow simulation models. Overall, this work could have a significant contribution to tight shale exploration plans in the subsurface by providing some knowledge about the fractures mechanical behavior of the lower part of Qusaiba shale member of Qalibah Formation.

TI  - Fusion of SAR, Optical Imagery and Airborne LiDAR for Surface Water Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection and monitoring of surface water and its extent are critical for understanding floodwater hazards. Flooding and undermining caused by surface water flow can result in damage to critical infrastructure and changes in ecosystems. Along major transportation corridors, such as railways, even small bodies of water can pose significant hazards resulting in eroded or washed out tracks. In this study, heterogeneous data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite missions, optical satellite-based imagery and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) were fused for surface water detection. Each dataset was independently classified for surface water and then fused classification models of the three datasets were created. A multi-level decision tree was developed to create an optimal water mask by minimizing the differences between models originating from single datasets. Results show a water classification uncertainty of 4-9% using the final fused models compared to 17-23% uncertainty using single polarization SAR. Of note is the use of a high resolution LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM) to remove shadow and layover effects in the SAR observations, which reduces overestimation of surface water with growing vegetation. Overall, the results highlight the advantages of fusing multiple heterogeneous remote sensing techniques to detect surface water in a predominantly natural landscape.

TI  - Applicability of Earth Observation for Identifying Small-Scale Mining Footprints in a Wet Tropical Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unpredictable climate in wet tropical regions along with the spatial resolution limitations of some satellite imageries make detecting and mapping artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) challenging. The objective of this study was to test the utility of Pleiades and SPOT imagery with an object-based support vector machine (OB-SVM) classifier for the multi-temporal remote sensing of ASM and other land cover including a large-scale mine in the Didipio catchment in the Philippines. Historical spatial data on location and type of ASM mines were collected from the field and were utilized as training data for the OB-SVM classifier. The classification had an overall accuracy between 87% and 89% for the three different imagesPleiades-1A for the 2013 and 2014 images and SPOT-6 for the 2016 image. The main land use features, particularly the Didipio large-scale mine, were well identified by the OB-SVM classifier, however there were greater commission errors for the mapping of small-scale mines. The lack of consistency in their shape and their small area relative to pixel sizes meant they were often not distinguished from other land clearance types (i.e., open land). To accurately estimate the total area of each land cover class, we calculated bias-adjusted surface areas based on misclassification values. The analysis showed an increase in small-scale mining areas from 91,000 m(2)or 0.2% of the total catchment areain March 2013 to 121,000 m(2)or 0.3%in May 2014, and then a decrease to 39,000 m(2)or 0.1%in January 2016.

TI  - On classification of sea surface oil films using TerraSAR-X satellite polarization data
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the results of applying a new polarization method proposed in [28] to identify the type of surface pollution and differentiate between mineral oil films (crude oil and its emulsion and petroleum products) and films of other origin in sea surface radar images. The method is based on calculation of the quantitative characteristics for the ratios of suppression or intensification of scattered radio signals of different physical nature, viz., caused by capillary ripples several centimeters long, or wave breaking. TerraSAR-X satellite coaxial-polarized (VV/HH) SAR images are used. The data for analysis have been collected in areas where spots and slicks of known origin regularly occur, such as oil spills and natural oil seeps in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caspian Sea, and biogenic films in the Caspian Sea. The results of analyzing radar images from the TerraSAR-X satellite with controlled experimental oil emulsion spills in the North Sea are used for comparison. Based on the analysis of ten TerraSAR-X radar polarization images with surface sensing angles greater than 30A degrees, it is shown that this method makes it possible to distinguish between oil spills and slicks formed by natural oil seeps and biogenic films with an accuracy higher than 80% regardless of the observation area.

TI  - Reassessment of the temperature-emissivity separation from multispectral thermal infrared data: Introducing the impact of vegetation canopy by simulating the cavity effect with the SAIL-Thermique model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the use of multispectral thermal imagery to retrieve land surface emissivity and temperature. Conversely to concurrent methods, the temperature emissivity separation (TES) method simply requires single overpass without any ancillary information. This is possible since TES makes use of an empirical relationship that estimates the minimum emissivity epsilon-min from the emissivity spectral contrast captured over several channels, so-called maximum-minimum difference (MMD). In previous studies, the epsilon-min-MMD empirical relationship of TES was calibrated and validated for various sensor spectral configurations, where the proposed calibrations involved single or linearly mixed spectra of emissivity at the leaf or soil level. However, cavity effect should be taken into account at the vegetation canopy level, to avoid an underestimation of emissivity, especially for intermediate vegetation conditions between bare soil and full vegetation cover.The current study aimed to evaluate the performances of the TES method when applied to vegetation canopies with cavity effect. We used the SAIL-Thermique model to simulate a library of emissivity spectra for a wide range of soil and plant conditions, and we addressed the spectral configurations of recent and forthcoming sensors. We obtained good results for calibration and validation over the simulated library, except for full cover canopies because of the TES gray body problem. Consistent with previous studies, the calibration/validation results were better with more channels that capture emissivity spectral contrast more efficiently. Our TES calibrations provided larger epsilon-min values as compared to former studies, especially for intermediate vegetation cover. We explained this trend by the simulated spectral library that involved numerous vegetation canopies with cavity effect, thereby shifting up the epsilon-min-MMD empirical relationship. Consequently, our TES calibration provided larger (respectively lower) estimates of emissivity (respectively radiometric temperature) that were likely to be more realistic as compared to previous calibrations. Finally, SAIL-Thermique simulations permitted to show that increasing Leaf Area Index induced a displacement of the (epsilon-min, MMD) pairs along the empirical relationship. This was consistent with the TES underlying assumption, where any change in epsilon-min induces changes in MMD since epsilon-max is bounded on [0.98-1]. Further investigations should focus on validating the outcomes of the current study against ground-based measurements, and on assessing TES performances when accounting for instrumental and atmospheric perturbations.

Wheat yields, in particular, have already stagnated in many regions and will be further affected by warming temperatures. Despite these challenges, wheat yields can be increased by improving management practices in regions with existing yield gaps. To identify the magnitude and causes of current yield gaps in India, one of the largest wheat producers globally, we produced 30 meter resolution yield maps from 2001 to 2015 across the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), the nation's main wheat belt. Yield maps were derived using a new method that translates satellite vegetation indices to yield estimates using crop model simulations, bypassing the need for ground calibration data. This is one of the first attempts to apply this method to a smallholder agriculture system, where ground calibration data are rarely available. We find that yields can be increased by 11% on average and up to 32% in the eastern IGP by improving management to current best practices within a given district. Additionally, if current best practices from the highest-yielding state of Punjab are implemented in the eastern IGP, yields could increase by almost 110%. Considering the factors that most influence yields, later sow dates and warmer temperatures are most associated with low yields across the IGP. This suggests that strategies to reduce the negative effects of heat stress, like earlier sowing and planting heat-tolerant wheat varieties, are critical to increasing wheat yields in this globally-important agricultural region.

TI  - Comparison of empirical models to estimate monthly mean diffuse solar radiation from measured data: Case study for humid-subtropical climatic region of India
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - This study demonstrates the performance comparison of the models to estimate monthly mean diffuse solar radiation on a horizontal surface for Humid-Subtropical Climatic Region of India. Meteorological data (global and diffuse solar radiation) were observed for the city of Aligarh (27.89 degrees N, 78.08 degrees E) at the Heat Transfer and Solar Energy Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh. The mean global, beam and diffuse solar radiation values for Aligarh were observed as 22.12 MJ/m(2)-day, 14.20 MJ/m(2)-day and 7.92 MJ/m(2)-day respectively. The mean values of sky-clearness index, diffuse fraction and diffusion coefficient were found to be 0.69, 0.37 and 0.25, respectively. The region exhibits abundant potential for solar energy utilization with favorable sky conditions. Diffuse solar radiation models with single input parameter (in the form of global solar radiation) were analyzed for suitability of estimation. 100 typical models were selected from the literature which correlated diffuse fraction (ratio of horizontal diffuse to global solar radiation) to sky clearness index (ratio of global to extraterrestrial solar radiation). The objective here was to find the most precise model which is suitable to assess diffuse solar radiation in the region considered. Distinctive statistical evaluation of the models was performed in terms of well-known statistical indicators. Further, the scaled values of statistical indicators were used to calculate Global Performance Indicator (GPI). GPI of the selected models lied in the range of from -4.2987 to 2.6606 with the highest value representing the best performing model. Models were subsequently ranked in order of descending GPI. This study helps to recognize the significance of diffuse solar radiation models where the absence of required equipment as well as high cost of operation and maintenance represents a critical barrier for measurement. The outcomes of the present study are valuable for locations within the developing countries and remote areas with similar climatic conditions.

TI  - Wade Nobles: The Intellectual as Healer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Healers and priests were archetypes of intellectuals in West Africa that were maintained in the cultural memory of Africans in the diaspora in spite of enslavement. The presence of these intellectuals/healers countered the perpetuation of Eurocentric thought because they were guardians of African culture and possessed the ability to transfer and transmit collective cultural and historical memory. Wade Nobles positions his intellectual work and activism in the tradition of healers that countered European cultural hegemony while affirming the humanity of African people. Nobles defines the Sakhu as the process of illuminating the human spirit and utilizes the various manifestations and functions of the Sakhu to demonstrate the intricate connections between spirituality, science, and culture. Through seeking, defining, unlocking, and applying the Sakhu, Nobles articulates a worldview grounded in African spirituality that attempts to heal the minds and spirits of African people.

TI  - Evapotranspiration by remote sensing: An analysis of the Colorado River Delta before and after the Minute 319 pulse flow to Mexico
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unique hydrologic conditions characterizing riparian ecosystems in dryland (arid and semi-arid) areas help maintain high biodiversity and support high levels of primary productivity compared to associated uplands. In western North America, many riparian ecosystems have been damaged by altered flow regimes (e.g., impoundments and diversions) and over utilization of water resources (e.g., groundwater pumping for agriculture and human consumption). This has led some state and national governments to provide occasional environmental flows to address the declining condition of such riparian systems. In a historic agreement between the United States and Mexico, 130 million cubic meters (mcm) of water was released to the lower Colorado River Delta in Mexico, with the intent to evaluate the hydrological and biological response of the ecosystem. We used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to estimate long term (2000-2014) and short term (pre- and post-pulse; 2013 and 2014) evapotranspiration (ET; used herein as an indicator of plant health) of the delta's riparian corridor. We found the pulse flow helped reverse a decline in ET from 2011 to 2013, with a small, but statistically significant increase in 2014 (P < 0.05). ET was greater than 100 mcm in all years analyzed (even in years without surface flows) and exceeded surface flows in all years except 2000 (result of excess flows following an El Nino cycle in 1997) and 2014 (year of the pulse flow). Based on groundwater salinities and MODIS ET estimates, we estimated groundwater flow into the delta to be 103 mcm. Shallow groundwater salinities in the riparian zone increased from 1.30 g L-1 in the most upstream reach to 2.77 g L-1 in the most downstream reach we measured, partly due to uptake of water by riparian vegetation and partly to intrusion of saline agricultural return flows. The disparity between surface flows and ET can likely be explained by the predominantly phreatophytic plants characterizing the area, which draw water from the aquifer. These results also suggest that the deteriorated condition of vegetation within the riparian zone might not be reversed by a single pulse event and could instead require subsequent pulse flows as a long term strategy to restore vegetation in this riparian ecosystem.

TI  - Greenup and evapotranspiration following the Minute 319 pulse flow to Mexico: An analysis using Landsat 8 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the southwestern U.S., many riparian ecosystems have been altered by dams, water diversions, and other anthropogenic activities. This is particularly true of the Colorado River, where numerous dams and agricultural diversions have affected this water course, especially south of the U.S. Mexico border. In the spring of 2014, 130 million cubic meters of water was released to the lower Colorado River Delta in Mexico. To understand the impact of this pulse flow release on vegetation in the delta's riparian corridor, we analyzed a modified form of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI*) data. We assessed greenup during the growing period and estimated actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for the period prior to (yr. 2013) and following (i.e., yr. 2014 and 2015) the pulse flow. We found a significant increase in NDVI* from 2013 to 2014 (P < 0.05) and a decrease from 2014 to 2015; however, 2015 levels were still significantly higher than in 2013. ETa was also higher in 2014 vs. 2013, with an estimated 74.5 million cubic meters in 2013 and 88.9 in 2014. The most intense greening occurred in the zone of inundation but also extended into the non-flooded part of the riparian zone, indicating replenishment of groundwater. These findings suggest the peak response by vegetation to the flow lasted about one year, followed by a decrease in NDVI*. As a long term solution to the declining condition of vegetation, additional pulse releases are likely needed for restoration and survival of riparian plant communities in the Colorado River Delta.

TI  - Provider and Site-Level Determinants of Testosterone Prescribing in the Veterans Healthcare System
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Testosterone prescribing rates have increased substantially in the past decade. However, little is known about the context within which such prescriptions occur.Objective: We evaluated provider-and site-level determinants of receipt of testosterone and of guideline-concordant testosterone prescribing.Design: This study was cross-sectional in design.Setting: This study was conducted at the Veterans Health Administration (VA).Participants: Study participants were a national cohort of male patients who had received at least one outpatient prescription within the VA during fiscal year (FY) 2008 to FY 2012. A total of 38,648 providers and 130 stations were associated with these patients.Main Outcome Measure: This study measured receipt of testosterone and guideline-concordant testosterone prescribing.Results: Providers ranging in age from 31 to 60 years, with less experience in the VA [all adjusted odds ratio (AOR), <2; P < 0.01] and credentialed as medical doctors in endocrinology (AOR, 3.88; P < 0.01) and urology (AOR, 1.48; P < 0.01) were more likely to prescribe testosterone compared with older providers, providers of longer VA tenure, and primary care providers, respectively. Sites located in the West compared with the Northeast [AOR, 1.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.45-2.11] and care received at a community-based outpatient clinic compared with a medical center (AOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.20-1.24) also predicted testosterone use. Although they were more likely to prescribe testosterone, endocrinologists were also more likely to obtain an appropriate workup before prescribing compared with primary care providers (AOR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.54-2.97).Conclusions: Our results highlight the opportunity to intervene at both the provider and the site levels to improve testosterone prescribing. This study also provides a useful example of how to examine contributions to prescribing variation at different levels of the health care system.

TI  - A MODIS-based modeling scheme for the estimation of downward surface shortwave radiation under cloud-free conditions
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) plays an important role in radiation modeling and partly determines the accuracy of estimated downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR). In this study, Iqbal's model C was used to estimate DSSR under cloud-free conditions over the Koohin and Chitgar sites in Tehran, Iran; the estimated DSSR was based on (1) our proposed hybrid modeling scheme where the AOD is retrieved using the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA), ground-based measurements at the AERONET site in Zanjan and (2) the AOD from the Terra MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. Several other Terra MODIS land and atmospheric products were also used as input data, including geolocation properties, water vapor, total ozone, surface reflectance, and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance. SARA-based DSSR and MODIS-based DSSR were evaluated with ground-based DSSR measurements at the Koohin and Chitgar sites in 2011 and 2013, respectively; the averaged statistics for SARA-based DSSR [R-2 approximate to 0.95, RMSE approximate to 22 W/m(2) (2.5% mean value), and bias approximate to 3 W/m(2)] were stronger than those for MODIS-based DSSR [R2 approximate to 0.79, RMSE approximate to 51 W/m(2) (5.8% mean value), and bias approximate to 34 W/m(2)]. These results show that the proposed hybrid scheme can be used at regional to global scales under the assumption of future access to spatially distributed AERONET sites. Additionally, the robustness of this modeling scheme was exemplified by estimating the aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) during a dust storm in Southwest Asia. The results were comparable to those of previous studies and showed the strength of our modeling scheme.

TI  - A Time-Space Domain Information Fusion Method for Specific Emitter Identification Based on Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Specific emitter identification plays an important role in contemporary military affairs. However, most of the existing specific emitter identification methods haven't taken into account the processing of uncertain information. Therefore, this paper proposes a time-space domain information fusion method based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which has the ability to deal with uncertain information in the process of specific emitter identification. In this paper, radars will generate a group of evidence respectively based on the information they obtained, and our main task is to fuse the multiple groups of evidence to get a reasonable result. Within the framework of recursive centralized fusion model, the proposed method incorporates a correlation coefficient, which measures the relevance between evidence and a quantum mechanical approach, which is based on the parameters of radar itself. The simulation results of an illustrative example demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively deal with uncertain information and get a reasonable recognition result.

TI  - Remotely sensed urban environmental indices and their economic implications
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies reveal that urban favorable amenities potentially contribute to housing prices, but we still lack proper indices to quantify intangible urban disservices and lack the understanding of their economic effects. We attempt to develop remotely sensed indices to reflect these unfavorable and intangible urban disservices. Taking Wuhan in central China as an example, we propose the Thermal Environment Index (TEI) and the Vegetation Coverage Index (VCI) to characterize the urban environment based on Landsat images and examine their influences on housing prices using a hedonic price model. We build the hedonic price model using the spatial lag regression between housing prices and explanatory variables, including the proposed environmental indices, locational variables, and apartment structural variables. The spatial regression shows that the floor area ratio, floor height, proximity to business centers, and road accessibility exert significant and positive influences on housing prices whereas the TEI and the VCI have significant and negative influences on housing prices. A one-percent increase in the TEI will decrease housing prices by approximately 55 RMB/m(2) in 2010. We further investigate the differences between housing prices inside heat islands of different levels or types and outside heat islands, confirming our findings with the results of hedonic modeling. This study shows the potential of developing a remote sensing index to measure intangible urban disservices and exploring their economic implications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Disentangling remotely-sensed plant phenology and snow seasonality at northern Europe using MODIS and the plant phenology index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology is frequently derived from remotely sensed data. However, over regions with seasonal snow cover, remotely-sensed land surface phenology may be dominated by snow seasonality, rather than showing true plant phenology. Overlooking snow influences may lead to inaccurate plant phenology estimation, and consequently to misinterpretation of climate-vegetation interactions. To address the problem we apply the recently developed plant phenology index (PPI) to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for estimating plant phenology metrics over northern Europe. We compare PPI-derived start and end of the growing season with ground observations by professionals (6 sites) and nonprofessional citizens (378 sites), with phenology metrics derived from gross primary productivity (GPP, 18 sites), and with data on the timing of snow cover. These data are also compared with land surface phenology metrics derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using the same MODIS data. We find that the PPI-retrieved plant phenology agrees with ground observations and GPP-derived phenology, and that the NDVI-derived phenology to a large extent agrees with the end-of-snowmelt for the start-of-season and the start-of-snowing for the end of-season. PPI is thereby useful for more accurate estimation of plant phenology from remotely sensed data over northern Europe and other regions with seasonal snow cover.

TI  - Irrigation-Induced Environmental Changes around the Aral Sea: An Integrated View from Multiple Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aral Sea basin (ASB) is one of the most environmentally vulnerable regions to climate change and human activities. During the past 60 years, irrigation has greatly changed the water distribution and caused severe environmental issues in the ASB. Using remote sensing data, this study investigated the environmental changes induced by irrigation activities in this region. The results show that, in the past decade, land water storage has significantly increased in the irrigated upstream regions (13 km(3) year(-1)) but decreased in the downstream regions (-27 km(3) year(-1)) of the Amu Darya River basin, causing a water storage decrease in the whole basin (-20 km(3) year(-1)). As a result, the water surface area of the Aral Sea has decreased from 32,000 in 2000 to 10,000 km(2) in 2015. The shrinking Aral Sea exposed a large portion of the lake bottom to the air, increasing (decreasing) the daytime (nighttime) temperatures by about 1 degrees C year(-1) (0.5 degrees C year(-1)). Moreover, there were other potential environmental changes, including drier soil, less vegetation, decreasing cloud and precipitation, and more severe and frequent dust storms. Possible biases in the remote sensing data due to the neglect of the shrinking water surface area of the Aral Sea were identified. These findings highlight the severe environmental threats caused by irrigation in Central Asia and call attention to sustainable water use in such dryland regions.

TI  - Mapping Smallholder Yield Heterogeneity at Multiple Scales in Eastern Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurements of crop production in smallholder farming systems are critical to the understanding of yield constraints and, thus, setting the appropriate agronomic investments and policies for improving food security and reducing poverty. Nevertheless, mapping the yields of smallholder farms is challenging because of factors such as small field sizes and heterogeneous landscapes. Recent advances in fine-resolution satellite sensors offer promise for monitoring and characterizing the production of smallholder farms. In this study, we investigated the utility of different sensors, including the commercial Skysat and RapidEye satellites and the publicly accessible Sentinel-2, for tracking smallholder maize yield variation throughout a similar to 40,000 km(2) western Kenya region. We tested the potential of two types of multiple regression models for predicting yield: (i) a calibrated model, which required ground-measured yield and weather data for calibration, and (ii) an uncalibrated model, which used a process-based crop model to generate daily vegetation index and end-of-season biomass and/or yield as pseudo training samples. Model performance was evaluated at the field, division, and district scales using a combination of farmer surveys and crop cuts across thousands of smallholder plots in western Kenya. Results show that the calibrated approach captured a significant fraction (R-2 between 0.3 and 0.6) of yield variations at aggregated administrative units (e.g., districts and divisions), while the uncalibrated approach performed only slightly worse. For both approaches, we found that predictions using the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI), which included the red edge band available in RapidEye and Sentinel-2, were superior to those made using other commonly used vegetation indices. We also found that multiple refinements to the crop simulation procedures led to improvements in the uncalibrated approach. We identified the prevalence of small field sizes, intercropping management, and cloudy satellite images as major challenges to improve the model performance. Overall, this study suggested that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used to map yields of smallholder farming systems, and the methodology presented in this study could serve as a good foundation for other smallholder farming systems in the world.

TI  - Small phytoplankton contribution to the total primary production in the highly productive Ulleung Basin in the East/Japan Sea
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ulleung Basin in the southwestern East/Japan Sea (hereafter East Sea) is known as a biologically productive "hot spot" but climate-associated changes in the physicochemical oceanographic conditions and some biological changes have been reported. In this study, our main objective was to determine the contribution of small phytoplankton to the total primary production, which is valuable information for detecting marine ecosystem changes in the Ulleung Basin. The small phytoplankton productivity contributions determined by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived monthly productivities using a phytoplankton community -based productivity algorithm was significantly consistent with the field-measured productivity contributions of small phytoplankton in this study. The daily primary productivity of small phytoplankton ranged from 42.7 to 418.7 mg Cm-2 d(-1) with an average of 172.9 mg Cm-2 d(-1) (S.D. = +/- 61.4 mg C m(-2) d(-1), n = 120), and the annual contribution of small phytoplankton ranged from 19.6% to 28.4% with an average of 23.6% (S.D. = +/- 8.1%) in the Ulleung Basin from 2003 to 2012. Overall, large phytoplankton were a major contributor to the total primary production in the Ulleung Basin (76.4 +/- 8.2%) from 2003 to 2012, which indicates that the Ulleung Basin is a highly productive region. A significantly negative relationship (p < 0.05) was found between the small phytoplankton primary productivity contribution and the annual primary production in this study. This finding revealed that the recent decreasing annual primary production in the Ulleung Basin could be a consequence of the increasing contribution of small phytoplankton. The response of phytoplankton to ongoing climate change depending on different-size phytoplankton compositions should be a subject for further investigation in the Ulleung Basin as a biologically highly productive region in the East Sea.

TI  - Spatial variation and seasonal dynamics of leaf-area index in the arctic tundra-implications for linking ground observations and satellite images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation in the arctic tundra typically consists of a small-scale mosaic of plant communities, with species differing in growth forms, seasonality, and biogeochemical properties.Characterization of this variation is essential for understanding and modeling the functioning of the arctic tundra in global carbon cycling, as well as for evaluating the resolution requirements for remote sensing. Our objective was to quantify the seasonal development of the leaf-area index (LAI) and its variation among plant communities in the arctic tundra near Tiksi, coastal Siberia, consisting of graminoid, dwarf shrub, moss, and lichen vegetation. We measured the LAI in the field and used two very-high-spatial resolution multispectral satellite images (QuickBird and WorldView-2), acquired at different phenological stages, to predict landscape-scale patterns. We used the empirical relationships between the plant community-specific LAI and degree-day accumulation (0 degrees C threshold) and quantified the relationship between the LAI and satellite NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). Due to the temporal difference between the field data and satellite images, the LAI was approximated for the imagery dates, using the empirical model. LAI explained variation in the NDVI values well (R-adj.(2) 0.42-0.92). Of the plant functional types, the graminoid LAI showed the largest seasonal amplitudes and was the main cause of the varying spatial patterns of the NDVI and the related LAI between the two images. Our results illustrate how the short growing season, rapid development of the LAI, yearly climatic variation, and timing of the satellite data should be accounted for in matching imagery and field verification data in the Arctic region.

TI  - Analysis of the Pyroclastic Flow Deposits of Mount Sinabung and Merapi Using Landsat Imagery and the Artificial Neural Networks Approach
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic eruptions cause pyroclastic flows, which can destroy plantations and settlements. We used image data from Landsat 7 Bands 7, 4 and 2 and Landsat 8 Bands 7, 5 and 3 to observe and analyze the distribution of pyroclastic flow deposits for two volcanos, Mount Sinabung and Merapi, over a period of 10 years (2001-2017). The satellite data are used in conjunction with an artificial neural network method to produce maps of pyroclastic precipitation for Landsat 7 and 8, then we calculated the pyroclastic precipitation area using an artificial neural network method after dividing the images into four classes based on color. Red, green, blue and yellow were used to indicate pyroclastic deposits, vegetation and forest, water and cloud, and farmland, respectively. The area affected by a volcanic eruption was deduced from the neural network processing, including calculating the area of pyroclastic deposits. The main differences between the pyroclastic flow deposits of Mount Sinabung and Mount Merapi are: the sediment deposits of the pyroclastic flows of Mount Sinabung tend to widen, whereas those of Merapi elongated; the direction of pyroclastic flow differed; and the area affected by an eruption was greater for Mount Merapi than Mount Sinabung because the VEI (Volcanic Explosivity Index) during the last 10 years of Mount Merapi was larger than Mount Sinabung.

TI  - Using crowdsourced and weather station data to fill cloud gaps in MODIS snow cover datasets
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the design, development, and testing of a new software package for generating snow cover maps. Using a custom inverse distance weighting method, we combine volunteer snow reports, cross-country ski track reports and station measurements to fill cloud gaps in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover product. The method is demonstrated by producing a continuous daily time step snow probability map dataset for the Czech Republic region. For validation, we checked the ability of our method to reconstruct MODIS snow cover under cloud by simulating cloud cover datasets and comparing estimated snow cover to actual MODIS snow cover. The percent correctly classified indicator showed accuracy between 80 and 90% using this method. The software is available as an R package. The output data sets are published on the HydroShare website for download and through a web map service for re-use in third-party applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predictors of HIV virological failure and drug resistance in Chinese patients after 48 months of antiretroviral treatment, 2008-2012: a prospective cohort study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To explore factors associated with HIV virological failure (VF) and HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) among HIV-positive Chinese individuals 4 years after initiating first-line lamivudine-based antiretroviral treatment (ART) in 2008 at five sentinel sites.Design First-line ART initiators who were previously treatment naive were selected using consecutive ID numbers from the 2008 National Surveillance Database into a prospective cohort study. Questionnaires and blood samples were collected in 2011 and 2012 to assess the outcomes of interest: VF (defined as viral load =1000 copies/mL) and HIVDR (defined as VF with genetic drug-resistant mutations). Questionnaires and data from National Surveillance Database assessed demographics and drug adherence data.Results 536 individuals with HIV were analysed; the 4-year risk of VF was 63 (11.8%) and HIVDR was 27 (5.0%). Female participants initiating stavudine (D4T)-based regimens were more susceptible to both VF (adjusted OR (aOR)=2.5, 95% CI 1 to 6.1, p=0.04) and HIVDR (aOR=3.6, 95% CI 1 to 12.6, p=0.05) versus zidovudine-based regimens. Male participants missing doses in past month were more susceptible to both VF (aOR=2.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 7, p=0.03) and HIVDR (aOR=9.7, 95% CI 2.1 to 44.1, p<0.01). Participants of non-Han nationality were of increased risk for HIVDR (aOR from 4.8 to 12.2, p<0.05) and non-Han men were at increased risk for VF (aOR=2.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 7.3, p=0.02). All 27 participants detected with HIVDR had non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor mutations, 21 (77.8%) also had nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor mutations, and no protease inhibitor mutations were detected.Conclusions Our findings suggest successful treatment outcomes at 4 years for roughly 90% of patients. We suggest conducting further study on whether and when to change ART regimen for women initiated with D4T-based regimen, and reinforcing adherence counselling for men. Increased VF and HIVDR risk among non-Han minorities warrants further exploration, and ethnic minorities may be an important group to tailor adherence-focused interventions.

TI  - Are the ACOSOG Z0011 Trial Findings Being Applied to Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy?
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2010, the ACOSOG Z0011 trial showed equivalent survival and recurrence between sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for those with a tumor positive sentinel node (SN). We examined national trends in axillary surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for clinically node positive disease in the years prior to and after the Z0011 trial publication. 12,063 women with cT1-4N1M0 invasive breast cancer who underwent NAC from 2006 to 2013 and had 1-3 positive nodes on pathology were selected from the National Cancer Data Base. We defined SLNB as 1-4 nodes and ALND as 10 nodes examined. 2,704 women (22.4%) underwent SLNB alone and 9,359 (77.6%) underwent ALND. The rate of SLNB increased from 25.6% in 2006 to 33.3% in 2012 in patients that underwent lumpectomy (p < 0.01) and increased from 20.6% to 22.8% in patients that underwent mastectomy (p = 0.25). Patients treated at Community centers (30.4% versus 19.2% at Academic centers) and those with less positive nodes (32.2% for 1 positive node versus 10.1% for 3 positive nodes, p < 0.01) were more likely to have SLNB alone compared to ALND. On multivariate analysis, treatment with lumpectomy (OR 1.46, CI 1.28-1.67), lower number of positive nodes (OR 3.98, CI 3.29-4.82) and lobular subtype (OR 1.82, CI 1.42-2.34) were independent predictors of receiving SLNB alone after NAC. Approximately 22% of patients with cN1 breast cancer underwent SLNB alone for pN1 disease after NAC. Ongoing clinical trials will determine if recurrence and survival rates are equivalent between SLNB and ALND groups.

TI  - Radiological Consequences of the Fire in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in April 2015
T2  - Radiatsionnaya Biologiya Radioekologiya
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of analyses of the remote sensing data, the areas of large grass fires (6250 ha), ground (2737 ha) and crown (1140 ha) forest fires in the Chernobyl exclusion zone in 2015 were determined; on April, 26-27th 1.735 ha, 28th - 5.761 ha and 29th - 2.631 hectares. The total area was 10.127 ha. The maximum density of the radionuclide contamination inside the fire perimeter in the forest blocks 306-308 of the Lubyanka forest ranger district was 1040 kBq/m(2) for Cs-137; 368 kBq/m for Sr-290; 11.4 kBq/m(2) for Pu238-240; 14.4 kBq/m for Am-2241.Wherein expected effective doses to fire-fighters during one fire-line hour did not exceed 0.64 mu Sv in case of external exposure and 0.37 mu Sv in case of internal exposure. It is shown that the expected effective dose of internal exposure to fire-fighters during suppression of wildfires will be below the dose from external exposure. At the moment, exposure to Sr-90 and Pu-241 (along with 238-240PU and Am-241) makes the most significant contribution to the internal dose to fire-fighters during suppression of forest and grassland fires in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Resuspension of radioactive aerosols by the fire in April 2015 did not have a significant influence on the secondary contamination of the territory and additional exposure of residents outside the Chernobyl exclusion zone.

TI  - From Disabled Students to Disabled Brains: The Medicalizing Power of Rhetorical Images in the Israeli Learning Disabilities Field.
T2  - The Journal of medical humanities
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The neurocentric worldview that identifies the essence of the human being with the material brain has become a central paradigm in current academic discourse. Israeli researchers also seek to understand educational principles and processes via neuroscientific models. On this background, the article uncovers the central role that visual brain images play in the learning-disabilities field in Israel. It examines the place brain images have in the professional imagination of didactic-diagnosticians as well as their influence on the diagnosticians' clinical attitudes. It relies on two theoretical fields: sociology and anthropology of the body and sociology of neuromedical knowledge. The research consists of three methodologies: ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and rhetorical analysis of visual and verbal texts. It uncovers the various rhetorical and ideological functions of brain images in the field. It also charts the repertoire of rhetorical devices which are utilized to strengthen the neuroreducionist messages contained in the images.

TI  - Intercomparison of PERSIANN-CDR and TRMM-3B42V7 precipitation estimates at monthly and daily time scales
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the first part of this paper, monthly precipitation data from Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B42 algorithm Version 7 (TRMM-3B42V7) are evaluated over Iran using the Generalized Three-Cornered Hat (GTCH) method which is self-sufficient of reference data as input. Climate Data Unit (CRU) is added to the GTCH evaluations as an independent gauge-based dataset thus, the minimum requirement of three datasets for the model is satisfied. To ensure consistency of all datasets, the two satellite products were aggregated to 0.5 degrees spatial resolution, which is the minimum resolution of CRU. The results show that the PERSIANN-CDR has higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) than TRMM-3B42V7 for the monthly rainfall estimation, especially in the northern half of the country. All datasets showed low SNR in the mountainous area of southwestern Iran, as well as the arid parts in the southeast region of the country. Additionally, in order to evaluate the efficacy of PERSIANN-CDR and TRMM-3B42V7 in capturing extreme daily-precipitation amounts, an in-situ rain-gauge dataset collected by the Islamic Republic of the Iran Meteorological Organization (IRIMO) was employed. Given the sparsity of the rain gauges, only 0.25 degrees pixels containing three or more gauges were used for this evaluation. There were 228 such pixels where daily and extreme rainfall from PERSIANN-CDR and TRMM-3B42V7 could be compared. However, TRMM-3B42V7 overestimates most of the intensity indices (correlation coefficients; R between 0.7648-0.8311, Root Mean Square Error; RMSE between 3.29mm/day21.2mm/5day); PERSIANN-CDR underestimates these extremes (R between 0.6349-0:7791 and RMSE between 3.59mm/day-30.56mm/5day). Both satellite products show higher correlation coefficients and lower RMSEs for the annual mean of consecutive dry spells than wet spells. The results show that TRMM-3842V7 can capture the annual mean of the absolute indices (the number of wet days in which daily precipitation > 10 mm, 20 mm) better than PERSIANN-CDR. The results of daily evaluations show that the similarity of Empirical Cumulative Density Function (ECDF) of satellite products and IRIMO gauges daily precipitation, as well as dry spells with different thresholds in some selected pixels (include at least five gauges), are significant. The results also indicate that ECDFs become more significant when threshold increases. In terms of regional analyses, the higher SNR of the products on monthly (based on the GTCH method) and daily evaluations (significant ECDFs) is mostly consistent.

TI  - Using fluorescence lymphangiography to define the ileocolic mesentery: proof of concept for the watershed area using real-time imaging
T2  - TECHNIQUES IN COLOPROCTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in mesenteric science have demonstrated that the mesentery is a continuous structure with a 'watershed' area at the mesenteric apex between the right colon and terminal ileum, where lymphatic flow can proceed either proximally or distally. With this new understanding of the anatomy, functional features are emerging, which can have an impact on surgical management. Fluorescence lymphangiography or lymphoscintigraphy with indocyanine green allows real-time visualization of lymphatic channels, which highlights sentinel lymph nodes and may facilitate identification of the ideal margins for mesenteric lymphadenectomy during bowel resection for colon cancer. By using this novel technology, it is possible to demonstrate a watershed area in the ileocolic region and may facilitate more precise mesenteric dissection. In the present study, we provide proof of concept for the ileocolic watershed area using fluorescence lymphangiography.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus is well known to transmit dengue and chikungunya viruses. Recent report that Zika virus is meditated by this mosquito highlights the importance of Ae. albopictus to human health worldwide. To elucidate the transmission dynamics of pathogens through blood feeding behavior of Ae. albopictus, we investigated blood meal sources and examined the dengue virus infection rate in field-captured Ae. albopictus. This study was conducted in an urban park in Seoul, a metropolitan city with high population density and significant floating population and a region with high risk of dengue virus transmission. Mosquitoes were collected twice a month from May through October in 2015 using BG-Sentinel traps. The collected Ae. albopictus were used in blood meal source analysis and dengue virus detection, whereas in other captured mosquito species, only those fed on blood were used for blood meal source analysis. A total of 54,682 mosquitoes representing 7 genera and 12 species were collected. The blood meal sources for Ae. albopictus included mammals (71%), birds (26%), amphibians (2%), and fish (1%). In mammals, the major blood meal source was humans (61.1%). No dengue virus was detected in captured samples. However, since the results for blood meal source indicate that Ae. albopictus feed almost exclusively on humans, this mosquito is likely to become a major vector of dengue virus, once this virus enters the mosquito.

TI  - Development of a Nomogram to Predict N2 or N3 Stage in T1-2 Invasive Breast Cancer Patients with No Palpable Lymphadenopathy
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Subsequent to the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 and After Mapping of the Axilla: Radiotherapy or Surgery (AMAROS) trials, complete axillary lymph node dissection is not routinely performed, even in cases where metastatic sentinel lymph nodes are detected. We investigated the percentage of N2 or N3 stages in T1-2 invasive breast cancer patients with no lymphadenopathy and developed a nomogram to predict the possibility of N2 or N3 stages in these patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of invasive breast cancer patients who were clinically NO stage, but had a positive sentinel or non-sentinel lymph node detected on sentinel lymph node biopsy. The association of potential risk factors with known outcomes (N2 or N3 stages) was tested using logistic regression analysis. Variables with p <0.05 in the multivariate analysis were included in the nomogram. Internal performance validation was carried out using a 5-fold cross validation method. Results: Among a total of 1,437 patients, 1,355 patients had stage N1 disease (94.3%), while 82 had stage N2 or N3 disease (5.7%). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed lymphovascular invasion (p=0.008), T2 stage (p=0.026), metastatic lymph node ratio (p<0.001), and perinodal extension (p<0.001) as independent predictors of N2 or N3 stages. A nomogram was developed based on these factors. The area under the curve estimated from the receiver operating characteristic graph was 0.8050 in the model set and 0.8246 in the test set. Conclusion: Our nomogram can be employed for the prediction of N2 or N3 stage among cases fulfilling the ACOSOG Z0011 or AMAROS criteria.

TI  - Characterizing hydrologic changes of the Great Dismal Swamp using SAR/InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), one of the largest, northernmost peatlands on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, is underlain by a thick water-logged organic soil layer (peat) made up of dead and decaying plant material. The peatland functions as a main sink for a large amount of soil derived organic carbon. The disturbance of this wetland has negatively impacted the ecosystem and contributed to climate change through the release of the stored greenhouse gases. Surface water level and soil moisture conditions are critical information about peatlands, but monitoring these hydrologic changes has been a challenging task. With a lack of in situ soil moisture measurements, we first explored yearlong Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data to find the close relationship (R-squared value: 0.80) between soil moisture and groundwater table from March 2015 to March 2016. Based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering returns and interferometric SAR (InSAR) phase measurements from C-band Radarsat-1 and L-band ALOS PALSAR datasets, we then analyzed the hydrologic changes in the peatlands. We compared averaged C/L-band SAR backscattering intensity (mid 1998-early 2008 for Radarsat-1, late 2006-early 2011 for ALOS PALSAR) with groundwater level changes and found that the SAR backscattering is significantly responsive (R-squared value: 0.76 and 0.67 for Radarsat-1 and ALOS PALSAR, respectively) to soil moisture changes through a three-way correlated relationship of soil moisture, groundwater level, and SAR intensity. Using InSAR coherence observations, we delineated the inundated area (western and northern regions of GDS) during the wet season, subject to double-bounce backscattering. We measured the relative water level changes in the inundated areas through the InSAR phase measurements, and estimated the groundwater level changes corresponding to soil moisture changes using time-series InSAR analysis: Our comprehensive study has demonstrated that time-series SAR backscattering retums and InSAR analysis can be used to gauge soil moisture conditions and to monitor the hydrologic and vegetation changes in the GDS.

TI  - Using leaf area index (LAI) to assess vegetation response to drought in Yunnan province of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic extremes such as drought have becoming a severe climate-related problem in many regions all over the world that can induce anomalies in vegetation condition. Growth and CO2 uptake by plants are constrained to a large extent by drought. Therefore, it is important to understand the spatial and temporal responses of vegetation to drought across the various land cover types and different regions. Leaf area index (LAI) derived from Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) data was used to evaluate the response of vegetation to drought occurrence across Yunnan Province, China (2001-2010). The meteorological drought was assessed based on Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values. Pearson's correlation coefficients between LAI and SPI were examined across several timescales within six sub-regions of the Yunnan. Further, the drought-prone area was identified based on LAI anomaly values. Lag and cumulative effects of lack of precipitation on vegetation were evident, with significant correlations found using 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month timescale. We found 9-month timescale has higher correlations compared to another timescale. Approximately 29.4% of Yunnan's area was classified as drought-prone area, based on the LAI anomaly values. Most of this drought-prone area was distributed in the mountainous region of Yunnan. From the research, it is evident that GLASS LAI can be effectively used as an indicator for assessing drought conditions and it provide valuable information for drought risk defense and preparedness.

TI  - Spatial Disaggregation of Coarse Soil Moisture Data by Using High-Resolution Remotely Sensed Vegetation Products
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel approach is presented to spatially disaggregate coarse soil moisture (SM) by only using remotely sensed vegetation index. The approach is based on the conditional relationship of vegetation with time-aggregated SM, allowing the coarse-scale SM to be disaggregated to the spatial resolution of the vegetation product. The method was applied to satellite-derived SM over January 2010-December 2011, using the high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The results were evaluated against ground measurements during the two-year period over the contiguous United States and Spain, and also compared with an existing disaggregation method that also requires land surface temperature observations. It is shown that the proposed approach can provide fine-resolution SM with reasonable spatial variability.

TI  - Self-Learning Based Land-Cover Classification Using Sequential Class Patterns from Past Land-Cover Maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the accuracy of classification with a small amount of training data, this paper presents a self-learning approach that defines class labels from sequential patterns using a series of past land-cover maps. By stacking past land-cover maps, unique sequence rule information from sequential change patterns of land-covers is first generated, and a rule-based class label image is then prepared for a given time. After the most informative pixels with high uncertainty are selected from the initial classification, rule-based class labels are assigned to the selected pixels. These newly labeled pixels are added to training data, which then undergo an iterative classification process until a stopping criterion is reached. Time-series MODIS NDVI data sets and cropland data layers (CDLs) from the past five years are used for the classification of various crop types in Kansas. From the experiment results, it is found that once the rule-based labels are derived from past CDLs, the labeled informative pixels could be properly defined without analyst intervention. Regardless of different combinations of past CDLs, adding these labeled informative pixels to training data increased classification accuracy and the maximum improvement of 8.34 percentage points in overall accuracy was achieved when using three CDLs, compared to the initial classification result using a small amount of training data. Using more than three consecutive CDLs showed slightly better classification accuracy than when using two CDLs (minimum and maximum increases were 1.56 and 2.82 percentage points, respectively). From a practical viewpoint, using three or four CDLs was the best choice for this study area. Based on these experiment results, the presented approach could be applied effectively to areas with insufficient training data but access to past land-cover maps. However, further consideration should be given to select the optimal number of past land-cover maps and reduce the impact of errors of rule-based labels.

TI  - Early ovarian cancer surgery with indocyanine-green-guided targeted compartmental lymphadenectomy (TCL, pelvic part)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Para-aortic indocyanine-green (ICG)-guided targeted compartmental lymphadenectomy is feasible in early ovarian cancer [1]; systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy could potentially be avoided if thoroughly investigated sentinel nodes could predict whether residual nodes will be involved or free of disease. In contrast to advanced ovarian cancer, where the therapeutic potential of lymphadenectomy will soon be clarified by the results of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie lymphadenectomy in ovarian neoplasms (AGO LION) trial, systematic lymphadenectomy seems to be mandatory for diagnostic and also therapeutic purposes in early ovarian cancer [2-4]. Sentinel node biopsy or resection of the regional lymphatic network may reduce morbidity compared to systematic lymphadenectomy as shown already for other entities [5-7]. Apart from the ovarian mesonephric pathway [1], a second Mullerian uterine pathway exists for lymphatic drainage of the ovary [8]. Lymphatic valves apparently do not exist at this level of the utero-ovarian network since injection of radioactivity into the ovarian ligaments also labelled pelvic nodes [9].Methods: We applied ICG using 4x0.5 mL of a 1.66 mg/mL ICG solution for transcervical injection into the fundal and midcorporal myometrium at each side [10] instead of injection into the infundibulopelvic ligament, since the utero-ovarian drainage was intact.Results: In this case a 1.8 cm cancer of the right ovary was removed in continuity with its draining lymphatic vessels and at least the first 2 sentinel nodes in each channel "en bloc" as shown in this video for the pelvic part, consistent with the loco-regional ontogenetic approach [11,12].Conclusion: This could potentially avoid most of systematic lymphadenectomies in early ovarian cancer.

TI  - Global WaterPack - A 250 m resolution dataset revealing the daily dynamics of global inland water bodies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about inland surface water distribution and its short- to long-term variability is of high importance. Recently many studies have presented interesting results at regional, continental and global scale with 14.25 m to 25 km spatial and 10 day to one year temporal resolution. However, surface inland water bodies can feature temporally rapid spatial changes caused by extreme events, seasonal variability as well as human activity. Such changes can occur on temporal scales which are below the currently existing dynamic water body products. While the daily temporal resolution of available sensors has not been exploited yet. In this study we present an approach which uses the full temporal resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to generate a 250 m daily global dataset of inland water bodies based on spectral information and dynamic thresholding. Based on a combination of MODIS Terra and Aqua daily classifications, auxiliary mask layers and temporal interpolation, a global cloud and gap free time series of inland water bodies is produced. The presented results are validated with 321 Landsat images across the globe. The executed validation shows an overall accuracy of 96.3% with 7.8% omission and 0.5% commission error, and a kappa coefficient of 933% for pure water pixels. The presented results demonstrate the high potential for different applications requiring information of inland water body dynamics at high temporal resolution. Examples demonstrate that e.g. the filling and emptying of water reservoirs, changes and inundation cycles of natural water bodies as well as freezing and thawing of lakes can be analyzed at a highly detailed temporal scale.

TI  - The Immunology of Melanoma
T2  - CLINICS IN LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relatively high DNA mutational burden in melanoma allows for the creation of potentially "foreign," immune-stimulating neoantigens, and leads to its exceptional immunogenicity. Brisk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, a marker of immune editing, confer improved overall survival in melanoma, possibly due to reduced sentinel lymph node spread. Meanwhile, T-cell-stimulating drugs, so-called T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, which reverse peripheral tolerance-dependent tumor escape, have demonstrated unparalleled clinical success in metastatic melanoma. Markers to predict response to immunotherapy are currently imperfect, and the subject of intense research, which will guide the future of ancillary pathologic testing in this setting.

TI  - Inconsistency of surface-based (SYNOP) and satellite-based (MODIS) cloud amount estimations due to the interpretation of cloud detection results
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface-based and satellite-based observations remain the fundamental source of cloud amount data for climatologists. However, both data sets show inconsistency related to the interpretation of instantaneous cloud detection, whether measured using the okta scale for surface-based (SYNOP) observations or cloud mask classes (for satellite-based observations). This study compared mean monthly SYNOP cloud amount with those reported for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud imager onboard Aqua and Terra satellites. Data were collected simultaneously (+/- 10min) over Poland between 2003 and 2013 (a total of 3240 MODIS passes). Results showed that in daytime conditions the average range of inconsistency for SYNOP (10.8%) is similar to MODIS (10.1%). However, for MODIS it doubles (20.9%) at nighttime. This is attributed to the change in frequency of MODIS cloud mask intermediate classes. Furthermore, in particular months' range of inconsistency for MODIS exceeded 20% in daytime and 50% at nighttime, while maximum values for SYNOP were always lower than 20% (a consequence of the okta scale). The findings also confirmed that the standard procedure used to interpret SYNOP okta values (i.e. the assumption that 1 okta equals 12.5%) is a relatively accurate (+/- 2%) estimate of monthly mean cloud amount, although this assumes that surface-based observers always correctly assign the correct okta value to the cloud fraction. Finally, the error in the SYNOP cloud amount estimation was correlated with the average cloud amount for a given location. Those findings will improve the reliability of cloud amount validation efforts that use SYNOP data as a reference.

TI  - 2.5D change detection from satellite imagery to monitor small-scale mining activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining natural resources serve fundamental societal needs or commercial interests, but it may well turn into a driver of violence and regional instability. In this study, very high resolution (VHR) optical stereo satellite data are analysed to monitor processes and changes in one of the largest artisanal and small-scale mining sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is among the world's wealthiest countries in exploitable minerals To identify the subtle structural changes, the applied methodological framework employs object-based change detection (OBCD) based on optical VHR data and generated digital surface models (DSM). Results prove the DSM-based change detection approach enhances the assessment gained from sole 2D analyses by providing valuable information about changes in surface structure or volume. Land cover changes as analysed by OBCD reveal an increase in bare soil area by a rate of 47% between April 2010 and September 2010, followed by a significant decrease of 47.5% until March 2015. Beyond that, DSM differencing enabled the characterisation of small-scale features such as pits and excavations. The presented Earth observation (EO)-based monitoring of mineral exploitation aims at a better understanding of the relations between resource extraction and conflict, and thus providing relevant information for potential mitigation strategies and peace building.

TI  - THE VOLUME OF POSTOPERATIVE, DRAINAGE FLUID AS A POTENTIAL EARLY PREDICTOR OF LYMPHEDEMA AFTER LYMPH NODE EXCISION FOR METASTATIC MELANOMA
T2  - LYMPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphedema (LE) following lymph node dissection is a major problem for cancer patients, and radiation therapy, extended surgery, groin dissection, obesity, and older age are well-established risk factors of LE. We studied whether these risk factors are further associated with high volumes of postoperative drainage fluid after complete lymph node dissection (CLND) for melanoma metastases. Moreover, we examined whether a high amount of drainage fluid after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can predict a high amount of drainage fluid after subsequent CLND. Using descriptive statistics and regression analyses, we analyzed the cumulative volumes of postoperative drainage fluid for 836 melanoma patients with lymph node excision in the axilla or groin. In multiple regression analyses, the well-established risk factors of LE, i.e., increased body mass index, older age, and ilioinguinal versus inguinal versus axillary dissection predicted a high drainage volume after CLND. Of note, a high drainage fluid volume after SLNB also predicted a high drainage volume after subsequent CLND. In patients with groin dissections, who are particularly susceptible to swelling, extended iliac dissection, age above 60, and a cumulative drainage volume of more than 100 ml in the preceding SLNB were predictors of the cumulative drainage volume. We find that common risk factors predict the volume of postoperative drainage fluid after CLND and postoperative LE. Further, high postoperative drainage volume may therefore function as a potential early predictor of LE following CLND.

TI  - Determining the number of measurements required to estimate crop residue cover by different methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue left after harvest plays an important role in controlling against soil erosion and in increasing soil organic matter content of agricultural soils. Crop residue management is a practice of great importance in southwestern Ontario, where soil management practices have an effect on Great Lakes water quality. The use of remote sensing data to measure and monitor crop residue can be fast and efficient. However, remote sensing based studies need calibration and validation using field observations. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal number of ground-truthing field measurements (i.e., digital photographs) required to estimate residue levels. To do so, we compared the residue estimates derived from digital photographs with those derived from the standard line-transect method. Residue was measured from 18 fields located in southern Ontario, and data collected included percentage of crop residue using line-transect and photographic grid methods. Results were analyzed using linear regression, correlation tests, ANOVA, and means tests. Analyses were also conducted to retrospectively determine the minimum number of line transects or digital photos required to estimate crop residue cover at specified levels of power. Results showed that (1) percentage of crop residue estimates derived from using digital photographs were strongly correlated (r = 0.91, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.83, and n = 90) to those derived from using line transects; (2) counting 50 to 100 points per digital photograph was sufficient to accurately estimate the percentage of residue cover; and (3) there was greater variability in the results for soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) than for corn (Zea mays L.), with the highest variability for medium-level soybean residue. Overall, the digital photograph method to estimate percentage of residue was found to be a suitable alternative to the line-transect method, which is more time consuming and labor intensive. Determining the optimal numbers of measurements to estimate crop residue cover is important to those wishing to use digital photo capture methods to record, archive, and measure residue for remote sensing calibration and validation or for handheld mobile device applications.

TI  - What California sea lions exposed to domoic acid might teach us about autism: lessons for predictive and preventive medicine
T2  - EPMA JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) shares many biological and behavioral similarities with the deleterious effects of domoic acid (DA) exposure. DA is produced by marine algae and most commonly by species of Pseudo-nitzschia. Humans and marine mammals can be exposed to DA when they consume whole fish or shellfish. The mammalian fetus is highly sensitive to the deleterious effects of DA exposure. Both ASD and exposures to toxic levels of DA feature repetitive behaviors, challenges with social interaction, and seizures. They can also share a commonality in brain anatomy and function, particularly the balance between excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. The current article is relevant to predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine for three reasons. First, shellfish consumption may be a risk factor for ASD and the regulatory limit for DA should be adjusted to prevent this possibility. Human contributions to increased algal production of DA in coastal waters should be identified and reduced. Second, evaluations of sentinel species wild and free-roaming in the environment, though typically outside the purview of biomedical research, should be much more fully employed to gain insights to risk factors for human disease. To better identify and prevent disease, biomedical researchers should study wild populations. Third, studies of DA exposure highlight the possibility that glutamate additives to processed foods may also have deleterious impacts on human brain development and behavior.

TI  - An exploratory wastewater analysis study of drug use in Auckland, New Zealand
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and Aims. New Zealand is considered to have unusual drug use patterns by international standards. However, this understanding has largely been obtained from social surveys where respondents self-report use. The aim of this paper is to conduct the first wastewater study of drug use in Auckland. Design and Methods. Wastewater sampling was completed from 2 May to 18 July 2014 at 2 Auckland wastewater treatment plants which service 1.3 million people. Samples were analysed for 17 drug residues by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Consumption of methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine, codeine and methadone (mg/day/1000 people) was estimated by using a back-calculation formula. Results. Methamphetamine, codeine, morphine and methadone were detected with high frequency (80-100%), followed by amphetamine (similar to 60%), MDMA (similar to 7%, i.e. 8 occasions) and methylone (3 occasions). An overall mean of 360 mg of methamphetamine and 60 mg of MDMA was estimated to have been consumed per day per 1000 people. Methamphetamine consumption was found at similar levels in both catchments (377 and 351 mg/day/ 1000 people). Cocaine was only detected in 1 catchment and on only 8 occasions. JWH-018 was detected in 1 catchment and only on 1 occasion. Methamphetamine, codeine and other opioids were detected at a consistent level throughout the week. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and methylone were detected only during the weekends. Conclusions. Wastewater analysis confirms that methamphetamine was one of the most commonly detected illegal drugs in Auckland and was detected consistently throughout the week. In contrast, cocaine and MDMA were rarely detected, with detection limited to weekends.

TI  - Tumor Mitotic Rate and Association with Recurrence in Sentinel Lymph Node Negative Stage II Melanoma Patients
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor mitotic rate (TMR) is a known prognostic variable in thin melanoma patients. Its significance in stage II melanoma patients is yet to be demonstrated. Retrospective analysis of a prospective melanoma database from 9/1997 to 7/2015 was performed. All stage II melanoma, with documented TMR, and six months of follow-up were included. We evaluated the association of clinicopathologic variables, TMR, as a continuous and categorical variable with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) using Cox proportional hazards modeling. We used a statistical model, X-tile, to develop optimal categorizations of TMR. A total of 265 patient characteristics are included in this study. Recurrences occurred in 82 (30.9%) patients, including 5 local, 41 regional, and 36 distant patients. In multivariate model, ulceration, Breslow, and continuous TMR were associated with worse RFS \ OS. Continuous TMR demonstrated worse RFS (hazards ratio [HR] 1.02 (1.00-1.05)) and OS (HR 1.02 (1.00-1.04)), whereas dichotomized TMR (>= 1 vs < 1) was not significant. TMR > 10.4 mitoses/mm(2) has a 5-year RFS \ OS of 27.2 and 44.3 per cent, respectively, compared with 57.4 and 71.4 per cent, respectively, for TMR < 3.2 mitoses/mm(2). Continuous TMR predicts incidence of recurrence in stage II melanoma. We propose a new categorization method developed by statistical modeling for optimal stratification that may guide surveillance for this disparate patient population.

M3  - Review
AB  - Spitzoid lesions represent a challenging and controversial group of tumours, in terms of clinical recognition, biological behaviour and management strategies. Although Spitz naevi are considered benign tumours, their clinical and dermoscopic morphological overlap with spitzoid melanoma renders the management of spitzoid lesions particularly difficult. The controversy deepens because of the existence of tumours that cannot be safely histopathologically diagnosed as naevi or melanomas (atypical Spitz tumours). The dual objective of the present study was to provide an updated classification on dermoscopy of Spitz naevi, and management recommendations of spitzoid-looking lesions based on a consensus among experts in the field. After a detailed search of the literature for eligible studies, a data synthesis was performed from 15 studies on dermoscopy of Spitz naevi. Dermoscopically, Spitz naevi are typified by three main patterns: starburst pattern (51%), a pattern of regularly distributed dotted vessels (19%) and globular pattern with reticular depigmentation (17%). A consensus-based algorithm for the management of spitzoid lesions is proposed. According to it, dermoscopically asymmetric lesions with spitzoid features (both flat/raised and nodular) should be excised to rule out melanoma. Dermoscopically symmetric spitzoid nodules should also be excised or closely monitored, irrespective of age, to rule out atypical Spitz tumours. Dermoscopically symmetric, flat spitzoid lesions should be managed according to the age of the patient. Finally, the histopathological diagnosis of atypical Spitz tumour should warrant wide excision but not a sentinel lymph-node biopsy.

TI  - Agricultural plastic waste spatial estimation by Landsat 8 satellite images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of plastic materials in agriculture involves several benefits but it results in huge quantities of agricultural plastic waste to be disposed of. Input and output data on the use of plastics in agriculture are often difficult to obtain and poor waste management schemes have been developed. The present research aims to estimate and map agricultural plastic waste by using satellite images. Waste was evaluated by means of the indexes relating waste production to crop type and plastic application as defined by the land use map realized by classifying the Landsat 8 image. The image classification was carried out using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and the accuracy assessment showed that the overall accuracy was 94.54% and the kappa coefficient equal to 0.934. Data on the plastic waste obtained by the satellite land use map were compared with the data obtained by using the institutional land use map; a difference of 1.74% was identified on the overall quantity of waste.

AB  - The use of remote sensing has allowed enormous progress in our understanding of biophysical processes worldwide. Despite their importance, the use of satellite bio-optical products is still limited due to optical complexity. In this study we assess the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer algorithm for chlorophyll-a (MODIS-OC3) and of normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH), in inner waters of northern Chilean Patagonia (41 degrees-45 degrees S). Satellite data were evaluated using a compilation of in situ chlorophyll-a data collected by the CIMAR-FIORDOS program during 2003-2012. During austral spring MODIS-OC3 showed a significant relationship with in situ measurements (R-2 = 0.2, P = 0.03, F = 5.33) in comparison with winter when the relationship was non-significant. In contrast, nFLH explained a significant fraction of observed variance of Chl-a during austral winter (R2 = 0.54, P = < 0.01, F = 10.68) and this relationship was not significant in spring. Our preliminary results offer an excellent chance to understand patterns of variability of the autotrophic biomass and physiological status in optically complex interior marine ecosystems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012. Our objective was to assess frequency of opioid tolerance and urine drug testing for individuals initiating ER/LA opioid analgesics.DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.SETTING: Sentinel, a distributed database with electronic healthcare data on >190 million predominantly commercially insured members.PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Members under age 65 initiating ER/LA opioid analgesics between January 2009 and December 2013.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We examined the proportion of opioid-tolerant-only ER/LA opioid analgesic initiates meeting tolerance criteria: receipt of ≥30 mg oxycodone equivalents per day in 7 days prior to the first opioid-tolerant-only dispensing. We separately examined the proportion of new users of extended-release oxycodone (ERO) and other ER/LA opioid analgesics with a claim for a urine drug test in the 30 days prior to, and separately for the 183 days after, dispensing.RESULTS: We identified 79,824 ERO, 7,343 extended-release hydromorphone, and 91,778 transdermal fentanyl opi-oid-tolerant-only episodes. Tolerance criteria were met in 64 percent of ERO, 64 percent of extended-release hydromorphone and 40 percent of transdermal fentanyl episodes. We identified 210,581 incident ERO and 311,660 other ER/LA opioid analgesic episodes. Use of urine drug testing for ERO compared with other ER/LA opioid analgesics was: 4 percent vs 14 percent respectively in the 30 days prior to initiation and 9 percent vs 23 percent respectively in the 183 days following initiation.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest potential areas for improving appropriate ER/LA opioid analgesic prescribing practices.

TI  - Testing the feasibility of using a conveyor belt to load weanling and nursery pigs for transportation.
T2  - Translational animal science
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Transportation is known to be a multi-faceted stressor, with the process of loading being one of the most significant factors impacting the stress to which animals are exposed. This project was designed to determine if using a conveyor to load pigs into the top deck of a simulated straight deck trailer could lower the stress to which pigs and handlers are exposed. Pigs were assigned to either a Control group that were herded up a stationary conveyor ramp into a top deck trailer (2.5 m above the ground); or Conveyor group which were herded onto a mobile conveyor into a top deck trailer. The conveyor was 7.6 m long, 0.9 m wide and rose to 2.5 m high at a 16° slope, and moved 11.3 m/min. Two age groups were tested; Weanling pigs which were moved in groups of 20 (n = 14 groups/treatment) and Nursery pigs which were moved in groups of 10 (n = 15 groups/treatment). Behavior was recorded during loading, including slips and falls, vocalizations, assists, and time to load. Heart rate of 2 sentinel pigs/group and the handler were recorded during loading, and body temperature of the handler after loading. Pigs were held in the simulated trailer for 30 min while heart rate was recorded. After which, they were unloaded and held in a holding pen for an additional 30 min while heart rate was recorded. There were no treatment differences for slips or falls (P < 0.90). Vocalizations were too few to analyze. Both Weanling (2.8 ± 0.7) and Nursery (1.6 ± 0.5) Conveyor pigs needed to be assisted onto the conveyor more than Weanling (1.2 ± 0.4) and Nursery (0.3 ± 0.1) Control pigs (P < 0.06). There was no difference in total loading time between the treatments for any age group (P < 0.15), with Weanling and Nursery pigs loading in 50 to 45 s, respectively. There were no treatment differences for heart rate variability measures (P > 0.10). However, loading increased heart rate of Nursery pigs (204.9 ± 5.7 bpm, P < 0.005), but not Weanling pigs (172.1 ± 9.0 bpm). Nursery pigs had a greater ratio of low frequency to high frequency power during loading (P < 0.02) compared to other phases of the procedure in both Control and Conveyor groups. Heart rate (93.9 ± 1.9 bpm) and body temperature (31.1 ± 0.3°C, eye temperature) of the handler was not affected by treatment (P < 0.26). Based on behavior and physiology, the pigs had similar experiences in both treatments. This study shows that it is feasible to use a conveyor to load pigs, but it may not be advantageous.

TI  - Comparison of Efficiency of BG-Sentinel Traps Baited with Mice, Mouse-Litter, and CO<sub>2</sub> Lures for Field Sampling of Male and Female <i>Aedes albopictu</i>s Mosquitoes
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the abundance and distribution of male mosquitoes in the wild and establishing species seasonality in candidate pilot sites is of particular interest with respect to the use of the sterile-male technique. With the knowledge that using mice as bait in BG-Sentinel traps effectively enhances Aedes albopictus male and female trapping success, the present study was designed to determine whether attractants derived from mouse odour blend could be a viable substitute for live mice to lure Ae. albopictus mosquitoes into traps. The effects of baiting BG-Sentinel traps with mice, carbon dioxide (CO2), and attractants derived from litter mouse odours (mouse litter (ML)) and a mouse odour blend (MOB) on the efficiency of trapping Ae. albopictus males and females were tested using a Latin square design. The BG-Sentinel trap baited with CO2 + ML caught a significantly larger number of mosquitoes compared to traps baited with mice only. The BG-Sentinel traps containing only CO2 or CO2 + MOB, however, did not catch significantly more mosquitoes compared to the other traps. The proportions of males caught in the BG-Sentinel traps did not differ significantly between the respective attractants. The results from this study confirm that CO2 bait is efficient to provide a reliable estimation method for Ae. albopictus adult male abundance in the wild, and suggest that mouse litter baits in combination with CO2 could be used to enhance Aedes trapping success in BG-Sentinel traps.

TI  - "Kill Two Birds with One Stone": Urban Tree Species Classification Using Bi-Temporal Pleiades Images to Study Nesting Preferences of an Invasive Bird
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the results of object-based classifications assessing the potential of bi-temporal Pleiades images for mapping broadleaf and coniferous tree species potentially used by the ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri for nesting in the urban area of Marseille, France. The first classification was performed based solely on a summer Pleiades image (acquired on 28 July 2015) and the second classification based on bi-temporal Pleiades images (a spring image acquired on 24 March 2016 and the summer image). An ensemble of spectral and textural features was extracted from both images and two machine-learning classifiers were used, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Regardless of the classifiers, model results suggest that classification based on bi-temporal Pleiades images produces more satisfying results, with an overall accuracy 11.5-13.9% higher than classification using the single-date image. Textural and spectral features extracted from the blue and the NIR bands were consistently ranked among the most important features. Regardless of the classification scheme, RF slightly outperforms SVM. RF classification using bi-temporal Pleiades images allows identifying 98.5% of the tree species used by the ring-necked parakeet for nesting, highlighting the promising value of remote sensing techniques to assess the ecological requirements of fauna in urban areas.

TI  - Landsat to monitor an endangered beetle population and its habitat: addressing annual life history and imperfect detection
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat-based conservation is a priority for the endangered American burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus Olivier), but its annual life history, dispersal ability, and low detectability contribute to difficulties explaining its decline, identifying manageable habitat characteristics, and mapping its distribution. Objectives of this study were to (i) assess factors affecting detection of beetles with baited pitfall traps, (ii) identify important habitat characteristics, and (iii) map spatio-temporal patterns of habitat quality and beetle abundance. At a military installation in western Arkansas with one of the largest remaining N.americanus populations, 257 sites were surveyed over 5years using three nights of baited pitfall trapping at each site. Geographic information systems (GIS)-based habitat assessments included three site radii (100, 800, and 1600m). Year-specific vegetation condition was quantified using satellite images and other GIS data. N-mixture models were used to account for imperfect detection and to assess competing models of beetle abundance and detection. Detection rates (mean=20%) were dependent on overnight temperature, dew point, and wind speed with upper and lower temperature thresholds beyond which detection was reduced. Habitat assessments were most effective within 800m site radii, consistent with previous estimates of N.americanus trap sample range. Beetle abundance was associated with grasslands and open-canopy woodlands with rolling topography, sandy loam soils, and moderate patchy disturbances from wildfire. Landsat, unlike vegetation maps, quantified year-specific habitat quality and allowed spatio-temporal population dynamics to be mapped at a yearly time-step for this annual species.

TI  - Spatial distribution of common Minke whale (<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>) as an indication of a biological hotspot in the East Sea
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is the most common baleen whale among several marine mammal species observed in Korea. Since a high concentrated condition of prey to whales can be obtained by physical structures, the foraging whale distribution can be an indicator of biological hotspot. Our main objective is verifying the coastal upwelling-southwestern East Sea as a productive biological hotspot based on the geographical distribution of minke whales. Among the cetacean research surveys of the National Institute of Fisheries Science since 1999, 9 years data for the minke whales available in the East Sea were used for this study. The regional primary productivity derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used for a proxy of biological productivity. Minke whales observed during the sighting surveys were mostly concentrated in May and found mostly (approximately 70%) in the southwestern coastal areas (< 300 m) where high chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity were generally detected. Based on MODIS-derived primary productivity algorithm, the annual primary production (320 g C m(-2) y(-1)) estimated in the southwestern coastal region of the East Sea belongs to the highly productive coastal upwelling regions in the world. A change in the main spatial distribution of minke whales was found in recent years, which indicate that the major habitats of mink whales have been shifted into the north of the common coastal upwelling regions. This is consistent with the recently reported unprecedented coastal upwelling in the mid-eastern coast of Korea. Based on high phytoplankton productivity and high distribution of minke whales, the southwestern coastal regions can be considered as one of biological hotspots in the East Sea. These regions are important for ecosystem dynamics and the population biology of top marine predators, especially migratory whales and needed to be carefully managed from a resource management perspective.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Korean clinical practice guideline recently developed by the Korean Breast Cancer Society to address the national clinical situation is currently under revision ahead of a seventh recommendation. A second consensus conference was held to further develop this guideline by soliciting opinions regarding important issues related to surgery, radiotherapy, and medical oncology. Several issues were discussed, and the discussion progressed to pros and cons in the context of cases in various clinical situations. The panels discussed and voted on issues regarding surgical treatment for non-axillary regional lymph nodes, regional nodal irradiation of pN1 disease, and ovarian functional suppression (OFS) as an adjuvant treatment in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Regarding the surgical treatment of non-axillary regional lymph node, most panelists agreed with the recommendation of preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy for patients with biopsy-diagnosed metastases, whereas surgery or radiotherapy of non-axillary regional lymph nodes was suggested for clinical partial responders. Discussions on radiotherapy addressed the need for adjuvant radiotherapy and radiation field of regional lymph node in the context of various N1 breast cancer cases. The-participants reached a consensus to recommend that N1 patients should receive regional nodal irradiation for a large tumor burden (e.g., three positive nodes, perinodal extension, or large primary tumor). Finally, the panels favored OFS in addition to endocrine therapy for premenopausal women with high risk factors such as a large tumor size, involvement of more than three nodes, and a high histologic grade.

TI  - MODIS Aqua Optical Throughput Degradation Impact on Relative Spectral Response and Calibration of Ocean Color Products
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua's launch in 2002, the radiometric system gains of the reflective solar bands have been degrading, indicating changes in the system's optical throughput. To estimate the optical throughput degradation, the electronic gain changes were estimated and removed from the measured system gain. The derived optical throughput degradation shows a rate that is much faster in the shorter wavelengths than the longer wavelengths. The wavelength-dependent optical throughput degradation modulated the relative spectral response (RSR) of the bands. In addition, the optical degradation is also scan angle-dependent due to large changes in response versus the scan angle over time. We estimated the modulated RSR as a function of time and scan angles and its impacts on sensor radiometric calibration for the ocean science. Our results show that the calibration bias could be up to 1.8% for band 8 (412 nm) due to its larger out-of-band response. For the other ocean bands, the calibration biases are much smaller with magnitudes at least one order smaller.

TI  - Sustainability in the Food-Water-Ecosystem Nexus: The Role of Land Use and Land Cover Change for Water Resources and Ecosystems in the Kilombero Wetland, Tanzania
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) has a significant impact on water resources and ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). On the basis of three research projects we aim to describe and discuss the potential, uncertainties, synergies and science-policy interfaces of satellite-based integrated research for the Kilombero catchment, comprising one of the major agricultural utilized floodplains in Tanzania. LULCC was quantified at the floodplain and catchment scale analyzing Landsat 5 and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery applying different adapted classification methodologies. LULC maps at the catchment scale serve as spatial input for the distributed, process-based ecohydrological model SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) simulating the changes in the spatial and temporal water balance in runoff components caused by LULCC. The results reveal that over the past 26 years LULCC has significantly altered the floodplain and already shows an impact on the ecosystem by degrading the existing wildlife corridors. On the catchment scale the anomalies of the water balance are still marginal, but with the expected structural changes of the catchment there is an urgent need to increase the public awareness and knowledge of decision makers regarding the effect of the relationship between LULCC, water resources and environmental degradation.

AB  - Delineation of the grounding line (GL) is necessary for calculating the mass balance of Antarctica, but GL measurements for most of the continent remain at a relatively coarse level. We used Sentinel-1 constellation data to map the GL of the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) using double-differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry. The ice thickness anomaly deduced from hydrostatic equilibrium and existing Antarctic GL products is compared with our result. With this new and very accurate GL, we detected new ice rises in the north of the AIS. Our new measurement shows no major change of the AIS GL, particularly in the southernmost part.

TI  - Development of a novel radiotherapy motion phantom using a stepper motor driver circuit and evaluation using optical surface scanning
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in radiotherapy have focused on the management of patient motion during treatment. Studies have shown that significant gains in treatment quality can be made by 'gating' certain treatments, simultaneously keeping target coverage, and increasing separation to nearby organs at risk (OAR). Motion phantoms can be used to simulate patient breathing motion and provide the means to perform quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) of gating functionality as well as to assess the dosimetric impact of motion on individual patient treatments. The aim of this study was to design and build a motion phantom that accurately reproduces the breathing motion of patients to enable end-to-end gating system quality control of various gating systems as well as patient specific quality assurance. A motion phantom based on a stepper motor driver circuit was designed. The phantom can be programmed with both real patient data from an external gating system and with custom signals. The phantom was programmed and evaluated with patient data and with a square wave signal to be tracked with a Sentinel (TM) (C-Rad, Uppsala, Sweden) motion monitoring system. Results were compared to the original curves with respect to amplitude and phase. The comparison of patient curve data showed a mean error value of -0.09 mm with a standard deviation of 0.24 mm and a mean absolute error of 0.29 mm. The square wave signals could be reproduced with a mean error value of -0.03 mm, a standard deviation of 0.04 mm and a mean absolute error of 0.13 mm. Breathing curve data acquired from an optical scanning system can be reproduced accurately with the help of the in-house built motion phantom. The phantom can also be programmed to follow user designed curve data. This offers the potential for QC of gating systems and various dosimetric quality control applications.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - A practical approach for deriving all-weather soil moisture content using combined satellite and meteorological data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture has long been recognized as one of the essential variables in the water cycle and energy budget between Earth's surface and atmosphere. The present study develops a practical approach for deriving all-weather soil moisture using combined satellite images and gridded meteorological products. In this approach, soil moisture over the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) clear sky pixels are estimated from the Vegetation Index/Temperature (VIT) trapezoid scheme in which theoretical dry and wet edges were determined pixel to pixel by China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) meteorological products, including air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and specific humidity. For cloudy pixels, soil moisture values are derived by the calculation of surface and aerodynamic resistances from wind speed. The approach is capable of filling the soil moisture gaps over remaining cloudy pixels by traditional optical/thermal infrared methods, allowing for a spatially complete soil moisture map over large areas. Evaluation over agricultural fields indicates that the proposed approach can produce an overall generally reasonable distribution of all-weather soil moisture. An acceptable accuracy between the estimated all-weather soil moisture and in-situ measurements at different depths could be found with an Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) varying from 0.067 m(3)/m(3) to 0.079 m(3)/m(3) and a slight bias ranging from 0.004 m(3)/m(3) to 0.011 m(3)/m(3). The proposed approach reveals significant potential to derive all-weather soil moisture using currently available satellite images and meteorological products at a regional or global scale in future developments.

TI  - Production, Property, and the Construction of Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing, particularly satellite imaging, is widely used in scientific, government, and public applications. One of the reasons it is so highly valued is the perception of its fundamental objectivity and neutrality. Yet like all data, satellite imagery is a product of human action. Elements such as specific technologies, strategic priorities, and privileged interpretations influence the availability and applications of remotely sensed data. We therefore argue that careful examination of the epistemological, social, and political dimensions of these data is a crucial, yet relatively underdeveloped task, especially in the scientific literature. We conduct such an examination through the property regimes (or property rights regimes) framework developed by Schlager and Ostrom. Property regimes are the arrangements by which rights over particular goods are allocated, as well as the roles to which these rights are assigned and the rules that regulate this process. This framework is especially useful in revealing the large contextual variation in the production, use, and appropriation of particular goods, in this case remotely sensed data. Understanding remotely sensed data through the property regimes that govern them emphasizes the political and economic dimensions of this valuable resource and reveals its embeddedness in the world it intends to capture from afar. Thus, we show that to have a better grasp on the role of remotely sensed data in science, policy, and society, users must acknowledge the property regimes and other political interventions that are here shown to be indeed fundamental to their construction. ??, ???????, ???????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????, ????????????????????, ???????, ??????????, ??????????????????????, ????????????????????, ?????????????????, ??????????????????????????????

La percepcion remota, en particular el escaneo satelital, se usa por doquier en aplicaciones cientificas, gubernamentales y publicas. Una de las razones por las que esta tecnologia es tan altamente apreciada es la apreciacion que se tiene sobre su fundamental objetividad y neutralidad. No obstante, como todos los datos, la imagineria satelital es un producto de la accion humana. Elementos tales, como las tecnologias especificas, las prioridades estrategicas e interpretaciones privilegiadas determinan la disponibilidad y las aplicaciones de datos obtenidos por percepcion remota. Por eso nosotros arguimos que es crucial un examen cuidadoso de las dimensiones epistemologicas, sociales y politicas de estos datos, tarea relativamente subdesarrollada, especialmente en la literatura cientifica. Nosotros llevamos a cabo tal examen a traves del enfoque de regimenes de propiedad (o regimenes de los derechos de propiedad) desarrollado por Schlager y Ostrom. Los regimenes de propiedad son las disposiciones mediante las cuales se asignan derechos sobre bienes particulares, lo mismo que los roles sobre los cuales se asignan estos derechos y las reglas que regulan el proceso. Este esquema es especialmente util para revelar la gran variacion contextual en la produccion, uso y apropiacion de bienes particulares, que en este caso son los datos obtenidos por percepcion remota.Entender datos de percepcion remota a traves de los regimenes de propiedad que los gobierna enfatiza las dimensiones politicas y economicas de este valioso recurso, y revela su caracter embridado dentro del mundo que la percepcion remota intenta capturar desde lejos. Asi, pues, indicamos que, para agarrar mejor el papel de los datos percibidos de manera remota en ciencia, politica y sociedad, los usuarios deben reconocer los regimenes de propiedad y otras intervenciones politicas que aqui se muestran como ciertamente fundamentales para su construccion.

TI  - NATURALIZING PSYCHEDELIC SPIRITUALITY
T2  - ZYGON
M3  - Article
AB  - A pressing philosophical problem is how to respond to the existential, anxiety and disenchantment resulting from a naturalistic worldview that eschews transcendent foundations for meaning and value. This problem is becoming more urgent as the popularization of neuroscientific findings renders a disenchanted conception of human beings ever more vivid, compelling, and widespread. I argue that the study of transformative experiences occasioned by classic psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin may reveal the nature of a viable practical solution to this problem. Despite the apparent centrality of nonnaturalistic metaphysical apprehensions to psychedelic transformation, findings from psychedelic research suggest that key elements of psychedelic or "entheogenic" spirituality are consistent with naturalism. These include disruption to neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning the sense of self, and consequent experiences of self-transcendence and of the decoupling of attention from personal concerns. This liberation of attention can result in the availability of broader perspectives and the development of wonder and appreciation for life.

TI  - A Global Analysis of Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B and Landsat-8 Data Revisit Intervals and Implications for Terrestrial Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combination of different satellite data will provide increased opportunities for more frequent cloud-free surface observations due to variable cloud cover at the different satellite overpass times and dates. Satellite data from the polar-orbiting Landsat-8 (launched 2013), Sentinel-2A (launched 2015) and Sentinel-2B (launched 2017) sensors offer 10 m to 30 m multi-spectral global coverage. Together, they advance the virtual constellation paradigm for mid-resolution land imaging. In this study, a global analysis of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B metadata obtained from the committee on Earth Observation Satellite (CEOS) Visualization Environment (COVE) tool for 2016 is presented. A global equal area projection grid defined every 0.05 degrees is used considering each sensor and combined together. Histograms, maps and global summary statistics of the temporal revisit intervals (minimum, mean, and maximum) and the number of observations are reported. The temporal observation frequency improvements afforded by sensor combination are shown to be significant. In particular, considering Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-2B together will provide a global median average revisit interval of 2.9 days, and, over a year, a global median minimum revisit interval of 14 min (+/- 1 min) and maximum revisit interval of 7.0 days.

TI  - A New Global Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Product at a 1-km Resolution for 2010 to 2100 Based on Human-Environment Interactions
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) data are crucial for modeling a wide range of environmental conditions. So far, access to high-resolution LUCC products at a global scale for public use is difficult because of data and technical issues. This article presents a Future Land-Use Simulation (FLUS) system to simulate global LUCC in relation to human-environment interactions, which is built and verified by using remote sensing data. IMAGE has been widely used in environmental studies despite its relatively coarse spatial resolution of 30 arc-min, which is about 55km at the equator. Recently, an improved model has been developed to simulate global LUCC with a 5-min resolution (about 10km at the equator). We found that even the 10-km resolution, however, still produced major distortions in land-use patterns, leading urban land areas to be underestimated by 19.77 percent at the global scale and global land change relating to urban growth to be underestimated by 60 to 97 percent, compared with the 1-km resolution model proposed through this article. These distortions occurred because a large percentage of small areas of urban land was merged into other land-use classes. During land-use change simulation, a majority of small urban clusters were also lost using the IMAGE product. Responding to these deficiencies, the 1-km FLUS product developed in this study is able to provide the spatial detail necessary to identify spatial heterogeneous land-use patterns at a global scale. We argue that this new global land-use product has strong potential in radically reducing uncertainty in global environmental modeling. ????????????

Los datos sobre cambios del uso del suelo y de cobertura de la tierra (LUCC) a nivel global son cruciales para modelar una amplia gama de condiciones ambientales. Hasta ahora, el acceso a productos de los LUCC a escala global para uso publico es dificil debido a problemas tecnicos y de datos. Este articulo presenta un sistema de Simulacion de Uso Futuro del Suelo (FLUS) para simular los LUCC globales en relacion con las interacciones humano-ambientales, el cual esta construido y verificado mediante el uso de datos originados por percepcion remota. El IMAGE ha sido ampliamente utilizado en estudios ambientales a pesar de su resolucion espacial relativamente ruda de 30 minutos de arco, que es de alrededor de 55km sobre el ecuador. Recientemente, se ha desarrollado un modelo mejorado para simular los LUCC globales con una resolucion de 5-minutos (alrededor de 10km en el ecuador). Sin embargo, hallamos que incluso la resolucion de 10-km sigue produciendo distorsiones importantes en los patrones de uso del suelo, lo cual conduce a la subestimacion de las areas de suelo urbano en un 19.77 por ciento en la escala global y a que el cambio global de la tierra relacionado con el crecimiento urbano se subestime entre un 60 a un 97 por ciento, comparado con el modelo de 1-km de resolucion propuesto en este articulo.Estas distorsiones ocurrieron debido a que un porcentaje grande de areas pequenas de tierra urbana se consolidaron con otros tipos de usos del suelo. Durante la simulacion del cambio de uso del suelo usando el producto IMAGE tambien se perdieron una mayoria de los pequenos agrupamientos urbanos. Respondiendo a estas deficiencias, el producto FLUS de 1-km desarrollado en este estudio tiene la capacidad de proveer el detalle espacial que se necesita para identificar los patrones espaciales de usos heterogeneos del suelo a escala global. Sostenemos que este nuevo producto para calcular el uso del suelo global tiene fuerte potencial para reducir radicalmente la incertidumbre en el modelado ambiental global.

TI  - Ground Moving Target Imaging and Motion Parameter Estimation With Airborne Dual-Channel CSSAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with the issue of ground moving target imaging and motion parameter estimation with an airborne dual-channel circular stripmap synthetic aperture radar (CSSAR) system. Although several methods of ground moving target motion parameter estimation have been proposed for the conventional airborne linear stripmap SAR, they cannot be applied to airborne CSSAR because the range history of a ground moving target for airborne CSSAR is different than that for airborne linear stripmap SAR. In this paper, the moving target's range history for airborne dual-channel CSSAR and the target signal model after the displaced phase center antenna processing are derived, and a new ground moving target imaging and motion parameter estimation algorithm is developed. In this algorithm, the estimation of baseband Doppler centroid and its compensation are first performed. Then focusing is implemented in the 2-D frequency domain via phase multiplication, and the target is focused in the SAR image without azimuth displacement due to the compensation of the Doppler shift caused by its motion. Finally, the target's motion parameters are estimated with its Doppler parameters and its position in the SAR image. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the derived range history and the performance of the proposed algorithm.

TI  - Examining the Driving Factors Causing Rapid Urban Expansion in China: An Analysis Based on GlobeLand30 Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A large number of studies have dealt with the driven forces of land expansion, in which the remote sensing data and statistical data are most commonly used. The recent progress based on the statistical data have not been fully tested and discussed by the remote sensing data, and the remote sensing data used in the previous studies are usually interpreted within certain areas which is not convenient for global comparison. In this paper, the 30-m GlobalLand Cover Dataset (GlobeLand30) and socioeconomic data from 2000 to 2010 are adopted to investigate the factors driving impervious surface expansion in China based on a multilevel regression model. The GlobeLand30 provides a world-wide data framework which has a sound basis for regional comparison research. The variables are selected according to the existing research. Most, but not all, results are consistent with the previous studies when using impervious surface data of GlobeLand30. The main findings are: (1) the market demand caused by economic development, such as the increase in GDP from 2000 to 2010, plays a positive role in the expansion of developed land; (2) the land supply, as reflected by the ratio of the total of land transfer fees to fiscal revenue, also has a positive effect on the increase in impervious surfaces; (3) the percentage of the increase by private workers to the increase in total workers and certain other frequently-used variables are not relevant after controlling for land demand-and supply-related variables; and (4) the growth in impervious surfaces is related to the amount of the cultivated land, which implies the necessity for a more stringent farmland protection policy. Considering the need to compare across regions, we suggest that GlobeLand30 should be used for more studies to better understand the driving forces of land expansion.

TI  - Split-Band Interferometry-Assisted Phase Unwrapping for the Phase Ambiguities Correction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Split-Band Interferometry (SBInSAR) exploits the large range bandwidth of the new generation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors to process images at subrange bandwidth. Its application to an interferometric pair leads to several lower resolution interferograms of the same scene with slightly shifted central frequencies. When SBInSAR is applied to frequency-persistent scatterers, the linear trend of the phase through the stack of interferograms can be used to perform absolute and spatially independent phase unwrapping. While the height computation has been the main concern of studies on SBInSAR so far, we propose instead to use it to assist conventional phase unwrapping. During phase unwrapping, phase ambiguities are introduced when parts of the interferogram are separately unwrapped. The proposed method reduces the phase ambiguities so that the phase can be connected between separately unwrapped regions. The approach is tested on a pair of TerraSAR-X spotlight images of Copahue volcano, Argentina. In this framework, we propose two new criteria for the frequency-persistent scatterers detection, based respectively on the standard deviation of the slope of the linear regression and on the phase variance stability, and we compare them to the multifrequency phase error. Both new criteria appear to be more suited to our approach than the multifrequency phase error. We validate the SBInSAR-assisted phase unwrapping method by artificially splitting a continuous phase region into disconnected subzones. Despite the decorrelation and the steep topography affecting the volcanic test region, the expected phase ambiguities are successfully recovered whatever the chosen criterion to detect the frequency-persistent scatterers. Comparing the aspect ratio of the distributions of the computed phase ambiguities, the analysis shows that the phase variance stability is the most efficient criterion to select stable targets and the slope standard deviation gives satisfactory results.

AB  - BackgroundLittle is known about the joint mental health effects of air pollution and tobacco smoking in low- and middle-income countries.AimsTo investigate the effects of exposure to ambient fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) and smoking and their combined (interactive) effects on depression.MethodMultilevel logistic regression analysis of baseline data of a prospective cohort study (n = 41 7 85). The 3-year average concentrations of PM2.5 were estimated using US National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite data, and depression was diagnosed using a standardised questionnaire. Three-level logistic regression models were applied to examine the associations with depression.ResultsThe odds ratio (OR) for depression was 1.09 (95% Cl 1.01-1.17) per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in ambient PM2.5, and the association remained after adjusting for potential confounding factors (adjusted OR=1.10, 95% Cl 1.02-1.19). Tobacco smoking (smoking status, frequency, duration and amount) was also significantly associated with depression. There appeared to be a synergistic interaction between ambient PM2.5 and smoking on depression in the additive model, but the interaction was not statistically significant in the multiplicative model.ConclusionsOur study suggests that exposure to ambient PM2.5 may increase the risk of depression, and smoking may enhance this effect.

TI  - The strength of the meridional overturning circulation of the stratosphere
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of gases such as ozone and water vapour in the stratosphere-which affect surface climate-is influenced by the meridional overturning of mass in the stratosphere, the Brewer-Dobson circulation. However, observation-based estimates of the global strength of this circulation are difficult to obtain. Here we present two calculations of the mean strength of the meridional overturning of the stratosphere. We analyse satellite data that document the global diabatic circulation between 2007-2011, and compare these to three reanalysis data sets and to simulations with a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model. Using measurements of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrous oxide, we calculate the global mean diabatic overturning mass flux throughout the stratosphere. In the lower stratosphere, these two estimates agree, and at a potential temperature level of 460 K (about 20 km or 60 hPa in tropics) the global circulation strength is 6.3-7.6 x 10(9) kg s(-1). Higher in the atmosphere, only the SF6-based estimate is available, and it diverges from the reanalysis data and simulations. Interpretation of the SF6-data-based estimate is limited because of a mesospheric sink of SF6; however, the reanalyses also differ substantially from each other. We conclude that the uncertainty in the mean meridional overturning circulation strength at upper levels of the stratosphere amounts to at least 100%.

TI  - Assessing spatiotemporal eco-environmental vulnerability by Landsat data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - An indicator of quantifying eco-environmental vulnerability was established by synthesizing 12 variables, mainly retrieved from satellite data with incorporation of analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Six vulnerability levels of potential, slight, light; medium, heavy, and very heavy were graded to depict changes of vulnerability over temporal and spatial scales. The proposed approach was employed to study spatiotemporal eco-environmental vulnerability with Landsat data acquired in 1989, 2003, and 2014 for the Thua Thien - Hue Province, Vietnam. Over the time periods of 1989-2003 and 2003-2014, both heavy and very heavy vulnerability levels exhibit an increasing trend in both magnitude and spatial size: The former raised from 5.9% in 1989, to 7.9% in 2003, and 15% in 2014; and the later increased from 1.2% in 1989, to 3.2% in 2003, and 7.3% in 2014. Both levels mainly appeared on urbanized area, bare land, semi-bare land, agricultural land, and sparse forests. In contrast, there was a significant decline in potential vulnerability level with 36.4% in 1989, 30.9% in 2003, and 19.2% in 2014, while the remaining vulnerability levels slight, light, and medium fluctuated slightly, increased in 2003 and decreased in 2014. Supporting reasons for such changes include: (1) deforestation, agriculture intensification, construction of three hydro-electric projects during the period 2003-2014; and (2) significant expansion of urbanized area leading to differences in thermal signatures in urban areas as compared with rural areas. The findings demonstrate that eco-environmental vulnerability is primarily exaggerated by anthropogenic activities through land use/land cover (LULC) changes and further enhanced by natural processes including disasters in the Thua Thien - Hue Province of Vietnam. The correlation between land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) is found to be positively correlated with 0.87, 0.89, and 0.84 for 1989, 2003, and 2014, respectively. In contrast, LST-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is found negatively correlated with respect to the spatiotemporal trend of environmental vulnerability with -0.81, -0.81, and -0.76 in 1989, 2003, and 2014, respectively. In addition, areas having potential, slight, and medium thermal environmental levels are decreased from 1989 to 2003 to 2003-2014. At the regional scale, increased anthropogenic activities through land's modification have intensified the eco-environmental vulnerability in the study area. The currently proposed methodology is feasible for evaluating long-term eco-environmental changes processes by using remote sensing data, and valid for the other regions.

TI  - Stratigraphic Formation of the Mekong River Delta and Its Recent Shoreline Changes
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Where the Mekong River discharges into the East Sea ( also known as the South China Sea), it has formed the world's third largest delta plain with an area of similar to 50,000 km(2). Numerous cores recovered from the subaerial delta reveal that it has prograded similar to 220 km southeastward within the past 7,500 years. Recent extensive seismic and geochemical surveys of the adjacent subaqueous delta indicate that the Mekong River forms a classic sigmoidal, cross-shelf clinoform immediately off its distributaries that is up to 15 m thick, with topset, foreset, and bottomset facies. These deposits are constrained within water depths of 20 m. Mekong-derived sediment packages extend similar to 300 km along shelf in the southwestward direction to the tip of the Ca Mau Peninsula, where they form a distal mud depocenter up to 22 m thick. These sediment packages can also be traced into the Gulf of Thailand to water depths of 25 m. The proximal and distal deposits cover similar to 11,000 km(2) of the shelf.Historically, the Mekong Delta has prograded seaward at a mean rate of > 30 m yr(-1), or 7 km(2) yr(-1); however, study of the past 43 years of Landsat images indicates that the mode of sedimentation in the delta shifted starting in 2005. From 1973 to 2005, the Mekong Delta's seaward shoreline growth decreased gradually from a mean of 7.8 m yr(-1) to 2.8 m yr(-1) and after 2005 it became negative, with a retreat rate of -1.4 m yr(-1). The net deltaic land area gain has also been slowing, with the mean rate decreasing from 4.3 km(2) yr(-1) (1973-1979) to 1.0 km(2) yr(-1) (1995-2005), and then to -0.05 km(2) yr(-1) (2005-2015). Thus, in about 2005, the subaerial Mekong Delta transitioned from a constructive mode to an erosional (or destructive) mode. Furthermore, not only is the subaerial Mekong Delta land area gradually diminishing, but high-resolution CHIRP sonar profiling surveys off the east-central Ca Mau Peninsula reveal that this portion of the subaqueous delta is also eroding. With the construction of more dams, sand mining, delta subsidence, increasing storms, and sea level rise, the Mekong Delta will likely face more destructive changes, with erosion both of coastlines and underwater deposits.

TI  - Alike Scene Retrieval from Land-Cover Products Based on the Label Co-Occurrence Matrix (LCM)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The management and application of remotely sensed data has become much more difficult due to the dramatically growing volume of remotely sensed imagery. To address this issue, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been applied to remote sensing image retrieval for information mining. As a consequence of the growing volume of remotely sensed imagery, the number of different types of image-derived products (such as land use/land cover (LULC) databases) is also increasing rapidly. Nevertheless, only a few studies have addressed the exploration and information mining of these products. In this letter, for the sake of making the most use of the LULC map, we propose an approach for the retrieval of alike scenes from it. Based on the proposed approach, we design a content-based map retrieval (CBMR) system for LULC. The main contributions of our work are listed below. Firstly, the proposed system can allow the user to select a region of interest as the reference scene with variable shape and size. In contrast, in the traditional CBIR/CBMR systems, the region of interest is usually of a fixed size, which is equal to the size of the analysis window for extracting features. In addition, the user can acquire various retrieval results by specifying the corresponding parameters. Finally, by combining the signatures in the base signature library, the user can acquire the retrieval result faster.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the ground observations were compared to the ERA-Interim, NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis, MODIS ET product, and emerging offline SEBS ET data sets in the Yellow River source region of the Tibet Plateau. In general, the slopes of linear least squares exhibit differences, with ERAInterim, NCEP-DOE, MOD16, and SEBS slopes of 0.88 +/- 0.05, 0.64 +/- 0.07, 0.66 +/- 0.17, and 1.24 +/- 0.97 respectively. ERA-Interim was found superior with ground observations to others; therefore, it provided a good representation of the study area. Based on the ERA-Interim ET product, the Sen's slope estimator and the Mann-Kendall (MK) test were applied to quantify the significance of the shifts in trends, while the moving t-test and MK test characterized abrupt changes. The results show that the Yellow River source region experienced a statistical increase in evapotranspiration (ET) in the northern part and a decrease in the southern part of the region from 1979 to 2014 at rates of approximately 1.65 and -0.50 mm/yr, respectively. The shift in the annual ET trend was more pronounced, and abrupt changes were detected in the 1980s. Precipitation was the most dominant factor affecting ET variation, whereas surface temperature was the least influential.

TI  - A PRELIMINARY STUDY ON THE 3DVAR ASSIMILATION OF THE AMSU-A DATA IN SPACE-TIME MULTISCALE ANALYSIS SYSTEM
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilating satellite radiances into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models has become an important approach to increase the accuracy of numerical weather forecasting. In this study, the assimilation technique scheme was employed in NOAA's STMAS (Space-Time Multiscale Analysis System) to assimilate AMSU-A radiances data. Channel selection sensitivity experiments were conducted on assimilated satellite data in the first place. Then, real case analysis of AMSU-A data assimilation was performed. The analysis results showed that, following assimilating of AMSU-A channels 5-11 in STMAS, the objective function quickly converged, and the channel vertical response was consistent with the AMSU-A weighting function distribution, which suggests that the channels can be used in the assimilation of satellite data in STMAS. With the case of the Typhoon Morakot in Taiwan Island in August 2009 as an example, experiments on assimilated and unassimilated AMSU-A radiances data were designed to analyze the impact of the assimilation of satellite data on STMAS. The results demonstrated that assimilation of AMSU-A data provided more accurate prediction of the precipitation region and intensity, and especially, it improved the 0-6h precipitation forecast significantly.

TI  - APPLICATION OF ENERGY AND WATER BALANCE METHODS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON WHEAT EVAPOTRANSPIRATION RATES
T2  - BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a problem of water shortage in Henan Province, it is necessary to study the evapotranspiration of wheat field, in order to make reasonable allocation of agricultural water resources. Water balance method (WB) is used to measure the evapotranspiration of the point, and the energy balance (EB) method and the eddy correlation (ECV) rule is used to estimate the evapotranspiration of large scale. Through the study, the correlation coefficient of the energy balance method and water balance method was 0.99. The instantaneous value of the energy balance method was higher, but the daily average value was close to the normal level. Finally, it is pointed out that in energy balance method is used to calculate evapotranspiration calculated Bowen ration the key is usually used on a weighted average value instead of the instantaneous values of the error can be eliminated. The results show that energy balance method can fasten and continuous monitor crop evapotranspiration, which has reference significance for guiding the local agricultural water resource disposition.

TI  - Spatiotemporally monitoring forest landscape for giant panda habitat through a high learning-sensitive neural network in Guanyinshan Nature Reserve in the Qinling Mountains, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 1970s and 1990s, Guanyinshan Nature Reserve (GNR), a giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) distribution area historically, had experienced periodic commercial logging. After officially logging stopping in 1998 and converting to a giant panda nature reserve in 2002, GNR got the chance on forest restoration. It is very necessary to monitor the spatiotemporal change of its forest habitat. It is also widely known that it is difficult to make accurate mapping the mountainous area based on images through traditional classification algorithm. So, this study aims to monitor the spatiotemporal change of mountainous habitat in GNR in order to provide proper suggestions for giant panda conservation. The research applied a multilayer perceptron model, a high learning-sensitive algorithm, to classify the land cover types and monitor habitat change in GNR by using Landsat images acquired in 1978, 1988, 1997 and 2007, respectively. Our results showed that: (1) three types of forests composed the main landscape of the GNR, and an increase of 7.7% forest coverage occurred within 30 years. (2) Due to logging, there were many forest clearing-cutting areas in 1997 and swaths of shrub-grass in 1978 and 1988. However, these two types of landscape were strongly reduced by 2007 due to more attention and protection. (3) A decrease in the number of patches, an increase in the mean patch size, and an over-time decreasing in the mean nearest neighbor distance all revealed a decreasing on habitat fragmentation. Therefore, reduction in detrimental human activities has helped enhance and expand giant panda habitat toward a healthier and more stable ecosystem.

TI  - Coupling the Modified Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis and Pixel-Swapping Methods for Improving Subpixel Water Mapping: Application to the Pearl River Delta, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution water mapping with remotely sensed data is essential to monitoring of rainstorm waterlogging and flood disasters. In this study, a modified linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) method is proposed to extract high-precision water fraction maps. In the modified LSMA, the pure water and mixed water-land pixels, which are extracted by the Otsu method and a morphological dilation operation, are used to improve the accuracy of water fractions. The modified LSMA is applied to the 18 October 2015 Landsat 8 OLI image of the Pearl River Delta for the extraction of water fractions. Based on the water fraction maps, a modified subpixel mapping method (MSWM) based on a pixel-swapping algorithm is proposed for obtaining the spatial distribution information of water at subpixel scale. The MSWM includes two steps in subpixel water mapping. The MSWM considers the inter-subpixel/pixel and intra-subpixel/subpixel spatial attractions. Subpixel water mapping is first implemented with the inter-subpixel/pixel spatial attractions, which are estimated using the distance between a given subpixel and its surrounding pixels and the water fractions of the surrounding pixels. Based on the initialized subpixel water mapping results, the final subpixel water maps are determined by a modified pixel-swapping algorithm, in which the intra-subpixel/subpixel spatial attractions are estimated using the initialized subpixel water maps and an inverse-distance weighted function of the current subpixel at the centre of a moving window with its surrounding subpixels within the window. The subpixel water mapping performance of the MSWM is compared with that of subpixel mapping for linear objects (SPML) and that of the subpixel/pixel spatial attraction model (SPSAM) using the GF-1 reference image from 20 October 2015. The experimental results show that the MSWM shows better subpixel water mapping performance and obtains more details than SPML and SPSAM, as it has the largest overall accuracy values and Kappa coefficients. Furthermore, the MSWM can significantly eliminate the phenomenon of jagged edges and has smooth continuous edges.

TI  - Sampling errors in satellite-derived infrared sea-surface temperatures. Part II: Sensitivity and parameterization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent work of Liu and Minnett (2016), we estimated the sampling errors in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Sea-Surface Temperatures (SSTs) due to clouds and other causes, and characterized the global error dependence on the variability of clouds and SST. Here we report sampling error sensitivity to the choice of reference field and the error variation when data from a different year are used. We also developed an empirical model to parameterize sampling errors. Our sensitivity tests show that the sampling error quantification method developed is robust and can reveal the consequences of missing infrared SST observations primarily due to clouds. Since the previously found pronounced negative sampling errors along the Tropical Instability Waves are largely dependent on the SST gradients, here these regional sampling errors are quantified using data from an El Nino year, confirming that the weakened meridional SST gradient due to El Nino can reduce the negative sampling errors. Furthermore, the climatology-derived sampling errors are found to be a primary component that can be utilized to estimate and parameterize the sampling errors, especially for the spatial sampling errors. For the temporal sampling errors, good estimates are obtained especially in the high latitudes and stratocumulus regions, by incorporating an empirical model proposed in this study and the previously found sampling error dependence.

TI  - Diversification of Land Surface Temperature Change under Urban Landscape Renewal: A Case Study in the Main City of Shenzhen, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unprecedented rapid urbanization in China during the past several decades has been accompanied by extensive urban landscape renewal, which has increased the urban thermal environmental risk. However, landscape change is a sufficient but not necessary condition for land surface temperature (LST) variation. Many studies have merely highlighted the correlation between landscape pattern and LST, while neglecting to comprehensively present the spatiotemporal diversification of LST change under urban landscape renewal. Taking the main city of Shenzhen as a case study area, this study tracked the landscape renewal and LST variation for the period 1987-2015 using 49 Landsat images. A decision tree algorithm suitable for fast landscape type interpretation was developed to map the landscape renewal. Analytical tools that identified hot-cold spots, the gravity center, and transect of LST movement were adopted to identify LST changes. The results showed that the spatial variation of LST was not completely consistent with landscape change. The transformation from Green landscape to Grey landscape usually increased the LST within a median of 0.2 degrees C, while the reverse transformation did not obviously decrease the LST (the median was nearly 0 degrees C). The median of LST change from Blue landscape to Grey landscape was 1.0 degrees C, corresponding to 0.5 degrees C in the reverse transformation. The imbalance of LST change between the loss and gain of Green or Blue landscape indicates the importance of protecting natural space, where the benefits in terms of temperature mitigation cannot be completely substituted by reverse transformation.

T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 21st century "Maritime Silk Road" strategy is a significant part of the belt and road initiatives of China. The cognition and investigation of ocean environment is essential and necessary in these regions which will provide scientific reference for many fields such as navigation, ocean engineering, and disaster prevent and reduction. A high-resolution cross-calibrated multi-platform wind product is used to analyze gales over the Maritime Silk Road. The yearly mean speed and space distribution of gale, and the frequencies and trends of gale and extreme wind speed are analyzed. The results show that relatively high pools of gale are mainly located in the waters of the Arabian Sea, the Somali Sea, Indo-China Peninsula sea area, and Bay of Bengal in the summer. The gale frequency of the Somali Sea is more than 90%. Overall, the gale days increase year by year in the majority of the South China Sea and the northern Indian Ocean, especially in the autumn and the winter.

M3  - Review
AB  - Assessing the inherent uncertainties in satellite data products is a challenging task. Different technical approaches have been developed in the Earth Observation (EO) communities to address the validation problem which results in a large variety of methods as well as terminology. This paper reviews state-of-the-art methods of satellite validation and documents their similarities and differences. First, the overall validation objectives and terminologies are specified, followed by a generic mathematical formulation of the validation problem. Metrics currently used as well as more advanced EO validation approaches are introduced thereafter. An outlook on the applicability and requirements of current EO validation approaches and targets is given.

TI  - Evaluating the sensitivity of glacier to climate by using stable water isotopes and remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Himalayan Mountain system are undergoing rapid retreat, and the global climate change has a significant impact on it. In the present study, we used stable water isotope and remote sensing data to understand the impact of climate on melting behavior of some high-altitude glaciers in two glacier-fed basins of western Himalaya, India. Glacier samples were collected from four major glaciers of Liddar (Kashmir region) and Suru basins (Ladakh region) during melting season from May 2012 to November 2013 for delta O-18 and delta H-2. It was observed that the glacier samples from Suru basin were more depleted in O-18 and H-2 (-10.9 to -16.2 parts per thousand and -73 to -128 parts per thousand) than the glaciers of Liddar basin (-8.2 to -14.9 parts per thousand and -52 to -102 parts per thousand). However, the d-excess of the glacier samples in Suru basin was lower (13.5-21.6 parts per thousand) than the glaciers of Liddar basin (17-28 parts per thousand). It was observed that the temporal changes in weather pattern strongly influence the isotopic composition of the glaciers with progressive decrease and increase in delta O-18 (or delta H-2) with the increase in ambient temperature and rainfall, respectively. The results suggest that during the sunny days of August and September, the glaciers are melting at higher altitudes (3900-4172 m) in the accumulation zone, reflecting that the glaciers of Liddar basin are not the ideal sites for the ice coring for paleoclimatological studies. The study also revealed that 20% glacier extent (glacierized area) in Liddar basin has been lost in <35 years, which is quite higher than that of Suru basin (2%)

AB  - Objective. Sentinel lymph node mapping, alone or in combination with pelvic lymphadenectomy, is considered a standard approach in staging of patients with cervical or endometrial cancer [1-3]. The goal of this video is to demonstrate the use of indocyanine green (ICG) and color-segmented fluorescence when performing lymphatic mapping in patients with gynecologic malignancies.Methods. Injection of ICG is performed in two cervical sites using 1 mL (0.5 mL superficial and deep, respectively) at the 3 and 9 o'clock position. Sentinel lymph nodes are identified intraoperatively using the Pinpoint near-infrared imaging system (Novadaq, Ontario, CA). Color-segmented fluorescence is used to image different levels of ICG uptake demonstrating higher levels of perfusion. A color key on the side of the monitor shows the colors that coordinate with different levels of ICG uptake. Color-segmented fluorescence may help surgeons identify true sentinel nodes from fatty tissue that, although absorbing fluorescent dye, does not contain true nodal tissue. It is not intended to differentiate the primary sentinel node from secondary sentinel nodes. The key ranges from low levels of ICG uptake (gray) to the highest rate of ICG uptake (red).Results. Bilateral sentinel lymph nodes are identified along the external iliac vessels using both standard and color-segmented fluorescence. No evidence of disease was noted after ultra-staging was performed in each of the sentinel nodes.Conclusion. Use of ICG in sentinel lymph node mapping allows for high bilateral detection rates. Color segmented fluorescence may increase accuracy of sentinel lymph node identification over standard fluorescent imaging. The following are the supplementary data related to this article.

TI  - VALIDITY AND USABILITY OF A NEW SYSTEM FOR MEASURING AND MONITORING VARIATIONS IN VERTICAL JUMP PERFORMANCE
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical jump (VJ) height is one of the most sensitive measures to quantify training-related fatigue and athletic performance in elite athletes. Currently, however, there is no equipment designed to graphically deliver the daily performance changes in VJ compared with the smallest worthwhile change (SWC), which is considered essential in "progressive statistics" to judge meaningful performance fluctuations. The aims of the study were to analyze the criterion validity of a new contact mat (i.e., Elite Jump), alongside testing its usability to detect meaningful changes in VJ of elite team sport athletes. A total of 31 athletes participated in the criterion validity part of the study, whereas 17 rugby players participated in the VJ sensitivity part. When compared with the force plate, the contact mat produced squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ) values with very high intraclass correlation coefficients (0.998 and 0.997, respectively) and very low biases (-0.11 and -0.08 cm, respectively), as assessed by the Bland-Altman plot. In addition, during a training microcycle, rugby players presented identical meaningful changes in performance in both SJ and CMJ when comparing the Elite Jump and Hopkins' spreadsheet outputs. Therefore, the contact mat is valid and the proprietary software can properly execute the SWC calculations, providing coaches and researchers with accurate information concerning variations in the physical performance of elite athletes.

TI  - Combining Multi-Source Remotely Sensed Data and a Process-Based Model for Forest Aboveground Biomass Updating
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and understanding the spatio-temporal variations of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is a key basis to quantitatively assess the carbon sequestration capacity of a forest ecosystem. To map and update forest AGB in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM) of China, this work proposes a physical-based approach. Based on the baseline forest AGB from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images in 2008, we dynamically updated the annual forest AGB from 2009 to 2012 by adding the annual AGB increment (ABI) obtained from the simulated daily and annual net primary productivity (NPP) using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model. The 2012 result was validated by both field-and aerial laser scanning (ALS)-based AGBs. The predicted forest AGB for 2012 estimated from the process-based model can explain 31% (n = 35, p < 0.05, RMSE = 2.20 kg/m(2)) and 85% (n = 100, p < 0.01, RMSE = 1.71 kg/m(2)) of variation in field-and ALS-based forest AGBs, respectively. However, due to the saturation of optical remote sensing-based spectral signals and contribution of understory vegetation, the BEPS-based AGB tended to underestimate/overestimate the AGB for dense/sparse forests. Generally, our results showed that the remotely sensed forest AGB estimates could serve as the initial carbon pool to parameterize the process-based model for NPP simulation, and the combination of the baseline forest AGB and BEPS model could effectively update the spatiotemporal distribution of forest AGB.

TI  - Remote Sensing Scene Classification by Unsupervised Representation Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of the satellite sensor technology, high spatial resolution remote sensing (HSR) data have attracted extensive attention in military and civilian applications. In order to make full use of these data, remote sensing scene classification becomes an important and necessary precedent task. In this paper, an unsupervised representation learning method is proposed to investigate deconvolution networks for remote sensing scene classification. First, a shallow weighted deconvolution network is utilized to learn a set of feature maps and filters for each image by minimizing the reconstruction error between the input image and the convolution result. The learned feature maps can capture the abundant edge and texture information of high spatial resolution images, which is definitely important for remote sensing images. After that, the spatial pyramid model (SPM) is used to aggregate features at different scales to maintain the spatial layout of HSR image scene. A discriminative representation for HSR image is obtained by combining the proposed weighted deconvolution model and SPM. Finally, the representation vector is input into a support vector machine to finish classification. We apply our method on two challenging HSR image data sets: the UCMerced data set with 21 scene categories and the Sydney data set with seven land-use categories. All the experimental results achieved by the proposed method outperform most state of the arts, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Objective To investigate the epidemiological and pathogenic characteristics of viral diarrhea in Minhang District of Shanghai. Methods Random sampling on diarrhea was conducted in intestinal outpatient departments of 2 sentinel hospitals according to a certain sampling interval in Minhang District from 2014 to 2016. Real-time PCR was used to detect rotavirus (RV), norovirus (NV), adenovirus (AD), astrovirus (AstV) and sapovirus (SaV) in fecal samples. Results A total of 11 243 cases of diarrhea were monitored in 2 sentinel hospitals during 2014 and 2016,with 3 213,3 600 and 4 430 cases for each year, respectively. Out of 809 stool specimens,309 were tested positively, and the positive rate was 38. 48%. All 5 pathogenic viruses were detected, mostly NV (207 cases,66. 99 %) followed by RV (77 cases, 24. 92%). Conclusions NV accounted for the majority of reported infection diarrhea cases in Minhang District of Shanghai from 2014 to 2016, with significant seasonal peaks. Tailored prevention and control measures should be carried out, particularly in risk seasons.

TI  - Comparison of Canopy Cover Estimations From Airborne LiDAR, Aerial Imagery, and Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy cover is an important forest structure parameter for many applications in ecology, hydrology, and forest management. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a promising tool for estimating canopy cover because it can penetrate forest canopy. Various algorithms have been developed to calculate canopy cover from LiDAR data. However, little attention was paid to evaluating how different factors, such as estimation algorithm, LiDAR point density and scan angle, influence canopy cover estimates; and how LiDAR-derived canopy cover differs from estimates using traditional methods, such as field measurements, aerial and satellite imagery. In this study, we systematically compared canopy cover estimations from LiDAR data, quick field measurements, aerial imagery, and satellite imagery using different algorithms. The results show that LiDAR-derived canopy cover estimates are marginally influenced by the estimation algorithms. LiDAR data with a point density of 1 point/m(2) can generate comparable canopy cover estimates to data with a higher density. The uncertainty of canopy cover estimates from LiDAR data increased drastically as scan angles exceed 12 degrees. Plot-level canopy cover estimates derived from quick field measurements do not have strong correlation with LiDAR-derived estimations. Both the aerial imagery-derived and satellite imagery-derived canopy cover estimates are comparable to LiDAR-derived canopy cover estimates at the forest stand scale, but tend to be overestimated in sparse forests and be underestimated in dense forests, particularly for the aerial imagery-derived estimates. The results from this study can provide practical guidance for the selection of data sources, sampling schemes, and estimation methods in regional canopy cover mapping.

TI  - Mapping key soil properties to support agricultural production in Eastern China
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial prediction of soil attributes plays important roles in establishing areas for agricultural development and sustainable land management. This paper aimed to model and map various soil properties (i.e. texture, pH, and soil organic matter content) at a spatial resolution of 90 m across a 21 million-ha. area in Eastern China using 2895 legacy topsoil observations coupled with freely available covariates (i.e. DEM, Landsat, Climate and Radar data). A decision tree model (Cubist) and a Regression Kriging (RK) approach were used in the modelling process. The prediction results showed that the RK approach achieved high accuracy in predicting the spatial distributions of soil properties that were affected by human activities (i.e. soil pH and organic matter content). Moreover, DEM data decomposed to different spatial scales and climate factors were found to be the most important predictors in this study area. It was concluded that the current methodology can be readily expanded to the whole China using existing soil data as a contribution to the GlobalSoilMap project.

TI  - Quaternary sediment architecture in the Orkhon Valley (central Mongolia) inferred from capacitive coupled resistivity and Georadar measurements
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information on shallow sediment distribution in basins is required to achieve solutions for problems in Quaternary geology, geomorphology, neotectonics, (geo)archaeology, and climatology. Usually, detailed information is obtained by studying outcrops and shallow drillings. Unfortunately, such data are often sparsely distributed and thus cannot characterise entire basins in detail. Therefore, they are frequently combined with remote sensing methods to overcome this limitation. Remote sensing can cover entire basins but provides information of the land surface only. Geophysical methods can close the gap between detailed sequences of the shallow sediment inventory from drillings at a few spots and continuous surface information from remote sensing. However, their interpretation in terms of sediment types is often challenging, especially if permafrost conditions complicate their interpretation. Here we present an approach for the joint interpretation of the geophysical methods ground penetrating radar (GPR) and capacitive coupled resistivity (CCR), drill core, and remote sensing data. The methods GPR and CCR were chosen because they allow relatively fast surveying and provide complementary information. We apply the approach to the middle Orkhon Valley in central Mongolia where fluvial, alluvial, and aeolian processes led to complex sediment architecture.The GPR and CCR data, measured on profiles with a total length of about 60 km, indicate the presence of two distinct layers over the complete surveying area: (i) a thawed layer at the surface, and (ii) a frozen layer below. In a first interpretation step, we establish a geophysical classification by considering the geophysical signatures of both layers. We use sedimentological information from core logs to relate the geophysical classes to sediment types. This analysis reveals internal structures of Orkhon River sediments, such as channels and floodplain sediments. We also distinguish alluvial fan deposits and aeolian sediments by their distinct geophysical signature. With this procedure we map aeolian sediments, debris flow sediments, floodplains, and channel sediments along the measured profiles in the entire basin.We show that the joint interpretation of drillings and geophysical profile measurements matches the information from remote sensing data, i.e., the sediment architecture of vast areas can be characterised by combining these techniques. The method presented here proves powerful for characterising large areas with minimal effort and can be applied to similar settings.

TI  - Internal Waves Along the Malvinas Current EVIDENCE OF TRANSCRITICAL GENERATION IN SATELLITE IMAGERY
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - An extended satellite image data set is used to investigate the twodimensional structure of internal waves (IWs) that propagate along the Patagonian shelf break and continental slope in the opposite direction of the Malvinas Current (MC). Intense surface manifestations of IWs are found throughout the semidiurnal and fortnightly tidal cycles, propagating more than 1,000 km in the along-slope direction between 38 degrees S and 48 degrees S. An instantaneous 800 km view provided by the Sentinel-2A satellite multispectral imager shows a nearly continuous IW field in which interpacket distances do not fit the usual semidiurnal tidal scales observed in coastal waters. Instead, acoustic Doppler current profiler-measured currents and CTD station data are consistent with resonant generation mechanisms in which the MC flows over bottom topography and generates upstream-propagating waves in a transcritical regime. These conditions are known to cause extra dissipation and mixing, whose effects over time and along more than 1,000 km may be important to a wider scope of ocean applications.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the association between demographic characteristics (age and sex) and other variables related to violence committed against children (form of violence perpetrator, place of occurrence, and nature of injury) using a sample of 404 children taken from the 2014 Violence and Accident Surveillance System (Sistema de Vigilancia de Violencias e Acidentes, VIVA) survey. Correspondence analysis was used to identify variables associated with the outcome violence against children. Victims were predominantly male. The most common form of violence was neglect/abandonment, followed by physical violence and sexual violence. The most common perpetrators were parents (ages zero to one and two to five years), followed by friends (ages six to nine years). The most common place of occurrence was the home. Notable levels of violence were observed at school, particularly among children aged between six and nine years. Neglect was most common in the age group zero to one year and two to five years, while physical violence was most common between children aged between six and nine years.

TI  - Three-year retention in buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder nationally in the Veterans Health Administration
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBuprenorphine has become the major treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) but data on long treatment term retention and its correlates are sparse.MethodsAll veterans with OUD treated in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities nationally in fiscal year (FY) 2012, and who began treatment with buprenorphine as indicated by a first prescription after the first 60 days of the year were identified with the date of and their last prescription from FY 2012-2015. Veterans were classified into four groups based on time from first to last prescription: (0-30 days, 31-365 days; 1-3 years; and more than 3 years). These groups were compared on socio-demographic, diagnoses and service, and psychotropic drug use. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify variables independently associated with retention in buprenorphine treatment.ResultsVeterans newly started on buprenorphine (n=3,151) were retained in treatment for a mean duration of 1.68 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.23), with 61.60% (n=1,941) retained for more than a year and 31.83% (n=1,003) for more than 3 years. Cox proportion hazards model showed that only black race (Hazards ratio [HR] 1.26; standard error [SE] .06; p.0003), the Charlson index (HR 1.03; SE .01; p.0132) and emergency room visits during FY 2012 (HR 1.03; SE .01; p<.0001) were the only available variables independently associated higher odds of buprenorphine discontinuation.ConclusionsBuprenorphine retention was substantial among veterans treated in VHA, but few individual characteristics correlated with retention.Scientific SignificanceFuture research focused on identifying further correlates of treatment retention is required to help devise interventions to improve treatment continuation.

TI  - Effectiveness of Nursing Education to Prevent Inpatient Suicide
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Inpatient suicide is recognized by The Joint Commission as a preventable sentinel event associated with inadequate patient and environmental assessments. Strategies are needed to meet this Joint Commission requirement.Method: Community hospital nurses were provided with classes to increase knowledge of inpatient suicide, patient assessments, and appropriate care. Independent pre- and postclass assessments were performed to measure nurses' confidence when talking to patients about suicidal thoughts and to assess nursing knowledge of actions to take when an at-risk patient is identified.Results: Education significantly increased nurses' confidence talking to patients about three of four confidence measures and increased their knowledge of actions to take when suicidal thoughts are identified. Confidence was lower in nurses with more experience; therefore, experience does not appear to increase confidence, and education is needed.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a focused in-service education program can increase nurses' confidence to dialogue with patients about suicidal thoughts and nurses' knowledge of actions to prevent inpatient suicide.

TI  - Manipulating field margins to increase predation intensity in fields of winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>)
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effectiveness of natural enemies to control pests can be enhanced through habitat manipulation. However, due to the differences in their ecology, generalist and specialist species may respond differently to the same manipulation. Moreover, interactions among natural enemies (i.e. cannibalism, intraguild predation, hyperparasitism) may complicate the assumption that a higher density of natural enemies would increase the level of biological control. We investigated the natural enemy guild composition and the predation rate along flower vs. grass margins at the edge of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) fields in Denmark. Natural enemies were sampled by pitfall trapping and by suction sampling; predation intensity was measured using two different sentinel prey methods: artificial caterpillars made of plasticine, and sentinel aphid colonies. Specialist and generalist species responded differently to the two margin types: specialists (mostly parasitic wasps) were attracted by the flower margins, while generalists (ground beetles, rove beetles and spiders) were more active in grass margins. The number of artificial caterpillars attacked was significantly greater in grass margins (mean=48.9%, SD=24.3) than in flower margins (mean=30.7%, SD=17.4). We found a significant positive relationship between the number of artificial caterpillars attacked by chewing insects, andactivity density for large (15mm) ground beetles. Predation of sentinel aphids in wheat fields did not vary significantly in relation to margin type. Our results suggest that flowering margins may be beneficial for canopy-active specialist natural enemies, but grassy margins are more useful for ground-active generalist predators.

TI  - High-TV Based CS Framework Using MAP Estimator for SAR Image Enhancement
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have two main problems: Degradation by speckle that causes low-contrast images and misinterpretation, and the large amount of data that makes the computation time an important issue. In addition to denoising, it is necessary to recover the missing data due to errors in the onboard SAR equipment, downlink equipment, and ground data registration. In this paper, we propose a method using high-order total variation (High-TV) denoising in compressive sensing (CS) framework, based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to simultaneously denoise and recover the large-size, complex-valued SAR images. Experiments on RADARSAT-1 raw data showed that the proposed method, called MAP High-TV, can suppress the speckle effectively without exhibiting a staircase effect on the images, and perfectly recovers the missed data. The performance comparison among the proposed method, MAP-MIDAL (the pioneer CS-based method), and three state of the art filters (NSM, POTDF and FANS), explores the capability of MAP High-TV for both denoising and recovering the complex-valued SAR images.

TI  - Vertical variability of aerosol single-scattering albedo and equivalent black carbon concentration based on in-situ and remote sensing techniques during the iAREA campaigns in Ny-Ålesund
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a methodology for obtaining vertical profiles of aerosol single scattering properties based on a combination of different measurement techniques. The presented data were obtained under the iAREA (Impact of absorbing aerosols on radiative forcing in the European Arctic) campaigns conducted in Ny-angstrom lesund (Spitsbergen) during the spring seasons of 2015-2017. The retrieval uses in-situ observations of black carbon concentration and absorption coefficient measured by a micro-aethalometer AE-51 mounted onboard a tethered balloon, as well as remote sensing data obtained from sun photometer and lidar measurements. From a combination of the balloon-borne in-situ and the lidar data, we derived profiles of single scattering albedo (SSA) as well as absorption, extinction, and aerosol number concentration. Results have been obtained in an altitude range from about 400 m up to 1600 m a.s.l. and for cases with increased aerosol load during the Arctic haze seasons of 2015 and 2016. The main results consist of the observation of increasing values of equivalent black carbon (EBC) and absorption coefficient with altitude, and the opposite trend for aerosol concentration for particles larger than 0.3 mu m. SSA was retrieved with the use of lidar Raman and Klett algorithms for both 532 and 880 nm wavelengths. In most profiles, SSA shows relatively high temporal and altitude variability. Vertical variability of SSA computed from both methods is consistent; however, some discrepancy is related to Raman retrieval uncertainty and absorption coefficient estimation from AE-51. Typically, very low EBC concentration in Ny-angstrom lesund leads to large error in the absorbing coefficient. However, SSA uncertainty for both Raman and Klett algorithms seems to be reasonable, e.g. SSA of 0.98 and 0.95 relate to an error of +/- 0.01 and +/- 0.025, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To analyze detection-rate(DR) and diagnostic-accuracy (A) of sentinel-nodes(SLNs) mapping following hysteroscopic-injection of tracer. To compare DR and A between tracers: ICG and Tc99m.Methods. Evaluation of endometrial-cancer patients who underwent SLNs mapping after hysteroscopic-peritumoral-injection of tracer lymphadenectomy. Analysis of DR (overall-bilateral-aortic) and A in the entire cohort and comparison between tracers.Results. 202 procedures were performed from January/2005 to February/2017. Mean age:60 years (28-82); mean BMI: 26.8 kg/m(2) (15-47). In 133 cases (65.8%) hysterectomy and mapping procedure were performed laparoscopically. The overall-DR of the technique was 93.2% (179/192) (10 cases were excluded: 9 for technical-equipment failure; 1 for vagal reaction). Bilateral pelvic mapping was found in 59.7% of cases (107/179) and was more frequent in the ICG group (72.8% vs 53.3%; p: 0.012). In 50.8% of cases (91/179) SLNs were mapped both in pelvic and aortic nodes, and in 5 cases (2.8%) only in the aortic area. The mean number of detected SLNs was 3.7 (1-8).22 patients (12.3%) had nodal involvement: 10-(45.5%)-macrometastases; 5-(22.7%)-micrometastases; 7-(31.8%)-ITCs. In 6 cases (27.3%) only aortic nodes were positive; in 5 cases (22.7%) both pelvic and aortic nodes and in 11 cases (50%) only pelvic nodes were involved.Three false-negative results were found, all in the Tc99m group. All had isolated aortic metastases with negative pelvic nodes.Overall-sensitivity was 86.4% (95%CI: 68.4-100) and overall-negative-predictive-value (NPV) was 96.4% (95%CI 86.7-100).No differences in terms of overall-DR, overall-sensitivity and overall-NPV were found between the two tracers.Conclusions. Hysteroscopic-injection of tracer for SLNs mapping in endometrial cancer is as accurate as cervical injection with a higher DR in the aortic area. ICG improves bilateral-DR. Further investigation is warranted on this topic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Deconstructing the landscape of fear in stable multi-species societies
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal distributions are influenced by variation in predation risk in space, which has been described as the "landscape of fear." Many studies suggest animals also reduce predation risk by eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls, allowing them to occupy otherwise risky habitats. One unexplored area of study is understanding how different species' alarms vary in quality, and how this variation is distributed in the landscape. We tested this phenomenon in a unique system of avian mixed species flocks in Amazonian rainforests: flock mates (eavesdropping species) strongly associate with alarm-calling antshrikes (genus Thamnomanes), which act as sentinel species. Up to 70 species join these flocks, presumably following antshrike behavioral cues. Since flocks in this region of the Amazon are exclusively led by a single antshrike species, this provides a unique natural system to compare differences in sentinel quality between flocks. We simulated predation threat by flying three species of live trained raptors (predators) towards flocks to compare sentinel probability to (1) produce alarm calls, and (2) encode information about magnitude and type of threat within such alarm calls. Our field experiments show significant differences in the probability of different sentinel species to produce alarm calls and distinguish predators. This variation may have important fitness consequences and shape the "landscape of fear" for eavesdropping species.

TI  - Results of Survey Regarding Prevalence of Adventitial Infections in Mice and Rats at Biomedical Research Facilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Control of rodent adventitial infections in biomedical research facilities is of extreme importance in assuring both animal welfare and high-quality research results. Sixty-three U.S. institutions participated in a survey reporting the methods used to detect and control these infections and the prevalence of outbreaks from 1 January 2014 through 31 December 2015. These results were then compared with the results of 2 similar surveys published in 1998 and 2008. The results of the current survey demonstrated that the rate of viral outbreaks in mouse colonies was decreasing, particularly in barrier facilities, whereas the prevalence of parasitic outbreaks has remained constant. These results will help our profession focus its efforts in the control of adventitial rodent disease outbreaks to the areas of the greatest needs.

TI  - Applicability of computer-aided comprehensive tool (LINDA: LlNeament Detection and Analysis) and shaded digital elevation model for characterizing and interpreting morphotectonic features from lineaments
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection and analysis of linear features related to surface and subsurface structures have been deemed necessary in natural resource exploration and earth surface instability assessment. Subjectivity in choosing control parameters required in conventional methods of lineament detection may cause unreliable results. To reduce this ambiguity, we developed LINDA (LlNeament Detection and Analysis), an integrated tool with graphical user interface in Visual Basic. This tool automates processes of detection and analysis of linear features from grid data of topography (digital elevation model; DEM), gravity and magnetic surfaces, as well as data from remote sensing imagery. A simple interface with five display windows forms a user-friendly interactive environment. The interface facilitates grid data shading, detection and grouping of segments, lineament analyses for calculating strike and dip and estimating fault type, and interactive viewing of lineament geometry. Density maps of the center and intersection points of linear features (segments and lineaments) are also included. A systematic analysis of test DEMs and Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery datasets in the North and South Eastern Deserts of Egypt is implemented to demonstrate the capability of LINDA and correct use of its functions. Linear features from the DEM are superior to those from the imagery in terms of frequency, but both linear features agree with location and direction of V-shaped valleys and dykes and reference fault data. Through the case studies, LINDA applicability is demonstrated to highlight dominant structural trends, which can aid understanding of geodynamic frameworks in any region.

TI  - Near real time de-noising of satellite-based soil moisture retrievals: An intercomparison among three different techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time de-noising of satellite-derived soil moisture observations presents opportunities to deliver more accurate and timely satellite data for direct satellite users. So far, the most commonly used techniques for reducing the impact of noise in the retrieved satellite soil moisture observations have been based on moving average filters and Fourier based methods. This paper introduces a new alternative wavelet based approach called Wiener-Wavelet-Based Filter (WiW), which uses an entropy based de-noising method to design a causal version of the filter. WiW is used as a post-retrieval processing tool to enhance the quality of observations derived from one active (the Advanced Scatterometer, ASCAT) and one passive (the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System, AMSRE) satellite sensors. The filter is then compared with two candidate de-noising techniques, namely: i) a Wiener causal filter introduced by Su et al. (2013) and ii) a conventional moving average filter. The validation is carried out globally at 173 (for AMSRE) and 243 (for ASCAT) soil moisture stations. Results show that all the three de-noising techniques can increase the agreement between satellite and in situ measurements in terms of correlation and signal-to-noise ratio. The Wiener-based methods show least signal distortion and demonstrate to be conservative in retaining the signal information in de-noised data. Importantly, the Wiener filters can be calibrated with the data at hand, without the need for auxiliary data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - MODIS phenology-derived, multi-year distribution of conterminous US crop types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Innovative, open, and rapid methods to map crop types over large areas are needed for long-term cropland monitoring. We developed two novel and automated decision tree classification approaches to map crop types across the conterminous United States (U.S.) using MODIS 250 m resolution data: 1) generalized, and 2) year-specific classification. The classification approaches use similarities and dissimilarities in crop type phenology derived from NDVI time-series data for the two approaches. The year-specific approach uses the training samples from one year and classifies crop types for that year only, whereas the generalized classification approach uses above-average, average, and below-average precipitation years for training to produce crop type maps for one or multiple years more robustly. We produced annual crop type maps using the generalized classification approach for 2001-2014 and the year-specific approach for 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The year-specific classification had overall accuracies >78%, while the generalized classifier had accuracies >75% for the conterminous U.S. for 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The generalized classifier enables automated and routine crop type mapping without repeated and expensive ground sample collection year after year. The resulting crop type maps for years prior to 2007 are new and especially important for long-term cropland monitoring and food security analysis because no other map products are currently available for 2001-2007.

TI  - Efficient fluorescence detection of protoporphyrin IX in metastatic lymph nodes of murine colorectal cancer stained with indigo carmine
T2  - PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a biochemical converted from 5-aminolevulinc acid (5-ALA) in living cells, is useful for intraoperative fluorescent detection of cancer metastasis in lymph nodes (LNs). However, unknown is whether the fluorescence of PpIX can be detected in the LNs when they coexist with indigo carmine, a blue dye commonly used for identification of sentinel LNs during surgery. To address this issue, we sought to evaluate the diagnostic usefulness of PpIX fluorescence in the presence of indigo carmine in a mouse LN metastasis model of rectal cancer after administration of 5-ALA. Spectral analysis of pure chemicals revealed that the absorption spectrum of indigo carmine widely overlapped with the fluorescence spectrum of PpIX specifically at the peak of 632 nm, a common emission wavelength for detecting PpIX, but not at the other peak of 700 nm. Due to such spectral overlap, the PpIX fluorescence intensity was significantly attenuated by mixture with indigo carmine at 632 nm, but not at 700 nm. Accordingly, fluorescent measurements of the mouse metastatic LN revealed more intense presentation of PpIX at 700 nm than at 632 nm, indicating that the diagnostic usefulness is greater at 700 urn than at 632 urn for the indigo carmine-dyed LNs after administration of 5-ALA. From these observations, we propose that the fluorescence measurement is more efficient at 700 urn than at 632 nm for detection of PpIX in metastatic LNs stained with indigo carmine.

TI  - <i>Pachasophy:</i> Landscape Ethics in the Central Andes Mountains of South America
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Andean philosophy of nature or pachasophy results from topography and mode of production that, merged together, have produced an integrated and interacting worldview that blurs the line between culture and nature. Respecting Pacha, or the interconnectedness of life and geography, maintaining complementarity and equilibrium through symbolic interactions, and caring for Pachamama, the feminine presence of Pacha manifested mainly as cultivable soil are the basis of Andean environmental and social ethics. Reciprocity or ayni is the glue that holds everything together. This weaving of traditional beliefs, customs, and ecological knowledge is rooted in the landscape and has sustained Quechua and Aymara societies during many millennia of knowing, using, and transforming the varied environments of the central Andes of South America. Any environmental ethics that influences people's lives and promotes respectful and sustainable relationships with nature will be framed by already held worldviews. In Bolivia indigenous intellectuals are drawing on the ancient tradition of Pacha to trace an environmental ethics of pacha qamana or the harmonious and integral well-being of life, the Earth, and the cosmos, and the ethics of suma qamana as an all embracing ethical framework for the "good life" or "living well." Although pacha qamana and suma qamana are rooted in the Andean mythological worldview, they will interest Western philosophers because the values they promote can be correctives for Western cultural traits that see little more than instrumental value in nature. In this sense, pacha qamana and suma qamana contribute to the broader discussion of environmental ethics.

M3  - Article
AB  - Low-cost flight-based hyperspectral imaging systems have the potential to provide important information for ecosystem and environmental studies as well as aide in land management. To realize this potential, methods must be developed to provide large-area surface reflectance data allowing for temporal data sets at the mesoscale. This paper describes a bootstrap method of producing a large-area, radiometrically referenced hyperspectral data set using the Landsat surface reflectance (LaSRC) data product as a reference target. The bootstrap method uses standard hyperspectral processing techniques that are extended to remove uneven illumination conditions between flight passes, allowing for radiometrically self-consistent data after mosaicking. Through selective spectral and spatial resampling, LaSRC data are used as a radiometric reference target. Advantages of the bootstrap method include the need for minimal site access, no ancillary instrumentation, and automated data processing. Data from two hyperspectral flights over the same managed agricultural and unmanaged range land covering approximately 5.8 km(2) acquired on June 21, 2014 and June 24, 2015 are presented. Data from a flight over agricultural land collected on June 6, 2016 are compared with concurrently collected ground-based reflectance spectra as a means of validation.

TI  - Integrating Remotely Sensed Imagery and Existing Multiscale Field Data to Derive Rangeland Indicators: Application of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed imagery at multiple spatial scales is used increasingly in conjunction with field data to estimate rangeland indicators (e.g., vegetation cover) and meet the growing need for landscape-scale monitoring and assessment of rangelands. Remote sensing studies that produce rangeland indicators often require intensive and costly field-data collection efforts to produce accurate model predictions. Existing monitoring data, such as those collected by the Bureau of Land Management's Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) program, are potentially useful sources of field data in remote sensing modeling studies. Given their data-hungry nature, common regression tree-based modeling approaches may be inadequate for reliably predicting rangeland indicators with the smaller sample sizes of AIM data than typically used for remote sensing studies. Current literature suggests that Bayesian models, such as Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), may provide a suitable alternative to traditional regression tree-based modeling approaches to overcome the sample size limitation of the AIM data. In this study, we used 182 AIM field plots together with both high (RapidEye) and moderate (Landsat OLI) spatial resolution satellite imagery to predict bare ground and bare soil, total foliar, herbaceous, woody, and shrub cover indicators on rangelands in a 14 625-km(2) area of northeastern California. We demonstrate that a BART model performed similarly to other regression tree approaches when field data and high spatial resolution imagery predictions were combined to predict indicator values using the medium spatial resolution Landsat image. The BART models also provided spatially explicit uncertainty estimates, which allow land managers to more carefully evaluate indicator predictions and to identify areas where future field data collection might be most useful. This study demonstrates that existing field data and freely available, remotely sensed imagery can be integrated to produce spatially explicit and continuous surface estimates of rangeland indicators across entire landscapes.

TI  - A comparison of service organisation and guideline compliance between two adjacent European health services.
T2  - European stroke journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Outcomes in stroke patients are improved by a co-ordinated organisation of stroke services and provision of evidence-based care. We studied the organisation of care and application of guidelines in two neighbouring health care systems with similar characteristics.METHODS: Organisational elements of the 2015 National Stroke Audit (NSA) from the Republic of Ireland (ROI) were compared with the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) in Northern Ireland (NI) and the United Kingdom (UK). Compliance was compared with UK and European guidelines.RESULTS: Twenty-one of 28 ROI hospitals (78%) reported having a stroke unit (SU) compared with all 10 in NI. Average SU size was smaller in ROI (6 beds vs. 15 beds) and bed availability per head of population was lower (1:30,633 vs. 1:12,037 p<0.0001 Chi Sq). Fifty-four percent of ROI patients were admitted to SU care compared with 96% of UK patients (p<0.0001). Twenty-four-hour physiological monitoring was available in 54% of ROI SUs compared to 91% of UK units (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference between ROI and NI in access to senior specialist physicians or nurses or in SU nurse staffing (3.9/10 beds weekday mornings) but there was a higher proportion of trained nurses in ROI units (2.9/10 beds vs. 2.3/10 beds (p=0.02 Chi Sq).CONCLUSION: Whilst the majority of hospitals in both jurisdictions met key criteria for organised stroke care the small size and underdevelopment of the ROI units meant a substantial proportion of patients were unable to access this specialised care.

TI  - Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) annual report 2015: Prospective hospital-based surveillance for serious paediatric conditions.
T2  - Communicable diseases intelligence quarterly report
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) network is a hospital-based active surveillance system employing prospective case ascertainment for selected serious childhood conditions, particularly vaccine preventable diseases and potential adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). PAEDS data is used to better understand these conditions, inform policy and practice under the National Immunisation Program, and enable rapid public health responses for certain conditions of public health importance. PAEDS enhances data available from other Australian surveillance systems by providing prospective, detailed clinical and laboratory information on children with selected conditions. This is the second of the planned annual PAEDS reporting series, and presents surveillance data for 2015.METHODS: Specialist surveillance nurses screened hospital admissions, emergency department records, laboratory and other data, on a daily basis in 5 paediatric tertiary referral hospitals in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland to identify children with the selected conditions. Standardised protocols and case definitions were used across all sites. Conditions under surveillance in 2015 included acute flaccid paralysis (a syndrome associated with poliovirus infection), acute childhood encephalitis (ACE), influenza, intussusception (IS; a potential AEFI with rotavirus vaccines), pertussis and varicella-zoster virus infection (varicella and herpes zoster). Most protocols restrict eligibility to hospitalisations, ED only presentations are also included for some conditions.METHODS: : In 2015, there were 674 cases identified across all conditions under surveillance. Key outcomes of PAEDS included: contribution to national AFP surveillance to reach WHO reporting targets; identification of signals for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and parechovirus-related outbreaks (ACE surveillance); and demonstration of high influenza activity with vaccine effectiveness (VE) analysis supportive of vaccination. Surveillance for IS remains ongoing with any identified AEFIs reported to the relevant State Health Department; varicella and herpes zoster case numbers decreased slightly from previous years in older children not eligible for catch-up. Pertussis case numbers increased in early 2015 and analysis of cases in children aged <1 year demonstrated the importance of timely childhood and maternal immunisation.CONCLUSIONS: PAEDS continues to provide unique policy-relevant data on serious paediatric conditions using hospital-based sentinel surveillance.

TI  - Entheogenesis: Toward an Expanded Worldview for Our Time
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMANISTIC PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Whereas the terminology of psychedelics has acquired spurious cultural associations of tripping, the historically primal concept of consciousness expansion has two advantages. One, it connects psychedelic drugs with other modes of consciousness expansion, such as meditation and creative visioning; and two, it suggests contrasting comparison with the consciousness contraction involved in concentration and focus. Both expansions and contractions can be observed at the level of an individual's states of consciousness and also at the level of the shared worldview of society. Contemporary world culture is moving toward an expanded worldview that recognizes both the material and the spiritual dimensions of our existence.

TI  - Pandemic-related health behavior: repeat episodes of influenza-like illness related to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Houston Health Department (HHD) in Texas tracks influenza-like illness (ILI) in the community through its Influenza Sentinel Surveillance Program, which began in 2008. After the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic (pH1N1) in 2009, investigators sought to assess the feasibility of this program as a non-traditional data source for tracking and monitoring care-seeking activities. Through the process of characterizing and describing patients who had 'return visits', or who were considered the heaviest ILI-related care-utilizers, the investigators sought to understand the strengths and limitations of this data source. Data used for this study were obtained from a multispecialty clinic in Houston, Texas between August 2008 and January 2011 across three phases: pre-pH1N1, pH1N1, and post-pH1N1. The data, which comprised of 4047 patient visits, yielded 150 return visits. We found an increase in the number of visits for ILI and proportion of return visits during the pandemic phase (pH1N1), as well as differences in the likelihood of a return visit between genders and age groups. More broadly, the findings of this study provide important considerations for future research and expose important gaps in using surveillance data to assess sick-role behaviors.

TI  - Long-term MRI surveillance after microsurgery for vestibular schwannoma
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo determine the optimal postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) schedule and length of follow-up for patients undergoing microsurgical excision of vestibular schwannoma (VS).Study DesignA retrospective review of patients who underwent microsurgical excision of VS at a single tertiary care center between January 1993 and March 2004.MethodsTwo hundred and twenty subjects were analyzed and characteristics gathered, including tumor size, surgical approach, completeness of resection, and length of follow-up to last MRI. All postoperative MRIs were reviewed. Radiologic progression is defined as a transition to a more advanced MRI grade from a less advanced MRI grade (eg, clean, linear, nodular) and was recorded for each of the subjects' serial MRIs. The MRI categorized findings were also binned into five time periods for summary analyses. Interval-censored survival analysis was performed to model time to recurrence across the population.ResultsOf the non-neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) cohort, the average tumor size at the time of resection was 1.98 1.02 cm (range 0.4-5 cm); average length of follow-up was 9.0 4.6 years (range 1-19); 102 subjects (47.2%) underwent a retrosigmoid resection; and 110 (50.9%) underwent a translabyrinthine resection. Eight of these subjects (4.1%) demonstrated radiologic progression; of those, four underwent additional treatment. Survival analysis showed early (1-2 years postoperative), middle (2-10 years postoperative), and late (> 10 years postoperative) radiologic progression events.ConclusionThe current recommended MRI surveillance schedule after microsurgery for VS includes MRIs at 1, 5, and 10 years postoperatively. Nonparametric survival analysis suggests that a majority of radiologic progression events occur in the first 10 years postoperatively.Level of Evidence4. Laryngoscope, 127:2132-2138, 2017

TI  - Fire Data as Proxy for Anthropogenic Landscape Change in the Yucatan
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is one of the earliest and most common tools used by humans to modify the earth surface. Landscapes in the Yucatan Peninsula are composed of a mosaic of old growth subtropical forest, secondary vegetation, grasslands, and agricultural land that represent a well-documented example of anthropogenic intervention, much of which involves the use of fire. This research characterizes land use systems and land cover changes in the Yucatan during the 2000-2010 time period. We used an active fire remotely sensed data time series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), in combination with forest loss, and anthrome map sources to (1) establish the association between fire and land use change in the region; and (2) explore links between the spatial and temporal patterns of fire and specific types of land use practices, including within- and between-anthromes variability. A spatial multinomial logit model was constructed using fire, landscape configuration, and a set of commonly used control variables to estimate forest persistence, non-forest persistence, and change. Cross-tabulations and descriptive statistics were used to explore the relationships between fire occurrence, location, and timing with respect to the geography of land use. We also compared fire frequencies within and between anthrome groups using a negative binomial model and Tukey pairwise comparisons. Results show that fire data broadly reproduce the geography and timing of anthropogenic land change. Findings indicate that fire and landscape configuration is useful in explaining forest change and non-forest persistence, especially in fragmented (mosaicked) landscapes. Absence of fire occurrence is related usefully to the persistence of spatially continuous core areas of older growth forest. Fire has a positive relationship with forest to non-forest change and a negative relationship with forest persistence. Fire is also a good indicator to distinguish between anthrome groups (e.g., croplands and villages). Our study suggests that active fire data series are a reasonable proxy for anthropogenic land persistence/change in the context of the Yucatan and are useful to differentiate quantitatively and qualitatively between and within anthromes.

TI  - Seroprevalence of <i>Trichinella</i> infections in domestic dogs from Slovakia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Trichinellosis is constantly present in the sylvatic cycle in Slovakia, with several sporadic human outbreaks registered since the 1960s. The largest outbreak of trichinellosis occurred in 1998 and was related to the consumption of dog meat that had been added to smoked pork sausages. The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of Trichinella infection in domestic dogs in various regions of Slovakia. Out of 439 dogs tested, 56 (12.8%) were classified as a seropositive based on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with confirmation by Western blotting. The highest seropositivity was recorded among dogs from the eastern part of Slovakia, in the Preov (22.9%) and Koice (17.1%) regions, long considered to be highly endemic for Trichinella occurrence and where the prevalence of infection in the vulpine population is also the highest in Slovakia. Trichinella-seropositive animals were detected significantly more often in dogs kept in rural areas (21.1%) when compared with animals living in towns or suburban localities (7.7%). On the other hand, neither age, nor gender and size of the dogs were shown to be a significant factor for Trichinella infection (P > 0.05). The present results indicate that the dog population in Slovakia is at high risk of exposure to Trichinella parasites and could potentially represent a suitable host group for serological monitoring of Trichinella infection as convenient sentinel animals.

T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline detection has been of major interest for environmentalists and many methods have been introduced to detect coastline automatically. Remote Sensing techniques are the most promising ones to deliver a satisfactory result in this regard. In our study, the objective was to retrieve performance level of certain image processing techniques vigorously used for the purpose to delineate coastline automatically and they were tested against two images acquired almost on the same period by LISS III and LANDSAT ETM+ sensors. The algorithms used in the study are Water Index, NDVI, Complex Band Ratio, ISODATA, Thresholding, ISH Transfirmation techniques. Accuracy of the shoreline detection by classifying the image in land and water has been tried to be estimated in three ways, firstly with comparison to the visually interpreted high resolution google earth image, secondly field collected GCP data of reference points of classes and thirdly the raw image itself. But problem in temporal disparity caused the constraint doing accuracy assessment from the first two reference data and maps along the coast. As a whole although four techniques among six, show satisfactory results namely density slicing, ISODATA classification, Water Index and ISH transformation technique, in the case of LISS-III and ETM+, Water Index (with kappa value being 0.95 for LISS-III and 0.97 for ETM+) and Intensity-Hue-Saturation transformation techniques give better performance. Sensor to sensor variation might have introduced certain differences in shoreline detection in images of same season with similar tidal influence.

M3  - Article
AB  - The studies of forest ecosystems from remotely-sensed data are of great interest to researchers because of ecosystem services provided by this ecosystem, including protection of soils and vegetation, climate stabilization, and regulation of the hydrological cycle. In this context, our study focused on the use of a spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification method for mapping species in the Azrou Forest, Central Middle Atlas, Morocco. A Sentinel-2A image combined with ground reference data were used in this research. Four classes (holm oak, cedar forest, bare soil, and others-unclassified) were selected; they represent, respectively, 27, 11, 24, and 38% of the study area. The overall accuracy of classification was estimated to be around 99.72%. This work explored the potential of the SAM classification combined with Sentinel-2A data for mapping land cover in the Azrou Forest ecosystem.

TI  - Early Stage Forest Windthrow Estimation Based on Unmanned Aircraft System Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong wind disturbances can affect large forested areas and often occur irregularly within a forest. Due to this, identifying damaged sites and estimating the extent of these losses are crucial for the harvesting management of salvage logging. Furthermore, the location should be surveyed as soon as possible after the disturbance to prevent the degradation of fallen trees. A fixed-wing type of unmanned aircraft system (UAS) with a compact digital camera was used in this study. The imagery was acquired on approximately 200 hectares where five large windthrow areas had occurred. The objective of the study was to determine the location of the windthrow areas using a semi-automatic approach based on the UAS imagery, and on the combination of UAS imagery with airborne laser scanning (ALS). The results were compared with reference data measured by global navigation satellite system (GNSS) devices. At the same time, windthrow areas were derived from Landsat imagery to investigate whether the UAS imagery would have significantly more accurate results. GNSS measurements and Landsat imagery are currently used in forestry on an operational level. The salvage logging was estimated for each forest stand based on the estimated areas and volume per hectare obtained from the forest management plan. The results from the UAS (25.09 ha) and the combined UAS/ALS (25.56 ha) methods were statistically similar to the reference GNSS measurements (25.39 ha). The result from Landsat, at 19.8 ha, was not statistically similar to the reference GNSS measurements or to the UAS and UAS/ALS methods. The estimate of salvage logging for the whole area, from UAS imagery and the forest management plan, overestimated the actual salvage logging measured by foresters by 4.93% (525m(3)), when only the most represented tree species were considered. The UAS/ALS combination improved the preliminary results of determining windthrow areas which lead to decreased editing time for all operators. The UAS imagery shows potential for application to early-stage surveys of windthrow areas in forests. The advantages of this method are that it provides the ability to conduct flights immediately after the disturbance, the foresters do not need to walk within the affected areas which decreases the risk of injury, and allows flights to be conducted on cloudy days. The orthomosaic of the windthrow areas, as a by-product of data processing in combination with forest maps and forest road maps, can be used as a tool to plan salvage logging.

TI  - Complications following completion lymphadenectomy versus therapeutic lymphadenectomy for melanoma - A systematic review of the literature
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) following a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been reported to be less morbid than lymphadenectomy for palpable disease (therapeutic lymph node dissection; TLND). The reporting of morbidity data can be heterogeneous, and hence no 'average' surgical complication rates of these procedures has been reported. This review aims to determine complications rates to inform patients undergoing surgery for metastatic melanoma.Methods: A systematic review of English-language literature from 2000 to 2017, reporting morbidity information about CLND and TLND for melanoma, was performed. The methodological quality of the included studies was performed using the methodological index for non randomised studies (MINORS) instrument and Detsky score. Pooled proportions of post-operative complications were constructed using a random effects statistical model.Results: After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 articles progressed to the final analysis. In relation to TLND (1627 patients), the overall incidence of surgical complications was 39.3% (95% CI 32.6-46.2); including wound infection/breakdown 25.4% (95% CI: 20.9-30.3); lymphoedema 20.9% (95% CI: 13.8-29.1); and seroma 20.4% (95% CI: 15.9-25.2). For CLND (1929 patients), the overall incidence of surgical complications was 37.2% (95% CI 27.6-47.4); including wound infection/breakdown 21.6% (95% CI: 13.8-30.6); lymphoedema 18% (95% CI: 12.5-24.2); and seroma 17.9% (95% CI: 10.3-27). The complication rate was marginally lower for CLND but not to statistical significance.Discussion: This study provides information about the incidence of complications after CLND and TLND. It can be used to counsel patients about the procedures and it sets a benchmark against which surgeons can audit their practice. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study was to describe the trends and patterns of antidepressant (AD) prescribing to children and adolescents in Canadian primary care before and after the black-box warning in 2004.MethodsPrescription data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network, a repository of primary care data on over 1 million patients, was used to analyze AD prescribing to children (8-11y) and adolescents (12-18y) between 2000 and 2014. Interrupted time series analyses were used to assess the impact of the 2004 black-box warning on the prescribing levels of ADs.ResultsThe 2004 black-box warning had a significant and immediate effect on the prescribing of AD. However, this drop was not sustained, and 5years after the advisory AD prescribing rates reversed direction and started to rise. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors dominated as the most common AD prescribed throughout the study period, increasing from 66% prior to the black-box warning to 83.12% after 2009.ConclusionsThe black-box warning effectively reduced AD prescribing in primary care for approximately 5years before a reversal back to a positive rate of prescribing. This rebounding could reflect an emerging consensus about the trade-off in risks and benefits.

TI  - Axillary Dissection and Nodal Irradiation Can Be Avoided for Most Node-positive Z0011-eligible Breast Cancers <i>A Prospective Validation Study of 793 Patients</i>
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 137th Annual Meeting of the American-Surgical-Association (ASA)
CL  - Philadelphia, PA
AB  - Objective: To determine rates of axillary dissection (ALND) and nodal recurrence in patients eligible for ACOSOG Z0011.Background: Z0011 demonstrated that patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancers and 1 to 2 involved sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) having breast-conserving therapy had no difference in locoregional recurrence or survival after SLN biopsy alone or ALND. The generalizability of the results and importance of nodal radiotherapy (RT) is unclear.Methods: Patients eligible for Z0011 had SLN biopsy alone. Prospectively defined indications for ALND were metastases in >= 3 SLNs or gross extracapsular extension. Axillary imaging was not routine. SLN and ALND groups and radiation fields were compared with chi-square and t tests. Cumulative incidence of recurrences was estimated with competing risk analysis.Results: From August 2010 to December 2016, 793 patients met Z0011 eligibility criteria and had SLN metastases. Among them, 130 (16%) had ALND; ALND did not vary based on age, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or HER2 status. Five-year event-free survival after SLN alone was 93% with no isolated axillary recurrences. Cumulative 5-year rates of breast+nodal and nodal+distant recurrence were each 0.7%. In 484 SLN-only patients with known RT fields (103 prone, 280 supine tangent, 101 breast+nodes) and follow-up >= 12 months, the 5-year cumulative nodal recurrence rate was 1% and did not differ significantly by RT fields.Conclusions: We confirm that even without preoperative axillary imaging or routine use of nodal RT, ALND can be avoided in a large majority of Z0011-eligible patients with excellent regional control. This approach has the potential to spare substantial numbers of women the morbidity of ALND.

TI  - Comparing Single-Site and Multiport Robotic Hysterectomy with Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping for Endometrial Cancer: Surgical Outcomes and Cost Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To compare operative times, surgical outcomes, and costs of robotic laparoendoscopic single-site (R-LESS) vs multiport robotic (MPR) total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) with sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for low-risk endometrial cancer.Design: Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification 11-2). Setting: Academic university hospital.Patients: Patients with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) or low-grade (1 or 2) endometrial cancer with body mass index <30 kg/m(2) and undergoing robotic TLH and SLN mapping between 2012 and 2016 were included.Interventions: Surgical outcomes and cost data were collected retrospectively and analyzed based on the surgical approach with R-LESS vs MPR assistance.Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-seven patients who met the inclusion criteria were identified, including 14 patients who underwent R-LESS TLH with SLN mapping and 13 patients who underwent MPR TLH with SLN mapping. Median uterine weight was comparable in the 2 cohorts (111.3 g vs 83.8 g; p =.33). Operative and console times were equivalent with the R-LESS and MPR approaches (median, 175 minutes vs 184 minutes, p =.61 and 136 vs 140 minutes, p =.12, respectively). Median estimated blood loss was 50 mL in both cohorts. Successful bilateral SLN mapping occurred in 85.7% of the R-LESS procedures and 76.9% of MPR procedures. No intraoperative or 30-day complications were encountered, and all patients were discharged within 23 hours of surgery. MPR was associated with additional disposable instrument and drape costs of $460 to $660 compared with R-LESS, depending on the surgeon's instrument selection. Average total hospital charges were lower for R-LESS procedures ($13,410 vs $15,952; p <.05).Conclusion: In highly selected patients with CAH or low-grade endometrial cancer undergoing TLH and SLN mapping, R-LESS appears to result in equivalent perioperative outcomes as a MPR approach while offering a more cost-effective option. Further research is needed to determine the benefits of R-LESS procedures in the gynecologic oncology setting. (C) 2017 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite remote sensing albedo retrievals over the ablation area of the southwestern Greenland ice sheet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo products have been validated over spatially uniform, snow-covered areas of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) using the so-called single 'point-to-pixel' method. This study expands on this methodology by applying a 'multiple-point-to-pixel' method and examination of spatial autocorrelation (here using semivariogram analysis) by using in situ observations, high-resolution World View-2 (WV-2) surface reflectances, and MODIS Collection V006 daily blue-sky albedo over a spatially heterogeneous surfaces in the lower ablation zone in southwest Greenland. Our results using 232 ground based samples within two MODIS pixels, one being more spatial heterogeneous than the other, show little difference in accuracy among narrow and broad band albedos (except for Band 2). Within the more homogenous pixel area, in situ and MODIS albedos were very close (error varied from -4% to +7%) and within the range of ASD standard errors. The semivariogram analysis revealed that the minimum observational footprint needed for a spatially representative sample is 30 m. In contrast, over the more spatially heterogeneous surface pixel, a minimum footprint size was not quantifiable due to spatial autocorrelation, and far exceeds the effective resolution of the MODIS retrievals. Over the high spatial heterogeneity surface pixel, MODIS is lower than ground measurements by 4-7%, partly due to a known in situ undersampling of darker surfaces that often are impassable by foot (e.g., meltwater features and shadowing effects over crevasses). Despite the sampling issue, our analysis errors are very close to the stated general accuracy of the MODIS product of 5%. Thus, our study suggests that the MODIS albedo product performs well in a very heterogeneous, low-albedo, area of the ice sheet ablation zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that single 'point-to-pixel' methods alone are insufficient in characterizing and validating the variation of surface albedo displayed in the lower ablation area. This is true because the distribution of in situ data deviations from MODIS albedo show a substantial range, with the average values for the 10th and 90th percentiles being -0.30 and 0.43 across all bands. Thus, if only single point is taken for ground validation, and is randomly selected from either distribution tails, the error would appear to be considerable. Given the need for multiple in-situ points, concurrent albedo measurements derived from existing AWSs, (low-flying vehicles (airborne or unmanned) and high-resolution imagery (WV-2)) are needed to resolve high sub-pixel variability in the ablation zone, and thus, further improve our characterization of Greenland's surface albedo.

TI  - Lymphatic invasion predicts sentinel lymph node metastasis and adverse outcome in primary cutaneous melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis is a powerful predictor of survival in primary cutaneous melanoma. Lymphatic invasion (LI) may correlate with increased risk of SLN metastasis. Intralymphatic metastases, often difficult to detect on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections, are readily identified with dual immunohistochemistry for melanocytic and lymphatic markers.MethodsWe used dual S100/D240 immunohistochemistry to detect LI in 125 melanomas from patients who underwent SLN biopsy and correlated LI with melanoma staging parameters and disease status.ResultsDual immunohistochemistry allowed for the identification of LI in 33 cases (26%), compared to only 2% on H&E stained sections. Melanomas with LI showed greater thickness, higher mitotic rate and more frequent ulceration. Eleven of 33 cases with LI (33%) and 10 of 92 cases without LI (11%) were associated with a positive SLN (P=.006). More patients without LI were disease-free at last follow-up (80%) than patients with LI (50%; P=.002); LI was significantly associated with decreased progression-free survival.ConclusionThe detection of LI is improved by dual immunohistochemistry and predicts SLN metastasis. The presence of LI may impact therapeutic planning in melanoma, such as the decision to perform a SLN biopsy.

TI  - Egg Parasitoids of <i>Dalbulus maidis</i><SUP>1</SUP> on Wild Teosintes in Mexico
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about parasitoids that attack insect pests on wild host plants, including wild teosintes. Sentinel teosinte plants with eggs of the specialist herbivore pest, the corn leafhopper, Dalbulus maidis (DeLong) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), were used to attract and capture egg parasitoid species in natural habitats of annual teosinte Zea mays ssp. parviglumis Iltis & Doebley, which is the direct ancestor of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.), and perennial teosinte Zea perennis (Hitchc.) Reeves & Mangelsdorf in central Mexico. In annual teosinte, eggs of D. maidis were parasitized by Anagrus incarnatus Haliday and Anagrus columbi Perkins (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), as well as Paracentrobia sp. near subflava (Girault) and Pseudoligosita sp. near longifrangiata (Viggiani) (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae); in perennial teosinte, they were parasitized by A. incarnatus and Pseudoligosita sp. near longifrangiata. All the egg parasitoids, recorded for the first time from wild teosintes, have been previously known from the same leafhopper pest on cultivated maize. Thus, their conservation in wild teosinte habitats may be important for enhancing natural biological control of the corn leafhopper in adjacent maize fields.

TI  - Preoperative Prediction of Node-Negative Disease After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients Presenting with Node-Negative or Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Axillary node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) influences the axillary surgical staging procedure as well as recommendations regarding reconstruction and radiation.Objective. Our aim was to construct a clinical preoperative prediction model to identify the likelihood of patients being node negative after NAC.Methods. Using the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from January 2010 to December 2012, we identified cT1-T4c, N0-N3 breast cancer patients treated with NAC. The effects of patient and tumor factors on pathologic node status were assessed by multivariable logistic regression separately for clinically node negative (cN0) and clinically node positive (cN+) disease, and two models were constructed. Model performance was validated in a cohort of NAC patients treated at our institution (January 2013-July 2016), and model discrimination was assessed by estimating the area under the curve (AUC).Results. Of 16,153 NCDB patients, 6659 (41%) were cN0 and 9494 (59%) were cN+. Factors associated with pathologic nodal status and included in the models were patient age, tumor grade, biologic subtype, histology, clinical tumor category, and, in cN+ patients only, clinical nodal category. The validation dataset included 194 cN0 and 180 cN+ patients. The cN0 model demonstrated good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-0.74) in the NCDB and 0.77 (95% CI 0.68-0.85) in the external validation, while the cN+ patient model AUC was 0.71 (95% CI 0.70-0.72) in the NCDB and 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.82) in the external validation.Conclusions. We constructed two models that showed good discrimination for predicting ypN0 status following NAC in cN0 and cN+ patients. These clinically useful models can guide surgical planning after NAC.

TI  - Who's Your Daddy? Family Structure Differences in Attachment to God
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that individuals' relationships with God are attachment-based. However, research has not yet investigated differences in attachment to God by parents' marital status. Thus, the goal of the present study was to examine these links. To do so, 288 undergraduate students completed measures assessing family structure, attachment to fathers, attachment to mothers, and attachment to God. Results suggest support for the correspondence theory of attachment to God (i.e., individuals project their attachment to parents onto their attachments to God) for participants with married parents. In contrast, the compensation hypothesis (i.e., individuals seek relationships with God to fulfill unreliable relationships with parents) was supported for participants with divorced parents.

TI  - Prediction of future urban surface temperatures using medium resolution satellite data in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine the impact of urban growth on future micro-climate of Harare by predicting future distribution of land use and land cover, as well as land surface temperature using Cellular Automata Markov Chain analysis. Landsat series data was used to map Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and land surface temperature distribution during the month of October for the year 1984, 1993, 2001 and 2015. The Cellular Automata Markov Chain analysis was used to determine long term landscape transformation at 10-year time steps from 2015 to 2045. We further tested the potential of a variety of vegetation and non-vegetation indices to predict land surface temperature. Results show that the Urban Index (UI), non-vegetation index was the best predictor of surface temperature, since it had the highest correlation with retrieved surface temperature (r = 0.9831). When tested against temperature derived from thermal band in October 2015, the mean absolute percentage error of the UI derived temperature was 5.27%. Based on changes which occurred between 1984 and 2015, the Cellular Automata Markov Chain analysis predicted that high density built-up areas will increase monotonically from 470.02 in 2015 to 490.36 km(2) in 2045. Green spaces were predicted as decreasing from 57.42 to 27.85 km(2), while croplands also decrease from 30.27 to 16.93 km(2) between 2015 and 2040. Using UI as predictor of land surface temperature, we predicted that the 18-28 degrees C class will decrease in coverage between 2015 and 2040, while the 36-45 degrees C category will increase in proportion covered from 42.5 to 58% of city. We concluded that continued urban growth will increase warming and result in high future temperatures unless mitigation efforts are strengthened. The findings of this study are important in informing future development of cities to consider growth implications on future temperatures and thermal comfort of urban residents.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability in biogenic gas dynamics in a subtropical peat soil at the laboratory scale is revealed using high-resolution ground-penetrating radar
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of peatlands as sources of greenhouse gas emissions has been demonstrated in many studies during the last two decades. While most studies have shown the heterogeneous distribution of biogenic gas in peat soils at the field scale (sampling volumes in the order of meters), little information exists for submeter scales, particularly relevant to properly capture the dynamics of hot spots for gas accumulation and release when designing sampling routines with methods that use smaller (i.e., submeter) sampling volumes like flux chambers. In this study, ground-penetrating radar is used at the laboratory scale to evaluate biogenic gas dynamics at high spatial resolution (i.e., cm) in a peat monolith from the Everglades. The results indicate sharp changes (both spatially and temporally) in the dynamics of gas accumulation and release, representing hot spots for production and release of biogenic gases with surface areas ranging between 5 to 10cm diameter and are associated with increases in porosity. Furthermore, changes in gas composition and inferred methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes also displayed a high spatiotemporal variability associated with hot spots, resulting in CH4 and CO2 flux estimates showing differences up to 1 order of magnitude during the same day for different parts of the sample. This work follows on recent studies in the Everglades and questions the appropriateness of spatial and temporal scales of measurement when defining gas dynamics by showing how flux values may change both spatially and temporarily even when considering submeter spatial scales.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variability in Winter Precipitation across the Western United States during the Satellite Era
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The western United States is known for its water shortages due to large seasonal and inter-annual variability of precipitation as well as increasing demand. Climate change will impact the availability of water in the western United States through the modification of precipitation characteristics. Satellite data presents the opportunity to study these changes at a fine, continuous spatial resolutionparticularly in places where no traditional ground observations exist. Utilizing the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 version 7 precipitation data, this study examines the spatio-temporal changes in precipitation characteristics over the western United States between 1998 and 2015, and their connections with the atmospheric total column water vapor and the El Nino Southern Oscillation during the winter season. The results show that precipitation frequency in the western United States has been decreasing in general, precipitation totals and mean daily intensity are increasing in northwestern United States, but decreasing in the southwest United States during the 18 years of the study time period. Additionally, results show a strong relationship between total column water vapor and the precipitation characteristics, specifically in the southwestern United States.

M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE To evaluate the incidence of surgical-site infections (SSIs) in a cohort of liver transplant recipients and to assess risk factors predisposing patients to these infections.DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study.SETTING Single transplant center in Canada.PATIENTS Patients who underwent liver transplantation between February 2011 and August 2014.METHODS Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for SSIs in liver transplant patients.RESULTS We enrolled 250 liver transplant recipients. The recipients' median age at the time of transplantation was 56 years (range, 19-70 years), and 166 patients (66.4%) were male. Moreover, 47 SSIs were documented in 43 patients (17.2%). Organ-space, superficial, and deep SSIs were noted in 29, 7, and 3 patients, respectively. In addition, 2 patients developed superficial and organ-space SSIs, and another 2 patients were found to have deep as well as organ-space infections. In total, we identified 33 organ-space SSIs (70.2%), 9 superficial SSIs (19.1%), and 5 deep SSIs (10.6%). Factors predictive of SSIs by multivariate analysis were duct-to-duct anastomosis (odds ratio [OR], 3.88; 95% CI, 1.85-8.13; P<.001) and dialysis (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.02-12.50; P=.046). Of the 66 organisms isolated in both deep and organ-space SSIs, 55 (83%) were resistant to cefazolin.CONCLUSIONS Organ-space SSIs are a common complication after liver transplantation. Duct-to-duct anastomosis and dialysis were independent risk factors associated with SSIs. Appropriate perioperative prophylaxis targeting patients with duct-to-duct anastomosis and dialysis while simultaneously providing optimum coverage for the potential pathogens causing SSIs is warranted.

TI  - Novel surgical approach based on the sentinel node concept in patients with early gastric cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF GASTROENTEROLOGICAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent prospective multicenter trials have demonstrated the clinical safety and efficacy of sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) in patients with early gastric cancer. Further, development of an intraoperative imaging system and an indocyanine green fluorescence imaging approach has been attracting attention as a novel tool for detection of the sentinel node (SN). The greatest advantage of an in vivo imaging system is that it visualizes SN and afferent lymphatic vessels from the primary tumor site more clearly than the conventional dye approach. Besides visualization of the SN, it is also essential to accurately assess the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis in the intraoperative management of SNNS. However, the clinical significance of lymph node micrometastasis (LNM) in patients with gastric cancer remains controversial. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is one of the representative assays used to identify LNM. A rapid RT-PCR assay that completes the detection of LNM within approximately 40 minutes has recently been produced and applied in the clinical management of SNNS. From the viewpoint of surgical methods, modified laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery with non-exposed approaches has recently been highlighted as a promising technique to prevent tumor dissemination caused by surgical procedures, and is likely to be clinically applied to SNNS in the future. When carrying out SNNS as a minimally invasive surgery, it is important to consider the balance between post-surgical quality of life and curability. Future prospective studies on SNNS will greatly contribute to furthering its establishment as a beneficial procedure for patients with early gastric cancer.

TI  - "Apostolic times as nonrepeatable and unique": Pentecostals and Luke-Acts
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Some Christians' scientifically-informed worldview leave little room for supernatural phenomena or divine interventions outside the accepted system of explainable cause and effect. They do not expect a supernatural/divine intervention because it falls outside their frame of reference. A part of these believers are the "cessationists" who inter alia limit the Acts 2 events of Pentecost and the other incidents of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Acts 4: 31; 8: 14-17; 9: 17; 10: 44-48; 11: 15-16; 13: 52; 19: 2-6) as well as the prevalence of charismata or spiritual gifts in the early church (1 Cor 12-14; Rom 12: 6-8; Eph 4: 11-13; 1 Pet 4: 10-11) to New Testament or apostolic times. On the other hand, classical Pentecostal believers expect that the supernatural would continually surprise them and that the events of the Day of Pentecost as well as the operation of the Spirit that characterized the life of the apostles and first assemblies as described in Acts would be repeated in their midst. In fact, they interpret and model their current reality on the basis of biblical narrative and especially Luke-Acts plays a decisive role as the replicable "history" of Jesus and the early Church. Pentecostal theologians use various aspects of the Lukan narrative to indicate that the author describes events with the clear aim and intention to encourage readers to model their practice on the basis thereof contra the cessationist view that interpret Luke's narrative about the Spirit from the theology in Paul's letters where he responds to specific situations in congregations to teach about the Spirit. These interpretations of Luke-Acts are then briefly described and analysed in contrast to the cessationist view that the events in Acts are unique and nonrepeatable before some aspects of the Pentecostal viewpoint are discussed critically. Pentecostals argue that Jesus' and Peter's sermon in respectively Luke 4: 16-30 and Acts 2: 14-41 intentionally provides an introduction to the two books in order to emphasize the important role that the Spirit plays in the ministry of Jesus and his disciples. Luke's unique reference to the mission of 70/72 disciples also serves as the fulfillment of Moses' plea that all the Lord's people may be prophets and equipped with the Spirit which is then demonstrated systematically and intentionally in the way Acts unfolds the history of the early Church. Cessationist theology responds to Luke's version of the baptism in the Spirit by interpreting Luke in Pauline terms, when Spirit baptism is limited to the event of initiation of the faithful into the Body of Christ, while Pentecostal theology chooses to describe it as a further experience in the lives of believers, in distinction from the first experience of salvation and the second experience of sanctification. It bases its view on what it perceives to be Luke's presentation of the term " filled with /baptized in the Spirit" as equipment with power in order to be effective witnesses unto the ends of the earth (Acts 1: 8). Some object that doctrine or didactic conclusions cannot be based on biblical narrative; Pentecostal theologians argue that they do not base their dogma on the narratives found in the Bible alone but primarily on the continuity of charismatic experiences witnessed in the Bible and repeated in the contemporary situation. However, the danger is that a door is left open for heresies that threaten the church because it allows for charismatic interpretation of scriptures as well as extrabiblical revelations.The issue of the underlying a-scientific worldview that underpins Pentecostal theology has not been discounted adequately. And Pentecostals' ecstatic experiences are difficult to describe; although contemporary descriptions borrow language from the Bible in order to describe these experiences, it is impossible, methodologically speaking, to place the historical and contemporary side by side in an undifferentiated analogous manner. To compare literary and contemporary spirituality with each other is impossible because of the differences in worldview, language and culture.

TI  - Satellite radar interferometry for monitoring subsidence induced by longwall mining activity using Radarsat-2, Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the simulation and real data analysis results from the recently launched SAR satellites, ALOS-2, Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2 for the purpose of monitoring subsidence induced by longwall mining activity using satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR). Because of the enhancement of orbit control (pairs with shorter perpendicular baseline) from the new satellite SAR systems, the mine subsidence detection is now mainly constrained by the phase discontinuities due to large deformation and temporal decorrelation noise.This paper investigates the performance of the three satellite missions with different imaging modes for mapping longwall mine subsidence. The results show that the three satellites perform better than their predecessors. The simulation results show that the Sentinel-1A/B constellation is capable of mapping rapid mine subsidence, especially the Sentinel-1A/B constellation with stripmap (SM) mode. Unfortunately, the Sentinel-1A/B SM data are not available in most cases and hence real data analysis cannot be conducted in this study. Despite the Sentinel-1A/B SM data, the simulation and real data analysis suggest that ALOS-2 is best suited for mapping mine subsidence amongst the three missions. Although not investigated in this study, the X-band satellites TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed with short temporal baseline and high spatial resolution can be comparable with the performance of the Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 C-band data over the dry surface with sparse vegetation.The potential of the recently launched satellites (e.g. ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1A/B) for mapping longwall mine subsidence is expected to be better than the results of this study, if the data acquired from the ideal acquisition modes are available.

TI  - Selecting the Best Band Ratio to Estimate Chlorophyll-a Concentration in a Tropical Freshwater Lake Using Sentinel 2A Images from a Case Study of Lake Ba Be (Northern Vietnam)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop a method to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) in tropical freshwater lake waters using in situ data of Chla, water reflectance, and concurrent Sentinel 2A MSI imagery (S2A) over Lake Ba Be, a Ramsar site and the largest natural freshwater lake in Vietnam. Data from 30 surveyed sampling sites over the lake water in June 2016 and May 2017 demonstrated the appropriateness of S2A green-red band ratio (band 3 versus band 4) for estimating Chla. This was shown through a strong correlation of corresponded field measured reflectance ratio with Chla by an exponential curve (r(2) = 0.68; the mean standard error of the estimates corresponding to 5% of the mean value of in situ Chla). The small error between in situ Chla, and estimated Chla from S2A acquired concurrently, confirmed the S2A green-red band ratio as the most suitable option for monitoring Chla in Lake Ba Be water. Resultant Chla distribution maps over time described a partially-seasonal pattern and also displayed the spatial dynamic of Chla in the lake. This allows a better understanding of the lake's limnological processes to be developed and provides an insight into the factors that affect lake water quality. The results also confirmed the potential of S2A to be used as a free tool for lake monitoring and research due to high spatial resolution data (10 m pixel size).

TI  - Delineating and predicting changes in rice cropping systems using multi-temporal MODIS data in Myanmar
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Rice is the most important source of livelihood for people in Myanmar. This study aimed to delineate the country's rice cropping systems from MODIS data and predict future changes using a Markov cellular automata (MCA) model. The mapping results compared with the ground reference data indicated overall accuracies and kappa coefficients generally higher than 89 percent and 0.79, respectively. These results were reaffirmed by a strong association between the MODIS-based rice area and the government's rice area statistics (R-2>0.8). From 2001-2002 to 2013-2014, the country's rice area increased by 562,850ha, mainly attributed to the increase in the double-cropped rice area from 2001-2002 to 2007-2008. The changes in rice area predicted for 2025-2026 indicated that the rice area would increase by 5.9 percent (445,750ha), from 7,618,800ha in 2013-2014 to 8,064,550ha in 2025-2026. Of this amount, double-cropped rice contributed 21.1 percent (420,500ha) and single-cropped rice contributed only 0.4 percent (25,250ha).

TI  - Sea-ice production in the northern Japan Sea
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinking of the dense water plays a significant role in the global climate system by driving thermohaline (overturning) circulation and biogeochemical cycles. Deep water convection occurs also in the Japan Sea, and the convection has been considered to be mainly caused by intense cooling of the sea surface. Another possible cause of the convection is brine rejection associated with high sea-ice production in a coastal polynya (thin sea ice) area in the northern Japan Sea. We have developed an algorithm which detects the thin ice area and estimates the thickness using passive microwave satellite data. Based on a heat flux calculation with the satellite derived ice thickness, the total sea-ice production in winter (December March) averaged over 2002/03-2010/11 is estimated to be 4.27 x 10(10) m(3). This indicates that the ice production was underestimated by about half in a previous study in which the polynya was unrealistically treated as a low ice concentration area. The main determinant factor for the total ice production is the surface air temperature in early winter (December January), which shows a rapid warming trend of 0.7 degrees C/decade for this 40-years. Based on a linear regression approach, the total ice production is estimated to have decreased by similar to 5%/decade due to air temperature warming. If brine rejection due to the ice production contributes to the deep water formation in the Japan Sea, this is consistent with the fact that the deep water formation has been decreasing for the last 50-100 years.

TI  - Sea-Ice Production in Antarctic Coastal Polynyas Estimated From AMSR2 Data and Its Validation Using AMSR-E and SSM/I-SSMIS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic coastal polynyas are very high sea-ice production areas. The resultant large amount of brine rejection leads to the formation of dense water. The dense water forms Antarctic bottom water, which is the densest water in the global overturning circulation and a key player in climate change as a significant sink for heat and carbon dioxide. In this study, an algorithm was developed that uses Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data (2012-present) to detect polynya area and estimates thin ice thickness by a method similar to that used to develop the algorithm for Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) data. Landfast sea-ice areas were also detected using AMSR2 data. Ice production in the polynyas was estimated by a heat flux calculation using AMSR2 sea-ice data. In four major polynyas, AMSR2 ice production was compared with AMSR-E (2003-2011) ice production through comparison of them with Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) ice production. The comparison confirmed that the ice production from AMSR-E/2 data, which have higher spatial resolution than SSM/I-SSMIS data, can be used to analyze time series covering more than 10 years. For example, maps of annual ice production based on AMSR-E/2 data revealed detailed changes of the Mertz Polynya, where the ice production decreased significantly after the Mertz Glacier Tongue calving in 2010. Continuous monitoring of the coastal polynyas by the AMSR series sensors is essential for climate-change-related analyses in the Antarctic Ocean.

T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intraoperative analysis of lymph nodes during a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure could result in one-step surgery for early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with an occult nodal metastasis. One-step nucleic acid amplification rapidly detects cytokeratin 19 (CK19) RNA with high accuracy. Sensitivity and specificity of CK19 expression in OSCC was evaluated.Methods: Immunohistochemical CK19 expression was done in 207 patients with OSCC with 65 cases of paired nodal metastases.Results: CK19 was expressed in 65% of all OSCC and even less in early OSCC (56%), with poor correlation between primary tumor and (occult) nodal metastasis. Furthermore, ectopic glandular tissue in close proximity of lymph nodes showed strong CK19 expression.Conclusion: CK19 lacks both sensitivity and specificity as a biomarker for nodal metastasis in OSCC, which questions the suitability for CK19-based one-step nucleic acid amplification in SLNB procedures. Therefore, future studies should focus on other biomarkers, because the concept of fast intraoperative diagnostics during SLNB remains attractive.

TI  - Monitoring the Response of Roads and Railways to Seasonal Soil Movement with Persistent Scatterers Interferometry over Six UK Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Road and rail networks provide critical support for society, yet they can be degraded by seasonal soil movements. Currently, few transport network operators monitor small-scale soil movement, but understanding the conditions contributing to infrastructure failure can improve network resilience. Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) is a remote sensing technique offering the potential for near real-time ground movement monitoring over wide areas. This study tests the use of PSI for monitoring the response of major roads, minor roads, and railways to ground movement across six study sites in England, using Sentinel 1 data in VV polarisation in ascending orbit. Some soils are more stable than othersa national soil map was used to quantify the relationships between infrastructure movement and major soil groups. Vertical movement of transport infrastructure is a function of engineering design, soil properties, and traffic loading. Roads and railways built on soil groups prone to seasonal water-logging (Ground-water Gley soils, Surface-water Gley soils, Pelosols, and Brown soils) demonstrated seasonal subsidence and heave, associated with an increased risk of infrastructure degradation. Roads and railways over Podzolic soils demonstrated relative stability. Railways on Peat soils exhibited the most extreme continual subsidence of up to 7.5 mm year(-1). Limitations of this study include the short observation period (similar to 13 months, due to satellite data availability) and the regional scale of the soil mapmapping units contain multiple soil types with different ground movement potentials. Future use of a higher resolution soil map over a longer period will advance this research. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates the viability of PSI as a technique for measuring both seasonal soil-related ground movement and the associated impacts on road and rail infrastructure.

TI  - Intermediate-Term Outcomes for Men with Very Low/Low and Intermediate/High Risk Prostate Cancer Managed by Active Surveillance
T2  - JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We compare intermediate term clinical outcomes among men with favorable risk and intermediate/high risk prostate cancer managed by active surveillance.Materials and Methods: A total of 635 men with localized prostate cancer have been on active surveillance since 2002 at a high volume academic hospital in the United States. Median followup is 50.5 months (IQR 31.1-80.3). Time to event analysis was performed for our clinical end points.Results: Of the cohort 117 men (18.4%) had intermediate/high risk disease. Overall 5 and 10-year all cause survival was 98% and 94%, respectively. Cumulative metastasis-free survival at 5 and 10 years was 99% and 98%, respectively. To date no cancer specific deaths had been observed. Overall freedom from intervention was 61% and 49% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Overall cumulative freedom from failure of active surveillance, defined as metastasis or biochemical failure after local therapy with curative intent, was 97% and 91% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Of the men 21 (9.9%) experienced biochemical failure after deferred treatment and the 5-year progression-free probability was 92%. Compared to men with favorable risk disease those with intermediate/high risk cancer experienced no difference in metastases, surveillance failure or curative intervention. However, patients at higher risk were at significantly increased risk for all cause mortality, likely reflecting patient selection factors. These conclusions may be limited by the small number of events and the duration of our study.Conclusions: Patients with localized prostate cancer who are on active surveillance demonstrated a low rate of active surveillance failure, prostate cancer specific mortality and metastases regardless of baseline risk.

TI  - "Dark Newnesses": The Failures of <i>Joseph Anton</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMONWEALTH LITERATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Salman Rushdie's 2012 memoir, Joseph Anton, marks a turning point in his career. While his earlier work celebrated "cultural translation" and the emergence of "newness" into the world, this book expresses reservations. "The arrival of the new was not always linked to progress", Rushdie writes, "Men found new ways of oppressing one another, too, new ways of unmaking their best achievements and sliding back towards that primal ooze; and men's darkest innovations, as much as their brightest ones, confused their fellow men". These "dark newnesses", as he calls them, "were innovations that came into being in the name of a totalizing ideology, an absolute ruler, an unarguable dogma, or a god". However, despite this turn towards a more binary worldview, the complexity of Rushdie's earlier writing refuses to be completely stifled, and this article argues that Joseph Anton is ultimately unable to persuasively follow through on its rhetoric of a world simplistically torn between newnesses "bright" and "dark". Although frequently relying on binary language, it is precisely the memoir's patent failure to convincingly represent the world in such starkly simplistic terms that, inadvertently, renders it valuable in foregrounding the nuances of post-9/11 identity politics that its author ostensibly seeks to deny.

TI  - Unexpected changes in community size structure in a natural warming experiment
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural ecosystems typically consist of many small and few large organisms(1-4). The scaling of this negative relationship between body mass and abundance has important implications for resource partitioning and energy usage(5-7). Global warming over the next century is predicted to favour smaller organisms(8-12), producing steeper mass-abundance scaling(13) and a less efficient transfer of biomass through the food web(5). Here, we show that the opposite effect occurs in a natural warming experiment involving 13 whole-stream ecosystems within the same catchment, which span a temperature gradient of 5-25 degrees C. We introduce a mechanistic model that shows how the temperature dependence of basal resource carrying capacity can account for these previously unexpected results. If nutrient supply increases with temperature to offset the rising metabolic demand of primary producers, there will be sufficient resources to sustain larger consumers at higher trophic levels. These new data and the model that explains them highlight important exceptions to some commonly assumed 'rules' about responses to warming in natural ecosystems.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and describe a list of sentinel events (SEs) for Primary Care (PC).METHODODOLOGY: A structured experts' consensus was obtained by using two online questionnaires. The participants were selected because of their expertise in PC and patient safety. The first questionnaire assessed the suitability of the hospital SEs established in the National Quality Forum 2006 for use in PC via responses of "yes", "no", or "yes but with modification". In the latter case, a re-wording of the SE was requested. Additionally, inclusion of new SEs was also allowed. The second questionnaire included those SEs with positive responses ("yes", "yes with modification"), so that the experts could choose between the original and alternative drafts, and evaluate the newly described SEs.RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed by 44 out of a total of the 47 experts asked to participate, and a total of 17 SEs were identified as suitable for PC. For the first questionnaire, 12 of the 28 hospital SEs were considered adaptable to PC, of which 11 were re-drafts. Thirty-seven experts proposed new SEs. These mainly concerned problems with medication and vaccines, delay, or lack of assistance, diagnostic delays, and problems with diagnostic tests, and were finally summarised in 5 SEs. In the second questionnaire, ≥65% of the experts chose the alternative wording against the original cases for the 11 SEs suitable for PC. The 5 newly included SEs were considered adequate with a positive response of 70-85%.CONCLUSION: Having a list of SEs available in PC will help to improve the management of health care risks.

TI  - Mapping leaf nitrogen and carbon concentrations of intact and fragmented indigenous forest ecosystems using empirical modeling techniques and WorldView-2 data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) are among the most important biochemical components of tree organic matter, and the estimation of their concentrations can help to monitor the nutrient uptake processes and health of forest trees. Traditionally, these tree biochemical components are estimated using costly, labour intensive, time-consuming and subjective analytical protocols. The use of very high spatial resolution multispectral data and advanced machine learning regression algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) provide an opportunity to accurately estimate foliar N and C concentrations over intact and fragmented forest ecosystems. In the present study, the utility of spectral vegetation indices calculated from WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery for mapping leaf N and C concentrations of fragmented and intact indigenous forest ecosystems was explored. We collected leaf samples from six tree species in the fragmented as well as intact Dukuduku indigenous forest ecosystems. Leaf samples (n = 85 for each of the fragmented and intact forests) were subjected to chemical analysis for estimating the concentrations of N and C. We used 70% of samples for training our models and 30% for validating the accuracy of our predictive empirical models. The study showed that the N concentration was significantly higher (p = 0.03) in the intact forests than in the fragmented forest. There was no significant difference (p = 0.55) in the C concentration between the intact and fragmented forest strata. The results further showed that the foliar N and C concentrations could be more accurately estimated using the fragmented stratum data compared with the intact stratum data. Further, SVM achieved relatively more accurate N (maximum R-2 V-al = 0.78 and minimum RMSEval = 1.07% of the mean) and C (maximum R-2 V-al = 0.67 and minimum RMSEv(al) = 1.64% of the mean) estimates compared with ANN (maximum (RVal)-V-2 = 0.70 for N and 0.51 for C and minimum RMSEval = 5.40% of the mean for N and 2.21% of the mean for C). Overall, SVM regressions achieved more accurate models for estimating forest foliar N and C concentrations in the fragmented and intact indigenous forests compared to the ANN regression method. It is concluded that the successful application of the WV-2 data integrated with SVM can provide an accurate framework for mapping the concentrations of biochemical elements in two indigenous forest ecosystems.

TI  - Characteristics of Aerosol Types in Beijing and the Associations with Air Pollution from 2004 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the fast development of the economy and expansion, a large number of people have concentrated in Beijing over the past few decades, leading to the result that Beijing has become home to one of the most complex mixtures of aerosol types in the world. The various aerosol types play different roles in the determination of global climate change, visibility, and human health. However, to the best of our knowledge, research has rarely analyzed the correlation between aerosol types and air quality index (AQI) in Beijing (urban and suburban) over a long-term series of observations. Therefore, in this study, we aim to identify and discuss the different aerosol types and AQI in Beijing from 2004 to 2015. The aerosol types are classified into six categories: dust, mixed, highly-absorbing, moderately-absorbing, slightly-absorbing, and scattering by a multiple clustering method with the fine mode fraction (FMF) and single scattering albedo (SSA) data of retrievals from the global Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometer sites. The AQI levels: are good (0-50); moderate (51-100); unhealthy for sensitive groups (101-150); unhealthy (151-200); very unhealthy (201-300); and hazardous (>300). The results show that a significant FMF variability occurred among different seasons in Beijing, with maximum values present in spring and minimum values in winter. The SSA values exhibit variation, with small fluctuations from season to season. In the case of BJ station, the scattering aerosols are more frequent in summer (39%) and less in winter (1%), while the coarse particles (dust) are more frequent in spring (18%) and less in autumn (6%). In contrast, the absorbing aerosols (especially slightly-absorbing) are more frequent in summer (35%) and winter (15%). However, the mixed aerosol types are more frequent in spring (38%) and less in summer (8%). There is a similar seasonal variation in XH. In the past 12 years, the slightly-absorbing aerosol type in Beijing has increased by approximately 14%, which is believed to be due to the rapid development of industrial cities. In addition, comparing the urban and suburban regions, the slightly-absorbing aerosol type is the dominant aerosol type in both areas. Furthermore, to identify the dominant aerosol types which lead to air pollution, a related analysis was carried out by analyzing different aerosol types and the relationship between aerosol types and AQI. The results indicate that the air pollution was strongly correlated to slightly-absorbing aerosols, in which the percentage of slightly-absorbing aerosols was about 49% during the hazardous days in 2013-2015, and the correlation between AQI and aerosol types is also strong (R-2 = 0.76 and 0.97, in Beijing and Xianghe).

TI  - Epidemiology of Major Depressive Disorder Disability in the US Military <i>FY</i> <i>2007</i>-<i>2012</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD) disability discharge and retirement in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force and describes MDD comorbidity. Service members with a disability discharge for either MDD (n = 2,882) or any nonpsychiatric disability (n = 56,145), between fiscal years 2007 and 2012, were included in the study population. Those with MDD disability at first evaluation but not at last evaluation were excluded. The incidence of MDD disability discharge increased significantly in the Army and Air Force between fiscal years 2007 and 2012. MDD disability retirement significantly increased in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Females, and those who experienced at least one deployment, had higher incidence rates of MDD disability discharge. All services included spinal diseases and posttraumatic stress disorder in their top five comorbid categories. Given the association between trauma and MDD, further research into the role of both combat exposure and injury on MDD is merited.

TI  - Effects of 4D-Var Data Assimilation Using Remote Sensing Precipitation Products in a WRF Model over the Complex Terrain of an Arid Region River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Individually, ground-based, in situ observations, remote sensing, and regional climate modeling cannot provide the high-quality precipitation data required for hydrological prediction, especially over complex terrains. Data assimilation techniques can be used to bridge the gap between observations and models by assimilating ground observations and remote sensing products into models to improve precipitation simulation and forecasting. However, only a small portion of satellite-retrieved precipitation products assimilation research has been implemented over complex terrains in an arid region. Here, we used the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model to assimilate two satellite precipitation products (The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission: TRMM 3B42 and Fengyun-2D: FY-2D) using the 4D-Var data assimilation method for a typical inland river basin in northwest China's arid region, the Heihe River Basin, where terrains are very complex. The results show that the assimilation of remote sensing precipitation products can improve the initial WRF fields of humidity and temperature, thereby improving precipitation forecasting and decreasing the spin-up time. Hence, assimilating TRMM and FY-2D remote sensing precipitation products using WRF 4D-Var can be viewed as a positive step toward improving the accuracy and lead time of numerical weather prediction models, particularly over regions with complex terrains.

TI  - The hydro-geomorphologic complexity of the lower Amazon River floodplain and hydrological connectivity assessed by remote sensing and field control
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological connectivity processes along the lower Amazon River floodplain at Lago Miratuba Floodplain (LMF) were analyzed based on remote sensing and field measurements. Connectivity processes are related to 12 geomorphic sub-units of the floodplain that are interconnected at different stage thresholds through channelized and overbank flow paths, while lakes act as reservoirs for flood waters, local rainfall, and water table saturation-seepage. Hydrological connectivity processes along the floodplain happen through complex internal routings of water flows over space and time, mainly along floodplain channels and breached levees. The contribution of local recharge (mainly rainfall) was decoupled from river recharge (river hydrological connection to floodplain) because precipitations and local runoff also recharge the floodplain. The hydrological connectivity of the 12 geomorphic units varied significantly from each other, because the inundation and the floodplain connections with the river were initiated at specific river stage thresholds for each sub-unit.An interesting finding is that connections with the river for all units were initiated through channelized flows below the bankfull stage of the Amazon River. The connectivity processes over different geomorphic units are also not correlated with their minimum distance (shortest lines) from the river. This implies that a "flood pulse" model largely concerned with lateral connectivity (mostly through overbank diffusion) only partially explains the complex hydrological connectivity processes at a regional scale along the complex lower Amazon River floodplain. Thus, for hydrological connectivity assessments in the Amazon River floodplain, reach-by-reach scale studies have to be carried out, relating the hydro-geomorphologic processes (channelized flow routing paths, overbank diffusion, and local recharge) to the internal geomorphic variability and complexity of the floodplain.

TI  - Fast and Efficient Correction of Ground Moving Targets in a Synthetic Aperture Radar, Single-Look Complex Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground moving targets distort normally-focused synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Since most high-resolution SAR data providers only offer single-look complex (SLC) data rather than raw signals to general users, they need to apply a simple and efficient residual SAR focusing to SLC data containing moving targets. This paper presents an efficient and effective SAR residual focusing method that is practically applicable to SLC data. The residual Doppler spectrum of the moving target is derived from a general SAR configuration and normal SAR focusing. The processing steps are simple and straightforward, with a limited size of the processing window, e.g., 64 x 64. Application results using simulation data and actual TerraSAR-X SLC data with a speed-controlled vehicle demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, which particularly improves the -3 dB width, integrated sidelobe ratio, and symmetry of the reconstructed signals. In particular, the azimuthal symmetry becomes seriously distorted when the target speed is higher than 8 m/s (or 28.8 km/h), and the symmetry is well recovered by the proposed method.

TI  - Satellite-based crop coefficient and evapotranspiration using surface soil moisture and vegetation indices in Northeast Asia
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the crop coefficient (K-c) is crucial for estimating actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) and planning appropriate irrigation management for efficient crop yield. In this study, satellite-based K-c values were estimated at cropland and mixed forest sites based on the dual crop coefficient approach using merged soil moisture from the European Space Agency as an indicator of evaporation from soil, as well as the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) to explain the effect of transpiration from plants. Comparison of the seasonal patterns and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) of NDVI, LAI, and surface soil moisture with K-c indicated that it was reasonable to use the three variables as independent variables to estimate K-c. Based on these results, the satellite -based K-c estimated using NDVI, LAI, and soil moisture (Case 1) was compared with the K-c calculated from NDVI and LAI (Case 2) and the flux towers at the significance level of 0.05. The statistical results confirmed that the K-c estimated from Case 1 (Bias: -0.012 to 0.053, RMSE: 0.144 to 0.172, and r: 0.463 to 0.800) showed better agreement with the observed K-c than that estimated from Case 2 (Bias: -0.058 to 0.088, RMSE: 0.146 to 0.221, and r: 0.434 to 0.788). Among the three variables, soil moisture had the greatest impact on the rice paddy, while the NDVI showed the highest influence on the mixed forest. Based on these results, K-c estimated from Case 1 was multiplied by MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based potential crop evapotranspiration and compared with the latent heat flux from flux towers. ETa showed reasonable bias (cropland: -0.224 to 1.364, mixed forest: 0.711 to 1.055), RMSE (cropland: 1.952 to 2.126, mixed forest: 1.085 to 1.878) and r (cropland: 0.529 to 0.832, mixed forest: 0.850 to 0.909) at all of the study sites. After validation of the satellite -based K-c approach under various vegetation types and climate conditions, this approach can be employed not only for developing adequate water and agricultural management plans, but also for analyzing and predicting crop yield productivity and agricultural drought.

TI  - The 2015 Surge of Hispar Glacier in the Karakoram
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karakoram mountain range is well known for its numerous surge-type glaciers of which several have recently surged or are still doing so. Analysis of multi-temporal satellite images and digital elevation models have revealed impressive details about the related changes (e.g., in glacier length, surface elevation and flow velocities) and considerably expanded the database of known surge-type glaciers. One glacier that has so far only been reported as impacted by surging tributaries, rather than surging itself, is the 50 km long main trunk of Hispar Glacier in the Hunza catchment. We here present the evolution of flow velocities and surface features from its 2015/16 surge as revealed from a dense time series of SAR and optical images along with an analysis of historic satellite images. We observed maximum flow velocities of up to 14 m d(-1) (5 km a(-1)) in spring 2015, sudden drops in summer velocities, a second increase in winter 2015/16 and a total advance of the surge front of about 6 km. During a few months the surge front velocity was much higher (about 90 m d(-1)) than the maximum flow velocity. We assume that one of its northern tributary glaciers, Yutmaru, initiated the surge at the end of summer 2014 and that the variability in flow velocities was driven by changes in the basal hydrologic regime (Alaska-type surge). We further provide evidence that Hispar Glacier has surged before (around 1960) over a distance of about 10 km so that it can also be regarded as a surge-type glacier.

TI  - Sentinel-1A-First precise orbit determination results
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1A is the first satellite of the European Copernicus programme. Equipped with a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument the satellite was launched on April 3, 2014. Operational since October 2014 the satellite delivers valuable data for more than two years. The orbit accuracy requirements are given as 5 cm in 3D. In order to fulfill this stringent requirement the precise orbit determination (POD) is based on the dual-frequency GPS observations delivered by an eight-channel GPS receiver.The Copernicus POD (CPOD) Service is in charge of providing the orbital and auxiliary products required by the PDGS (Payload Data Ground Segment). External orbit validation is regularly performed by comparing the CPOD Service orbits to orbit solutions provided by POD expert members of the Copernicus POD Quality Working Group (QWG). The orbit comparisons revealed systematic orbit offsets mainly in radial direction (approx. 3 cm). Although no independent observation technique (e.g. DORIS, SLR) is available to validate the GPS-derived orbit solutions, comparisons between the different antenna phase center variations and different reduced dynamic orbit determination approaches used in the various software packages helped to detect the cause of the systematic offset. An error in the given geometry information about the satellite has been found. After correction of the geometry the orbit validation shows a significant reduction of the radial offset to below 5 mm. The 5 cm orbit accuracy requirement in 3D is fulfilled according to the results of the orbit comparisons between the different orbit solutions from the QWG. (C) 2017 COSPAR.

TI  - Developments in Landsat Land Cover Classification Methods: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Land cover classification of Landsat images is one of the most important applications developed from Earth observation satellites. The last four decades were marked by different developments in land cover classification methods of Landsat images. This paper reviews the developments in land cover classification methods for Landsat images from the 1970s to date and highlights key ways to optimize analysis of Landsat images in order to attain the desired results. This review suggests that the development of land cover classification methods grew alongside the launches of a new series of Landsat sensors and advancements in computer science. Most classification methods were initially developed in the 1970s and 1980s; however, many advancements in specific classifiers and algorithms have occurred in the last decade. The first methods of land cover classification to be applied to Landsat images were visual analyses in the early 1970s, followed by unsupervised and supervised pixel-based classification methods using maximum likelihood, K-means and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODAT) classifiers. After 1980, other methods such as sub-pixel, knowledge-based, contextual-based, object-based image analysis (OBIA) and hybrid approaches became common in land cover classification. Attaining the best classification results with Landsat images demands particular attention to the specifications of each classification method such as selecting the right training samples, choosing the appropriate segmentation scale for OBIA, pre-processing calibration, choosing the right classifier and using suitable Landsat images. All these classification methods applied on Landsat images have strengths and limitations. Most studies have reported the superior performance of OBIA on different landscapes such as agricultural areas, forests, urban settlements and wetlands; however, OBIA has challenges such as selecting the optimal segmentation scale, which can result in over or under segmentation, and the low spatial resolution of Landsat images. Other classification methods have the potential to produce accurate classification results when appropriate procedures are followed. More research is needed on the application of hybrid classifiers as they are considered more complex methods for land cover classification.

TI  - Intention-to-Treat Analysis of Radical Trachelectomy for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer With Special Reference to Oncologic Failures: Single-Institutional Experience in Hungary
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of our study was to evaluate clinical and pathological data in order to draw eligibility criteria for oncologically sufficient radical trachelectomy (RT) in early-stage cervical cancer. Reviewing all cases of attempted RT performed at our unit, we focused attention on prognostic indicators of the need for additional oncologic treatment following RT. The analysis was extended by extensive literature review to include previously published cases of oncologic failures.Methods The authors retrospectively analyzed data of patients who underwent RT at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Debrecen. Electronic records and case notes of RT cases were reviewed to determine the incidence of abdominal and vaginal route, distribution of clinicopathologic data, and follow-up results of individual cases. Individual procedures were categorized as oncologically insufficient if additional oncologic treatment was necessary following RT. Theoretical eligibility criteria for RT in early-stage cervical cancer were determined retrospectively by selecting prognostic features that were associated with oncologic insufficiency from clinicopathologic indicators of the complete series.Results Twenty-four cases of RT were performed by the authors, 15 vaginal RTs with laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy and 9 abdominal RTs with open pelvic lymphadenectomy. Fifteen of 24 cases proved oncologically sufficient. Three cases required immediate conversion to radical hysterectomy because of positive sentinel nodes and/or positive isthmic disc on frozen section. In further 5 cases, final pathology results indicated additional oncologic treatment, that is, radical hysterectomy (n = 2), chemoradiotherapy (n = 2), or chemotherapy (n = 1). One patient among immediately converted cases and another 3 among those who required additional oncologic treatment died of their disease later. There were no other cases of recurrences over a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 12-188 months). Factors that may predict oncologic insufficiency of RT were stage IB1 or greater, tumor size of greater than 2 cm in 1 dimension or greater than 15 mm in 3 dimensions, G3, nonsquamous/adeno histological type, stromal invasion of greater than 9 mm, and lymphovascular space involvement in the primary tumor.Conclusions Most cases of oncologically insufficient RTs have significant risk features that can be identified preoperatively. There is a need for more clinicopathologic data on oncologic failure of RT cases in order to improve patient selection.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - CLINICS IN LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) has probably become the most popular method of early staging of patients with cutaneous melanoma. SLNs are considered to be the most likely ones to contain metastatic deposits; thus, they can be examined in a more intense manner than in standard lymphadenectomy. Most processing protocols use formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin with the addition of immunohistochemistry. Approximately 20% of patients with cutaneous melanoma show melanoma cells in the SLNs. Different methods of quantification of tumor burden in SLNs provide clinically important prognostic information.

TI  - COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT BETWEEN PER-PIXEL AND OBJECT-ORIENTED FOR MAPPING LAND COVER AND USE
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional per-pixel classification methods consider only spectral information, and may be limited. Object-based classifiers, however, also consider shape and texture, firstly segmenting the image, and then classifying individual objects. Thus, a Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) was compared in conjunction with data mining techniques and a traditional per-pixel method. A cut of Landsat-8, bands 2 to 7, orbit/point 223/77, located between the municipalities of Cascavel, Corbelia, Cafelandia and Tupassi, in the west part of the state of Parana, from 12/18/2013 was used. In the GEOBIA approach was realized image segmentation, spatial and spectral attribute extraction, and classification using the decision tree supervised algorithm, J48. For the per-pixel method, we used the supervised Maximum Likelihood Classifier. Both approaches presented equivalent results, with Kappa Index of 0.75 and Global Accuracy (GA) of 78.97% for the approach by GEOBIA and Kappa Index of 0.72 and GA of 77.44% for the per-pixel classification. The classification by GEOBIA showed better accuracy for the soil, forest and soybean classes, and did not show the splash aspect, which visually improves the classification result.

TI  - Dispersed decision-making system with fusion methods. from the rank level and the measurement level - A comparative study
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the problem of decision-making based on dispersed knowledge that is stored in several independent knowledge bases. The dispersed decision-making system, which was proposed in a previous paper of the authors, is used. In this study, four fusion methods from the rank level and, nine methods from the measurement level were used in this dispersed system. These methods were tested on three data sets from the UCI Repository - Soybean, Vehicle Silhouettes and Landsat Satellite. The sets are diverse in terms of the number of objects, the number,of conditional attributes and the number of decision classes. There are also various types of conditional attributes in these sets. The experimental section is divided according to the three objectives of the article. The fusion methods Were compared in the two groups - rank, and measurement levels. In addition, experiments were carried out fusing multiple methods simultaneously in the decision-making process. Methods from the rank level and the measurement level were applied simultaneously in the same decision-making process. Then the decisions that were generated by the methods were merged. The results were compared,and conclusions were drawn. The third goal of the article was to compare the efficiency of the inference of fusion method with and without the use of a dispersed system. It was found that the use of a dispersed system improved the efficiency of inference in most cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrative information models for filling/reconstructing hydro-climatic time-series are required for a variety of practical applications. A GIS-based model for a rapid and reliable assessment of monthly time-series of several key hydro-climatic variables at the basin scale, is here developed as plug-in and applied to the entire region of Sicily (Italy). The plug-in, once the desired basin outlet section and time-window are selected, uses appropriate spatial techniques and algorithms to identify its drainage area and estimate the corresponding mean areal rainfall and temperatures time-series. A recent regional regressive rainfall-runoff model is successively applied for the assessment of the runoff time-series. Finally, a consolidated temperature-based method is applied to estimate monthly potential evapotranspiration time-series, while, actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture storage time-series are derived through a classical water balance model. The tool, supported by a preliminarily developed database, includes automatic procedures for data retrieving and processing and a user friendly interface. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating Ground Level NO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations over Central-Eastern China Using a Satellite-Based Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - People in central-eastern China are suffering from severe air pollution of nitrogen oxides. Top-down approaches have been widely applied to estimate the ground concentrations of NO2 based on satellite data. In this paper, a one-year dataset of tropospheric NO2 columns from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) together with ambient monitoring station measurements and meteorological data from May 2013 to April 2014, are used to estimate the ground level NO2. The mean values of OMI tropospheric NO2 columns show significant geographical and seasonal variation when the ambient monitoring stations record a certain range. Hence, a geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model is introduced to treat the spatio-temporal non-stationarities between tropospheric-columnar and ground level NO2. Cross-validations demonstrate that the GTWR model outperforms the ordinary least squares (OLS), the geographically weighted regression (GWR), and the temporally weighted regression (TWR), produces the highest R-2 (0.60) and the lowest values of root mean square error mean (RMSE), absolute difference (MAD), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Our method is better than or comparable to the chemistry transport model method. The satellite-estimated spatial distribution of ground NO2 shows a reasonable spatial pattern, with high annual mean values (>40 g/m(3)), mainly over southern Hebei, northern Henan, central Shandong, and southern Shaanxi. The values of population-weight NO2 distinguish densely populated areas with high levels of human exposure from others.

TI  - Seasonal variation of Guangdong coastal thermal front based on merged satellite data
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis ( OSTIA) data in 2015, we analyzed the seasonal variation and genesis mechanisms of thermal fronts in Guangdong coastal zone. The Guangdong coastal thermal fronts are strong in winter and weak in summer. In the eastern Guangdong coastal zone, thermal fronts are seen all year round, while in the western Guangdong coastal zone, thermal fronts disappear in summer. In the Pearl River estuary zone, thermal fronts are associated with the Pearl River plumes, which extend east northward in summer and southward in autumn. We suggest wind speed play important roles in the genesis and disappearance of these thermal fronts. Using a simple model, we find that monsoon influences the front strength through air-sea turbulent heat fluxes. Under southwesterly (northeasterly) wind condition, warm and wet (cold and dry) air mass could decrease (increase) the latent heat release near the cold coastal zone, leading to a temperature increase in the cold zone, and finally the front disappears.

TI  - Impacts of Urbanization on Vegetation Phenology over the Past Three Decades in Shanghai, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology manifests the rhythm of annual plant life activities. It has been extensively studied in natural ecosystems. However, major knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the impacts of urbanization on vegetation phenology. This study addresses two questions to fill the knowledge gaps: (1) How does vegetation phenology vary spatially and temporally along a rural-to-urban transect in Shanghai, China, over the past three decades? (2) How do landscape composition and configuration affect those variations of vegetation phenology? To answer these questions, 30 m x 30 m mean vegetation phenology metrics, including the start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season (EOS), and length of growing season (LOS), were derived for urban vegetation using dense stacks of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series from images collected by Landsat 5-8 satellites from 1984 to 2015. Landscape pattern metrics were calculated using high spatial resolution aerial photos. We then used Pearson correlation analysis to quantify the associations between phenology patterns and landscape metrics. We found that vegetation in urban centers experienced advances of SOS for 5-10 days and delays of EOS for 5-11 days compared with those located in the surrounding rural areas. Additionally, we observed strong positive correlations between landscape composition (percentage of landscape area) of developed land and LOS of urban vegetation. We also found that the landscape configuration of local land cover types, especially patch density and edge density, was significantly correlated with the spatial patterns of vegetation phenology. These results demonstrate that vegetation phenology in the urban area is significantly different from its rural surroundings. These findings have implications for urban environmental management, ranging from biodiversity protection to public health risk reduction.

TI  - Retrieval of forest fuel moisture content using a coupled radiative transfer model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fuel moisture content (FMC) dynamics are paramount to assessing the forest wildfire risk and its behavior. This variable can be retrieved from remotely sensed data using a radiative transfer model (RTM). However, previous studies generally treated the background of forest canopy as soil surface while ignored the fact that the soil may be covered by grass canopy. In this study, we focused on retrieving FMC of such forestry structure by coupling two RTMs: PROSAIL and PRO-GeoSail. The spectra of lower grass canopy were firstly simulated by the PROSAIL model, which was then coupled into the PRO-GeoSail model. The results showed that the accuracy level of retrieved FMC using this coupled model was better than that when the PRO-GeoSail model used alone. Further analysis revealed that low FMC condition fostered by fire weather condition had an important influence on the breakout of a fire during the study period. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Impact of Medication-Based Risk Adjustment on the Association Between Veteran Health Outcomes and Dual Health System Use
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Veterans commonly receive care from both Veterans Health Administration (VA) and non-VA sources (i.e., dual use). A major challenge in comparing health outcomes between dual users and VA-predominant users is applying an accurate method of risk adjustment.To determine how different comorbidity indices affect the association between patterns of dual use and health outcomes.Retrospective cohort.A total of 316,775 community-dwelling Veterans (65 years) with type 2 diabetes who were enrolled in VA and fee-for-service Medicare from 2008 to 2010.We determined the associations between dual use and death or diabetes-related hospitalization in FY 2010 using multivariable models incorporating claims-based (Elixhauser) or medication-based (RxRisk-V) risk adjustment. Dual use was classified using four previously identified groups of health services users: 1) VA-predominant, 2) VA + Medicare visits and labs, 3) VA + Medicare test strips, and 4) VA + Medicare medications.Controlling for Elixhauser comorbidities, dual-use groups 2-4 had significantly decreased odds of death or hospitalization compared to VA-predominant users. Controlling for RxRisk-V comorbidities, groups 2-4 had increased odds of death compared to VA-predominant users, but variable odds of hospitalization, with group 2 having increased odds (OR 1.06, CI 1.04-1.09), while groups 3 (OR 0.96, CI 0.94-0.99) and 4 (OR 0.93, CI 0.89-0.97) had decreased odds.The method of risk adjustment drastically influences the direction of effect in health outcomes among dual users of VA and Medicare. These findings underscore the need for standardized and reliable risk adjustment methods that are not susceptible to measurement differences across different health systems.

TI  - Local- and Plot-Scale Measurements of Soil Moisture: Time and Spatially Resolved Field Techniques in Plain, Hill and Mountain Sites
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture measurement is essential to validate hydrological models and satellite data. In this work we provide an overview of different local and plot scale soil moisture measurement techniques applied in three different conditions in terms of altitude, land use, and soil type, namely a plain, a mountain meadow and a hilly vineyard. The main goal is to provide a synoptic view of techniques supported by practical case studies to show that in such different conditions it is possible to estimate a time and spatially resolved soil moisture by the same combination of instruments: contact-based methods (i.e., Time Domain Reflectometry-TDR, and two low frequency probes) for the time resolved, and hydro-geophysical minimally-invasive methods (i.e., Electromagnetic Induction-EMI, Ground Penetrating Radar-GPR, and the Electrical Resistivity Tomography-ERT) for the spatially resolved. Both long-term soil moisture measurements and spatially resolved measurement campaigns are discussed. Technical and operational measures are detailed to allow critical factors to be identified.

TI  - An Accurate Semianalytical Waveform Model for Mispointed SAR Interferometric Altimeters
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeters reduce the along-track footprint size exploiting the coherence of the transmitted pulses and achieve at the same time a noise reduction. Consequently, a large effort has been aimed at the formulation of theoretical models that apply to SAR altimeters, in order to fully exploit the improvement in spatial resolution obtained from the along-track aperture synthesis. This letter presents a novel semianalytical waveform model for SAR interferometric altimeters that preserves high accuracy even in the presence of mispointing. Starting from the waveform model proposed by Wingham et al. that provides a unified formulation for pulse-limited and SAR interferometric altimeters which can only be computed numerically, here, we describe a semianalytical approximation for small variations of the mispointing angles around an arbitrary combination of pitch and roll angles ((mu) over cap, (theta) over cap). The proposed semianalytical waveform model allows to reduce the high dimensionality of the model proposed by Wingham et al. and it has been proven to be accurate for variations of mispointing angles up to 0.4 deg around the ((mu) over cap, (theta) over cap). The performance of the proposed formulation has been evaluated on simulated data from Sentinel-6 configuration and on real data from CryoSat-2 SARin acquisitions over ocean.

TI  - Sentinel Artery in Double Eyelid Blepharoplasty: Identification, Prevention, Management
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRANIOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - In double eyelid blepharoplasty, unexpected bleeding may cause intraoperative hematoma, swelling, and temporary ptosis, which could cause asymmetry and prolong recovery time. In 1725 patients (3450 eyes), double eyelid blepharoplasties were performed on Chinese patients from January 2014 to July 2016 by our senior author. In 36 eyes, the authors identified a variant artery, which the authors named the "sentinel artery,'' located in the inferolateral superficial orbital septum. The sentinel artery courses between the orbital septum and the levator palpebrae finally drain into the peripheral arcade. This artery is uncommon since only 1.04% of eyes have it. If the artery is severed accidentally, the cleaved arterial end will retract into the levator palpebrae and bleed causing a large hematoma to rapidly form posterior to the levator palpebrae. The authors actively avoided unexpected bleeding caused by tearing up this artery while opening the orbital septum during double eyelid blepharoplasty procedure.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analyses of urban vegetation structural attributes using multitemporal Landsat TM data and field measurements
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key message We conducted spatiotemporal analyses of urban vegetation structural attributes using multitemporal Landsat TM data and field measurements. We showed that multitemporal TMdata has the potential of rapidly estimating urban vegetation structural attributes including LAI, CC, and BA at an urban landscape level.Context Urban vegetation structural properties/attributes are closely linked to their ecological functions and thus directly affect urban ecosystem process such as energy, water, and gas exchange. Understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of urban vegetation structures is important for sustaining urban ecosystem service and improving the urban environment.Aims The purposes of this study were to evaluate the potential of estimating urban vegetation structural attributes from multitemporal Landsat TM imagery and to analyze spatiotemporal changes of the urban structural attributes.Methods We first collected three scenes of TM images acquired in 1997, 2004, and 2010 and conducted a field survey to collect urban vegetation structural data (including crown closure (CC), tree height (H), leaf area index (LAI), basal area (BA), stem density (SD), diameter at breast height (DBH), etc.). We then calculated and normalized NDVI maps from the multitemporal TM images. Finally, spatiotemporal urban vegetation structural maps were created using NDVI-based urban vegetation structure predictive models.Results The results show that NDVI can be used as a predictor for some selected urban vegetation structural attributes (i.e., CC, LAI, and BA), but not for the other attributes (i.e., H, SD, and DBH) that are well predicted by NDVI in natural vegetation. The results also indicate that urban vegetation structural attributes (i.e., CC, LAI, and BA) in the study area decreased sharply from 1997 to 2004 but increased slightly from 2004 to 2010. The CC, LAI, and BA class distributions were all skewed toward low values in 1997 and 2004. Moreover, LAI, CC, and BA of urban vegetation all present a decreasing trend from suburban areas to urban central areas.Conclusion The experimental results demonstrate that Landsat TM imagery could provide a fast and cost-effective method to obtain a spatiotemporal 30-m resolution urban vegetation structural dataset (including CC, LAI, and BA).

TI  - Comparison of military and nonmilitary land condition using an image derived soil erosion cover factor
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land condition of military installations varies spatially and temporally mainly due to variable intensity and frequency of military training induced disturbance. The existing ground-based methods to assess the land condition are costly and time consuming. There is thus a strong need to develop an efficient and low-cost methodology for modeling and monitoring of the land condition for military installations and compare it with nonmilitary land to assess the training induced impacts. For this purpose, in this study Fort Riley military installation (FR) and its neighboring Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS) were chosen.A remote sensing based linear spectral mixture (LSM) analysis method was proposed to model, monitor, and compare the land conditions of both sites by developing a soil erosion relevant and image derived cover factor (ICF) using both Landsat Thematic Mapper and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The results showed that (1) the LSM based ICF was statistically significantly correlated with military training induced disturbance intensity and can be used to quantify the land conditions; (2) the ICF provided the potential to generate spatially and temporally explicit estimates of the land conditions; (3) the ICF time.series revealed that the land condition of FR fluctuated with a slight decreasing trend of ICF values, but statistically the trend was not significant; and (4) small ICF values dominated both FR and KPBS, but compared to that in the nonmilitary land KPBS, military training led to significantly poorer land condition in the military land FR. Overall, the ICF method provides a potential tool to spatially and temporally assess land conditions of military installations. It is expected that this method can be applied to assess land conditions for other military and nonmilitary areas.

TI  - Monitoring and Modeling of Spatiotemporal Urban Expansion and Land-Use/Land-Cover Change Using Integrated Markov Chain Cellular Automata Model
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial-temporal analysis of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change as well as the monitoring and modeling of urban expansion are essential for the planning and management of urban environments. Such environments reflect the economic conditions and quality of life of the individual country. Urbanization is generally influenced by national laws, plans and policies and by power, politics and poor governance in many less-developed countries. Remote sensing tools play a vital role in monitoring LULC change and measuring the rate of urbanization at both the local and global levels. The current study evaluated the LULC changes and urban expansion of Jhapa district of Nepal. The spatial-temporal dynamics of LULC were identified using six time-series atmospherically-corrected surface reflectance Landsat images from 1989 to 2016. A hybrid cellular automata Markov chain (CA-Markov) model was used to simulate future urbanization by 2026 and 2036. The analysis shows that the urban area has increased markedly and is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the future, whereas the area for agriculture has decreased. Meanwhile, forest and shrub areas have remained almost constant. Seasonal rainfall and flooding routinely cause predictable transformation of sand, water bodies and cultivated land from one type to another. The results suggest that the use of Landsat time-series archive images and the CA-Markov model are the best options for long-term spatiotemporal analysis and achieving an acceptable level of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, understanding the relationship between the spatiotemporal dynamics of urbanization and LULC change and simulating future landscape change is essential, as they are closely interlinked. These scientific findings of past, present and future land-cover scenarios of the study area will assist planners/decision-makers to formulate sustainable urban development and environmental protection plans and will remain a scientific asset for future generations.

TI  - Methane optical density measurements with an integrated path differential absorption lidar from an airborne platform
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on an airborne demonstration of atmospheric methane (CH4) measurements with an integrated path differential absorption lidar using an optical parametric amplifier and optical parametric oscillator laser transmitter and sensitive avalanche photodiode detector. The lidar measures the atmospheric CH4 absorption at multiple, discrete wavelengths near 1650.96 nm. The instrument was deployed in the fall of 2015, aboard NASA's DC- 8 airborne laboratory along with an in situ spectrometer and measured CH4 over a wide range of surfaces and atmospheric conditions from altitudes of 2 to 13 km. We will show the results from our flights, compare the performance of the two laser transmitters, and identify areas of improvement for the lidar. (C) The Authors.

TI  - RNA SEQUENCING ANALYSIS OF TRANSCRIPTIONAL CHANGE IN THE FRESHWATER MUSSEL <i>ELLIPTIO COMPLANATA</i> AFTER ENVIRONMENTALLY RELEVANT SODIUM CHLORIDE EXPOSURE
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - To identify potential biomarkers of salt stress in a freshwater sentinel species, we examined transcriptional responses of the common mussel Elliptio complanata to controlled sodium chloride (NaCl) exposures. Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-Seq) of mantle tissue identified 481 transcripts differentially expressed in adult mussels exposed to 2 ppt NaCl (1.2 ppt chloride) for 7 d, of which 290 had nonoverlapping intervals. Differentially expressed gene categories included ion and transmembrane transport, oxidoreductase activity, maintenance of protein folding, and amino acid metabolism. The rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of taurine, an amino acid frequently linked to osmotic stress in aquatic species, was upregulated, as was the transmembrane ion pump sodium/potassium adenosine 5'-triphosphatase. These patterns confirm a primary transcriptional response to the experimental dose, albeit likely overlapping with nonspecific secondary stress responses. Substantial involvement of the heat shock protein 70 chaperone family and the water-transporting aquaporin family was not detected, however, in contrast to some studies in other bivalves. A subset of the most significantly regulated genes was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in an independent sample. Cluster analysis showed separation of mussels exposed to 2 ppt NaCl from control mussels in multivariate space, but mussels exposed to 1 ppt NaCl were largely indistinguishable from controls. Transcriptome-scale analysis of salt exposure under laboratory conditions efficiently identified candidate biomarkers for further functional analysis and field validation.

TI  - Retrieval of Secchi disk depth from a reservoir using a semi-analytical scheme
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanistic model reported in Lee et al. (2015) estimating the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) was applied to an oligo- to mesotrophic reservoir in Brazil. The model was originally validated with data covering lake, oceanic, and coastal waters; however, the model used the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) designed for optically deep waters as input and was applied to oceanic and coastal waters to derive absorption [a] and backscattering [b(b)] coefficients. The hypothesis is that the use of QAA(v5) (http://www.ioccg.org/groups/Software_OCA/QAA_v5.pdf) to estimate both a and b(b) (step M1) to retrieve K-d (step M2) and Z(SD) (step M3) will lead to errors caused by M1 preventing an accurate estimate in oligo- to mesotrophic water. To test this hypothesis, data collected in three field trips were used to apply the mechanistic model based on the spectral bands from OLI/Landsat-8, (often applied to oceanic and coastal waters), and multispectral instrument (MSI)/Sentinel-2 bands (applied to QAA designed for very turbid inland water). The impact of step M1 over steps M2 and M3 was analyzed by the error analysis. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for K-d using QAA(v5) ranged between 1035% and 19.76%, while the error using QAA(M14) varied between 12.68% and 28.29%. Regarding the errors of step M3 and applying QAA 5, the total root-mean-square difference (RMSD) varied from 055 to 1.18 m and MAPE ranged between 12.86% and 31.17%, while the RMSD ranged between 0.70 and 1.50 m and MAPE varied from 1433% to 39.13% when using QAA(M14). However, the result from QAA(v5) showed a better correlation with in situ data, although underestimating K-d and Z(SD). Therefore, a modified version of QAA(v5) (QAA(R17)) was evaluated. The results showed an improvement of K-d (MAPE ranging between 8.89% to 18.76%) and Z(SD) (RMSD ranging between 032 and 0.90 m and MAPE ranging between 8.65 and 19.75%), bringing the values close to the 1:1 line. The largest error was observed for the data of the second field trip, where the bio-optical properties showed a horizontal gradient along the reservoir. In addition, the magnitude of the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) also varied depending on the water quality. Thus, with respect to Z(SD) mapping, this research showed that environments with a high variability in R-rs can limit the accurate estimation of inherent optical properties (IOPs) based on QAA(v5). Therefore, the limiting step of the model was attributed to M1, which means that the mechanistic model from Lee et al. (2015) can be considered an universal approach if M1 is modified based on the type of water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing and Monitoring Forest Degradation in a Deciduous Tropical Forest in Mexico via Remote Sensing Indicators
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing and monitoring forest degradation under national Monitoring, Verification and Reporting (MRV) systems in developing countries have been difficult to implement due to the lack of adequate technical and operational capacities. This study aims at providing methodological options for monitoring forest degradation in developing countries by using freely available remote sensing, forest inventory and ancillary data. We propose using Canopy Cover to separate, through a time series analysis approach using Landsat Imagery, forest areas with changes over time from sectors that report a "stable condition". Above ground Biomass and Net Primary Productivity derived from remote sensing data were used to define thresholds for areas considered degraded. The approach was tested in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in the Southeast of Mexico. The results showed that higher rates of forest degradation, 1596 to 2865 ha year 1, occur in areas with high population densities. The results also showed that 43% of the forests of the study area remain with no evident signs of degradation, as determined by the indicators used. The approach and procedures followed allowed for the identification and mapping of the temporal and spatial distribution of forest degradation, based on the indicators selected, and they are expected to serve as the basis for operations of the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiative in Mexico and other developing countries, provided appropriate adaptations of the methodology are made to the conditions of the area in turn.

TI  - Native egg parasitoids recorded from the invasive <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> successfully exploit volatiles emitted by the plant-herbivore complex
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - When an accidentally introduced pest establishes in the invaded area, native natural enemies may adapt to the new host. A decade after the accidental introduction of the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, in Europe, two generalist native egg parasitoids, the eupelmid Anastatus bifasciatus and the encyrtid Ooencyrtus telenomicida, have been recorded from this invasive agricultural pest in the field. Both species are able to complete development to the adult stage within the new host. Trissolcus basalis (Platygastridae = Scelionidae), which is not associated with H. halys in the field, was reared from freeze-killed sentinel eggs placed on soybean plants in central Italy. We tested in a Y-tube olfactometer the behavioural responses of these egg parasitoids to volatiles from H. halys adults and from Vicia faba plants attacked by H. halys. Both A. bifasciatus and O. telenomicida positively responded to adult H. halys male volatiles and to H. halys-induced plant volatiles, indicating ability to exploit cues associated with the new host for egg location, whereas T. basalis only reacted to female volatiles. A. bifasciatus and O. telenomicida are generalist egg parasitoids, showing a much wider host range when compared to T. basalis. On the other hand, platygastrid egg parasitoids from the native area of H. halys, considered for classical biological control, may be too risky due to the possibility of attacking nontarget species, including predaceous stink bugs. Therefore, indigenous A. bifasciatus and O. telenomicida are presently under evaluation for augmentative biological control of H. halys in Europe.

TI  - Drought sensitivity mapping using two one-class support vector machine algorithms
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the use of standardised precipitation index (SPI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as indicators of soil moisture. On the other hand, we attempted to produce a drought sensitivity map (DSM) for vegetation cover using two one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) algorithms. In order to achieve promising results a combination of both 30 years statistical data (1978 to 2008) of synoptic stations and 10 years MODIS imagery archive (2001 to 2010) are used within the boundary of Kermanshah province, Iran. The synoptic data and MODIS imagery were used for extraction of SPI and EVI, respectively. The objective is, therefore, to explore meaningful changes of vegetation in response to drought anomalies, in the first step, and further extraction of reliable spatio-temporal patterns of drought sensitivity using efficient classification technique and spatial criteria, in the next step. To this end, four main criteria including elevation, slope, aspect and geomorphic classes are considered for DSM using two OC-SVM algorithms. Results of the analysis showed distinct spatio-temporal patterns of drought impacts on vegetation cover. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for the proposed DSM was used along with the simple overlay technique for accuracy assessment phase and the area under curve (AUC = 0.80) value was calculated.

TI  - Diagnostics of malignant melanoma of the skin. Recommendations of the current S3 guidelines on histology and molecular pathology
T2  - HAUTARZT
M3  - Article
AB  - The updated S3 guidelines on malignant melanoma were established in August 2016. The principles of diagnostics and classification are based on the histopathological results from the primary tumor and if necessary the sentinel lymph nodes. The most important factor for prognosis is the tumor thickness according to Breslow and the detection of sentinel node micrometastases. The surgical safety margin after excision is dependent on the tumor thickness. Furthermore, ulceration of the primary tumor and presence of mitosis in melanomas less than 1mm in thickness are also considered in the T-classification. The sentinel lymph nodes should be prepared according to established procedures using HE staining and immunohistochemical methods. The largest tumor diameter of a micrometastasis should be measured in tenths of a millimeter (Rotterdam classification). Molecular pathology testing for mutations in the BRAF and NRAS oncogenes should be carried out in patients with metastatic disease or surgically non-resectable tumors. In addition c-KIT mutations should be tested in acral lentiginous and mucosal melanomas. Treatment with signal transduction inhibitors is possible when mutations have been detected.

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover Change in the Paramo of South-Central Ecuador, 1979-2014
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover were mapped between 3500 and 5000 meters above sea level m.a.s.l. in the Rio Chambo basin in south-central Ecuador from Landsat MSS, TM, ETM and OLI imagery acquired between 1979 and 2014. The area mapped has been dominated by paramo and a variety of agricultural land uses since 1979. The main land-use transitions have been from paramo to agriculture, native forest to paramo and agriculture, and agriculture back to paramo. Significant areas of paramo have remained unchanged over the 35-year period analyzed, while the area of native forest has declined and that of bare soil increased. Plantations of non-native timber species increased from 1979 to 1999, but their area has now declined. Most land-use transformations have occurred at lower elevations in the 3500-5000 m.a.s.l. range. This is particularly the case for the loss of native forest and the degradation of paramo and agriculture to areas of bare (eroded) soils. A drivers-based approach revealed that these land-use transformations were related to import substitution and afforestation policies geared toward internal markets, exports and environmental conservation.

TI  - New procedures for the identification of sentinel lymph node: shaping the horizon of future management in early stage uterine cervical cancer
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic factors for uterine cervical cancer, although lymph node status is not part of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging. Considering the increasing attention about the topic, we performed a comprehensive review of the literature, to assess the accuracy of real-time fluorescence sentinel lymph node (SLN) for the detection of nodal metastases in patients with early stage cervical cancer (ESCC). In this work, we discuss the different techniques for SLN mapping and the accuracy of each one of them and, basing on these data, summarize the most important recommendations. In particular, we suggest to perform indocyanine green-SLN technique for ESCC, since it showed the highest accuracy for the detection of nodal metastases.

TI  - The optical trapezoid model: A novel approach to remote sensing of soil moisture applied to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The "trapezoid" or "triangle" model constitutes the most popular approach to remote sensing (RS) of surface soil moisture based on coupled thermal (Le., land surface temperature) and optical RS observations. The model, hereinafter referred to as Thermal-OptiCal TRAapezoid Model (TOTRAM), is based on interpretation of the pixel distribution within the land surface temperature - vegetation index (LST-VI) space. TOTRAM suffers from two inherent limitations. It is not applicable to satellites that do not provide thermal data (e.g., Sentinel-2) and it requires parameterization for each individual observation date. To overcome these restrictions we propose a novel Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM), which is based on the linear physical relationship between soil moisture and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (SIR) and is parameterized based on the pixel distribution within the SIR-VI space. The OPTRAM-based surface soil moisture estimates derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations for the Walnut Gulch and Little Washita watersheds were compared with ground truth soil moisture data. Results indicate that the prediction accuracies of OPTRAM and TOTRAM are comparable, with OPTRAM only requiring observations in the optical electromagnetic frequency domain. The volumetric moisture content estimation errors of both models were below 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) with local calibration and about 0.04-0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) without calibration. We also demonstrate that OPTRAM only requires a single universal parameterization for a given location, which is a significant advancement that opens a new avenue for remote sensing of soil moisture.

M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2003, the permanent failure of the scan line corrector (SLC) of the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor has seriously limited the scientific applications and usability of ETM+ data. While a number of methods have been conducted to fill the regular un-scanned locations in ETM+ SLC-off images, only a few researches have been developed to recover the large gap areas in such images. In this study, an innovative gap filling method has been introduced to reconstruct the large gap locations in SLC-off images via multi-temporal auxiliary fill images. A correlation is established between the corresponding pixels in the target SLC-off image and two auxiliary fill images in parallel using the multiple linear regression (MLR) model in two successive steps. In the first step, almost half the gap locations have been recovered using the MLR model, then in the second step a weighted multiple linear regression (WMLR) algorithm is proposed to recover the remaining missing values. The simulated and actual case studies show that the proposed approach may provide a powerful tool for recovering the large gaps in SLC-off images, especially when there is a long time interval between the auxiliary fill images and the target SLC-off image.

TI  - Ocean color satellite determinations of phytoplankton size class in the Arabian Sea during the winter monsoon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A regionally tuned three component "abundance" model of Brewin et al. (2012) has been used to discriminate satellite ocean color derived fields of phytoplankton biomass observable as Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), into three size classes, i.e. microplankton (>20 mu m), nanoplankton (>2 to <20 mu m) and picoplankton (<2 mu m). The model has been applied to MODIS-Aqua and Oceansat-2, Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) derived fields of Chl-a data between Nov. and Mar. In the Arabian Sea, during the evolution of blooms of the large (>800 mu m sized) green mixotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans. A comparison of shipboard measured and model derived values of phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) show the superiority of the regionally tuned model over parameterizations used in the original model of Brewin et al. (2012). A total number of 39 in situ data points have been used for the tuning of the regional model and 5 different in-situ data points have been used for the comparison with in situ data in this remote region of data paucity. The absolute mean and the maximum absolute errors for all size fractions are 4.7% and 17.2% respectively, as compared to the values of 9.6% and 26% respectively obtained using Brewin et al. (2012). When applied to a weekly time series of Chl-a images, the regionally tuned model is able to capture the seasonal cycle of PSC in the Arabian Sea associated with the tail end of the fall inter-monsoon (Nov.), the winter monsoon (Dec. to Feb.) and the transition to the spring inter-monsoon Although ocean color remote sensing is a useful tool for studying phytoplankton processes in regions like the Arabian Sea that suffer from a paucity of in-situ observations, enhancing the validity and confidence in satellite ocean color derived products such as PSC, will require additional shipboard datasets.

AB  - The study of well-being is important to evaluate the benefits of policies and set a potential national indicator of policy success. The objective measure of well-being index is not capable to capture the subjective assessment of citizens regarding their own life. Thus, subjective measurement is required to evaluate citizen's life comprehensively. Subjective well-being either in individual level or society focus on life satisfaction as well as emotional experiences. Achieving good subjective well-being can create benefits in many areas but it must first be measured using appropriate methods. The determinants of well-being are set as an indicators and measurement items in this study. It is based on the theory of aboriginal worldview and medicine wheel that accentuates connectedness and interdependence among all things in the universe. The medicine wheel derived from aboriginal worldview has been practiced by aborigines for a very long time as guidelines of healing and prosperity. The population discussed in this study is Orang Asli, aborigines from Malaysia that inhibited this land for thousands of years. Their well-being is essential to ensure survival of their heritage and culture. This study proposed conceptual framework of determinants of well-being and its effect on subjective well-being.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BLACK PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cognitive Style Questionnaire (CSQ), an expansion of the Attributional Style Questionnaire (ASQ), was created as an enhanced measure of cognitive vulnerability to depression using a hopelessness theory framework. However, the CSQ's development emphasized facets of cognitive vulnerability consistent with a Eurocentric worldview. Consequently, the CSQ may inadvertently degrade rather than enhance assessment of cognitive vulnerability to depression for Black participants whose vulnerability may be shaped by a different sociopolitical context. Participants were 259 White and 180 Black college students. As predicted, cognitive vulnerability to depression assessed via the reformulated learned helplessness (ASQ) but not hopelessness theory (CSQ) was associated with increased symptoms of depression for Black participants. The opposite pattern of results was found for White participants for whom hopelessness (CSQ), but not helplessness (ASQ) was associated with higher levels of depression symptoms. The current findings support the need for more extensive examination of social context and race in assessing cognitive vulnerability to depression.

TI  - Characterizing historical fire patterns as a guide for harvesting planning using landscape metrics derived from long term satellite imagery
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest managers across the Canadian boreal require detailed fire pattern information to support disturbance-based management. However, there are no consistent classifications of post-fire patterns, and those that exist rely on field-data that is both expensive and lacking in spatial representation. As a result, across the managed boreal forest there is limited fire pattern information, no standardized protocols to derive the quantitative fire pattern information nor agreement on the most appropriate metrics needed to implement management planning based on emulating natural disturbances. In this paper we first derived three classes of tree mortality based on Landsat spectral data and aerially photo interpreted (API) polygons. Next we used these derived classes to compute seven fire pattern metrics over 14 fires that occurred from 1984 to 2006 in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. We then compared the metrics derived from the Landsat data to those computed from the API coverage. Lastly, we assessed the influence of a suite of environmental and fire pattern variables on the Landsat-derived indices. Overall we found very close correspondence for the two event-scale indices: the total area affected by fire and the complexity of the perimeter. The more detailed within-fire event metrics presented more varied results and were somewhat less precise. For example, the total amount of residuals or the largest disturbed patch were accurately captured. Other indices such as the number of disturbed patches or total amount of island remnants presented moderate systematic biases, but still might be serviceable given that the biases were predictable in direction. Fire size and seasonal drought variables were the most correlated with the Landsat derived pattern indices and their inclusion as model variables is likely to increase overall prediction accuracy. A pan-boreal geospatial database of detailed fire pattern metrics would be an invaluable tool to support the implementation of disturbance-based management approaches. Here we demonstrate that a cost-effective Landsat methods produces comparable fire pattern information to conventional approaches based on manual interpretation of aerial photographs. Building upon the standardized methods proposed here hundreds of fires could be mapped, to potentially, create a comprehensive national fire pattern database. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Vegetation Water Content Retrieval by Means of Multifrequency Microwave Acquisitions From AMSR2
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, two retrieval algorithms for estimating the water content of vegetation (VWC) in the range 0-8 kg/m(2) from multifrequency microwave radiometric data have been implemented, with the purpose of contributing to the development of an all-weather VWC product for the satellite AMSR2 radiometer of the JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) GCOM-W mission. The first algorithm estimates VWC through a semi-empirical combination of the polarization index (PI) acquired at X and Ku bands, while the second one endeavors to improve the retrieval accuracy adding C-band data and using an artificial neural network (ANN) method. The sensitivity to vegetation biomass of multifrequency PIs at various frequencies, which was already pointed out in the previous literature, has been first further evaluated with the support of the well-known tau-omega solution of the radiative transfer model and experimental data. Two years of AMSR2 data collected on a wide portion of Africa, which includes a large variety of vegetation types and biomasses, have been considered for implementing and testing both algorithms. VWC reference data with the same temporal and spatial coverage of AMSR2, needed for validating the algorithm outputs, have been derived from SPOT4 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), downsampled to the AMSR2 ground resolution. The test results provided a correlation coefficient R > 0.88 with root mean square error (RMSE) < 1.4 kg/m(2) for the semi-empirical algorithm, and R = 0.98 with RMSE < 0.5 kg/m(2) for ANN algorithm, thus demonstrating that, although both approaches are able to estimate VWC, the ANN algorithm is able to obtain better results. An independent validation of the two algorithms was then carried out on the entire Australian continent, considering 4 periods of 16 days each in different seasons of 2013. In this case, the algorithm outputs have been compared with VWC derived from MODIS 16 days averaged NDVI. The independent validation, as expected, showed slightly worst results, with R = 0.82 and RMSE around 1.5 kg/m(2) for the semi-empirical algorithm, and R = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.86 kg/m(2) for the ANN. This study demonstrated that microwave data from AMSR2 and polarization indices can be legitimately used to produce vegetation maps on a global scale by separating several levels of biomass, without any need of further information from other sensors.

TI  - Mapping post-disturbance forest landscape composition with Landsat satellite imagery
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests worldwide are impacted by a wide variety of disturbances that are happening more frequently with more intensity than in the past due to global climate change. Forest managers, therefore, need to identify new ways to quickly and accurately predict post-disturbance forest landscape composition. We suggest the use of Landsat satellite imagery and an image processing tool to map percent canopy cover (PCC) by species and sub-canopy species counts to be used in adaptive forest management strategies. We used zero-inflated models to successfully predict PCC and sub-canopy counts (number of regenerating trees per pixel, also called biotic legacies) for 4 tree species, along with overall PCC and percent mortality, for a large portion of the Rio Grande National Forest (RGNF) in 2013. The RGNF had recently been disturbed by spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) infestation since the early 2000s and the West Fork Fire Complex in 2013. Our PCC models resulted in pseudo median differences between observed and predicted values of 0.2-6.5%, RMSE of 10.9-17.0%, and 95% confidence interval widths of 4.4-24.9%, depending on the species. The percent mortality model resulted in pseudo median differences between observed and predicted values of 1.1%, RMSE of 12.4%, and 95% confidence interval width of 4.6%. The sub-canopy PCC model resulted in a pseudo median differences between observed and predicted values of 1.3%, RMSE of 9.4%, and 95% confidence interval of 3.0%. The sub-canopy count models resulted in mean differences of 0.1-1.4 trees, RMSE of 3.0-13.4 trees, and 95% confidence interval widths of 1.1-5.0 trees, depending on species. By mapping PCC and sub-canopy counts, we have provided forest managers with knowledge of the current surviving forest (PCC) as well as the biotic legacies (sub-canopy counts) that can aid in forming hypotheses as to what the forest might become in the future, adding to the forest manager toolbox for forest management strategies. The methods described can be applied to a variety of issues within the field of disturbance ecology and, combined with change analyses, will provide forest managers with empirical evidence of current and future forest composition along with biological legacies that will impact forest regeneration.

TI  - Landsat images and crop model for evaluating water stress of rainfed soybean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water content is a vital resource that plays a central role in agricultural areas. In Argentina the soybean (Glycine max (L) Merrill) is the most important crop, considering the economic yield and the sown area. Actually, remote sensing allows continuous monitoring of crops and to evaluate the impact of water stress in their development. The combination of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator that provides information about the condition of the vegetation and surface soil moisture content. In this study we evaluate relationships between indicators of crop water stress and the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) determined from Landsat, for sites with rainfed soybean in the agricultural central zone of Cordoba (Argentina).Field data were acquired continuously throughout the whole growing season. For each sample date and plot, data of percent green vegetation cover, soil moisture content and phenology were registered. The use of a simulation crop model allowed obtaining indicators of crop water stress indices: (1) soil water deficit, (2) crop water use vs. reference crop evapotranspiration, and (3) fraction of the available water capacity that is readily available.The NDVI/LST spaces presented a trapezoidal form, which indicated that TVDI will have similar sensitivity for the full range of NDVI and showed temporal changes of wet and dry edges.When soybean cover exceeds 60%, the combination of TVDI with (2) and (3) can enhance the ability of detecting crop water stress conditions (R-2 = 0.62 and 0.82, respectively). However, the relationship between TVDI and (1) showed low correlation values (R-2 = 0.21). (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stroke is a well-documented potential risk of structural cardiac interventions. As a result of the far-reaching burden of stroke on patients, caregivers and the healthcare system, new medical interventions and therapies are being developed to help mitigate this risk. One such intervention is the recently FDA-cleared Sentinel Cerebral Protection System (Sentinel; Claret Medical, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) designed to capture and remove debris dislodged during transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures. In the SENTINEL IDE Study, and in a more recent all-comers trial, Sentinel significantly reduced periprocedural strokes by 63 and 70 % respectively. In this paper, we review the growing body of evidence supporting the use of Sentinel in transcatheter aortic valve replacement and other endovascular procedures.

TI  - Using Annual Landsat Time Series for the Detection of Dry Forest Degradation Processes in South-Central Angola
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dry tropical forests undergo massive conversion and degradation processes. This also holds true for the extensive Miombo forests that cover large parts of Southern Africa. While the largest proportional area can be found in Angola, the country still struggles with food shortages, insufficient medical and educational supplies, as well as the ongoing reconstruction of infrastructure after 27 years of civil war. Especially in rural areas, the local population is therefore still heavily dependent on the consumption of natural resources, as well as subsistence agriculture. This leads, on one hand, to large areas of Miombo forests being converted for cultivation purposes, but on the other hand, to degradation processes due to the selective use of forest resources. While forest conversion in south-central rural Angola has already been quantitatively described, information about forest degradation is not yet available. This is due to the history of conflicts and the therewith connected research difficulties, as well as the remote location of this area. We apply an annual time series approach using Landsat data in south-central Angola not only to assess the current degradation status of the Miombo forests, but also to derive past developments reaching back to times of armed conflicts. We use the Disturbance Index based on tasseled cap transformation to exclude external influences like inter-annual variation of rainfall. Based on this time series, linear regression is calculated for forest areas unaffected by conversion, but also for the pre-conversion period of those areas that were used for cultivation purposes during the observation time. Metrics derived from linear regression are used to classify the study area according to their dominant modification processes. We compare our results to MODIS latent integral trends and to further products to derive information on underlying drivers. Around 13% of the Miombo forests are affected by degradation processes, especially along streets, in villages, and close to existing agriculture. However, areas in presumably remote and dense forest areas are also affected to a significant extent. A comparison with MODIS derived fire ignition data shows that they are most likely affected by recurring fires and less by selective timber extraction. We confirm that areas that are used for agriculture are more heavily disturbed by selective use beforehand than those that remain unaffected by conversion. The results can be substantiated by the MODIS latent integral trends and we also show that due to extent and location, the assessment of forest conversion is most likely not sufficient to provide good estimates for the loss of natural resources.

TI  - Hard Copy Durable Patient Cancer Education Materials: Do They Still Matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Cancer Education Conference
CL  - Tucson, AZ
AB  - Traditional hard copy information materials are still present in our cancer clinics. While their actual impact on patient care often goes un-assessed, it is important to understand their role in today's electronic age where information can easily be obtained from various sources. It has remained the practice in our melanoma clinic to provide an information booklet to all of our new patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how useful this booklet was, as well as determine the current resources our patients use to gather cancer information. All patients referred to the clinic in the previous 3 years were pooled from our prospective, IRB-approved, melanoma sentinel node database. Of these 205 patients, a valid email address was listed for 147. A ten-question survey was emailed to all of these patients, who were not told ahead of time that their experience with the booklet would be studied. Seventy-seven of the 147 (52 %) patients polled responded. Fifty-eight (75 %) remembered receiving the booklet at their initial consultation. Forty-four (76 %) of those patients rated it as extremely or very useful, and no patients reported the booklet as not useful at all. Eighty-eight percent of respondents found the information to be clear and helpful. Sixty-four percent remembered the provider reviewing the material with them, and nearly all of these patients found that helpful. When asked to rank the importance of the various resources for obtaining cancer information, providers were ranked as most important, followed by the information booklet and Internet information sites. Internet blogs and friends and family were rated as the least important sources of information. Even in the current electronic age, our results indicate that information shared by providers, including the hard copy education booklet, was the most important source of information for our newly referred melanoma patients.

TI  - Fragmentation increases wind disturbance impacts on forest structure and carbon stocks in a western Amazonian landscape
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical second-growth forests could help mitigate climate change, but the degree to which their carbon potential is achieved will depend on exposure to disturbance. Wind disturbance is common in tropical forests, shaping structure, composition, and function, and influencing successional trajectories. However, little is known about the impacts of extreme winds on second-growth forests in fragmented landscapes, though these ecosystems are often located in mosaics of forest, pasture, cropland, and other land cover types. Indirect evidence suggests that fragmentation increases risk of wind damage in tropical forests, but no studies have found such impacts following severe storms. In this study, we ask whether fragmentation and forest type (old vs. second growth) were associated with variation in wind damage after a severe convective storm in a fragmented production landscape in western Amazonia. We applied linear spectral unmixing to Landsat 8 imagery from before and after the storm, and combined it with field observations of damage to map wind effects on forest structure and biomass. We also used Landsat 8 imagery to map land cover with the goals of identifying old-and second-growth forest and characterizing fragmentation. We used these data to assess variation in wind disturbance across 95,596 ha of forest, distributed over 6,110 patches. We find that fragmentation is significantly associated with wind damage, with damage severity higher at forest edges and in edgier, more isolated patches. Damage was also more severe in old-growth than in second-growth forests, but this effect was weaker than that of fragmentation. These results illustrate the importance of considering landscape context in planning tropical forest restoration and natural regeneration projects. Assessments of long-term carbon sequestration potential need to consider spatial variation in disturbance exposure. Where risk of extreme winds is high, minimizing fragmentation and isolation could increase carbon sequestration potential.

TI  - An example of aerosol pattern variability over bright surface using high resolution MODIS MAIAC: The eastern and western areas of the Dead Sea and environs
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The extreme rate of evaporation of the Dead Sea (DS) has serious implications for the surrounding area, including atmospheric conditions. This study analyzes the aerosol properties over the western and eastern parts of the DS during the year 2013, using MAIAC (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) for MODIS, which retrieves aerosol optical depth (ADD) data at a resolution of 1 km. The main goal of the study is to evaluate MAIAC over the study area and determine, for the first time, the prevailing aerosol spatial patterns. First, the MAIAC-derived ADD data was compared with data from three nearby AERONET sites (Nes Ziona - an urban site, and Sede Boker and Masada - two arid sites), and with the conventional Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) retrievals for the same days and locations, on a monthly basis throughout 2013. For the urban site, the correlation coefficient (r) for DT/DB products showed better performance than MAIAC (r = 0.80, 0.75, and 0.64 respectively) year-round. However, in the arid zones, MAIAC showed better correspondence to AERONET sites than the conventional retrievals (r = 0.58-0.60 and 0.48-0.50 respectively). We investigated the difference in ADD levels, and its variability, between the Dead Sea coasts on a seasonal basis and calculated monthly/seasonal ADD averages for presenting AOD patterns over arid zones. Thus, we demonstrated that aerosol concentrations show a strong preference for the western coast, particularly during the summer season. This preference, is most likely a result of local anthropogenic emissions combined with the typical seasonal synoptic conditions, the Mediterranean Sea breeze, and the region complex topography. Our results also indicate that a large industrial zone showed higher AOD levels compared to an adjacent reference-site, i.e., 13% during the winter season. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Four major unknown active faults identified, using satellite data, in India and Pakistan portions of NW Himalaya
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - New mapping through geomorphic analysis of tectonic landforms using a variety of freely available satellite data, including shuttle radar topography and Google Maps, has revealed four major curvilinear similar to NW-SE trending faults in NW Himalaya regions of India and Pakistan. From north-west to south-east, these are named as Mawer, Tunda, Gulmarg, and Mughal Road fault zones. Some of these faults show evidence of oblique faulting where thrusting is accompanied by a small component of sinistral strike-slip faulting, and this possibly increases towards south-east. The active nature of deformation on these faults is demonstrated by occurrence of triangular facets, fault rupture scarps, topographic breaks, displaced ridges, shutter ridges, deflected drainages, plus uplift and back tilting of Holocene sedimentary deposits. This is further supported by the fact that these fault traces truncate the previously mapped active structures such as Kashmir basin/Balapore fault and main boundary thrust. The abrupt termination of most of these faults in north-west indicates a strong structural control. These faults are active, and their dimensions and geometrical configurations indicate their potential to host major earthquakes that could be similar or greater than what we witnessed during Kashmir earthquake of 2005. Further, active deformation is also mapped within Udhampur Piggyback basin, which lies within the Riasi fault system in Jammu and Kashmir, NW Himalaya. The emergent thrusting further suggests splay faulting from one of the branches of the Riasi fault system (Mandili-Kishanpur thrust). The structural configuration of the basin indicates a possible structural control on the formation and deformation of the basin. The geomorphic expression of active faulting is manifested in the overall morphology of the oval-shaped basin (similar to Kashmir basin in NW Himalaya). The shape is structurally controlled by faults as the whole of the basin is riding on Riasi fault system. Within the valley, the active faults are only visible on the similar to SE portion. This has divided the basin into two distinctive geomorphic divisions: SE and NW domains. These domains are delineated by a structural break that could be similar to NE-SW trending fault zone because the mapped faults do not continue beyond this topographic break in the basin. And since the SE tectonic domain is faulted, the streams are deeply incising into the bedrock forming deep canyons. The tributaries are short because their lengths are trimmed by the faults. Thus, the tributaries on the hanging wall have permanently lost their headwater source and are orphaned. Such geomorphic features are not visible in the NW domains, which have not been faulted, and thus, the streams are following the natural slope. All the streams feed the basin merge into a major stream (Tawi River) that cuts through the anticlinal ridge of Suruin-Mastgarh anticline. This river roughly follows the interpreted similar to NE-SW trending topographic break, which could mean that it follows a fault. Such an interpretation is backed by the evidence that the anticlinal ridge is only broken at this portion of the ridge.

TI  - Sensing an intense phytoplankton bloom in the western Taiwan Strait from radiometric measurements on a UAV
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid assessment of algal blooms in bays and estuaries has been difficult due to lack of timely shipboard measurements and lack of spatial resolution from current ocean color satellites. Airborne measurements may fill the gap, yet they are often hindered by the high cost and difficulty in deployment. Here we demonstrate the capacity of a low-cost, low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in assessing an intense phytoplankton (Phaeocystis globosa) bloom (chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 73 to 45.6 mg/m(3)) in Weitou Bay in the western Taiwan Strait. The UAV was equipped with a hyperspectral sensor to measure the water color with a footprint of 5 mat every 30 m distance along the flight track. A novel approach was developed to obtain remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from the UAV at-sensor radiometric measurements. Compared with concurrent and co-located field measured R-rs (14 stations in total), the UAV-derived R-rs showed reasonable agreement with root mean square difference ranging 0.0028-0.0043 sr(-1) (relative difference similar to 20-32%) of such turbid waters for the six MODIS bands (412-667 nm). The magnitude of the bloom was further evaluated from the UAV-derived R-rs. For the bloom waters, the estimated surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) ranged 6-98 mg/m(3), which is 3-50 times of the Chl under normal conditions. This effort demonstrates for the first time a successful retrieval of both water color (i.e., R-rs) and Chl in a nearshore environment from UAV hyperspectral measurements, which advocates the use of UAVs for rapid assessment of water quality, especially for nearshore or difficult-to-reach waters, due to its flexibility, low cost, high spatial resolution, and sound accuracy.

TI  - Atypical Chemokine Receptor 1 polymorphism cannot be used as an indicator of liver fibrosis progression in Hepatitis C virus positive patients
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & Objective: Atypical chemokine receptor 1(ACKR1) represents an atypical chemokine receptor that can bind promiscuously to various chemokines. Chemokines play a crucial role to recruit leukocyte subsets migration through the endothelium and into liver against the virus during the progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Most HCV positive patients can lead to liver fibrosis. Hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), collagen IV(C-IV) and amino-terminal pro-peptide of Type-III pro-collagen (PIII NP) are indices of the extent of liver fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ACKR1 polymorphism and liver fibrosis with these four serum liver markers in HCV positive patients.Methods: From April 2015 to December 2015, a total of 210 patients (109 males and 101 females) with chronic HCV infection at Dalian Infectious Hospital were recruited to participate in this study. ACKR1 genotyping was using TaqMan probes method. HA, LN, C-IV and PIII NP were detected by using diagnostic kits.Results: We compared serum levels of HA, LN, C-IV and PIII NP between FY*A/FY*A and FY*A/FY*B patients and the differences were not significant (P=0.905, P=0.298, P=0.880 and P=0.470, respectively).Conclusions: This study has attempted to elucidate the role of ACKR1 polymorphism in liver fibrosis progression of HCV infection, our results demonstrated that ACKR1 polymorphism is not directly associated with the fibrogenesis in HCV positive patients.

TI  - High-Resolution Vegetation Mapping in Japan by Combining Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 Based Multi-Temporal Datasets through Machine Learning and Cross-Validation Approach
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an evaluation of the multi-source satellite datasets such as Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with different spatial and temporal resolutions for nationwide vegetation mapping. The random forests based machine learning and cross-validation approach was applied for evaluating the performance of different datasets. Cross-validation with the rich-feature datasetswith a sample size of 390showed that the MODIS datasets provided highest classification accuracy (Overall accuracy = 0.80, Kappa coefficient = 0.77) compared with Landsat 8 (Overall accuracy = 0.77, Kappa coefficient = 0.74) and Sentinel-2 (Overall accuracy = 0.66, Kappa coefficient = 0.61) datasets. As a result, temporally rich datasets were found to be crucial for the vegetation physiognomic classification. However, in the case of Landsat 8 or Sentinel-2 datasets, sample size could be increased excessively as around 9800 ground truth points could be prepared within 390 MODIS pixel-sized polygons. The increase in the sample size significantly enhanced the classification using Landsat-8 datasets (Overall accuracy = 0.86, Kappa coefficient = 0.84). However, Sentinel-2 datasets (Overall accuracy = 0.77, Kappa coefficient = 0.74) could not perform as much as the Landsat-8 datasets, possibly because of temporally limited datasets covered by the Sentinel-2 satellites so far. A combination of the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets slightly improved the classification (Overall accuracy = 0.89, Kappa coefficient = 0.87) than using the Landsat 8 datasets separately. Regardless of the fact that Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 datasets have lower temporal resolutions than MODIS datasets, they could enhance the classification of otherwise challenging vegetation physiognomic types due to possibility of training a wider variation of physiognomic types at 30 m resolution. Based on these findings, an up-to-date 30 m resolution vegetation map was generated by using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 datasets, which showed better accuracy than the existing map in Japan.

TI  - A Comparative Study of GRACE with Continental Evapotranspiration Estimates in Australian Semi-Arid and Arid Basins: Sensitivity to Climate Variability and Extremes
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the dynamics and robustness of large-scale evapotranspiration products in water-limited environments. Four types of ET products are tested against rainfall in two large semi-arid to arid Australian basins from 2003 to 2010: two energy balance ET methods which are forced by optical satellite retrievals from MODIS; a newly developed land surface model (AWRA); and one approach based on observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and rainfall data. The two basins are quasi (Murray-Darling Basin: 1.06 million km(2)) and completely (Lake Eyre Basin: 1.14 million km(2)) endorheic. During the study period, two extreme climatic events-the Millennium drought and the strongest La Nina event-were recorded in the basins and are used in our assessment. The two remotely-sensed ET products constrained by the energy balance tended to overestimate ET flux over water-stressed regions. They had low sensitivity to climatic extremes and poor capability to close the water balance. However, these two remotely-sensed and energy balance products demonstrated their superiority in capturing spatial features including over small-scale and complicated landscapes. AWRA and GRACE formulated in the water balance framework were more sensitive to rainfall variability and yielded more realistic ET estimates during climate extremes. GRACE demonstrated its ability to account for seasonal and inter-annual change in water storage for ET evaluation.

TI  - Analysis of the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of vegetative drought and its relationship with meteorological factors in China from 1982 to 2010
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complex natural phenomenon that can cause reduced water supplies and can consequently have substantial effects on agriculture and socioeconomic activities. The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of vegetative drought and its relationship with meteorological factors in China. The Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) dataset calculated from NOAA/AVHRR images from 1982 to 2010 was used to analyse the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of vegetative drought in China. This study also examined the trends in meteorological factors and their influences on drought using monitoring data collected from 686 national ground meteorological stations. The results showed that the VCI appeared to slowly rise in China from 1982 to 2010. From 1982 to 1999, the VCI rose slowly. Then, around 2000, the VCI exhibited a severe fluctuation before it entered into a relatively stable stage. Drought frequencies in China were higher, showing a spatial distribution feature of "higher in the north and lower in the south". Based on the different levels of drought, the frequencies of mild and moderate drought in four geographical areas were higher, and the frequency of severe drought was higher only in ecologically vulnerable areas, such as the Tarim Basin and the Qaidam Basin. Drought was mainly influenced by meteorological factors, which differed regionally. In the northern region, the main influential factor was sunshine duration, while the other factors showed minimal effects. In the southern region and Tibetan Plateau, the main influential factors were sunshine duration and temperature. In the northwestern region, the main influential factors were wind velocity and station atmospheric pressure.

TI  - A framework to improve hyper-resolution hydrological simulation in snow-affected regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow processes in mid- and north-latitude basins and their interaction with runoff generation at hyper-resolution (<1 km and <hourly) pose challenges in current state-of-the-art distributed hydrological models. These models run typically at macro to moderate scales (>5 km), representing land surface processes based on simplified couplings of snow thermal physics and the water cycle in the soil-vegetation atmosphere (SVA) layers. This paper evaluates a new hydrological model capable of simulating river flows for a range of basin scales (100 km(2) to >10,000 km(2)), and a particular focus on mid- and north latitude regions. The new model combines the runoff generation and fully distributed routing framework of the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model with a new land surface process model that strictly couples water and energy balances at the SVA layer, imposing closed energy balance solutions. The model is vectorized and parallelized to achieve long-term (>30 years) high-resolution (30 m to 500 m and subhourly) simulations of large river basins utilizing high-performance computing. The model is tested in the Connecticut River basin (20,000 km(2)), where flooding is frequently associated with interactions of snowmelt triggered by rainfall events. Model simulations of distributed evapotranspiration (ET) and snow water equivalence (SWE) at daily time step are shown to match accurately ET estimates from MODIS (average NSCE and bias are 0.77 and 6.79%) and SWE estimates from SNODAS (average correlation and normalized root mean square error are 0.94 and of 19%); the modeled daily river flow simulations exhibit an NSCE of 0.58 against USGS streamfiow observations.

TI  - Red blood cell phenotype prevalence in blood donors who self-identify as Hispanic.
T2  - Immunohematology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Molecular genotyping platforms provide a quick, high-throughput method for identifying red blood cell units for patients on extended phenotype-matching protocols, such as those with sickle cell disease or thalassemia. Most of the antigen prevalence data reported are for non-Hispanic populations. Therefore, this study sought to determine the phenotype prevalence in a single blood center's Hispanic population and to compare those results with previously reported rates in non-Hispanic donor populations. We performed a retrospective review of all serologic and molecular typing from donors who self-reported as Hispanic. The phenotype prevalence was reported and compared with rates from other racial/ethnic groups. A total of 1127 donors who selfidentified as Hispanic were screened by serologic methods for Rh and Kell antigens, and 326 were subsequently selected for molecular typing. The most prevalent probable Rh phenotypes were R1r (26.6%), R1R2 (21.5%), and R1R1 (20.7%); rr was found in 7.8 percent of donors tested. The percentage of K+ donors in this population was 2.8 percent. The most prevalent Duffy phenotypes were Fy(a+b+) (35.9%), Fy(a+b-) (35.6%), and Fy(a-b+) (27%). Of the donors studied, 15.3 percent had an FY GATA mutation. Only 1.5 percent of the donors were Fy(a-b-). The Jk(a+b+) phenotype was found in nearly half of the population. M+N+S+s+ was the most prevalent MNS phenotype from that group, constituting 22.4 percent. A total of 95.7 percent of the donors were Lu(a-b+), and Di(a-b+) was observed in 94.4 percent. The most prevalent Dombrock phenotype was Do(a+b+), constituting 46.9 percent, followed closely by Do(a-b+) at 40.5 percent. Hispanic donor antigen prevalence is distinctly different from other racial/ethnic groups and should be considered when attempting to find extended matched units for these patients.

TI  - A Method for Consistent Estimation of Multiple Land Surface Parameters From MODIS Top-of-Atmosphere Time Series Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most methods for generating global land surface products from satellite data are parameter specific and do not use multiple temporal observations, which often results in spatial and temporal discontinuity and physical inconsistency among different products. This paper proposes a data assimilation (DA) scheme to simultaneously estimate five land surface parameters from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) time series reflectance data under clear and cloudy conditions. A coupled land surface-atmosphere radiative transfer model is developed to simulate TOA reflectance, and an ensemble Kalman filter technique is used to retrieve the most influential surface parameters of the coupled model, such as leaf area index, by combining predictions from dynamic models and the MODIS TOA reflectance data whether under clear or cloudy conditions. Then, the retrieved surface parameters are input to the coupled model to calculate four other parameters: 1) land surface reflectance; 2) incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); 3) land surface albedo; and 4) the fraction of absorbed PAR (FAPAR). The estimated parameters are compared with those of the corresponding MODIS, the Global LAnd Surface Satellite, and the Geoland2/BioPar version 1 (GEOV1) products. Validation of the estimated parameters against ground measurements from several sites with different vegetation types demonstrates that this method can estimate temporally complete land surface parameter profiles from MODIS TOA time series reflectance data, with accuracy comparable to that of existing satellite products over the selected sites. The retrieved leaf area index profiles are smoother than the existing satellite products, and unlike the MOD09GA product, the retrieved surface reflectance values do not have the high peak values influenced by clouds. The use of the coupled land surface-atmosphere model and the DA technique ensures physical connections between the land surface parameters and makes it possible to calculate radiation-related parameters for clear and cloudy atmospheric conditions, which is an improvement for FAPAR retrieval compared with the MODIS and GEOV1 products. The retrieved FAPAR and PAR values can reveal the significant differences in them under clear and cloudy atmospheric conditions.

TI  - COMPARING HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION PATTERNS VIA GLOBAL DIFFERENCES IN THE ENDORSEMENT OF CURRENT PROCEDURAL TERMINOLOGY CODES
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The linkage of electronic medical records (EMR) across clinics, hospitals, and healthcare systems is opening new opportunities to evaluate factors associated with both individual treatment benefit and potential harm. For example, the FDA Sentinel initiative seeks to create a surveillance network with over 100 million patient lives (Behrman et al. [N. Engl. J. Med. 364 (2011) 498-499]), while PCORnet has created multiple networks that include linked electronic medical records from geographic regions such as entire cities or states, with the ultimate goal of facilitating comparative effectiveness research (Collins et al. [Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association 4 (2014) 576-577]). However, one key challenge to the use of electronically assembled cohorts is the potential for variation in both the choice of specific healthcare procedures and coding practices due to differences in patient populations and/or financial incentives within care delivery networks. In order to explore variation in patient care or procedure coding, we review and develop statistical methods that can permit testing and estimation of subgroup differences in code assignments. We focus on Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes which are used in a standardized fashion to capture patient treatment details and to record medical histories, but the methods we develop can be used for any structured EMR data. We specifically study testing procedures that can be valid for comparing both rare and common counts as routinely encountered with medical procedure codes, and we transfer methods from studies of genetic association. Hierarchical structure in terms of both thematically grouped medical codes and provider-level clustering adds unique complexity to the analysis of EMR data. We detail penalized regression methods unifying estimation and inference to leverage the hierarchical structure and stabilize rate ratio estimates for rare procedures. We also expand inference methods to account for potential within provider correlation of patient utilization. We illustrate methods comparing the endorsement of CPT codes for subjects enrolled in a back pain cohort study where interest is in the differences across recruitment centers in the use of CPT codes (Jarvik [BMC Musculoskelet Disord. 13 (2012)]).

AB  - Landslides constitute a major threat to people's lives and property in mountainous regions such, as in the Three Gorges area in China. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) with its wide coverage and unprecedented displacement measuring capabilities has been widely used in landslide monitoring. However, it is difficult to apply traditional InSAR techniques to investigate landslides having large deformation gradients or moving primarily in north-south direction. In this study, we propose a time series split-bandwidth interferometry (SBI) procedure to measure two dimensional (azimuth and range) displacements of the Shuping landslide in the Three Gorges area with 36 TerraSAR-X high resolution spotlight (HS) images acquired from February 2009 to April 2010. Since the phase based SBI procedure is sensitive to noise, we focused on extracting displacements of corner reflectors (CRs) installed on or surrounding the Shuping landslide. Our results agreed well with measurements obtained by the point-like targets offset tracking (PTOT) technique and in-situ GPS stations. Centimeter level accuracy could be achieved with SBI on CRs which shows great potential in futures studies on fast moving geohazards.

TI  - Identification of Potential High-Risk Habitats within the Transmission Reach of <i>Oncomelania hupensis</i> after Floods Based on SAR Techniques in a Plane Region in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Schistosomiasis japonica is an infectious disease caused by Schistosoma japonicum, and it remains endemic in China. Flooding is the main hazard factor, as it causes the spread of Oncomelania hupensis, the only intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, thereby triggering schistosomiasis outbreaks. Based on multi-source real-time remote sensing data, we used remote sensing (RS) technology, especially synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and geographic information system (GIS) techniques to carry out warning research on potential snail habitats within the snail dispersal range following flooding. Our research result demonstrated: (1) SAR data from Sentinel-1A before and during a flood were used to identify submerged areas rapidly and effectively; (2) the likelihood of snail survival was positively correlated with the clay proportion, core area standard deviation, and ditch length but negatively correlated with the wetness index, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), elevation, woodland area, and construction land area; (3) the snail habitats were most abundant near rivers and ditches in paddy fields; (4) the rivers and paddy irrigation ditches in the submerged areas must be the focused of mitigation efforts following future floods.

TI  - Analysis of Time-Series Spectral Index Data to Enhance Crop Identification Over a Mediterranean Rural Landscape
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral index time series can provide valuable phenological information into the classification process for the precise crop mapping, in order to reduce misclassification rates associated with low interclass and high intraclass spectral variability. Stochastic hidden Markov models (HMMs) are efficient yet computationally demanding classification approach which can simulate crop dynamics, exploiting the spectral information of their phenological states and the relations between these states. This letter aims to present a methodology which achieves accurate classification results while maintaining a low computational cost. A classification framework based on HMMs was developed, and different spectral indices were generated from the time series of Landsat ETM+ and RapidEye imagery, for modeling crop vegetation dynamics over a Mediterranean rural area, with high spatiotemporal crop heterogeneity. To further improve the HMMs indices classification, separability analysis and two different decision fusion strategies were tested. The assessment of the classification accuracy, along with an evaluation of the computational cost, indicated that the green-red vegetation index produced the most favorable results among the individual spectral indices. Although the decision fusion based on an integration of a reliability factor increased the overall accuracy by 3.1%, this came at the cost of computational time, compared to the separability analysis model which required less processing time.

TI  - Head and neck desmoplastic melanoma: Utility of sentinel node biopsy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in desmoplastic melanoma has been questioned due to multiple reports of a low rate of occult nodal metastasis in this variant of melanoma. We describe a single institution experience with management of desmoplastic melanoma of the head and neck and discuss the utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy.Materials and methods: A retrospective review was performed of 49 patients with desmoplastic melanoma of the head and neck at a tertiary care center from 1994 to 2014.Results: Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 15 patients. Only 1 (6.7%) of these patients was found to have a positive sentinel node. Of the 46 patients without evidence of neck disease at presentation, 3 (6.5%) were found to have occult nodal disease or developed neck recurrences. When looking at the entire cohort, there were a total of 16 recurrences in 14 patients (28.6%). The majority (85.7%) of recurrences were either local or distant metastasis with only 2 (14.3%) recurrences being in regional lymph node basins. The overall rates of local, regional, and distant recurrences were 14.2%, 4.1%, and 10.2% respectively. The mixed pathologic subtype was not associated with a higher rate of nodal metastasis.Conclusions: Desmoplastic melanoma has a low rate of occult nodal metastasis and a high propensity to recur locally or as a distant metastasis, regardless of regional node status. Our experience combined with the uncertain impact that sentinel node status has on survival raises the question of the utility of routine sentinel node biopsy in this specific variant of melanoma.

TI  - Comparing digital soil mapping techniques for organic carbon and clay content: Case study in Burundi's central plateaus
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Whereas contemporary land use and land management planning require specific and quantitative georeferenced soil information, often only general-purpose and qualitative soil maps are available. With a view to fill this gap for topsoil clay and organic carbon content in the central plateaus of Burundi, we tested for a representative 15 km(2) hilly landscape, six types of SCORPAN models. The SCORPAN models were first applied as standalone trend models and next extended with a component accounting for the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals from the trend. Various sets of predictors, including class variables derived from the available soil map and continuous derivatives from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and from Landsat-imagery were incorporated. For clay, the best prediction method was a Residual Kriging (RK) using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) as trend built with only DEM derivatives and spectral normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Furthermore, the classical and simplest RK, i.e. using a Least Squares Linear Regression (LR) trend built with only continuous covariates, outperformed all standalone trend models. For organic carbon, residuals from the trend models were not significantly auto-correlated, making RK meaningless. In this case the best model was a GAM combining lithologic units with DEM derivatives and NDVI. Overall, the contribution of soil map derived predictors to the model performance was rather weak. It was concluded that, for prediction of specific soil characteristics in the study area, a SCORPAN approach is preferred the more as the performance can be boosted by kriging of trend residuals if auto-correlated.

TI  - Association Between Patient Age and Lymph Node Positivity in Thin Melanoma
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE More than half of all new melanoma diagnoses present as clinically localized T1 melanoma, yet sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is controversial in this population given the overall low yield. Guidelines for SLNB have focused on pathologic factors, but patient factors, such as age, are not routinely considered.OBJECTIVES To identify indicators of lymph node (LN) metastasis in thin melanoma in a large, generalizable data set and to evaluate the association between patient age and LN positivity.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Database, an oncology database representing patients from more than 1500 hospitals throughout the United States, was performed (2010-2013). Data analysis was conducted from October 1, 2016, to January 15, 2017. A total of 8772 patients with clinical stage I 0.50 to 1.0 mm thin melanoma undergoing wide excision and surgical evaluation of regional LNs were included for study.MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The primary outcome of interest was presence of melanoma in a biopsied regional LN. Clinicopathologic factors associated with LN positivity were characterized, using logistic regression. Age was categorized as younger than 40 years, 40 to 64 years, and 65 years or older for multivariable analysis. Classification tree analysis was performed to identify high-risk groups for LN positivity.RESULTS Among the study cohort (n = 8772), 333 patients had nodal metastases, for an overall positivity rate of 3.8% (95% CI, 3.4%-4.2%). A total of 4087 (54.0%) patients were women. Median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46-67) in patients with negative LNs and 52 years (IQR, 41-61) in those with positive LNs (P<.001). In multivariable analysis, younger age, female sex, thickness of 0.76 mm or larger, increasing Clark level, mitoses, ulceration, and lymphovascular invasion were independently associated with LN positivity. In decision tree analysis, patient age was identified as an important risk stratifier for LN metastases, after mitoses and thickness. Patients younger than 40 years with category T1b tumors 0.50 to 0.75 mm, who would generally not be recommended for SLNB, had an LN positivity rate of 5.6%(95% CI, 3.3%-8.6%); conversely, patients 65 years or older with T1b tumors 0.76mmor larger, who would generally be recommended for SLNB, had an LN positivity rate of only 3.9% (95% CI, 2.7%-5.3%).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patient age is an important factor in estimating lymph node positivity in thin melanoma independent of traditional pathologic factors. Age therefore should be taken into consideration when selecting patients for nodal biopsy.

TI  - Patterns of lymph nodemetastasis identified following bilateral mandibular andmedial retropharyngeal lymphadenectomy in 31 dogs with malignancies of the head
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Variable pathways of lymphatic drainage have been described in the dog head and neck. The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess the patterns of lymph node metastasis in dogs with malignancies of the head following bilateral mandibular and medial retropharyngeal lymphadenectomy. Thirty-one dogs were included. Median age at surgery was 10 years (range: 5 months to 14 years) and mean bodyweight was 21.4 +/- 11.9 kg. Lymph nodemetastasis occurred in 14 dogs (45%), with spread to mandibular lymph nodes in 14 dogs and medial retropharyngeal metastasis in 11 dogs. Eight of 13 dogs (62%) with lymphatic metastasis and a lateralised lesion showed contralateral dissemination, while 12/13 (92%) showed ipsilateralmetastasis. Of 13 dogs with oral malignant melanoma, four showed metastasis to all four lymph centres. Contralateral metastasis may occur in dogs with malignancies of the head and should be considered during staging and management.

TI  - Novel public health risk assessment process developed to support syndromic surveillance for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Syndromic surveillance aims to provide early warning and real time estimates of the extent of incidents; and reassurance about lack of impact of mass gatherings. We describe a novel public health risk assessment process to ensure those leading the response to the 2012 Olympic Games were alerted to unusual activity that was of potential public health importance, and not inundated with multiple statistical 'alarms'.Methods Statistical alarms were assessed to identify those which needed to result in 'alerts' as reliably as possible. There was no previously developed method for this. We identified factors that increased our concern about an alarm suggesting that an 'alert' should be made.Results Between 2 July and 12 September 2012, 350 674 signals were analysed resulting in 4118 statistical alarms. Using the risk assessment process, 122 'alerts' were communicated to Olympic incident directors.Conclusions Use of a novel risk assessment process enabled the interpretation of large number of statistical alarms in a manageable way for the period of a sustained mass gathering. This risk assessment process guided the prioritization and could be readily adapted to other surveillance systems. The process, which is novel to our knowledge, continues as a legacy of the Games.

T2  - ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Review
AB  - An overview of geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) is the main focus of this work, that emphasizes their application to obtain water body information. This information is integrated to the Framework Directive, and in this way, seeks to propose the linkage of these information to the Resolution 357/2005, in order to serve as a tool for decision making in strategic management of water quality mainly in large reservoirs. Thus, a review that integrates geotechnology to limnological science and to reservoirs management was done, highlighting the possible potential of interdisciplinary integration. At the end, an integration model of GIS, RS and limnology is schematized for monitoring and management of water quality standards according to the Resolution 357/2005.

TI  - Detection of secular acceleration pulses from magnetic observatory data
T2  - PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomagnetic secular variation (SV) models for the epochs before the space era are based on magnetic observatory data, which represent.relatively rough and noisy time series due to magnetic storms, anthropogenic spikes and gaps. These models are often strongly regularized in time, so that fast variations in the SV are smoothed out. However, recent studies show that at least some of the geomagnetic jerks observed at the Earth's surface emanate from increasing and decreasing phases of secular acceleration (SA) pulses at the core surface. The latter ones are direct manifestation of the dynamic processes taking place in the liquid core. They were first detected from satellite data, which are both of higher quality and more homogeneous in terms of geographical coverage than ground data. Herein we attempt to carry out similar studies based on observatory data available for a longer period. The proposed method of SV modeling and recognition of SA pulses relies on a new technique of processing time series based on fuzzy mathematics. Comparison with the SV modeling results derived from satellite data shows their high conformity with the proposed method. Stability and reliability of the SA pulse recognition are demonstrated by the examples of well-studied SA pulses in 2006, 2009 and 2012. Moreover, several new SA pulses around 1996, 1999, 2002 and 2014 are discovered as a result of the new approach application to multi-observatory data analysis. The latter provides a basis for applying the method to older historical data and investigate SA pulses and geomagnetic jerks further back in time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-2A Satellite Imagery for Mapping Cotton Root Rot
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an economically important crop that is highly susceptible to cotton root rot. Remote sensing technology provides a useful and effective means for detecting and mapping cotton root rot infestations in cotton fields. This research assessed the potential of 10-m Sentinel-2A satellite imagery for cotton root rot detection and compared it with airborne multispectral imagery using unsupervised classification at both field and regional levels. Accuracy assessment showed that the classification maps from the Sentinel-2A imagery had an overall accuracy of 94.1% for field subset images and 91.2% for the whole image, compared with the airborne image classification results. However, some small cotton root rot areas were undetectable and some non-infested areas within large root rot areas were incorrectly classified as infested due to the images' coarse spatial resolution. Classification maps based on field subset Sentinel-2A images missed 16.6% of the infested areas and the classification map based on the whole Sentinel-2A image for the study area omitted 19.7% of the infested areas. These results demonstrate that freely-available Sentinel-2 imagery can be used as an alternative data source for identifying cotton root rot and creating prescription maps for site-specific management of the disease.

TI  - Variance Estimation of Maternal Lineage Effect on Milk Traits in Croatian Holstein Cattle
T2  - Agriculturae Conspectus Scientificus
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of maternal lineage (ML) on milk production traits: milk, fat and protein yield (MY, FY, and PY), fat and protein content (FC and PC) was evaluated in the Croatian Holstein cattle. Data included 102,961 records for 46,696 cows calved from January 2000 to July 2015 taken from the Central database of the Croatian Agricultural Agency. Pedigree file consisted of 77,398 animals. Variance components were estimated by REML method using VCE-6 program. Statistical model included parity, region, and calving season as fixed class effects, while age at first calving was fitted as quadratic regression. Random effects were: interaction herd -year, permanent environment, maternal lineage, and direct additive genetic effect. Identification of ML was based on the pedigree information. The contribution of ML to the phenotypic variance was 2% for FC and PC and 3% for MY, FY, and PY. The estimates of ML for milk traits were within the range of other studies.

TI  - A model for upscaling global partnerships and building nurse and midwifery capacity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - AimTo provide a unique model for use in guiding global collaboration and policy to upscale nursing and midwifery partnerships.Background and introductionNurses and midwives across nations need skills reaching beyond the bedside and unit level in today's complex, global, multifaceted healthcare milieu. Thoughtful consideration, research and concomitant development of models to guide appropriate upscaling of nurse and midwifery capacity within and between nations are needed.DiscussionThis article explores an integrated global approach to upscaling nurse and midwifery capacity using examples of partnerships between nursing and midwifery programmes across multiple continents.Conclusion and implications for nursingGlobal nurse and midwifery capacity is effectively being developed using a myriad of approaches. A new model is presented to illustrate supports, strategies and activities to achieve intermediate and long-term goals for capacity building through strong and sustainable global partnerships.Implication for nursing policyDevelopment of global skills can focus the nurse and midwife to influence policy-level decisions. Human resource planning that can impact countrywide provision of health care begins in the preservice setting for both nurses and midwives. A global experience can be a value-added component to the well-rounded education of future nurses. Education during preparation for entry into practice is a strategic way to develop a worldview. Incorporating reflective practice can build skills and shape attitudes to prepare the new nurse to be comfortable as a global healthcare provider. An expanded world view is the springboard to more robust and informed involvement and inclusion in policy-level discussions.

TI  - An Alternative Approach to Using LiDAR Remote Sensing Data to Predict Stem Diameter Distributions across a Temperate Forest Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply a spatially-implicit, allometry-based modelling approach to predict stem diameter distributions (SDDs) from low density airborne LiDAR data in a heterogeneous, temperate forest in Ontario, Canada. Using a recently published algorithm that relates the density, size, and species of individual trees to the height distribution of first returns, we estimated parameters that succinctly describe SDDs that are most consistent with each 0.25-ha LiDAR tile across a 30,000 ha forest landscape. Tests with independent validation plots showed that the diameter distribution of stems was predicted with reasonable accuracy in most cases (half of validation plots had R-2 0.75, and another 23% had 0.5 R-2 < 0.75). The predicted frequency of larger stems was much better than that of small stems (8 x < 11 cm diameter), particularly small conifers. We used the predicted SDDs to calculate aboveground carbon density (ACD; RMSE = 21.4 Mg C/ha), quadratic mean diameter (RMSE = 3.64 cm), basal area (RMSE = 6.99 m(2)/ha) and stem number (RMSE = 272 stems/ha). The accuracy of our predictions compared favorably with previous studies that have generally been undertaken in simpler conifer-dominated forest types. We demonstrate the utility of our results to spatial forest management planning by mapping SDDs, the proportion of broadleaves, and ACD at a 0.25 ha resolution.

TI  - Worldview Orientations in Close Relationships: Development and Initial Validation of the Contract-Covenant Continuum
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Christian approaches to close relationships in North America have been understood in covenantal terms between married persons, dating couples, and close friends, and have been contrasted with contractual or ego-based ones. Covenantal approaches value the dyad, interdependence, faith community involvement, and communication strategies to engender long-term commitment whereas contractual approaches value self, independence, negotiation for personal needs, and freedom to exit relationships when costs outweigh benefits. The authors gathered survey data among 713 subjects over three studies in order to develop a 22-item scale to measure covenantal and contractual worldview dimensions in close relationships. Scale items were examined for inter-item reliability, factor structure, evidence for construct validity, and predictive power of relational satisfaction. The resulting Contract-Covenant Continuum showed good reliability and multi-dimensionality. Evidence was also gathered to support concurrent, construct, and criterion validity as well as the scale's capacity to predict relational satisfaction and equity.

TI  - Circum-Arctic Changes in the Flow of Glaciers and Ice Caps from Satellite SAR Data between the 1990s and 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We computed circum-Arctic surface velocity maps of glaciers and ice caps over the Canadian Arctic, Svalbard and the Russian Arctic for at least two times between the 1990s and 2017 using satellite SAR data. Our analyses are mainly performed with offset-tracking of ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 (2007-2011) and Sentinel-1 (2015-2017) data. In certain cases JERS-1 SAR (1994-1998), TerraSAR-X (2008-2012), Radarsat-2 (2009-2016) and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (2015-2016) data were used to fill-in spatial or temporal gaps. Validation of the latest Sentinel-1 results was accomplished by means of SAR data at higher spatial resolution (Radarsat-2 Wide Ultra Fine) and ground-based measurements. In general, we observe a deceleration of flow velocities for the major tidewater glaciers in the Canadian Arctic and an increase in frontal velocity along with a retreat of frontal positions over Svalbard and the Russian Arctic. However, all regions have strong accelerations for selected glaciers. The latter developments can be well traced based on the very high temporal sampling of Sentinel-1 acquisitions since 2015, revealing new insights in glacier dynamics. For example, surges on Spitsbergen (e.g., Negribreen, Nathorsbreen, Penckbreen and Strongbreen) have a different characteristic and timing than those over Eastern Austfonna and Edgeoya (e.g., Basin 3, Basin 2 and Stonebreen). Events similar to those ongoing on Eastern Austofonna were also observed over the Vavilov Ice Cap on Severnaya Zemlya and possibly Simony Glacier on Franz-Josef Land. Collectively, there seems to be a recently increasing number of glaciers with frontal destabilization over Eastern Svalbard and the Russian Arctic compared to the 1990s.

TI  - Analyzing long wave radiation data associated with the 2015 Nepal earthquakes based on Multi-orbit satellite observations
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The infrared anomaly index algorithm is proposed in this paper based on the advantages of RST (Satellite Technique Robust) and vorticity algorithm which have been used in application of detecting infrared anomaly. An M(S)8.1 and an M(S)7.5 earthquake, occurred at the front of the India-Eurasia collision belt, struck Nepal on April 25th and May 12th, 2015. We analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of outgoing long wave radiation (OLR) obtained from satellite observations around the time of the two earthquakes using RST and anomaly index algorithms. The Meteorological satellite data we used include night-time data (once daily) from the polar orbit NOAA/AVHRR and three hours data (8 times daily) of the Chinese geostationary satellite FY-2D.The results show that RST algorithm provides no anomalous solutions around the epicenter of two earthquakes. In comparison the infrared anomaly index algorithm did provide an anomaly detection, and specifically we found an increase of emitted infrared radiation on the west of the MS8.1 epicenter on April 15th 2015. The thermal anomaly derived from NOAA data reached the maximum on April 24 at 100 kilometers west of the M(S)8.1 epicenter, and then disappeared gradually. In addition another thermal anomaly was detected on May 10 at 200 kilometers east of the M(S)7.5 epicenter. Based on three-hour data analysis from FY-2D, we found on April 24 a dynamic evolution in the anomalous process, the same day when the NOAA data thermal anomaly reaches the maximum. In this case FY-2D satellite data provided complimentary data to the initial detection based on low temporal/spatial resolution data obtained from NOAA and improved the final solution in the location of the anomaly. Our initial results suggest that systematic use of multi-orbit satellite observation can provide reference to monitor the pre-earthquake changes of thermal radiation.

TI  - The Impact of Mapping Error on the Performance of Upscaling Agricultural Maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aggregation methods are the most common way of upscaling land cover maps. To analyze the impact of land cover mapping error on upscaling agricultural maps, we utilized the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data with corresponding confidence level data and simulated eight levels of error using a Monte Carlo simulation for two Agriculture Statistic Districts (ASD) in the U.S.A. The results of the simulations were used as base maps for subsequent upscaling, utilizing the majority rule based aggregation method. The results show that increasing error level resulted in higher proportional errors for each crop in both study areas. As a result of increasing error level, landscape characteristics of the base map also changed greatly resulting in higher proportional error in the upscaled maps. Furthermore, the proportional error is sensitive to the crop area proportion in the base map and decreases as the crop proportion increases. These findings indicate that three factors, the error level of the thematic map, the change in landscape pattern/characteristics of the thematic map, and the objective of the project, should be considered before performing any upscaling. The first two factors can be estimated by using pre-existing land cover maps with relatively high accuracy. The third factor is dependent on the project requirements (e.g., landscape characteristics, proportions of cover types, and use of the upscaled map). Overall, improving our understanding of the impacts of land cover mapping error is necessary to the proper design for upscaling and obtaining the optimal upscaled map.

TI  - Extracting mineral alteration information using WorldView-3 data
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The multispectral commercial satellite-WorldView-3 (WV-3) has the highest spatial, spectral and radiation resolutions among the satellites currently and can generate good data in the shortwave infrared (SWIR). The study area is located in the Pobei area of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which is rich in mineral resources. The spectral analyses of some typical altered hydroxy-bearing, iron-bearing, and carbonate-bearing minerals could establish several Principal Component Analysis (PCA) models and mineral indices, using the visible and near infrared (VNIR) and the shortwave infrared (SWIR) subsystems of WV-3 data. In addition, the Spectral Angle Method and the spectrum index tool of ENVI software were used to extract the relevant alteration information. The WV-3 data is well suited for identifying hydroxy-bearing alteration with rich SWIR bands which distinguish Al-OH-bearing from Mg-OH-bearing alteration. Hence, this study provides a basis for the prediction of mineral resources in the Pobei area and sets the foundation for WV-3 data to be used as an important tool in extracting alteration information and prospecting practices.

TI  - Statistically optimal estimation of degree-1 and <i>C</i><sub>20</sub> coefficients based on GRACE data and an ocean bottom pressure model
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we develop a methodology to estimate monthly variations in degree-1 and C-20 coefficients by combing Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data with oceanic mass anomalies (combination approach). With respect to the method by Swenson et al., the proposed approach exploits noise covariance information of both input data sets and thus produces stochastically optimal solutions supplied with realistic error information. Numerical simulations show that the quality of degree-1 and -2 coefficients may be increased in this way by about 30 per cent in terms of RMS error. We also proved that the proposed approach can be reduced to the approach of Sun et al. provided that the GRACE data are noise-free and noise in oceanic data is white. Subsequently, we evaluate the quality of the resulting degree-1 and C-20 coefficients by estimating mass anomaly time-series within carefully selected validation areas, where mass transport is small. Our validation shows that, compared to selected Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) and joint inversion degree-1 solutions, the proposed combination approach better complements GRACE solutions. The annual amplitude of the SLR-based C-10 is probably overestimated by about 1 mm. The performance of the C-20 coefficients, on the other hand, is similar to that of traditionally used solution from the SLR technique.

TI  - A Modified Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (MNDISI) for Automatic Urban Mapping from Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface area (ISA) is a key factor for monitoring urban environment and land development. Automatic mapping of impervious surfaces has attracted growing attention in recent years. Spectral built-up indices are considered promising to map ISA distributions due to their easy, parameter-free implementations. This study explores the potentials of impervious surface indices for ISA mapping from Landsat imagery using a case study area in Boston, USA. A modified normalized difference impervious surface index (MNDISI) is proposed, and a Gaussian-based automatic threshold selection method is used to identify the optimal MNDISI threshold for delineating impervious surfaces from background features. To evaluate its effectiveness, comparison analysis is conducted between MNDISI and the original NDISI using Landsat images from three sensors (TM/ETM+/OLI-TIRS) acquired in four seasons. Our results suggest that built-up indices are sensitive to image seasonality, and summer is the best time phase for ISA mapping. With reduced uncertainties from automatic threshold selection, the MNDISI extracts impervious surfaces from all Landsat images in summer with an overall accuracy higher than 87% and an overall Kappa coefficient higher than 0.74. The proposed method is superior to previous index-based ISA mapping from the enhanced thermal integration and automatic threshold selection. The ISA maps from the TM, ETM+ and OLI-TIRS images are not significantly different. With enlarged data pool when all Landsat sensors are considered and automation of threshold selection proposed in this study, the MNDISI could be an effective built-up index for rapid and automatic ISA mapping at regional and global scales.

TI  - Future changes in summer MODIS-based enhanced vegetation index for the South-Central United States
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the response of vegetation to climate change is relevant to improving the management of both human and natural systems. Here, we quantify the response of the MODIS-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to temperature, precipitation, and large-scale natural variability across the South-Central U.S. for summer (JJA) from 2000 to 2013. We find statistically significant relationships between climate and EVI that vary across the region and are distinct for each land cover type: the mean coefficient of determination (R-2) between EVI and climate is, greatest for pasture (0.61 +/- 0.13) and lowest for forest (0.55 +/- 0.14). Among the climate variables, three-month cumulative precipitation has the strongest influence on summer vegetation, particularly in semi-arid west Texas and eastern New Mexico. Summer monthly maximum temperature plays an important role in the eastern half of Texas and Oklahoma, moderated by the influence of both Atlantic and Pacific teleconnection indices over inter-annual time scales. Based on these relationships, we train, cross-validate, and, where statistically significant relationships exist, combine this multivariate predictive model with projected changes in teleconnection indices and statistically-downscaled temperature and precipitation from 16 CMIP5 global climate models to quantify future changes in EVI. As global mean temperature increases, projected EVI decreases, indicative of stressed and dry vegetation, particularly for grasslands as compared to other land types, and in Oklahoma and western, central and Gulf Coast Texas for mid- and end-of-century. These trends have potentially important implications for agriculture and the regional economy, as well as for ecosystems and endemic species that depend on vegetation.

TI  - A Dialogic Vaccine to Bridge Opposing Cultural Viewpoints Based on Bakhtin's Views on Dialogue and Estrangement
T2  - INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, we face global conflicts between opposing ideologies that may be described in terms of cultural viewpoints and value judgments. It is difficult for individuals to determine whether ideologies are right or wrong because each ideology has its own worldview and sense of justice. Psychologists have an urgent mission to defuse the likelihood of fatal clashes between opposing cultural perspectives (ideologies), and to propose paradigms for peaceful coexistence. This paper examines the series of papers (Oh, Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science, 51, 2017; Sakakibara, Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science, 51, 2017; Watanabe, Integrative Psychological & Behavioral Science, 51, 2017) contributed to this volume that investigate the effects of high school and university educational programs promoting productive dialogue aimed at bridging, or transcending, conflicting perspectives among Japanese, Chinese, and Korean students. Here, I have evaluated the capacity of these educational programs to coordinate opposing cultural ideologies using the framework of Bakhtin's theories of dialogue and estrangement. Bakhtin viewed discourse with others who had opposing viewpoints as an opportunity to learn to overcome the one-sidedness of ideology, which ensues from automatic value judgments made by each speaker according to their culture, and he affirmed the value of flexible attitudes toward opposing viewpoints. In this paper, I review Bakhtin's theories relating to communication in a context of different cultural viewpoints, assess the general values of the educational practices mentioned above, and propose new concepts for applying these methods to other educational fields in the future using Bakhtin's theoretical viewpoints.

T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 59th Annual Thomas L. Petty Aspen Lung Conference
CL  - Aspen, CO
AB  - Lung ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury contributes to post-transplant complications, including primary graft dysfunction. Decades of reports show that reactive oxygen species generated during lung IR contribute to pulmonary vascular endothelial barrier disruption and edema formation, but the specific target molecule(s) that "sense" injury-inducing oxidant stress to activate signaling pathways culminating in pathophysiologic changes have not been established. This review discusses evidence that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may serve as a molecular sentinel wherein oxidative mtDNA damage functions as an upstream trigger for lung IR injury. First, the mitochondrial genome is considerably more sensitive than nuclear DNA to oxidant stress. Multiple studies suggest that oxidative mtDNA damage could be transduced to physiologic dysfunction by pathways that are either a direct consequence of mtDNA damage per se or involve formation of proinflammatory mtDNA damage-associated molecular patterns. Second, transgenic animals or cells overexpressing components of the base excision DNA repair pathway in mitochondria are resistant to oxidant stress-mediated pathophysiologic effects. Finally, published and preliminary studies show that pharmacologic enhancement of mtDNA repair or mtDNA damage-associated molecular pattern degradation suppresses reactive oxygen species-induced or IR injury in multiple organs, including preclinical models of lung procurement for transplant. Collectively, these findings point to the interesting prospect that pharmacologic enhancement of DNA repair during procurement or ex vivo lung perfusion may increase the availability of lungs for transplant and reduce the IR injury contributing to primary graft dysfunction.

TI  - Accelerated Urban Expansion in Lhasa City and the Implications for Sustainable Development in a Plateau City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization challenges regional sustainable development, but a slight expansion mechanism was revealed in a plateau city. We have integrated the urban expansion process and analyzed its determinants in Lhasa (Tibet), and we provide insightful suggestions for urban management and planning for Lhasa. The full continuum of the urban expansion process has been captured using time-series of high-resolution remote sensing data (1990-2015). Four categories of potential determinants involved in economic, demographic, social, and government policy factors were selected, and redundancy analysis was employed to define the contribution rates of these determinants. The results illustrate that considerable urban expansion occurred from 1990 to 2015 in Lhasa, with the area of construction land and transportation land increasing at rates of 117.2% and 564.7%, respectively. The urban expansion in the center of Lhasa can be characterized as temperate sprawl from 1990 through 2008, primarily explained by governmental policies and investment, economic development, tourist growth, and increased governmental investment resulting in faster urban expansion from 2008 to 2015, mainly occurring in the east, south, and west of Lhasa. In contrast with other cities of China, central government investment and "pairing-up support" projects have played an important role in infrastructure construction in Lhasa. The miraculous development of the tourism industry had prominent effects on this economic development and urbanization after 2006, due to the running of the Tibetan Railway. An integrative and proactive policy framework, the "Lhasa development model", having important theoretical, methodological, and management implications for urban planning and development, has been proposed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of vegetation and their responses to temperature and precipitation in upper Shiyang river basin
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shiyang river basin is a typical arid inland river basin in northwestern China, where significant climate change and ecological environment deterioration has been observed over the past several decades. The vegetation in Shiyang river basin is mostly concentrated in its upstream, and plays an important role in ecological environment of this watershed. However, how the regional vegetation responds to such climatic change is poorly understood. To address this question, the spatiotemporal changes of vegetation growth in upper Shiyang river basin together with their responses to climate changes were investigated using SPOT VEGETATION Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climate datasets from 1999 to 2013. Results reveal that about 81.3% of the study area shows an increasing trend in NDVI. The average NDVI of the study area increases at rates of 7.75% for the growing season (March November), 11.75% for spring (March May), 9.62% for summer (June August), and 5.98% for autumn (September November) over the study period. The increase of NDVI in spring and autumn suggests the growing season of the vegetation in this study area has been prolonged. The effects of climate changes on vegetation growth vary with the types of vegetation and seasons, which shows a large spatial and temporal heterogeneity. As compared with temperature, precipitation is the dominant climatic factor affecting the interannual variations of vegetation. If the temperature and precipitation continue to increase in the study area, the sensitivity of vegetation growth to temperature and precipitation may decline. (C) 2017 COSPAR.

TI  - River flood mapping in urban areas combining Radarsat-2 data and flood return period data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-real-time flood maps are essential to organize and coordinate emergency services' response actions during flooding events. Thanks to its capacity to acquire synoptic and detailed data during day and night, and in all weather conditions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite remote sensing is considered one of the best tools for the acquisition of flood mapping information. However, specific factors contributing to SAR backscatter in urban environments, such as shadow and layover effects, and the presence of water surface-like radar response areas, complicate the detection of flood water pixels. This paper describes an approach for near-real-time flood mapping in urban and rural areas. The innovative aspect of the approach is its reliance on the combined use of very-high-resolution SAR satellite imagery (C-band, HH polarization) and hydraulic data, specifically flood return period data estimated for each point of the floodplain. This approach was tested and evaluated using two case studies of the 2011 Richelieu River flood (Canada) observed by the very-high-resolution RADARSAT-2 sensor. In both case studies, the algorithm proved capable of detecting flooding in urban areas with good accuracy, identifying approximately 87% of flooded pixels correctly. The associated false negative and false positive rates are approximately 14%. In rural areas, 97% of flooded pixels were correctly identified, with false negative rates close to 3% and false positive rates between 3% and 35%. These results highlight the capacity of flood return period data to overcome limitations associated with SAR-based flood detection in urban environments, and the relevance of their use in combination with SAR C-band imagery for precise flood extent mapping in urban and rural environments in a crisis management context.

TI  - The Utility of Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in High-Grade Endometrial Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to report the utility and false-negative rates of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping during surgical staging of women with high-grade, apparent uterine-confined endometrial cancer.Methods This was a single-institution study performed at a high-volume academic center. From December 2012 to December 2015, women with high-grade endometrial cancer (grade 3 endometrioid, serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma) underwent SLN mapping via cervical injection followed by robot-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy and completion lymphadenectomy. Ultrastaging of SLNs was performed in patients with tumors with any degree of myoinvasion. Patient demographics, SLN test characteristics, treatment, and recurrence outcomes were prospectively evaluated for analysis.Results Fifty-two patients with high-grade histologic findings underwent SLN mapping followed by completion lymphadenectomy. The median patient age was 64 years, and median body mass index was 31.8 kg/m(2). Most patients had either serous (46%) or grade 3 endometrioid histology (27%) on preoperative biopsy. Nine patients had nodal metastases, 7 of whom had metastases identified in SLNs. No low-volume nodal metastases were identified on ultrastaging. Two patients had false-negative SLN mapping (22%). After a median follow-up of 15.6 months, 14 recurrences (27%) were diagnosed; all were distant or multisite relapses. Sentinel lymph node mapping did not impact the choice of adjuvant therapy or recurrence risk in node-positive patients.Conclusions Sentinel lymph node detection of metastases in patients with high-grade endometrial cancer is high, but false-negative results were encountered. More research is needed to determine whether SLN mapping can safely replace systemic lymphadenectomy in women with high-risk histologic findings.

TI  - Fallen stock data: An essential source of information for quantitative knowledge of equine mortality in France
T2  - EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundQuantitative information about equine mortality is relatively scarce, yet it could be of great value for epidemiological purposes. In France, data from rendering plants are centralised in the Fallen Stock Data Interchange database (FSDI), managed by the French Ministry of Agriculture, while individual equine data are centralised in the French equine census database, SIRE, managed by the French horse and riding institute (IFCE).ObjectivesTo evaluate whether the combined use of the FSDI and SIRE databases can provide representative and accurate quantitative information on mortality for the French equine population and to propose enhancements of these databases to improve the quality of the resulting demographic information.Study designDescriptive study.MethodsMortality ratios for the French equine population were calculated per year between 2011 and 2014 and temporal variations in equine mortality modelled during the same period. Survival analyses were performed on a sample of equines traceable in both the FSDI and SIRE databases.ResultsEstimates of the annual mortality ratios varied from 3.02 to 3.40% depending on the years. Survival rates of equines 2-years-old and over differed according to breed categories with the highest median age at death for the ponies. The weekly description of mortality highlighted marked seasonality of deaths whatever the category of equines. Modelling temporal variations in equine mortality also brought to light excess mortality.Main limitationsInsufficient traceability of equines between the two databases.ConclusionThe FSDI database provided an initial approach to equine death ratios on a national scale and an original description of temporal variations in mortality. Improvement in the traceability of equines between the FSDI and SIRE databases is needed to enable their combined use, providing a representative description of equine longevity and a more detailed description of temporal variations in mortality.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in low risk settings
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should be performed in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) undergoing mastectomy. Yet, the same logic is controversial in the setting of prophylactic mastectomy.Methods: Surgeons were surveyed as to their practices. Statistical analyses were performed to identify associated factors.Results: 238 surgeons responded to the survey. 73.1% of respondents stated they would always perform SLNB in the setting of mastectomy for DCIS, but only 6.6% would always do so in the prophylactic setting. While generally perceived that the rate of SLN positivity in the setting of pure DCIS and prophylactic mastectomy was <5% (96.9% and 99.5%, respectively), 61.8% of surgeons who reported "always" performing SLNB in the setting of DCIS treated with mastectomy stated they "never" performed a SLNB for prophylactic mastectomy.Conclusion: SLNB practice patterns for these low risk settings are disparate. Consensus is required to rationalize practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The intriguing effect of delay time to sentinel lymph node biopsy on survival: a propensity score matching study on a cohort of melanoma patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Time between primary melanoma excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has not been sufficiently studied as an independent predictor of survival in cutaneous melanoma. Objectives: We used propensity score matching to evaluate whether early SLNB (performed <= 40 days from excisional biopsy) is associated with higher mortality in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Materials & methods: A retrospective cohort study at a tertiary melanoma referral centre. We included 787 consecutive patients from the melanoma database of the Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia who underwent a SLNB between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2015, of whom 350 were matched into pairs using propensity score matching. The variable of interest was the time between primary melanoma excision and SLNB (<= 40 days vs > 40 days). The study outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS), melanomaspecific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS). Results: A delay time of 40 days or less was associated with worse DSF (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.65; p = 0.024), MSS (AHR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.1-3.53; p = 0.08), and OS (AHR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.11-2.83; p = 0.017). Other variables associated with shorter MSS were age, tumour location and thickness, mitotic rate, and SLN status. Conclusion: Early SLNB was associated with worse survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma after adjusting for classic prognostic factors. A delay time of over 40 days was not associated with higher mortality.

TI  - First quantitative survey delineates the distribution of chimpanzees in the Eastern Central African Republic
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vast, pristine ecosystems and their biodiversity are vanishing globally at frightening speed, but many large tracts of wilderness have not yet been systematically inventoried and important natural populations of threatened species remain poorly characterized. The forest-savanna ecotone of the Eastern Central African Republic (CAR) is one such poorly studied area. Using camera traps, transect walks and collected fecal samples, we provide the first quantitative survey of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in this region previously classified as a highly important chimpanzee conservation unit. In contrast to species distribution models and expert predictions, we did not find any evidence of chimpanzees in the large and remote forest blocks west of the Chinko River despite considerable search effort. Our study thus highlights the limitations of relying solely on remote sensing data to predict the presence or absence of endangered species and illustrates the necessity of extensive field surveys to accurately assess occurrence and density in remote areas. However, we did discover a sizeable and reproducing population of chimpanzees east of the Chinko River. Based on a density of 0.81 chimpanzees/km(2) in closed canopy forest that we inferred from nest count data, we estimate 910 weaned chimpanzees to inhabit the Chinko Nature Reserve (CNR) and further predict additional 2700 individuals in adjacent, unmanaged hunting zones and reserves. According to microsatellite data, these chimpanzees genetically cluster with P.t. schweinfurthii populations in East Africa. Conservation action and appropriate management plans are urgently needed to protect this important population and to prevent heavily-armed nomadic pastoralists from the Sahel, illegal miners, as well as elephant and meat poachers, from irretrievably destroying the natural vegetation and local biodiversity of the area.

TI  - Comparison of UAV and WorldView-2 imagery for mapping leaf area index of mangrove forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing has opened the door to new sources of data to effectively characterize vegetation metrics at very high spatial resolution and at flexible revisit frequencies. Successful estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) in precision agriculture with a UAV image has been reported in several studies. However, in most forests, the challenges associated with the interference from a complex background and a variety of vegetation species have hindered research using UAV images. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies have mapped the forest LAI with a UAV image. In addition, the drawbacks and advantages of estimating the forest LAI with UAV and satellite images at high spatial resolution remain a knowledge gap in existing literature. Therefore, this paper aims to map LAI in a mangrove forest with a complex background and a variety of vegetation species using a UAV image and compare it with a WorldView-2 image (WV2).In this study, three representative NDVIs, average NDVI (AvNDVI), vegetated specific NDVI (VsNDVI), and scaled NDVI (ScNDVI), were acquired with UAV and WV2 to predict the plot level (10 x 10 m) LAI. The results showed that AvNDVI achieved the highest accuracy for WV2 (R-2 = 0.778, RMSE = 0.424), whereas ScNDVI obtained the optimal accuracy for UAV (R-2 = 0.817, RMSE = 0.423). In addition, an overall comparison results of the WV2 and UAV derived LAIs indicated that UAV obtained a better accuracy than WV2 in the plots that were covered with homogeneous mangrove species or in the low LAI plots, which was because UAV can effectively eliminate the influence from the background and the vegetation species owing to its high spatial resolution. However, WV2 obtained a slightly higher accuracy than UAV in the plots covered with a variety of mangrove species, which was because the UAV sensor provides a negative spectral response function(SRF) than WV2 in terms of the mangrove LAI estimation.

TI  - Extraction of Rice Heavy Metal Stress Signal Features Based on Long Time Series Leaf Area Index Data Using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing technology to diagnose heavy metal stress in crops is of great significance for environmental protection and food security. However, in the natural farmland ecosystem, various stressors could have a similar influence on crop growth, therefore making heavy metal stress difficult to identify accurately, so this is still not a well resolved scientific problem and a hot topic in the field of agricultural remote sensing. This study proposes a method that uses Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) to obtain the heavy metal stress signal features on a long time scale. The method operates based on the Leaf Area Index (LAI) simulated by the Enhanced World Food Studies (WOFOST) model, assimilated with remotely sensed data. The following results were obtained: (i) the use of EEMD was effective in the extraction of heavy metal stress signals by eliminating the intra-annual and annual components; (ii) LAIdf (The first derivative of the sum of the interannual component and residual) can preferably reflect the stable feature responses to rice heavy metal stress. LAIdf showed stability with an R-2 of greater than 0.9 in three growing stages, and the stability is optimal in June. This study combines the spectral characteristics of the stress effect with the time characteristics, and confirms the potential of long-term remotely sensed data for improving the accuracy of crop heavy metal stress identification.

TI  - Implications of para-aortic lymph node metastasis in patients with endometrial cancer without pelvic lymph node metastasis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to confirm the incidence and implications of a lymphatic spread pattern involving para-aortic lymph node (PAN) metastasis in the absence of pelvic lymph node (PLN) metastasis in patients with endometrial cancer.Methods: We carried out a retrospective chart review of 380 patients with endometrial cancer treated by surgery including PLN dissection and PAN dissection at Hokkaido Cancer Center between 2003 and 2016. We determined the probability of PAN metastasis in patients without PLN metastasis and investigated survival outcomes of PLN-PAN+ patients.Results: The median numbers of PLN and PAN removed at surgery were 41 (range: 11-107) and 16 (range: 1-65), respectively. Sixty-four patients (16.8%) had lymph node metastasis, including 39 (10.3%) with PAN metastasis. The most frequent lymphatic spread pattern was PLN+PAN+ (7.9%), followed by PLN+PAN-(6.6%), and PLN-PAN+ (2.4%). The probability of PAN metastasis in patients without PLN metastasis was 2.8% (9/325). The 5-year overall survival rates were 96.5% in PLN-PAN-, 77.6% in PLN+PAN-, 63.4% in PLN+PAN+, and 53.6% in PLN-PAN+ patients.Conclusion: The likelihood of PAN metastasis in endometrial cancer patients without PLN metastasis is not negligible, and the prognosis of PLN-PAN+ is likely to be poor. The implications of a PLN-PAN+ lymphatic spread pattern should thus be taken into consideration when determining patient management strategies.

TI  - Improving the prediction of African savanna vegetation variables using time series of MODIS products
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - African savanna vegetation is subject to extensive degradation as a result of rapid climate and land use change. To better understand these changes detailed assessment of vegetation structure is needed across an extensive spatial scale and at a fine temporal resolution. Applying remote sensing techniques to savanna vegetation is challenging due to sparse cover, high background soil signal, and difficulty to differentiate between spectral signals of bare soil and dry vegetation. In this paper, we attempt to resolve these challenges by analyzing time series of four MODIS Vegetation Products (VPs): Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) for Etosha National Park, a semiarid savanna in north-central Namibia. We create models to predict the density, cover, and biomass of the main savanna vegetation forms: grass, shrubs, and trees. To calibrate remote sensing data we developed an extensive and relatively rapid field methodology and measured herbaceous and woody vegetation during both the dry and wet seasons. We compared the efficacy of the four MODIS-derived VPs in predicting vegetation field measured variables. We then compared the optimal time span of VP time series to predict ground-measured vegetation. We found that Multiyear Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) models were superior to single year or single date models. Our results show that NDVI-based PLSR models yield robust prediction of tree density (R-2 = 0.79, relative Root Mean Square Error, rRMSE = 1.9%) and tree cover (R-2 = 0.78, rRMSE = 0.3%). EVI provided the best model for shrub density (R-2 = 0.82) and shrub cover (R-2 = 0.83), but was only marginally superior over models based on other VPs. FPAR was the best predictor of vegetation biomass of trees (R-2 = 0.76), shrubs (R-2 = 0.83), and grass (R-2 = 0.91). Finally, we addressed an enduring challenge in the remote sensing of semiarid vegetation by examining the transferability of predictive models through space and time. Our results show that models created in the wetter part of Etosha could accurately predict trees' and shrubs' variables in the drier part of the reserve and vice versa. Moreover, our results demonstrate that models created for vegetation variables in the dry season of 2011 could be successfully applied to predict vegetation in the wet season of 2012. We conclude that extensive field data combined with multiyear time series of MODIS vegetation products can produce robust predictive models for multiple vegetation forms in the African savanna. These methods advance the monitoring of savanna vegetation dynamics and contribute to improved management and conservation of these valuable ecosystems.

TI  - Reconstruction of time-varying tidal flat topography using optical remote sensing imageries
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats (TFs) occupy approximately 7% of the total coastal shelf areas worldwide. However, TFs are unavailable in most global digital elevation models (DEMs) due to water-impermeable nature of existing remote sensing approaches (e.g., radar used for WorldDEM (R) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM and optical stereo-pairs used for ASTER Global Digital Elevation Map Version 2). However, this problem can be circumvented using remote sensing imageries to observe land exposure at different tidal heights during each revisit. This work exploits Landsat-4/-5/-7/-8 Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced TM Plus/Operational Land Imager imageries to reconstruct topography of a TF, namely, Hsiang-Shan Wetland in Taiwan, to unveil its formation and temporal changes since the 1980s. We first classify water areas by applying modified normalized difference water index to each Landsat image and normalize chances of water exposure to create an inundation probability map. This map is then scaled by tidal amplitudes extracted from DTU10 tide model to convert the probabilities into actual elevations. After building DEM at intertidal zone, a water level-area curve is established, and accuracy of DEM is validated by sea level (SL) at the timing of each Landsat snapshot. A 22-year (1992-2013) dataset composed of 227 Landsat scenes are analyzed and compared with tide gauge data. Root-mean-square differences of SL reaches 48 cm with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, indicating that the present technique is useful for constructing accurate coastal DEMs, and that products can be utilized for estimating instant SL. This study shows the possibility of exploring evolution of intertidal zones using an archive of optical remote sensing imageries. The technique developed in the present study potentially helps in quantifying SL from the start of optical remote sensing era.

TI  - Pathologically Benign Lymph Nodes Can Mimic Malignancy on Imaging in Patients With Angiomatoid Fibrous Histiocytoma
T2  - CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is a rare soft tissue neoplasm, and its rarity makes studying it difficult. We found that several of our patients with AFH presented with radiologically suspicious local lymph nodes that were sampled because of their imaging characteristics, but the nodes proved to be benign on pathologic evaluation. Although the frequency of this finding is unknown, it seems important for orthopaedic oncologists who care for patients with AFH to know whether suspicious-appearing associated nodes in these patients warrant aggressive management.Questions/purposes (1) How often do patients with newly diagnosed AFH present with radiologically suspicious lymph nodes? (2) How often are the radiologically suspicious nodes malignant on pathologic evaluation?Methods In this retrospective, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, we used a hospital database to identify all 54 patients treated at our hospital for AFH between 1993 and 2016. This study was performed with institutional review board waiver. All of the patients were considered potentially eligible for analysis. Of the patients, 19 (35%) had pretherapy imaging; during the period in question, pretherapy imaging generally was obtained when there was uncertainty regarding extent of disease. All patients who had imaging underwent MRI, and four also had fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT). Imaging reports were reviewed to identify which patients had nodes that were called suspicious in the reports. All patients with nodes described as suspicious on imaging underwent subsequent pathologic analysis for the presence or absence of metastatic AFH cells in the node.Results Seven of 19 patients with pretherapy imaging had local lymph nodes called suspicious for nodal metastases. Pathologic analysis of these nodes showed they were malignant in only one patient, whereas six patients had nodes that were histologically benign despite suspicious imaging findings. Benign nodes measured as much as 3.2 x 1.8 cm on MRI and showed maximum standardized uptake values up to 10.9 on FDG PET/CT.Conclusions Patients with newly diagnosed AFH present with benign lymph nodes that are mistaken for malignancy on imaging. Orthopaedic surgeons and radiologists should be aware of this finding in patients with AFH. Less-invasive management of suspicious nodes, such as image-guided biopsy, may be preferable to nodal resections, as this will help decrease the aggressiveness of surgery for patients with newly diagnosed AFH.

TI  - Molecular analysis of group A rotaviruses detected in hospitalized children from Rawalpindi, Pakistan during 2014
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - As a part of strategy to control diarrheal diseases, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to include rotavirus vaccines in national immunization programs. Sentinel surveillance networks have been established to monitor rotavirus disease burden and genotype distribution in both pre and post vaccine era in many countries. Unfortunately, due to lack of proper surveillance programs, data on rotavirus disease burden and genotype distribution from Pakistan is scarce. We investigated 502 stool samples from children (<5 years) hospitalized due to gastroenteritis in Rawalpindi, Pakistan during 2014 for the presence of group A rotavirus (RVA) and its genotypic diversity. Among 147 ELISA positive samples, 131 were successfully genotyped for RVA. Common G types detected were G1 (23.6%), followed by G3 (22.9%), G12 (19.8%), G2 (19.08%) and G9 (9.9%). The most common P-type was P[8] (41.2%), followed by P[6] (29%) and P[4] (28.24%). G3P[8] (17.55%) was the most prevalent genotype combination followed by G12P[6] (16.7%), G2P[4] (15.2%) and G1P[8] (14.5%). Mixed infection of rotavirus G-P typeswas also observed in 6% of samples. Phylogenetic analysis of VP7 and VP4 genes of Pakistani strains showed that G1, G2, G9 and P[4], P[6], P[8] were closely related to strains circulating worldwide as well as previously reported strains from Pakistan. Pakistani G12P[8] strains NIH-BBH-3981 and NIH-BBH-4003 belonged to lineage 3 cluster 3a along with strains from USA and Italy whereas G12P[6] strains NIH-BBH-3978, NIH-BBH-4052 and NIH-BBH-4444 were closely related to strains from Italy, Thailand, United Kingdom and with previously reported G12 strains from Pakistan within lineage 3 cluster 3b. This pre-vaccination data supports the need for RVA vaccine inclusion at our national level and will be helpful in assessing the effect of vaccination on RVA genotype diversity due to vaccine selection pressure once post-vaccination data becomes available.

TI  - Use of 99mTc-Tilmanocept as a Single Agent for Sentinel Lymph Node Identification in Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Pilot Study.
T2  - Journal of nuclear medicine technology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - 99mTc-tilmanocept received recent Food and Drug Administration approval for lymphatic mapping in 2013. However, to our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated the use of 99mTc-tilmanocept as a single agent in sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer. Methods: We executed this retrospective pilot study to assess the ability of 99mTc-tilmanocept to identify sentinel nodes as a single agent in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients. Patients received a single intradermal injection overlying the tumor of either 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) of 99mTc-tilmanocept on the day of surgery or 74.0 MBq (2.0 mCi) on the day before surgery by a radiologist. Immediate 3-view lymphoscintigraphy was performed. Intraoperatively, SLNs were identified with a portable gamma-probe. A node was classified as hot if the count (per second) of the node was more than 3 times the background count. Descriptive statistics are reported. Results: Nineteen patients underwent SLN biopsy with single-agent 99mTc-tilmanocept. Immediate lymphoscintigraphy identified at least 1 sentinel node in 13 of 17 patients (76.5%). Intraoperatively, at least 1 (mean, 1.7 ± 0.8; range, 1-3) hot node was identified in all patients. Three patients (15.8%) had 1 disease-positive SLN. Conclusion: In this small, retrospective pilot study, 99mTc-tilmanocept performed well as a single agent for intraoperative sentinel node identification in breast cancer. A larger, randomized clinical trial is warranted to compare 99mTc-tilmanocept as a single agent with other radiopharmaceuticals for sentinel node identification in breast cancer.

TI  - Advances in radioguided surgery in oncology
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is probably the most well-known radioguided technique in surgical oncology. Today SLN biopsy reduces the morbidity associated with lymphadenectomy and increases the identification rate of occult lymphatic metastases by offering the pathologist the lymph nodes with the highest probability of containing metastatic cells. These advantages may result in a change in clinical management both in melanoma and breast cancer patients. The SLN evaluation by pathology currently implies tumor burden stratification for further prognostic information. The concept of SLN biopsy includes pre-surgical lymphoscintigraphy as a " roadmap" to guide the surgeon toward the SLNs and to localize unpredictable lymphatic drainage patterns. In addition to planar images, SPECT/CT improves SLN detection, especially in sites closer to the injection site, providing anatomic landmarks which are helpful in localizing SLNs in difficult to interpret studies. The use of intraoperative imaging devices allows a better surgical approach and SLN localization. Several studies report the value of such devices for excision of additional sentinel nodes and for monitoring the whole procedure. The combination of preoperative imaging and radioguided localization constitutes the basis for a whole spectrum of basic and advanced nuclear medicine procedures, which recently have been encompassed under the term "guided intraoperative scintigraphic tumor targeting" (GOSTT). Excepting SLN biopsy, GOSTT includes procedures based on the detection of target lesions with visible uptake of tumor-seeking radiotracers on SPECT/CT or PET/CT enabling their subsequent radioguided excisional biopsy for diagnostic of therapeutic purposes. The incorporation of new PET-tracers into nuclear medicine has reinforced this field delineating new strategies for radioguided excision. In cases with insufficient lesion uptake after systemic radiotracer administration, intralesional injection of a tracer without migration may enable subsequent excision of the targeted tissue. This approach has been helpful in non-palpable breast cancer and in solitary pulmonary nodules. The introduction of allied technologies like fluorescence constitutes a recent advance aimed to refine the search for SLNs and tracer-avid lesions in the operation theatre in combination with radioguidance.

TI  - A worldview of root traits: the influence of ancestry, growth form, climate and mycorrhizal association on the functional trait variation of fine-root tissues in seed plants
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-root traits play key roles in ecosystem processes, but the drivers of fine-root trait diversity remain poorly understood. The plant economic spectrum ( PES) hypothesis predicts that leaf and root traits evolved in coordination. Mycorrhizal association type, plant growth form and climate may also affect root traits. However, the extent to which these controls are confounded with phylogenetic structuring remains unclear.Here we compiled information about root and leaf traits for >600 species. Using phylogenetic relatedness, climatic ranges, growth form and mycorrhizal associations, we quantified the importance of these factors in the global distribution of fine-root traits.Phylogenetic structuring accounts for most of the variation for all traits excepting root tissue density, with root diameter and nitrogen concentration showing the strongest phylogenetic signal and specific root length showing intermediate values. Climate was the second most important factor, whereas mycorrhizal type had little effect. Substantial trait coordination occurred between leaves and roots, but the strength varied between growth forms and clades.Our analyses provide evidence that the integration of roots and leaves in the PES requires better accounting of the variation in traits across phylogenetic clades. Inclusion of phylogenetic information provides a powerful framework for predictions of belowground functional traits at global scales.

TI  - Outbreaks of syphilis among men who have sex with men attending STI clinics between 2007 and 2015 in the Netherlands: a space-time clustering study
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Infectious syphilis (syphilis) is diagnosed predominantly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Netherlands and is a strong indicator for sexual risk behaviour. Therefore, an increase in syphilis can be an early indicator of resurgence of other STIs, including HIV. National and worldwide outbreaks of syphilis, as well as potential changes in sexual networks were reason to explore syphilis trends and clusters in more depth.Methods National STI/HIV surveillance data were used, containing epidemiological, behavioural and clinical data from STI clinics. We examined syphilis positivity rates stratified by HIV status and year. Additionally, we performed space-time cluster analysis on municipality level between 2007 and 2015, using SaTScan to evaluate whether or not there was a higher than expected syphilis incidence in a certain area and time period, using the maximum likelihood ratio test statistic.Results Among HIV-positive MSM, the syphilis positivity rate decreased between 2007 (12.3%) and 2011 (4.5%), followed by an increasing trend (2015: 8.0%). Among HIV-negative MSM, the positivity rate decreased between 2007 (2.8%) and 2011 also (1.4%) and started to increase from 2013 onwards (2015: 1.8%). In addition, we identified three geospatial clusters. The first cluster consisted of MSM sex workers in the South of the Netherlands (July 2009-September 2010, n=10, p<0.001). The second cluster were mostly HIV-positive MSM (58.5%) (Amsterdam; July 2011-December 2015; n=1123, p<0.001), although the proportion of HIV-negative MSM increased over time. The third cluster was large in space (predominantly the city of Rotterdam; April-September 2015, n=72, p=0.014) and were mostly HIV-negative MSM (62.5%).Conclusions Using SaTScan analysis, we observed several not yet recognised outbreaks and a rapid resurgence of syphilis among known HIV-positive MSM first, but more recently, also among HIV-negative MSM. The three identified clusters revealed locations, periods and specific characteristics of the involved MSM that could be used when developing targeted interventions.

TI  - Speculative promise as a driver in climate engineering research: The case of Paul Crutzen's back-of-the-envelope calculation on solar dimming with sulfate aerosols
T2  - FUTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I study the generative role of speculative promise in climate engineering research. My analysis operationalizes Alfred Nordmann's call for a 'forensics of wishing', a variety of technology assessment which scrutinizes the politics of anticipation in technoscience. Using scientific articles and reports as primary sources I trace the uptake and contestation of, bold claims made by atmospheric scientist Paul Crutzen a decade ago. In 2006, Crutzen called for dedicated research on stratospheric albedo enhancement as a method to cool the planet. A back-of-the-envelope calculation invoking the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano as a case to be mimicked served to illustrate the method. In the paper, I concentrate on the reception of this idea by fellow climate scientists. Besides fundamental objections being made to Crutzen's climate paradigm, less idealized models appeared to produce much less promising calculations. The initial claims however kept reappearing as well and continue to exert influence as idealized models take the idea further. Speculation thus continues to be an important driver of the research. In the conclusion, I discuss aspects of the worldview underlying the proposal, drawing on environmental humanities literature on the human condition in the Anthropocene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Validation of the USGS Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) across the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV), developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), capitalizes on the long temporal availability of Landsat imagery to identify burned areas across the conterminous United States (CONUS) (1984-2015). Adequate validation of such products is critical for their proper usage and interpretation. Validation of coarse-resolution products often relies on independent data derived from moderate resolution sensors (e.g., Landsat). Validation of Landsat products, in turn, is challenging because there is no corresponding source of high-resolution, multispectral imagery that has been systematically collected in space and time over the entire temporal extent of the Landsat archive. Because of this, comparison between high-resolution images and Landsat science products can help increase user's confidence in the Landsat science products, but may not, alone, be adequate. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to systematically validate the Landsat-derived BAECV product. Burned area extent was mapped for Landsat image pairs using a manually trained semi-automated algorithm that was manually edited across 28 path/rows and five different years (1988,1993, 1998, 2003, 2008). Three datasets were independently developed by three analysts and the datasets were integrated on a pixel by pixel basis in which at least one to all three analysts were required to agree a pixel was burned. We found that errors within our Landsat reference dataset could be minimized by using the rendition of the dataset in which pixels were mapped as burned if at least two of the three analysts agreed. BAECV errors of omission and commission for the detection of burned pixels averaged 42% and 33%, respectively for CONUS across all five validation years. Errors of omission and commission were lowest across the western CONUS, for example in the shrub and scrublands of the Arid West (31% and 24%, respectively), and highest in the grasslands and agricultural lands of the Great Plains in central CONUS (62% and 57%, respectively). The BAECV product detected most (>65%) fire events >10 ha across the western CONUS (Arid and Mountain West ecoregions). Our approach and results demonstrate that a thorough validation of Landsat science products can be completed with independent Landsat-derived reference data, but could be strengthened by the use of complementary sources of high-resolution data.

TI  - Topographic Correction to Landsat Imagery through Slope Classification by Applying the SCS plus C Method in Mountainous Forest Areas
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the topographic normalization of remotely sensed imagery is to reduce reflectance variability caused by steep terrain and thus improve further processing of images. A process of topographic correction was applied to Landsat imagery in a mountainous forest area in the south of Mexico. The method used was the Sun Canopy Sensor + C correction (SCS + C) where the C parameter was differently determined according to a classification of the topographic slopes of the studied area in nine classes for each band, instead of using a single C parameter for each band. A comparative, visual, and numerical analysis of the normalized reflectance was performed based on the corrected images. The results showed that the correction by slope classification improves the elimination of the effect of shadows and relief, especially in steep slope areas, modifying the normalized reflectance values according to the combination of slope, aspect, and solar geometry, obtaining reflectance values more suitable than the correction by non-slope classification. The application of the proposed method can be generalized, improving its performance in forest mountainous areas.

TI  - SCOPE-Based Emulators for Fast Generation of Synthetic Canopy Reflectance and Sun-Induced Fluorescence Spectra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Progress in advanced radiative transfer models (RTMs) led to an improved understanding of reflectance (R) and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emission throughout the leaf and canopy. Among advanced canopy RTMs that have been recently modified to deliver SIF spectral outputs are the energy balance model SCOPE and the 3D models DART and FLIGHT. The downside of these RTMs is that they are computationally expensive, which makes them impractical in routine processing, such as scene generation and retrieval applications. To bypass their computational burden, a computationally effective technique has been proposed by only using a limited number of model runs, called emulation. The idea of emulation is approximating the original RTM by a surrogate machine learning model with low computation time. However, a concern is whether the emulator reaches sufficient accuracy. To this end, we analyzed key aspects of emulator development that may impact the precision of emulating SCOPE-like R and SIF spectra, being: (1) type of machine learning, (2) type of dimensionality reduction (DR) method, and (3) number of components and lookup table (LUT) size. The machine learning family of Gaussian processes regression and neural networks were found best suited to function as emulators. The classical principal component analysis (PCA) remains a robust DR method, but the number of components needs to be optimized depending on the complexity of the spectral data. Based on a small Latin hypercube sampling LUT of 500 samples (70% used for training) covering a selection of SCOPE input variables, the best-performing emulators can reconstruct any combination for the selected SCOPE input variables with relative errors along the spectral range below 2% for R and 4% for SIF. That is sufficient for a precise reconstruction for the large majority of possible combinations, and errors can be further reduced when increasing LUT size for training. As a proof of concept, we imported the best-performing emulators into a newly developed Automated Scene Generator Module (A-SGM) to generate a R and SIF synthetic scene of a vegetated surface. Using emulators as alternative of SCOPE reduced the processing time from the order of days to the order of minutes while preserving sufficient accuracy.

TI  - Modelling suspended sediment dynamics on the subaqueous delta of the Mekong River
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluvial sediment is the major source for the formation and development of the Mekong Delta. This paper aims to analyse the dynamics of suspended sediment and to investigate the roles of different processes in order to explore flux pattern changes. We applied modelling on two scales, comprising a large-scale model (the whole delta) to consider the upstream characteristics, particularly the Tonle Sap Lake's flood regulation, and a smaller-scale model (tidal rivers and shelf) to understand the sediment processes on the subaqueous delta. A comprehensive comparison to in-situ measurements and remote sensing data demonstrated that the model is capable of qualitatively simulating sediment dynamics on the subaqueous delta. It estimates that the Mekong River supplied an amount of 41.5 mil tons from April 2014 to April 2015. A substantial amount of sediment delivered by the Mekong River is deposited in front of the river mouths in the high flow season and resuspended in the low flow season. A sensitivity analysis shows that waves, baroclinic effects and bed composition strongly influence suspended sediment distribution and transport on the shelf. Waves in particular play an essential role in sediment resuspension. The development of this model is an important step towards an operational model for scientific and engineering applications, since the model is capable of predicting tidal propagation and discharge distribution through the main branches, and in predicting the seasonal SSC and erosion/deposition patterns on the shelf, while it is forced by readily available inputs: discharge at Kratie (Cambodia), GFS winds, ERA40 reanalysis waves, and TPXO 8v1 HR tidal forcing.

TI  - Landsat identifies aeolian dust emission dynamics at the landform scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The modelling of windblown mineral dust emissions remains a challenge. This is in part due to the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of the data on which these models are based, but also because the processes and mechanisms of aeolian dust emission are not well understood. Satellite imagery has been used extensively in the study of dust from the late 1990s with important contributions being made in terms of sources, transport pathways and deposition areas. Using MODIS imagery, the Namib Desert has been identified as one of the largest sources of dust in southem Africa. The opening of the Landsat archive presents the opportunity to investigate these events at a higher spatial resolution (up to 15 x 15 m) than previously possible. Despite the low temporal resolution, we used Landsat imagery to identify 40 major dust episodes over the last 25 years that originated primarily from the ephemeral river valleys and pan complexes, providing new insight into the spatial and temporal evolution of the dust sources from dryland surfaces. Examination of the imagery enabled the identification of local-scale landform source points to direct ground based testing of the surfaces responsible for dust emission. Emissivity tests were undertaken using a PI-SWERL portable wind tunnel in three of the major dust producing river systems along the Namib coast, namely the Kuiseb, Omaruru and Huab Rivers. Preliminary observations suggest that human impact on the hydrological systems in two of the river basins, to cater for the increasing demand of water, have dramatically altered the emission patterns of dust. The source areas of greatest dust emission are found to be located on recently deposited fluvial surfaces which are not active in the contemporary environment.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Internal mammary nodes (IMN) in early stage breast cancer are a still unresolved issue. Their involvement has a crucial impact on the staging as well as prognosis of the breast cancer patients. The reported incidence of IMN drainage in the process of detecting the axillary sentinel node is about 20% depending on the tracer application technique. However, the IMN drainage itself apparently has no effect on the prognosis even when the nodes are left without biopsy or radiotherapy. The major predictive factor for the presence of metastases in IMN is the presence of metastases in axillary lymph nodes. Studies evaluating adjuvant IMN radiotherapy have shown inconsistent outcomes. The generally accepted trend towards less extensive locoregional procedures in breast cancer treatment will apparently affect the IMN, as well, given that new systemic treatment will probably compensate for uncertainties in IMN management.Key words: breast cancer internal mammary nodes radiotherapy.

TI  - Effect of spatial variability of wet snow on modeled and observed microwave emissions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Melting snow provides an essential source of water in many regions of the world and can also contribute to devastating, wide-scale flooding. Global datasets of recorded passive microwave emissions provide non-destructive, daily information on snow processes including the presence of liquid water in the snow, which can be an indicator of snowmelt The objective of this research is to test the sensitivity of the emission signal as it relates to the spatial distribution of liquid water content in the snowpack. This signal response was evaluated over an area approximately the size of a microwave pixel to assess whether a relationship exists between the aerial extent of wet snow and the magnitude of the T-B response. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a high-resolution, physically based snow-emission model to simulate microwave emissions. The signal response to wet snow was evaluated given a range of spatially distributed snowpack conditions. Daily snow states were simulated for a 9-year period using a high-resolution (50 m) energy balance snow model over a 34 x 34 km domain. These data were fed into a microwave emission model to simulate brightness temperatures. A near-linear relationship was found between the T-B signal response over a spatially heterogeneous snowpack and the percent area with liquid water content (LWC) present. The results were confirmed by evaluating actual wet snow events over a 9-year period. The model output was also compared to AMSR-E passive microwave satellite data and discharge data at a basin outlet within the study area. The results are used to help understand the impact of spatially distributed snowmelt as detected by passive microwave data. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Multi-Data Approach for remote sensing-based regional crop rotation mapping: A case study for the Rur catchment, Germany
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial land use information is one of the key input parameters for regional agro-ecosystem modeling. Furthermore, to assess the crop-specific management in a spatio-temporal context accurately, parcel-related crop rotation information is additionally needed. Such data is scarcely available for a regional scale, so that only modeled crop rotations can be incorporated instead. However, the spectrum of the occurring multiannual land use patterns on arable land remains unknown. Thus, this contribution focuses on the mapping of the actually practiced crop rotations in the Rur catchment, located in the western part of Germany. We addressed this by combining multitemporal multispectral remote sensing data, ancillary information and expert-knowledge on crop phenology in a GIS-based Multi-Data Approach (MDA). At first, a methodology for the enhanced differentiation of the major crop types on an annual basis was developed. Key aspects are (i) the usage of physical block data to separate arable land from other land use types, (ii) the classification of remote sensing scenes of specific time periods, which are most favorable for the differentiation of certain crop types, and (iii) the combination of the multitemporal classification results in a sequential analysis strategy. Annual crop maps of eight consecutive years (2008-2015) were combined to a crop sequence dataset to have a profound data basis for the mapping of crop rotations. In most years, the remote sensing data basis was highly fragmented. Nevertheless, our method enabled satisfying crop mapping results. As an example for the annual crop mapping workflow, the procedure and the result of 2015 are illustrated. For the generation of the crop sequence dataset, the eight annual crop maps were geometrically smoothened and integrated into a single vector data layer. The resulting dataset informs about the occurring crop sequence for individual areas on arable land, so that crop rotation schemes can be derived. The resulting dataset reveals that the spectrum of the practiced crop rotations is extremely heterogeneous and contains a large amount of crop sequences, which strongly diverge from model crop rotations. Consequently, the integration of remote sensing-based crop rotation data can considerably reduce uncertainties regarding the management in regional agro-ecosystem modeling. Finally, the developed methods and the results are discussed in detail.

TI  - Robust Computerized Ionospheric Tomography Based on Spaceborne Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the dispersion nature of the ionosphere, the spaceborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) systems at L or lower frequencies will generally experience more severe effects in comparison to frequencies above L-band. Correspondingly, according to the mechanism of how ionosphere destroys the scattering matrix of PolSAR data, the total electron content (TEC), an important input in computerized ionospheric tomography (CIT), can be retrieved by model inversion. Thus, this paper presents a technique of CIT based on the spaceborne PolSAR data. The CIT technique is a means to obtain the spatial distribution of ionospheric electron density from the TEC values. Because of the high spatial resolution of spaceborne SAR, the kilometer-scale TEC information can be obtained by the PolSAR data where such resolution was previously inaccessible. The spatial distribution of ionospheric electron density with high resolution can therefore be obtained. In addition, the potential limitation of previous CIT based on SAR imaging information is the difficulty in requiring strong point targets with high signal-to-clutter (SCR) ratio in scenes. In contrast, the CIT reconstruction based on scattering matrix information can be easily realized without aforementioned special requirements. In this paper, by using the simulated data of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased-Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) full-pol data, the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) 2007, and the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) models, the reconstruction of ionospheric electron density distribution is first simulated to validate the feasibility of the proposed technique. Then, possible effects of SAR system and model errors on the reconstruction results are also simulated and analyzed to show the applicability.

TI  - Analysis of Differences in Phenology Extracted from the Enhanced Vegetation Index and the Leaf Area Index
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing phenology detection can compensate for deficiencies in field observations and has the advantage of capturing the continuous expression of phenology on a large scale. However, there is some variability in the results of remote-sensing phenology detection derived from different vegetation parameters in satellite time-series data. Since the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the leaf area index (LAI) are the most widely used vegetation parameters for remote-sensing phenology extraction, this paper aims to assess the differences in phenological information extracted from EVI and LAI time series and to explore whether either index performs well for all vegetation types on a large scale. To this end, a GLASS (Global Land Surface Satellite Product)-LAI-based phenology product (GLP) was generated using the same algorithm as the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)-EVI phenology product (MLCD) over China from 2001 to 2012. The two phenology products were compared in China for different vegetation types and evaluated using ground observations. The results show that the ratio of missing data is 8.3% for the GLP, which is less than the 22.8% for the MLCD. The differences between the GLP and the MLCD become stronger as the latitude decreases, which also vary among different vegetation types. The start of the growing season (SOS) of the GLP is earlier than that of the MLCD in most vegetation types, and the end of the growing season (EOS) of the GLP is generally later than that of the MLCD. Based on ground observations, it can be suggested that the GLP performs better than the MLCD in evergreen needleleaved forests and croplands, while the MLCD performs better than the GLP in shrublands and grasslands.

TI  - Sentinel-1 observations of the 2016 Menyuan earthquake: A buried reverse. event linked to the left-lateral Haiyuan fault
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge on the interaction of active structures is essential to understand mechanics of continental deformation and estimate the earthquake potential in complex tectonic settings. Here we use Sentinel-1A radar imagery to investigate coseismic deformation associated with the 2016 Menyuan (Qinghai) earthquake, which occurred in the vicinity of the left-lateral Haiyuan fault. The ascending and descending interferograms indicate thrust-dominated slip, with the maximum line-of-sight displacements of 58 and 68 mm, respectively. The InSAR observations fit well with the uniform-slip dislocation models except for a larger slip-to-width ratio than that predicted by the empirical scaling law. We suggest that geometric complexities near the Leng Long Ling restraining bend confine rupture propagation, resulting in high slip occurred within a small area and much higher stress drop than global estimates. Although InSAR observations cannot distinguish the primary plane, we prefer the west-dipping solution considering aftershocks distribution and the general tectonic context. Both InSAR modelling and aftershock locations indicate that the rupture plane linked to the Haiyuan fault at 10 km depth, a typical seismogenic depth in Tibet. We suggest that the earthquake more likely occurred on a secondary branch at a restraining bend of the Haiyuan fault, even though we cannot completely rule out the possibility of it being on a splay of the North Qilian Shan thrusts.

TI  - Detecting ship targets in spaceborne infrared image based on modeling radiation anomalies
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using infrared imaging sensors to detect ship target in the ocean environment has many advantages compared to other sensor modalities, such as better thermal sensitivity and all-weather detection capability. We propose a new ship detection method by modeling radiation anomalies for spaceborne infrared image. The proposed method can be decomposed into two stages, where in the first stage, a test infrared image is densely divided into a set of image patches and the radiation anomaly of each patch is estimated by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and thereby target candidates are obtained from anomaly image patches. In the second stage, target candidates are further checked by a more discriminative criterion to obtain the final detection result. The main innovation of the proposed method is inspired by the biological mechanism that human eyes are sensitive to the unusual and anomalous patches among complex background. The experimental result on short wavelength infrared band (1.560-2.300 mu m) and long wavelength infrared band (10.30-12.50 mu m) of Landsat-8 satellite shows the proposed method achieves a desired ship detection accuracy with higher recall than other classical ship detection methods.

TI  - Surface Urban Heat Island Analysis of Shanghai (China) Based on the Change of Land Use and Land Cover
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present surface urban heat island (SUHI) analysis of Shanghai (China) based on the change in land use and land cover using satellite Landsat images from 2002 to 2013. With the rapid development of urbanization, urban ecological and environmental issues have aroused widespread concern. The urban heat island (UHI) effect is a crucial problem, as its generation and evolution are closely related to social and economic activities. Land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) is the key in analyzing the UHI effect. Shanghai, one of China's major economic, financial and commercial centers, has experienced high development density for several decades. A tremendous amount of farmland and vegetation coverage has been replaced by an urban impervious surface, leading to an intensive SUHI effect, especially in the city's center. Luckily, the SUHI trend has slowed due to reasonable urban planning and relevant green policies since the 2010 Expo. Data analyses demonstrate that an impervious surface (IS) has a positive correlation with land surface temperature (LST) but a negative correlation with vegetation and water. Among the three factors, impervious surface is the most relevant. Therefore, the policy implications of land use and control of impervious surfaces should pay attention to the relief of the current SUHI effect in Shanghai.

TI  - Circumference-Based Criteria for Detection of Secondary Arm Lymphedema for Chinese Women
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Detection of upper limb lymphedema following treatment for breast cancer typically relies on interlimb circumference-based differences. Normative-determined criteria from an Australian population have high sensitivity and specificity for detection of mild lymphedema in Australian women. It is unknown whether these criteria are applicable to Chinese women whose body habitus is different from Australian women. The aims of this study, therefore, were to determine the normative-based interlimb circumference and volume differences in a Chinese population and whether specific population-based thresholds are required.Methods and Results: Arm circumferences at the wrist and at 10 cm intervals proximally to 40 cm were measured on both the dominant and nondominant limb in 484 healthy women, aged >= 20 years. Absolute interlimb differences and interlimb ratios were determined for the circumferences and derived 10 cm volume segments. Analysis of variance determined if the differences varied, depending on location. The absolute interlimb circumference difference from 10 to 30 cm did not vary significantly, enabling determination of a single threshold applicable to all three circumferences. The interlimb ratios varied less, requiring only a threshold for the wrist and one for 10-40 cm and one ratio for interlimb volume segments. The interlimb thresholds determined in the Chinese population were within 2mm to that reported in the Australian study.Conclusions: Even though the habitus of Chinese women living in China differed to the women living in Australia, similar normative-based thresholds for the detection of lymphedema were identified.

TI  - Quantitative models of <i>Rhipicephalus</i> (<i>Boophilus</i>) ticks: historical review and synthesis
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several tick species, in what is now known as the subgenus Boophilus in the genus Rhipicephalus, are economically important ectoparasites of livestock and other ungulates; as vectors of pathogens that kill cattle, they remain among the most studied ticks in the world. Researchers have developed quantitative computer models of Rhipicephalus ticks since the early 1970s to study complex biological and ecological relationships that influence management or eradication of ticks and tick-borne diseases. We review the 45-yr history of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) models, which were developed and applied first in Australia, 10 yr later in North and South America, then soon after in Africa. Models progressed from analytical models of a portion of tick life cycles, to simulation models of complete life cycles or ecoclimatic indices, to the current emphasis on GIS-based bioclimatic envelope models estimated from remotely sensed data and tick presence records. Earlier models were used primarily to predict effects of management techniques, such as use of sterile hybrid ticks, pasture rotation, acaricides, vaccines, and resistant cattle, while more recent models have been used to predict the potential for range expansion, especially due to global climate change and wildlife hosts, as well as in the face of competition with other tick species. We summarize characteristics of these models and compare those of population dynamics and bioclimatic envelope models. We discuss the past and present utility of these models and provide a perspective on future Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) modeling efforts.

T2  - REVISTA CHAPINGO SERIE CIENCIAS FORESTALES Y DEL AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Urbanization has altered the natural landscape in the world. The urban expansion has been occurring more rapidly than ever before in China.Objective: To analyze the urban forest landscape pattern and ecological network structure in the Pudong district in Shanghai, China.Materials and methods: The study area covers 553 km(2), including 253 km(2) of built-up area. Using Landsat 7 2008TM, 2007 Spot Image, Google Earth and city maps, the structural characteristics were analyzed. The landscape patterns of the urban forest and green network structure were interpreted using ArcGIS Software.Results and discussion: The area of the urban forest patches (>900 m(2)) and the built-up area in the district were 5.15 % and 5.78 % respectively. The area of the green corridor network was 80.27 km(2) while the density was 1.99 km.km(-2). The linkage of the green network was 1.30, circuitry was 0.19 and connectivity 0.47. The tree canopy coverage was 7.02 % in the entire study area, and 10.27 % in the built-up area. The tree canopy coverage can reach to 8.68 % similar to 9.79 % in the total study area, and 11.49 % similar to 12.3 % in the built-up area.Conclusion: The green network has been constructed, but it was not well designed, so it is necessary to improve its structure. The existing trees cannot modify the forest environment for all the urban forest. Planting more trees is feasible to increase the tree canopy coverage.

TI  - Validation of MODIS-Aqua Aerosol Products C051 and C006 over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recently released MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) Collection 6(C006) includes several significant improvements, which are expected to do well in analyzing aerosols and using the observations for air pollution application. The C006 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrievals should be validated completely before they will be applied to specific research. However, the validation of C006 AOD retrievals at a regional scale is limited. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of the MODIS-Aqua Collection 51 (C051) and C006 AOD retrievals over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in China from 2006 to 2015 using ground-based Sun photometers. The algorithms of the AOD product include Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB). The results indicated that the improvements in DT C006 were slight, as the expected error (EE) increased by almost 9% over the two sites, and the DT C051 and DT C006 AOD were overestimated for both sites. DB C006 presented an improvement over DB C051, and a better correlation was observed between the collocated DB C006 retrievals and Sun photometer data (R ranged from 0.9343-0.9383). There was an increase in the frequency from DT C051 to DT C006, in the range 0.6-1.5, over the two sites; moreover, the AOD from the DB retrievals had a very narrow range (0.1-0.3). The spatial distribution of the AOD values was high (AOD >0.7) over the southeastern region and low (AOD < 0.3) over the northwestern region. Changes in the DT C006 algorithm resulted in an increased AOD (0.085) for the region. The AOD values in spring and summer were higher than those in fall and winter. By subtracting the C051 AOD from the corresponding C006 values, greater positive changes (similar to 0.2) were found in the southeastern areas during summer, presumably as the updated cloud-masking allowed heavy smoke retrievals. The accuracy of the AOD retrievals depended on the assumptions of surface reflectance and the selection of the aerosol model. The use of the DB C006 algorithm is recommended for the Beijing and Xianghe sites. Because of the limitations of the DT algorithm over sparsely vegetated surfaces, the DT C006 product is recommended for Xianghe.

AB  - BackgroundTumour thickness is a strong predictor for cervical node involvement in oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), with a recent meta-analysis concluding a 4-mm optimal prognostic cut-off point. No consensus has been reached for the tumour thickness cut-off for oral tongue SCCs.MethodsA retrospective review of prospectively collected data from 112 patients by the Northern Sydney Cancer Centre (Australia) with primary oral tongue SCC was conducted. Tumour thickness was measured by standard histopathological techniques and cervical node involvement was determined either from neck dissection histopathology or by clinical and radiological follow-up.ResultsNeck dissection was performed in 78 patients (70%). Tumour thickness was a significant predictor of cervical node disease (P < 0.01), with a median tumour thickness of 5.5 mm. Cervical node metastasis rates for tumours <2, 2-3.9 and 4 mm thick were 10%, 42.1% and 46.5%, respectively. The rate of cervical node metastasis was significantly higher for patients with tumours thicker than a cut-off of 2 mm (odds ratio: 7.53, P < 0.01). A 4-mm thickness cut-off was also statistically significant (P < 0.05); however, the odds ratio was smaller at 2.52.ConclusionDespite some previous evidence for a 4-mm tumour thickness cut-off in oral tongue SCCs, thinner tumours (2-3.9 mm) can also have a propensity for cervical node metastasis. Patients in this category require close monitoring for regional recurrence if they do not have a neck dissection.

TI  - Comparison of TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR Differential Interferometry With Multisource DEMs for Monitoring Ground Displacement in a Discontinuous Permafrost Region
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) has shown its capability in monitoring ground displacement caused by the freeze-thaw cycle in the active layer of permafrost regions. However, the unique landscape in the discontinuous permafrost zone increases the difficulty of applying DInSAR to detect ground displacements. In this study, datasets from two radar systems, X-band TerraSAR-X and L-band ALOS PALSAR, were used to evaluate the influencing factors and application conditions for DInSAR in the discontinuous permafrost environment based on a large number of analyzed interferograms. Furthermore, the impact of different DEMs on the application of DInSAR was illustrated by comparing the high-resolution LiDAR-DEM, TanDEM-X DEM, and SRTM DEM. The results demonstrate that temporal decorrelation and strong volume decorrelation in areas with developed vegetation highly constrains the application of X-band data. In terrain with more developed vegetation (such as shrubs and spruce), the X-band differential phase becomes linked to the canopy rather than the topography, whereas L-band data show promising results in retrieving topography-related displacement. By comparing the displacement velocity maps of the two sensors and referencing in situ measurements, we demonstrated that the ALOS PALSAR results capture the permafrost-induced terrain movement characteristics and values in the correct range. Moreover, the influence of soil moisture and vegetation phenology on the accuracy of displacement retrievals using the L-band data are illustrated and discussed. The analyses confirm that the L-band has strong advantages over the X-band in monitoring displacements in discontinuous permafrost environments.

TI  - Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Fusion of MODIS and Landsat Data by Incorporating 250 m MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion of MODIS and Landsat data aims to produce new data that have simultaneously the Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS temporal resolution. It is an ill-posed problem involving large uncertainty, especially for reproduction of abrupt changes and heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, we proposed to incorporate the freely available 250 m MODIS images into spatio-temporal fusion to increase prediction accuracy. The 250 m MODIS bands 1 and 2 are fused with 500 m MODIS bands 3-7 using the advanced area-to-point regression kriging approach. Based on a standard spatio-temporal fusion approach, the interim 250 m fused MODIS data are then downscaled to 30 m with the aid of the available 30 m Landsat data on temporally close days. The 250 m data can provide more information for the abrupt changes and heterogeneous landscapes than the original 500 m MODIS data, thus increasing the accuracy of spatio-temporal fusion predictions. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme was demonstrated using two datasets.

TI  - Complex responses of spring alpine vegetation phenology to snow cover dynamics over the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover dynamics are considered to play a key role on spring phenological shifts in the high-latitude, so investigating responses of spring phenology to snow cover dynamics is becoming an increasingly important way to identify and predict global ecosystem dynamics. In this study, we quantified the temporal trends and spatial variations of spring phenology and snow cover across the Tibetan Plateau by calibrating and analyzing time series of the NOAA AVHRR-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during 1983-2012. We also examined how snow cover dynamics affect the spatio-temporal pattern of spring alpine vegetation phenology over the plateau. Our results indicated that 52.21% of the plateau experienced a significant advancing trend in the beginning of vegetation growing season (BGS) and 34.30% exhibited a delaying trend. Accordingly, the snow cover duration days (SCD) and snow cover melt date (SCM) showed similar patterns with a decreasing trend in the west and an increasing trend in the southeast, but the start date of snow cover (SCS) showed an opposite pattern. Meanwhile, the spatial patterns of the BGS, SCD, SCS and SCM varied in accordance with the gradients of temperature, precipitation and topography across the plateau. The response relationship of spring phenology to snow cover dynamics varied within different climate, terrain and alpine plant community zones, and the spatio-temporal response patterns were primarily controlled by the long-term local heat-water conditions and topographic conditions. Moreover, temperature and precipitation played a profound impact on diverse responses of spring phenology to snow cover dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-Mode GF-3 Satellite Image Geometric Accuracy Verification Using the RPC Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite is the first C-band multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging satellite with a resolution up to 1 m in China. It is also the only SAR satellite of the High-Resolution Earth Observation System designed for civilian use. There are 12 different imaging models to meet the needs of different industry users. However, to use SAR satellite images for related applications, they must possess high geometric accuracy. In order to verify the geometric accuracy achieved by the different modes of GF-3 images, we analyze the SAR geometric error source and perform geometric correction tests based on the RPC model with and without ground control points (GCPs) for five imaging modes. These include the spotlight (SL), ultra-fine strip (UFS), Fine Strip I (FSI), Full polarized Strip I (QPSI), and standard strip (SS) modes. Experimental results show that the check point residuals are large and consistent without GCPs, but the root mean square error of the independent checkpoints for the case of four corner control points is better than 1.5 pixels, achieving a similar level of geometric positioning accuracy to that of international satellites. We conclude that the GF-3 satellite can be used for high-accuracy geometric processing and related industry applications.

T2  - Chinese Pharmacological Bulletin
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim To observe the effect of eplerenone (EPL) and Chinese decoction on cell apoptosis in obstructive nephropathy rats. Methods Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into sham group, UUO group, EPL group and ZY group (n = 15). Except sham group, the rats in the other groups were ligated with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) for renal interstitial fibrosis model. The rats were treated with eplerenone at 100 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) added to diet in EPL group, and orally 13. 7 g.kg(-1).d(-1) decoction of Chinese medicine in ZY group. The kidneys were harvested on 14th day, the number of renal cell apoptosis were detected by TUNEL, and serum aldosterone and 8-OhdG were detected with radioimmunoassay and ELISA. Caspase-12 caspase-9 Bax and Bcl-2 were examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Results The levels of serum aldosterone, serum and urine 8-OhdG and the number of positive apoptotic cells increased significantly in UUO rats compared with Sham group. The overexpression of caspase-9, caspase-12 and Bax and down-regulated Bcl-2 were obvious in UUO group(P <0. 01). The level of 8-OhdG, expression of caspase-9 caspase-12 and Bax were down-regulated, and Bcl-2 expression was up-regulated in eplerenone and Chinese decoction treated rats (P < 0. 01). Conclusion Eplerenone and Chinese decoction could inhibit cell apoptosis induced by oxidative damage after UUO via caspases and (or) Bax pathway.

TI  - Incorporating an iterative energy restraint for the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) has proven itself as an effective remotely sensed estimator of actual evapotranspiration (ETa). However, it has several vulnerabilities associated with the partitioning of the available energy (AE) at the land surface. We introduce a two stage energy restraint process into the SEBS algorithm (SEBS-ER) to overcome these vulnerabilities. The first offsets the remotely sensed surface temperature to ensure the surface to air temperature difference reflects AE, while the second stage uses a domain based image search process to identify and adjust the proportions of sensible (H) and latent (lambda E) heat flux with respect to AE. We effectively implemented SEBS-ER over 61 acquisitions over two Landsat tiles (path 90 row 84 and path 91 row 85) in south-eastern Australia that feature heterogeneous land covers. Across the two areas we showed that the SEBS-ER algorithm has: greater resilience to perturbed errors in surface energy balance algorithm inputs; significantly improved accuracy (p < 0.05) at two eddy covariance flux towers in heavily forested (RMSE 62.3 W m(-2), R-2 0.879) and sub-alpine grassland (RMSE 33.2 W m(-2), R-2 0.939) land covers; and greater temporal stability across 52 daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimates compared to a temporally stable and independent ETa dataset. The energy restraint within SEBS-ER has reduced exposure to the complex errors and uncertainties within remotely sensed, meteorological, and land type SEBS inputs, providing more reliable and accurate spatially distributed ETa products.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping with Isosulfan Blue or Indocyanine Green in Colon Cancer Shows Comparable Results and Identifies Patients with Decreased Survival: A Prospective Single-Center Trial
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was reported to improve lymph node staging in colon cancer. This study compares isosulfan blue (IB) with indocyanine green (ICG)-based SLN-mapping and assesses the prognostic value of isolated tumor cells (ITC) and micro-metastases in upstaged patients.A total of 220 stage I-III colon cancer patients were included in this prospective single-center study. In 170 patients, SLN-mapping was performed in vivo with IB and in 50 patients ex vivo with ICG. Three levels of each SLN were stained with H&E. If negative for tumor infiltration, immunostaining for cytokeratin (AE1/3; cytokeratin-19) was performed.SLN detection rate for IB and ICG was 100 and 98%, respectively. Accuracy and sensitivity was 88 and 75% for IB, 82 and 64% for ICG, respectively (p = 0.244). Overall, 149 (68%) patients were node negative. In these patients, ITC and micro-metastases were detected in 26% (31/129) with IB and 17% (5/29) with ICG (p = 0.469). Patients with ITC and micro-metastases did show decreased overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.96, p = 0.09) compared to node negative disease.This study demonstrates a high diagnostic accuracy for both the IB and the ICG SLN-mapping. SLN-mapping upstaged a quarter of patients with node negative colon cancer, and the detected ITC and micro-metastases were an independent negative prognostic marker in multivariate analysis.

TI  - A Novel ICU Hand-Over Tool: The Glass Door of the Patient Room
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Poor communication among health-care providers is cited as the most common cause of sentinel events involving patients. Patient care in the critical care setting is incredibly complex. A consistent care plan is necessary between day/night shift teams and among bedside intensive care unit (ICU) nurses, consultants, and physicians. Our goal was to create a novel, easily accessible communication device to improve ICU patient care.Methods: This communication improvement project was done at an academic tertiary surgical/trauma/mixed 36-bed ICU with an average of 214 admissions per month. We created a glass door template embossed on the glass that included 3 columns for daily goals to be written: day team, night team, and surgery/consultant team. Assigned areas for tracking lines, antibiotics, ventilator weaning, and Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) screening were included. These doors are filled out/updated throughout the day by all of the ICU providers. All services can review current plans/active issues while evaluating the patient at the bedside. Patient-identifying data are not included. We retrospectively reviewed all ICU safety reported events over a 4-year period (2 years prior/2 years after glass door implementation) for specific handover communication-related errors and compared the 2 cohorts.Results: Information on the glass doors is entered daily on rounds by all services. Prior to implementation, 7.96% of reported errors were related to patient handover communication errors. The post glass-door era had 4.26% of reported errors related to patient handover communication errors with a relative risk reduction of 46.5%. Due to its usefulness, this method of communication was quickly adopted by the other critical care services (cardiothoracic, medical, neurology/neurosurgery, cardiology) at our institution and is now used for over 150 ICU beds.Conclusions: Our glass door patient handover tool is an easily adaptable intervention that has improved communication leading to an overall decrease in the number of handover communication errors.

TI  - Determining the Pixel-to-Pixel Uncertainty in Satellite-Derived SST Fields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary measure of the quality of sea surface temperature (SST) fields obtained from satellite-borne infrared sensors has been the bias and variance of matchups with co-located in-situ values. Because such matchups tend to be widely separated, these bias and variance estimates are not necessarily a good measure of small scale (several pixels) gradients in these fields because one of the primary contributors to the uncertainty in satellite retrievals is atmospheric contamination, which tends to have large spatial scales compared with the pixel separation of infrared sensors. Hence, there is not a good measure to use in selecting SST fields appropriate for the study of submesoscale processes and, in particular, of processes associated with near-surface fronts, both of which have recently seen a rapid increase in interest. In this study, two methods are examined to address this problem, one based on spectra of the SST data and the other on their variograms. To evaluate the methods, instrument noise was estimated in Level-2 Visible-Infrared Imager-Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST fields of the Sargasso Sea. The two methods provided very nearly identical results for AVHRR: along-scan values of approximately 0.18 K for both day and night and along-track values of 0.21 K for day and night. By contrast, the instrument noise estimated for VIIRS varied by method, scan geometry and day-night. Specifically, daytime, along-scan (along-track), spectral estimates were found to be approximately 0.05 K (0.08 K) and the corresponding nighttime values of 0.02 K (0.03 K). Daytime estimates based on the variogram were found to be 0.08 K (0.10 K) with the corresponding nighttime values of 0.04 K (0.06 K). Taken together, AVHRR instrument noise is significantly larger than VIIRS instrument noise, along-track noise is larger than along-scan noise and daytime levels are higher than nighttime levels. Given the similarity of results and the less stringent preprocessing requirements, the variogram is the preferred method, although there is a suggestion that this approach overestimates the noise for high quality data in dynamically quiet regions. Finally, simulations of the impact of noise on the determination of SST gradients show that on average the gradient magnitude for typical ocean gradients will be accurately estimated with VIIRS but substantially overestimated with AVHRR.

TI  - An integrated assessment of urban flooding mitigation strategies for robust decision making
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to mitigate urban flooding, an integrated assessment has been proposed to identify the optimum drainage solution which implements the potential green infrastructure with the existing conventional gray infrastructure. The integrated evaluation framework which consists the data of remote sensing and geographic information system, and the assessments of 2D hydrologic simulation and life cycle cost has been applied into a developed area in Shanghai under nine design storms with different return periods and durations. The results showed that increasing the pipe diameter at this area could alleviate the node flooding and pipe hydraulic load under a short return period and rainfall duration. However, according to the integrated evaluation, the potential flooding risk under a longer rainfall duration could be well controlled by implementing a combination of low impact development practices of Rain Barrel (RB) + Pervious Concrete (PC) + Green Roof (GR).

TI  - Development of a fine-scale discomfort index map and its application in measuring living environments using remotely-sensed thermal infrared imagery
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The discomfort index (DI) is an important indicator that measures the human heat sensation for different climate conditions. Currently, DI of a city is usually calculated using data from a single or a few weather stations and hence does not accurately represent various thermal discomfort states of the whole city. In addition, because the result of existing DI is just a single numeric value, it does not reveal the spatial variation of thermal discomfort levels and thus is unable to represent actual living environment conditions. This greatly limits the DI application. Taking Fuzhou of southeastern China as an example, this paper proposes a technique to produce a fine-scale DI map by combining a sharpened Landsat thermal infrared image with in-situ measured meteorological data. The DI map clearly reveals the spatial details of DI in different locations of the city. It provides quantitative characterization of the living environment of each DI level based on a 3-graded DI map. This greatly expands the application range of the index. The quantitative analysis results show that the area of high building density substantially increases outdoor human thermal discomfort sensation, while high vegetation and water covers reduce the discomfort sensation. The impact of built surface to human discomfort sensation is near two times more than those of vegetation and water in the Fuzhou case. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-Frame Super-Resolution of Gaofen-4 Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-4 is China's first geosynchronous orbit high-definition optical imaging satellite with extremely high temporal resolution. The features of staring imaging and high temporal resolution enable the super-resolution of multiple images of the same scene. In this paper, we propose a super-resolution (SR) technique to reconstruct a higher-resolution image from multiple low-resolution (LR) satellite images. The method first performs image registration in both the spatial and range domains. Then the point spread function (PSF) of LR images is parameterized by a Gaussian function and estimated by a blind deconvolution algorithm based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP). Finally, the high-resolution (HR) image is reconstructed by a MAP-based SR algorithm. The MAP cost function includes a data fidelity term and a regularized term. The data fidelity term is in the L-2 norm, and the regularized term employs the Huber-Markov prior which can reduce the noise and artifacts while preserving the image edges. Experiments with real Gaofen-4 images show that the reconstructed images are sharper and contain more details than Google Earth ones.

TI  - Urban Impervious Surfaces Estimation From Optical and SAR Imagery: A Comprehensive Comparison
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits of fusing optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for urban impervious surfaces estimation. Given the increasing availability of SAR satellite data, the synergized use of optical and SAR data is increasingly important. However, previous studies have focused primarily on a single scale. This study aims to evaluate the impervious surfaces estimation using different combinations of optical and SAR data, as well as to quantify the scale effects of combining optical and SAR data under various resolutions from 30 to 1050 m. Six combinations of optical and SAR data in three cities, Shenzhen, Mumbai, and Sao Paulo, were compared. Experimental results illustrated the effectiveness of using texture and SAR data in improving impervious surface estimation with producer's accuracy improvement of 5%, 0%, and 4% in Shenzhen, Mumbai, and Sao Paulo at 30 m. The correlation coefficient assessment between the estimated and referenced impervious surfaces at various scales demonstrated that TerraSAR-X data generally outperformed ENVISAT advanced SAR of impervious surface estimation. Estimation accuracy of impervious surfaces in Shenzhen had an improvement of 4% to 5%. Moreover, the texture information of SAR data was observed to provide positive contributions to the impervious surfaces estimation in three study cases at different scales.

TI  - Tectonic and Anthropogenic Deformation at the Cerro Prieto Geothermal Step-Over Revealed by Sentinel-1A InSAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerro Prieto geothermal field (CPGF) lies at the step-over between the imperial and the Cerro Prieto faults in northern Baja California, Mexico. While tectonically this is the most active section of the southern San Andreas Fault system, the spatial and temporal deformation in the area is poorly resolved by the sparse global positioning system (GPS) network coverage. Moreover, interferograms from satellite observations spanning more than a few months are decorrelated due to the extensive agricultural activity in this region. Here we investigate the use of frequent, short temporal baseline interferograms offered by the new Sentinel-1A satellite to recover two components of deformation time series across these faults. Following previous studies, we developed a purely geometric approach for image alignment that achieves better than 1/200 pixel alignment needed for accurate phase recovery. We construct interferometric synthetic aperture radar time series using a coherence-based small baseline subset method with atmospheric corrections by means of common-point stacking. We did not apply enhanced spectral diversity because the burst discontinuities are generally small (<1.4 mm) and can be effectively captured during the atmospheric corrections. With these algorithms, the subsidence at CPGF is clearly resolved. The maximum subsidence rate of 160 mm/yr, due to extraction of geothermal fluids and heat, dominates the similar to 40 mm/yr deformation across the proximal ends of the imperial, the Cerro Prieto, and the indiviso faults.

TI  - Long-time series aerosol optical depth retrieval from AVHRR data over land in North China and Central Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for the retrieval of the aerosol optical depth over land (ADL) using radiances at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) measured by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is proposed. AVHRR is the only satellite sensor providing nearly continuous global coverage since June 1979, which could generate the longest aerosol climate data records currently available from operational satellites. In the implementation of the ADL algorithm, an analytical model is used which couples an atmospheric radiative transfer model and a land surface reflectance parameterization. The radiation field can be separated into three parts: direct radiance, single scattered radiance, and multiple-scattered. Each of these parts is individually parameterized. To obtain the surface reflectance in an automatic retrieval procedure over land for AVHRR, the aerosol scattering effect at 3.75 gm was assumed to be negligible and relationships between the surface reflectances at 0.64 mu m and 3.75 mu m were evaluated for different surface types and the authors propose to use these to obtain the surface reflectance at the shorter wavelength. The 0.64 mu m surface reflectance was then used in a radiative transfer model to compute AOD at that wavelength using six different aerosol types, where optimal estimation (OE) theory is applied to minimize the difference between modeled and measured radiances.The ADL algorithm is applied to re-calibrated Level 1B radiances from the AVHRRs on-board the TIROS-N and the Metop-B satellites to retrieve the AOD over North China and Central Europe. The results show that the AOD retrieved from these two instruments are in agreement with co-located AOD values from ground-based reference networks. Over North China, using AERONET sites, 58% of the ADLAOD values are within an expected error (EE) range of +/-(0.05 + 20%) and 53% are within the EE range of +/-(0.05 + 15%). For GAW-PFR (World Meteorological Organization, WMO, Global Atmosphere Watch, GAW) sites, part of the European ACTRIS (Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure) sites, 79% of the ADL AOD values are within the EE range of +/-(0.05 + 20%) and 75% are within the EE range of +/-(0.05 + 15%). Not surprisingly, the agreement is better over Europe with generally lower AOD values. An additional cross comparison of the AOD results with MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) DeepBlue aerosol products shows that the spatial distributions of the two AOD datasets are similar, but with generally lower values for ADL and lower coverage. The temporal variation of the annual mean AOD over selected AERONET sites shows that ADL values are generally between 0.2 and 0.5 over North-Eastem China and trace the MODIS and AERONET data for the overlapping years quite well.

TI  - A Satellite-Based Assessment of the Distribution and Biomass of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in the Optically Shallow Basin of Lake Biwa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the abundance of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), particularly in shallow lakes, is essential for effective lake management activities. In the present study we applied satellite remote sensing (a Landsat-8 image) in order to evaluate the SAV coverage area and its biomass for the peak growth period, which is mainly in September or October (2013 to 2016), in the eutrophic and shallow south basin of Lake Biwa. We developed and validated a satellite-based water transparency retrieval algorithm based on the linear regression approach (R-2 = 0.77) to determine the water clarity (2013-2016), which was later used for SAV classification and biomass estimation. For SAV classification, we used Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA), a Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and a binary decision tree, giving an overall classification accuracy of 86.5% and SAV classification accuracy of 76.5% (SAV kappa coefficient 0.74), based on in situ measurements. For biomass estimation, a new Spectral Decomposition Algorithm was developed. The satellite-derived biomass (R-2 = 0.79) for the SAV classified area gives an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.26 kg dry weight (DW) m(-2). The mapped SAV coverage area was 20% and 40% in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Estimated SAV biomass for the mapped area shows an increase in recent years, with values of 3390 t (tons, dry weight) in 2013 as compared to 4550 t in 2016. The maximum biomass density (4.89 kg DW m(-2)) was obtained for a year with high water transparency (September 2014). With the change in water clarity, a slow change in SAV growth was noted from 2013 to 2016. The study shows that water clarity is important for the SAV detection and biomass estimation using satellite remote sensing in shallow eutrophic lakes. The present study also demonstrates the successful application of the developed satellite-based approach for SAV biomass estimation in the shallow eutrophic lake, which can be tested in other lakes.

M3  - Review
AB  - Post Syntax Trial, 'Heart Team' Concept has been ensconsed class I recommendation in both the European and ACC/AHA guidelines and has gained increasing traction in context of complex and multi modality procedures. Despite an arrray of advantages including the much touted - 'the patient is central', there are a plethora of un-addressed issues, some of which sentinel to our country, which threaten to make the 'Heart Team' concept a perfunctory exercise. As it stands today, 'Heart Team' is more of a fictional euphemism, a kind of 'Platonic Illusion' rather than a pragmatic reality.

TI  - A Comparison of Dye Versus Fluorescence Methods for Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel nodes (SNs) have been observed in several reports from Japan and overseas in cases with endometrial cancer; however, no consensus has been reached regarding the types of tracers or the method of their injection. A combination of the radioisotope (RI) and dye method is considered to be desirable. We assessed SN mapping using either dye or near-infrared fluorescence imaging to clarify a suitable method in cases of endometrial cancer.Methods Patients were enrolled from 92 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer and having no extrauterine metastasis by the preoperative imaging between 2009 and 2014 at our institution. To identify the SNs, we performed 3 methods using either dye or fluorescence solutions in conjunction with a RI method. In the dye method, we injected indocyanine green in the uterine subserosa, visually identifying SNs as stained green. In the fluorescence method, a dilute indocyanine green solution (0.5 mg, fluorescence A or 0.25 mg, fluorescence B, each per 10 mL of solvent) was injected and the SN identified by the HyperEye Medical System.Results The SN detection rates were 100%, 100%, and 96% using dye and fluorescence A or B solution, respectively. Pelvic SNs were detected by the 3 methods in 98%, 100%, and 96% of cases and para-aortic SNs in 65%, 88%, and 74%, respectively. Fluorescence A solution was somewhat better than dye in detecting para-aortic SNs, although not significantly so (P = 0.07). The sensitivity and negative predictive values for detecting SNs with metastases with the dye method were 92% and 98% compared with 100% and 100%, respectively, for both fluorescence solutions.Conclusions Although both dye and fluorescence methods performed well, no method perfectly identified para-aortic SNs. The concomitant use of the RI method is required to detect para-aortic SNs.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To investigate the etiological agents of the outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Minhang District of Shanghai from 2009 to 2016, and to provide evidence for the prevention and management policy of HFMD by collecting suspected HFMD samples for laboratory testing from HFMD sentinel hospitals,the Children's Hospitals of Fudan University and jurisdiction community health service centers. Methods Specimens including stools, throat swabs and anal swabs were collected from patients suspected of HFMD from surveillance hospitals, i. e., Children's Hospital of Fudan University and jurisdiction community health service centers during 2009 and 2016. The specimens were detected by real-time RT-PCR with the five types of viruses including panenterovirus (EV), enterovirus 71 (EV71), Coxsackie virus A16 (CVA16), Coxsackie virus A6(CVA6) and Coxsackie virus A10 (CVA10). The distribution characteristics of pathogens were analyzed. Results During 2009 and 2016 we collected 3 744 cases of HFMD, the positive detection rate of pan-enterovirus were 84. 83% (3 176 cases), including EV71 (64. 45%) and CVA16 (15. 77%), then were CVA6 (9. 23%) and other EV (8. 78%), and CVA10 was only 0. 76%. The major etiological agent was EV71. The advantage of different years and different season strain presented dynamic change, mainly EV71 and CVAI6 co-popular in 2009, mainly EV71 epidemic from 2010 to 2011, EV71 and CVA16 were co-popular again in 2012,and the priority was EV71, then EV71 and other EV were co-popular in 2013. After 2014, CVA6 gradually increased, mainly CVA6 was popular 2015 and 2016, especially in 2016, the proportion of CVA6 ranged as high as 40. 55%. CVA10 showed sporadic distribution trend in very low proportion. From the difference of age and gender in HFMD cases,the males were more than the females (1. 68 :1), and the incidence was the highest in children of 1 - 3 years old. The peak of incidence occured in April to July, then in September to November. Conclusions HFMD onset seasons mainly were summer and fall-and-winter in bimodal popular models. It happens in children under 5 years of age. The incidence was higher in male than in female. The advantage of different years and different season strains present dynamic change, and the prevalence has obvious age and season limit.

TI  - Estimation of leaf area index and its sunlit portion from DSCOVR EPIC data: Theoretical basis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the theoretical basis of the algorithm designed for the generation of leaf area index and diurnal course of its sunlit portion from NASA's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard NOAA's Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). The Look-up-Table (LUT) approach implemented in the MODIS operational LAI/FPAR algorithm is adopted. The LUT, which is the heart of the approach, has been significantly modified. First, its parameterization incorporates the canopy hot spot phenomenon and recent advances in the theory of canopy spectral invariants. This allows more accurate decoupling of the structural and radiometric components of the measured Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF), improves scaling properties of the LUT and consequently simplifies adjustments of the algorithm for data spatial resolution and spectral band compositions. Second, the stochastic radiative transfer equations are used to generate the LUT for all biome types. The equations naturally account for radiative effects of the three-dimensional canopy structure on the BRF and allow for an accurate discrimination between sunlit and shaded leaf areas. Third, the LUT entries are measurable, i.e., they can be independently derived from both below canopy measurements of the transmitted and above canopy measurements of reflected radiation fields. This feature makes possible direct validation of the LUT, facilitates identification of its deficiencies and development of refinements. Analyses of field data on canopy structure and leaf optics collected at 18 sites in the Hyytiala forest in southern boreal zone in Finland and hyperspectral images acquired by the EO-1 Hyperion sensor support the theoretical basis.

TI  - A study on retrieving chlorophyll concentration by using GF-4 data
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofeng-4 products have become available since June 2016. GF-4 is the first geosynchronous orbit remote sensing satellite in China. The virtue of the satellite is its high spatial and temporal resolution. So, the satellite is useful for monitoring marine disasters. In this study, we established a model to retrieve the chlorophyll concentration from GF-4 satellite data based on the in situ measured data on 22th October 2009 (the coefficient of determination r(2)= 0.90; root mean square error RMSE=0.1). The algorithm has been shown to have a relatively better applicability by comparing the result with Hydrolight (r(2)=0.92; RMSE=0.23). The model was further applied to analyze the harmful algal bloom in Guangxi in May 2016 by using GF-4 satellite data. The result showed a good agreement with the in situ survey data. This is the first time to retrieve chlorophyll concentration from the remote sensing reflectance, including the harmful algal bloom waters in Guangxi by using GF-4 products. The research can provide an effective technique for constructing marine civilization and marine disaster investigation.

TI  - Range-wide evaluation of wildlife habitat change: A demonstration using Giant Pandas
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on wildlife habitat distribution and change is crucial for the design and evaluation of conservation efforts. While habitat distribution has been evaluated for many species, information on habitat change is often unclear, particularly across entire geographic ranges. Here we use the iconic giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) as a model species and present an advanced approach to evaluate its habitat change across an entire geographic range through the integration of time-series satellite imagery and field data. Our results show that despite a few areas showing habitat degradation, both the overall habitat suitability and habitat area increased between the early 2000s and the early 2010s. Our results also indicate that conservation efforts in China have achieved success beyond the boundaries of nature reserves, since panda habitat outside nature reserves shows a higher proportional growth than inside the reserves. Despite these promising trends, we found habitat fragmentation remains a threat to the species' long-term survival. These results provide valuable information to assess the appropriateness of recent decision by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that down-listed the giant panda from endangered to vulnerable species, while laying a good foundation for the design of future conservation efforts. The approach described here may also be easily implemented for evaluating range-wide habitat change for many other species around the world and thus help achieve biodiversity conservation objectives such as those set by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Recent dynamics of alpine lakes on the endorheic Changtang Plateau from multi-mission satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of the alpine lakes on the endorheic Changtang Plateau is vitally important in understanding climate impacts on hydrological cycle. Existing studies have revealed an accelerated lake expansion on the Changtang Plateau during the 2000s compared with prior decades. However, the partial hiatus of recent Landsat archive affected the continuation of understanding the lake changes in the recent decade. Here we synergistically used imagery from Landsat and Huanjing satellites to enable a detailed monitoring of lake area dynamics on the Changtang Plateau. Our results present that lakes on the Changtang Plateau continued to expand at a rapid rate of 340.79 km(2) yr(-1) (1.06% yr(-1), p < 0.05) from 2009 to 2014. Changes in endorheic (terminal) lakes contribute to 98% of the net expansion, suggesting that monitoring endorheic lake dynamics is of critical importance for understanding climate changes. Meanwhile, changes in saline lakes, which are mostly endorheic, account for 96% of the net expansion, implying that the proportion of freshwater storage on the Changtang Plateau is likely in decline. Rapid expansion occurred in both glacier-fed and non-glacier-fed lakes, with a rate of 224.94 km(2) yr(-1) (0.92% yr(-1), p < 0.05) and 115.85 km(2) yr(-1) (1.47% yr(-1), p = 0.08), respectively, indicating that glacier retreat alone may not fully explain the recent lake expansion. Intra-annual variations of the selected 24 large lakes fluctuated within 0.22-2.46% (in coefficient of variation) for glacier-fed lakes and 0.17-236% for non glacier-fed lakes. Most of these lakes expanded during the unfrozen period (from May/june to October) and reached to their maximum extents in September or October. By spatially associating our revealed lake changes with climate variables, we observed that the recent lake expansion is more related to precipitation than to temperature, although future efforts are needed for a more comprehensive picture of the lake changing mechanisms.

TI  - A Long-Term Vegetation Recovery Estimation for Mt. Jou-Jou Using Multi-Date SPOT 1, 2, and 4 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation recovery monitoring is critical for assessing denudation areas after landslides have occurred. A long-term and broad area investigation using remote sensing techniques is an efficient and cost-effective approach incorporating the consideration of radiometric correction and seasonality variations across multi-date satellite images. This paper investigates long-term vegetation recovery using 14 SPOT satellite images spanning from 1999 to 2011 over the landslide area of Mt. Jou-Jou in central Taiwan, which was caused by the Chi-Chi earthquake in 1999. The vegetation status was evaluated by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with radiometric correction between multi-date images based on pseudoinvariant features, and subsequently a vegetation recovery rate (VRR) model was empirically established after seasonality adjustment was performed on the multi-date NDVI images. An increasing tendency of the vegetation recovery in the landslide area of Mt. Jou-Jou appeared based on the NDVI value rising to 0.367 in March 2011 from -0.044 right after the catastrophic earthquake. The vegetation recovery rate with seasonality adjustment approached 81.5% for the total area and 81.3% for the landslide area through 12 years succession. The seasonality adjustment also enhanced the VRR model with a determination coefficient that increased from 0.883 to 0.916 for the landslide area and from 0.584 to 0.915 for the total area, highlighting the necessity of seasonality adjustment in multi-date vegetation observations using satellite images. Furthermore, the association between precipitation and NDVI was discussed, and the inverse relationship with the reoccurrence of high-intensity short-duration rainfall and yearly heavy rainfall was observed, in agreement with the on-site investigation.

TI  - Types and characteristics of slow-moving slope geo-hazards recognized by TS-InSAR along Xianshuihe active fault in the eastern Tibet Plateau
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Displacement for a long time is an important clue to recognize slow-moving slope geo-hazards (SMSGH). And active fault zones in Tibet Plateau are usually the regions developing serious SMSGHs because of rugged terrain, strong tectonic movement, frequent earthquakes and cracked rock masses, etc. Taking the persistent active Xianshuihe Fault (XSF) zone in the eastern Tibet Plateau as study area, this paper carries out time series InSAR observation using 18 periods of L-band ALOS/PALSAR datasets acquired from December, 2006 to September, 2010, gain millimetric-scale ground velocity. Furthermore, combining InSAR velocity with works of field investigation, optical remote sensing interpretation and geological setting analysis, we recognize 394 SMSGHs and gain some understanding of SMSGHs in types, deformation and spatial distribution. Firstly, creep landslide, debris flow and slow-moving moraine are three main types of SMSGH. Secondly, most paleo-landslides, co-seismic landslides and cracked unstable slopes distribute alone the northern section of XSF, and the majority of landslides intersecting with XSF is obviously movable and others are stable or of smaller movement. Thirdly, in the areas of debris flow source, the slow and disperse deformation commonly develop, which can be taken as the clue to identify debris flow; and two types of debris flow sources, "earth-forest" and "loose deposition," are found. Finally, moraine in hanging glacier valley above 4200 m a.s.l. exists extensively, with huge body and fast dislocation, which is the majority surface erosion type nowadays in this uplifting plateau. The study results also indicate that the combination of InSAR displacement and geological setting analysis can recognize SMSGHs efficiently and effectively, being suitable for mountainous and inaccessible area as this study.

TI  - Satellite-based rainfall estimation and discharge measurement of Middle Indus River, Pakistan
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of floods and droughts are intensified by climate change, lack of preparedness, and coordination. The average rainfall in study area is ranging from 200 to 400 mm per year. Rain gauge generally provides very accurate measurement of point rain rates and the amounts of rainfall but due to scarcity of the gauge locations provides very general information of the area on regional scale. Recognizing these practical limitations, it is essential to use remote sensing techniques for measuring the quantity of rainfall in the Middle Indus. In this research, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) estimation can be used as a proxy for the magnitude of rainfall estimates from classical methods (rain gauge), quantity, and its spatial distribution for Middle Indus river basin. In order to use TRMM satellite data for discharge measurement, its accuracy is determined by statistically comparing it with in situ gauged data on daily and monthly bases. The daily R-2 value (0.42) is significantly lower than monthly R-2 value (0.82), probably due to the time of summation of TRMM 3-hourly precipitation data into daily estimates. Daily TRMM data from 2003 to 2012 was used as input forcing in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model along with other input parameters. The calibration and validation results of SWAT model give R-2 = 0.72 and 0.73 and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency = 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. Daily and monthly comparison graphs are generated on the basis of model discharge output and observed data.

TI  - Impact of biomass fires on tropospheric nitrogen dioxide in South and Southeast Asia for the years from 2005 to 2014
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide is a prominent air pollutant effecting public health, mainly formed by anthropogenic activities and biomass fires. To assess the impact of biomass fires on nitrogen dioxide, recent studies have analyzed the relationship between nitrogen dioxide and fires in relatively sparsely populated areas, avoiding the uncertainty of assessment caused by human activities. However, it is necessary to further investigate the relationship between nitrogen dioxide and fires in densely populated areas, which requires considering an appropriate way to distinguish between nitrogen dioxide from biomass fires and nitrogen dioxide from anthropogenic activities (e.g., industry). In this study, a new approach is proposed and applied to estimate the impact of biomass fires on tropospheric nitrogen dioxide in South and Southeast Asia, which has a high population density and is undergoing through the process of industrialization. We conducted ten year analysis of correlation (from 2005 to 2014) between nitrogen dioxide and fires, and further estimated the impacts of winter and summer monsoon on the correlation. The analysis indicates a high efficiency and reliability of this approach in presenting correlation between nitrogen dioxide and fire and demonstrates a strong monsoon impact on the correlation. Moreover, we concluded that the correlation is influenced by land use and local industrialization level as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Circumpolar arctic tundra biomass and productivity dynamics in response to projected climate change and herbivory
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data have indicated a general 'greening' trend in the arctic tundra biome. However, the observed changes based on remote sensing are the result of multiple environmental drivers, and the effects of individual controls such as warming, herbivory, and other disturbances on changes in vegetation biomass, community structure, and ecosystem function remain unclear. We apply ArcVeg, an arctic tundra vegetation dynamics model, to estimate potential changes in vegetation biomass and net primary production (NPP) at the plant community and functional type levels. ArcVeg is driven by soil nitrogen output from the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model, existing densities of Rangifer populations, and projected summer temperature changes by the NCAR CCSM4.0 general circulation model across the Arctic. We quantified the changes in aboveground biomass and NPP resulting from (i) observed herbivory only; (ii) projected climate change only; and (iii) coupled effects of projected climate change and herbivory. We evaluated model outputs of the absolute and relative differences in biomass and NPP by country, bioclimate subzone, and floristic province. Estimated potential biomass increases resulting from temperature increase only are approximately 5% greater than the biomass modeled due to coupled warming and herbivory. Such potential increases are greater in areas currently occupied by large or dense Rangifer herds such as the Nenets-occupied regions in Russia (27% greater vegetation increase without herbivores). In addition, herbivory modulates shifts in plant community structure caused by warming. Plant functional types such as shrubs and mosses were affected to a greater degree than other functional types by either warming or herbivory or coupled effects of the two.

TI  - A fuzzy logic approach to analyse the suitability of nesting habitat for greater sage-grouse in western Wyoming
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Habitat suitability analysis is complex and requires integration of multiple attributes at a range of spatial scales. We use fine- and broad-scale variables within a spatial modelling framework to determine the suitability of greater sage-grouse nesting habitat using fuzzy logic. Fuzzy theory allows for a landscape component to have full, partial, or no membership in a particular management target. We used seven biophysical and anthropogenic variables correlated with nest site locations to build the fuzzy model. Using field and remotely sensed data and expert opinion, we developed fuzzy functions to define numerical membership values describing relationships between landscape characteristics and nesting habitat suitability. We used a fuzzy gamma overlay function to define five suitability classes in the resulting habitat map. Using a fuzzy logic model, we were able to spatially distinguish the suitability of nesting habitat using fine- and broad-scale attributes and characterise the uncertainty of the habitat model.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: A Clinical Review and Update
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become a standard staging tool in the surgical management of breast cancer. The positive impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy on postoperative negative outcomes in breast cancer patients, without compromising the oncological outcomes, is its major advantage. It has evolved over the last few decades and has proven its utility beyond early breast cancer. Its applicability and efficacy in patients with clinically positive axilla who have had a complete clinical response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is being aggressively evaluated at present. This article discusses how sentinel lymph node biopsy has evolved and is becoming a useful tool in new clinical scenarios of breast cancer management.

TI  - Estimating Particulate Matter using satellite based aerosol optical depth and meteorological variables in Malaysia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The insufficient number of ground-based stations for measuring Particulate Matter < 10 mu m (PM10) in the developing countries hinders PM10 monitoring at a regional scale. The present study aims to develop empirical models for PM10 estimation from space over Malaysia using aerosol optical depth (AOD(550)) and meteorological (surface temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric stability) data (retrieved or estimated) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) during the period 2007-2011. The MODIS retrievals are found to be satisfactorily correlated with ground-based measurements at Malaysia. Multiple linear regressions (MLR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques are utilized to develop the empirical models for PM10 estimation. The model development and training are performed via comparison with measured PM10 at 29 stations over Malaysia and reveal that the ANN provides slightly higher accuracy with R-2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 11.61 mu g m(-3) compared to the MLR method (R-2 = 0.66 and RMSE = 12.39 mu g m(-3)). Stepwise regression analysis performed on the MLR method reveals that the MODIS AOD(550) is the most important parameter for PM10 estimations (R-2 = 0.59 and RMSE = 13.61 mu g m-3); however, the inclusion of the meteorological parameters in the MLR increases the accuracy of the retrievals (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 12.39 mu g m-3). The estimated PM10 concentrations are finally validated against surface measurements at 16 stations resulting in similar performance from the ANN model (R-2 = 0.58, RMSE = 10.16 mu g m(-3)) and MLR technique (R-2 = 0.56, RMSE = 10.58 mu g m(-3)). The significant accuracy that has been attained in PM10 estimations from space allows us to assess the pollution levels in Malaysia and map the PM10 distribution at large spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Recognizing methods for epicenter-neighboring orbits with ionospheric information from DEMETER satellite data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the temporal and spatial restriction of existing approaches, a recognizing method focuses on all strong seismic activities in globe during the lifecycle of DEMETER (Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions) is proposed for epicenter-neighboring orbits from the point of view of the Fourth Paradigm. Satellite orbits are regarded as the analyzing objects to reduce the unbalance between the quantity of non-seismic and abnormal data. Two criteria, alpha(3) and (alpha(4) are put forward to quantify the asymmetry and stability of ionospheric parameters along the orbit and t location-scale distribution is carried out to fit the quantitative indicators. Moreover, during the distribution fitting, the probable cause of two typical types of exceptions are analyzed and explained. In order to determine which magnitude the abnormal alpha(3) and alpha(4) are caused by, suitable pairs of thresholds are calculated by means of dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. Finally, three groups of experiments are applied to validate the effectiveness of this method. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - [A new perspective on axillary dissection in situations of metastatic sentinel node].
T2  - Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease in women and represents a worldwide problem. Up-to-date diagnostics methods, mammography screening and complex treatments have resulted in a substantial reduction of mortality rates. However, the incidence of the disease keeps growing constantly, although in a moderate way. The struggle against this disease has several levels, such as prevention, primary tumour therapy as well as the management of recurrent or generalized disease. Therefore, it is very significant to evaluate the prognosis on the basis of biological characteristics of the tumour and to determine the right individual therapy in each patient.AIM OF THE STUDY: Our aim was to determine a group of patients with malignant breast disease based on biological characteristics of the tumour who can be treated without axillary exenteration even with a metastasis in the sentinel lymph node, thereby reducing the morbidity associated with this surgery, without worsening the prognosis.METHOD: The research project lasted from June 2012 to June 2015. It was a prospective randomized study where the main investigated group consisted of women with primarily surgically treated mammary cancer undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) during their surgery. These patients were divided into three groups: group 1 - positive SNB without axillary exenteration (axillary dissection - AD); group 2 - positive SNB with AD; and group 3 - negative SNB. Group 4 consisted of patients with primarily performed AD. We investigated statistically significant prognostic factors of metastatic lymph nodes and early disease progression. The results were statistically processed and differences between individual groups were evaluated, determining prognostically usable biological characteristics of the tumour in connection with metastases in lymph nodes and progression-free survival.RESULTS: The study included 214 patients with breast cancer. No metastases of axillary lymph nodes were found in 136 patients (64%); on the other hand, 78 patients (36%) had positive axillary lymph nodes and included: 28 (13%) patients with a micrometastasis in the sentinel lymph node; 38 (17%) patients with 13 positive lymph nodes; 8 (4%) patients with 49 positive lymph nodes; and 4 (2%) patients had more than 10 metastatic lymph nodes. A statistically significant difference with respect to metastatic lymph node involvement was found for the tumour size, expression of oestrogen receptors, proliferative activity and grading.CONCLUSION: The following prognostic factors of metastatic lymph nodes and early disease progression were shown to be statistically significant: tumour size over 2 cm, negative expression of oestrogen receptors, tumours with moderate and high proliferative activity, and tumour grades G2 and G3. In the course of the three years of this study, no regional recurrence was found in axillary lymph nodes in any patient, and therefore, it clearly follows that the completion of axillary exenteration can be omitted in the case of tumour sizes below 2 cm, present expression of oestrogen receptors, low proliferative activity and grade 1 even if one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes are present, provided that adjuvant radiation therapy can be used. Also, axillary exenteration is not needed if a micrometastasis or isolated tumour cells are found in the sentinel lymph node.Key words: breast cancer - sentinel lymph node biopsy - axillary exenteration - prognostic factors.

TI  - Methane emissions from global wetlands: An assessment of the uncertainty associated with various wetland extent data sets
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A wide range of estimates on global wetland methane (CH4) fluxes has been reported during the recent two decades. This gives rise to urgent needs to clarify and identify the uncertainty sources, and conclude a reconciled estimate for global CH4 fluxes from wetlands. Most estimates by using bottom-up approach rely on wetland data sets, but these data sets show largely inconsistent in terms of both wetland extent and spatiotemporal. distribution. A quantitative assessment of uncertainties associated with these discrepancies among wetland data sets has not been well investigated yet. By comparing the five widely used global wetland data sets (GISS, GLWD, Kaplan, GIEMS and SWAMPS-GLWD), it this study, we found large differences in the wetland extent, ranging from 5.3 to 10.2 million km(2), as well as their spatial and temporal distributions among the five data sets. These discrepancies in wetland data sets resulted in large bias in model-estimated global wetland CH4 emissions as simulated by using the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM). The model simulations indicated that the mean global wetland CH4 emissions during 2000-2007 were 177.2 +/- 49.7 Tg CH4 yr(-1), based on the five different data sets. The tropical regions contributed the largest portion of estimated CH4 emissions from global wetlands, but also had the largest discrepancy. Among six continents, the largest uncertainty was found in South America. Thus, the improved estimates of wetland extent and CH4 emissions in the tropical regions and South America would be a critical step toward an accurate estimate of global CH4 emissions. This uncertainty analysis also reveals an important need for our scientific community to generate a global scale wetland data set with higher spatial resolution and shorter time interval, by integrating multiple sources of field and satellite data with modeling approaches, for cross-scale extrapolation.

TI  - Modeling NDVI Using Joint Entropy Method Considering Hydro-Meteorological Driving Factors in the Middle Reaches of Hei River Basin
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial vegetation dynamics are closely influenced by both hydrological process and climate change. This study investigated the relationships between vegetation pattern and hydro-meteorological elements. The joint entropy method was employed to evaluate the dependence between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and coupled variables in the middle reaches of the Hei River basin. Based on the spatial distribution of mutual information, the whole study area was divided into five sub-regions. In each sub-region, nested statistical models were applied to model the NDVI on the grid and regional scales, respectively. Results showed that the annual average NDVI increased at a rate of 0.005/a over the past 11 years. In the desert regions, the NDVI increased significantly with an increase in precipitation and temperature, and a high accuracy of retrieving NDVI model was obtained by coupling precipitation and temperature, especially in sub-region I. In the oasis regions, groundwater was also an important factor driving vegetation growth, and the rise of the groundwater level contributed to the growth of vegetation. However, the relationship was weaker in artificial oasis regions (sub-region III and sub-region V) due to the influence of human activities such as irrigation. The overall correlation coefficient between the observed NDVI and modeled NDVI was observed to be 0.97. The outcomes of this study are suitable for ecosystem monitoring, especially in the realm of climate change. Further studies are necessary and should consider more factors, such as runoff and irrigation.

TI  - Biophysical response of young pomegranate trees to surface and sub-surface drip irrigation and deficit irrigation
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to recurring agricultural water shortages, many farmers are looking for crops such as pomegranate that have both some degree of drought resistance and a higher economic value. To manage limited water effectively, it is necessary to know how pomegranate trees respond to varying levels of applied water and the type of irrigation system used. This study was conducted in experimental orchards located at the University of California Kearney Agricultural Research and Extension (UC KARE) Center and the USDA-ARS San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center in Parlier, California. The impact of surface drip (DI) and subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) at the UC KARE orchard and irrigation levels (35, 50, 75, 100% of crop water use) at the USDA-ARS orchard on tree canopy size [fractional canopy ground cover (f(c)), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference infrared index (NDII)], canopy-to-air temperature difference, and fruit yield was determined during the 2012-2014 growing seasons. There was no difference in tree canopy size between the DI and SDI systems at the UC KARE site; but trees under SDI produced larger fruit in 2013 and higher yield whilst saving about 10% of water application. The difference in water application highlights an advantage of SDI over DI systems to conserve water without creating negative impacts on tree size or yield. At the USDA-ARS site, the 35 and 50% irrigation treatments significantly reduced tree canopy size in 2013 and 2014, compared to the 75 and 100% irrigation treatments. In 2014, trees irrigated with 75% of crop water use produced more yield than trees irrigated at 35% of crop water use. Furthermore, NDVI and NDII were correlated to f(c). The relationships between NDVI to f(c) and f(c) to pomegranate crop coefficient were established. The derived crop coefficient from ground-based remotely sensed data may potentially be used as a tool by farmers and water managers to estimate pomegranate tree water use on a field or regional scale using aerial or satellite imagery.

TI  - Seasonal parasitism and host specificity of <i>Trissolcus japonicus</i> in northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal), native to China, Japan, and Korea, has emerged as a harmful invasive pest of a variety of crops in North America and Europe. The Asian egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus has been identified as the most promising agent for classical biological control of invasive H. halys populations. A 4-year study evaluated the fundamental and ecological host ranges of T. japonicus as well as its phenology and impact on H. halys populations in fruit orchards in its native range in northern China. In laboratory no-choice tests, developmental suitability of eight nontarget host species for T. japonicus was demonstrated by the successful production of progeny on the majority (>85%) of non-target host species tested. In field-collected, naturally laid egg masses, T. japonicus was the most abundant parasitoid associated with H. halys and Dolycoris baccarum, but was also sporadically found in Plautia crossota. Furthermore, it was regularly reared from sentinel egg masses of Menida violacea, Arma chinensis, and Carbula eoa. The only species that did not support development in the laboratory and field was Cappaea tibialis. Besides the benefit of having a high impact on H. halys populations in Northern China, the risk assessment conducted in the area of origin indicates that native Pentatomidae in North America and Europe could be negatively impacted by T. japonicus. Whether the benefits of T. japonicus outweigh the possible risks will have to be evaluated based on the outcome of additional host range studies in the two invaded regions.

TI  - Collaborative classification of hyperspectral and visible images with convolutional neural network
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made multisensor data available for the same area, and it is well-known that remote sensing data processing and analysis often benefit from multisource data fusion. Specifically, low spatial resolution of hyperspectral imagery (HSI) degrades the quality of the subsequent classification task while using visible (VIS) images with high spatial resolution enables high-fidelity spatial analysis. A collaborative classification framework is proposed to fuse HSI and VIS images for finer classification. First, the convolutional neural network model is employed to extract deep spectral features for HSI classification. Second, effective binarized statistical image features are learned as contextual basis vectors for the high-resolution VIS image, followed by a classifier. The proposed approach employs diversified data in a decision fusion, leading to an integration of the rich spectral information, spatial information, and statistical representation information. In particular, the proposed approach eliminates the potential problems of the curse of dimensionality and excessive computation time. The experiments evaluated on two standard data sets demonstrate better classification performance offered by this framework. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Evaluation and Adjustment of the AMSR2 Snow Depth Algorithm for the Northern Xinjiang Region, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is still a challenge to accurately map snow depth using passive microwave remote sensing. This study first validates the standard AMSR2 snow depth product in Northern Xinjiang, China, and then proposes an improved snow depth retrieving algorithm using the AMSR2 brightness temperature data in combination with in-situ measurements in the same region. The results show that: 1) in the past 15 years the mean snow depth based on the metrological stations ranges from 1.1 to 20.4 cm (mean 8.9 cm); 2) the standard AMSR2 snow depth product overestimates (underestimates) snow depth when snow depth thinner (thicker) than 30 cm, with an overall increased estimation error (root mean squared error) as snow depth increase; and 3) for the ascending mode (AMSR2_A) and descending mode (AMSR2_D), our improved algorithm shows smaller bias (2.5 and 3.9 cm) and smaller error (6.9 and 8.2 cm) as compared with the standard AMSR2 products (5.7 and 6.7 cm) and (11.2 and 12.1 cm), respectively. This suggests that the improved algorithm based on brightness temperature data of AMSR2_A has better accuracy and smaller error and can be used to retrieve snow depth of nonforest areas in cold period in the Northern Xinjiang.

TI  - Approaches for synergistically exploiting VIIRS I- and M-Band data in regional active fire detection and FRP assessment: A demonstration with respect to agricultural residue burning in Eastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate a new active fire (AF) detection and characterisation approach for use with the VIIRS spaceborne sensor. This includes for the first-time joint exploitation of both 375 m I-Band and 750 m M-Band data to provide both AF detections and FRP (fire radiative power) retrievals over the full range of fire and FRP magnitudes. We demonstrate the value of our VIIRS-IM 'synergy' product in an area of eastern China dominated by numerous small agricultural residue burns, which contribute significantly to regional air quality problems but which are often difficult to identify via standard (e.g. MODIS 500 m resolution) burned area mapping. We show that the highly 'fire sensitive' VIIRS I-Band data enables detection of the 'small' active fires (FRP <= 1 MW), but this sensitivity can lead to false alarms, often associated with manmade structures. We help avoid these via use of 30 m resolution global land cover data and an OpenStreetMap mask. Comparisons to near-simultaneous Aqua-MODIS AF detections, and the existing VIIRS I-Band AF global product, highlight our VIIRS algorithm's ability to more reliably detect the lowest FRP pixels, associated with the type of agricultural burning dominating eastern China. Our algorithm delivers typically 5 to 10x more AF pixels than does simultaneous-collected MODIS AF data (notwithstanding differences in spatial resolution), and importantly with a AF detection sensitivity that remains much more constant across the swath due to VIIRS' unique pixel aggregation scheme. The VIIRS I4-Band saturates over higher FRP fires, but by combining use of 1- and M-Band data our algorithm generates reliable FRP records for all fires regardless of FRP magnitude. Using the VIIRS-IM methodology we find regionally summed FRP's up to 4x higher than are recorded by MODIS over the same fire season, highlighting the significance of the formally undetected low FRP active fires and indicating that current MODIS FRP-based emissions inventories for areas dominated by agricultural burning may be underestimating in a similar way to burned-area based approaches. FRP generation from VIIRS that takes into account both low- and high-FRP fires via use of both the I- and M-Band data should therefore enable significant improvements in global fire emissions estimation, particularly for regions where smaller types of fire are especially dominant.

TI  - Monetary incentives for provision of syphilis screening, Yunnan, China
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem Early detection of syphilis-infected people followed by effective treatment is essential for syphilis prevention and control.Approach Starting in 2010 the local health authority in Yunnan province, China, developed a network of 670 service sites for syphilis testing, diagnosis and treatment or for testing-only with referral for further diagnosis and treatment. Point-of-care tests for syphilis and syphilis interventions were integrated into the existing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and control programme. To improve the syphilis services, a pay-for-performance scheme was introduced in which providers were paid for testing and treating patients.Local setting Yunnan province is the region hardest hit by HIV infection and disproportionately burdened with syphilis cases in China.Relevant changes The proportion of attendees at voluntary counselling and testing clinics who were tested for syphilis increased from 46.2% (32 877/71 162) in 2010 to 98.2% (68 012/69 259) in 2015. Syphilis-infected cases treated with the recommended therapy increased from 26.6% (264/993) in 2010 to 82.5% (453/549) in 2015 at designated testing, diagnosis and treatment sites.Lessons learnt The strategy greatly increased the uptake of syphilis testing and treatment among people at risk. Introduction of pointof- care tests for syphilis increased coverage of the testing services. Introduction of a pay-for-performance scheme seemed to motivate health-care providers to undertake syphilis intervention services.

TI  - Spectral-spatial multi-feature classification of remote sensing big data based on a random forest classifier for land cover mapping
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Supplementary information, such as multitemporal spectral data and textural features, has the potential to improve land cover classification accuracy. However, given the larger volumes of remote sensing data, it is difficult to utilize all the features of remote sensing big data having different times and spatial resolutions. Inefficiency is also a large problem when dealing with large area land cover mapping. In this study, a new mode of incorporating spatial and temporal dependencies in a complex region employing the random forests (RFs) classifier was utilized. To map land covers, spring and autumn spectral images and their spectral indexes, textural features obtained from Landsat 5 were selected, and an importance measure variable was used to reduce the data's dimension. In addition to randomly selecting the variable, we used random sampling to furthest decrease the generalization error in RF. The results showed that utilizing random sampling, multi-temporal spectral image and texture features, the classification of the Wuhan urban agglomeration, China, using RF performed well. The RF algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 89.2% and a Kappa statistic of 0.8522, indicating high model performance. In addition, the variable importance measures demonstrated that the type of textural features was extremely important for intra-class separability. The RF model has transitivity. The algorithm can be extended by choosing a set of appropriate features for signature extension over large areas or in time-series of Landsat imagery. Land cover mapping might be more economical and efficient if no-cost imagery is used.

TI  - Light absorption by water-soluble organic carbon in atmospheric fine particles in the central Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Brown carbon (BrC) has recently received much attention because of its light absorption features. The chemical compositions, optical properties, and sources of fine aerosol at a high-elevation mountain observatory (4730 m a.s.l.) in the central Tibetan Plateau were measured between 31 May and 1 July 2015. A low flow-rate sampler was used to collect 24-h average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) filter samples. Water-soluble ions, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and light absorption by water-soluble BrC were determined for 26 filter samples. The mean (+/- 1 sigma) OC and WSOC concentrations were 0.76 +/- 0.43 and 0.39 +/- 0.15 mu gC/m(3), respectively, and the mean WSOC/OC mass ratio was 0.59 +/- 0.22. The OC and WSOC concentrations were relatively higher (0.59-1.80 and 0.33-0.83 mu gC/m(3), respectively) during the pre-monsoon period (2-13 June) and were relatively lower (0.27-0.77 and 0.12-0.50 mu gC/m(3), respectively) during the monsoon period (14 June to 1 July), probably because of wet scavenging of aerosols during long-range transport and the presence of cleaner marine air masses during the monsoon period. The absorption spectra of PM2.5 water extracts smoothly increase from visible range to ultraviolet range. The absorption ngstrom exponent, which describes the wavelength dependence of water-soluble BrC, was 2.74-10.61 (mean 6.19 +/- 1.70), and its value was similar in the pre-monsoon period (6.57 +/- 0.56) to that in the monsoon period (5.91 +/- 2.14). The water-soluble BrC mass absorption efficiency, 0.38 +/- 0.16 m(2)/(g C), was much lower than those observed in most urban areas but similar to those in other remote sites. Absorption coefficient at 365 nm, typically used as a proxy for water-soluble BrC, correlated well with the WSOC concentration (R-2 = 0.57), K+ concentration (R-2 = 0.75), and organic aerosol biomass burning markers characterized by an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (C2H4O2+ + C3H5O2 (+), R-2 = 0.60). It can be inferred that biomass burning was an important source of water-soluble BrC in the study area combined with air mass back trajectory analysis using the NOAA HYSPLIT as well as MODIS data of fire dots and aerosol optical depths. The water-soluble BrC to BC light absorption (at 365 nm) coefficient ratios were 9-27%.

TI  - Multitemporal Landsat Image Based Water Quality Analyses of Danjiangkou Reservoir
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Danjiangkou Reservoir (DJKR) is one of the largest artificial freshwater lakes in Asia and a water source of the South: the North Water Transfer Project. However, few studies have analyzed the spatio-temporal water quality distribution or investigated the causative factors of the long-term water quality variation of DJKR. In this study, we used multi-temporal Landsat images combined with the multiple linear stepwise regression (MLSR) method to retrieve long-term distributions of the main water quality parameters in DJKR, i.e., total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). Results indicated the heavily polluted regions and an alarming water quality deterioration trend between May 2006 and May 2014. A combination of land use/land cover (LULC) maps and socioeconomic data was considered to investigate the causative factors of the water quality distribution, as well as the deterioration. This study could provide a valuable reference for the decision-making for water quality conservation in DJKR.

TI  - The Combined Use of Remote Sensing and Social Sensing Data in Fine-Grained Urban Land Use Mapping: A Case Study in Beijing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of the need for fine-grained, accurate, and timely urban land use information, a per-field classification approach was proposed in this paper to automatically map fine-grained urban land use in a study area within Haidian District, Beijing, China, in 2016. High-resolution remote sensing imagery and multi-source social sensing data were used to provide both physical and socioeconomic information. Four categories of attributes were derived from both data sources for urban land use parcels segmented by the OpenStreetMap road network, including spectral/texture attributes, landscape metrics, Baidu Point-Of-Interest (POI) attributes, and Weibo attributes. The random forests technique was adopted to conduct the classification. The importance of each attribute, attribute category, and data source was evaluated for the classification as a whole and the classification of individual land use types. The results showed that a testing accuracy of 77.83% can be achieved. The approach is relatively good at classifying open space and residential parcels, and poor at classifying institutional parcels. While using solely remote sensing data or social sensing data can achieve equally high overall accuracy, their importance varies in terms of the classification of individual classes. Landscape metrics are the most important for open space parcels. Spectral/texture attributes are more important in identifying institutional and residential parcels. The classification of business parcels relies more on landscape metrics and social sensing data, and less on spectral/texture attributes. The classification accuracy can be potentially improved upon the acquisition of purer parcels and the addition of new attributes. It is expected that the proposed approach will be useful for the routine update of urban land use information and large-scale urban land use mapping.

TI  - Rapid ice unloading in the Fleming Glacier region, southern Antarctic Peninsula, and its effect on bedrock uplift rates
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid regional warming in the Antarctic Peninsula has led to the significant retreat and eventual collapse of several major ice shelves since the 1970s, triggering the subsequent acceleration and thinning of their feeding glaciers. The Wordie Ice Shelf, lying off the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, has undergone long-term disintegration since the 1960s with a substantial calving event occurring around 1989, followed by continuous steady retreat and its almost-complete disappearance. The dynamic response of the upstream glaciers to the ice shelf collapse and the response of the solid Earth to the associated mass loss are not fully understood. To quantify the mass loss from the system, we generated a digital elevation model (DEM) using airborne vertical and oblique imagery from 1966 and compared it to a DEM derived from 2008 SPOT data. This analysis reveals lowering over that time of approximately 60 m at the front of Fleming Glacier. Using IceBridge and ICESat-2/GLAS data spanning 2002-2014, we show an increased rate of mean ice-surface lowering, with rates post-2008 more than twice those of 2002-2008. We use these load change data as a basis for the simulation of viscoelastic solid Earth deformation. We subtract modeled elastic deformation rates, and a suite of modeled viscous rates, from GPS-derived three-dimensional bedrock velocities at sites to the south of Fleming Glacier to infer properties of Earth rheology. Assuming the pre-breakup bedrock uplift was positive due to post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ice retreat, our viscoelastic-corrected GPS uplift rates suggest upper mantle viscosities are >2 x 10(19) Pa s and likely >1 x 10(20) Pas in this region, 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than previously found for the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Horizontal velocities at the GPS site nearest the Fleming Glacier, after the application of elastic and plate tectonic corrections, point away from Marguerite Bay rather than the present glacier front. This suggests that horizontal motion in the region reflects the earlier retreat of the glacier system following the LGM, compatible with a relatively strong mantle in this region. These findings highlight the need for improved understanding of ice load changes in this region through the late Holocene in order to accurately model glacial isostatic adjustment.

TI  - Sources of uncertainty in exploring rangeland phenology: A case study in an alpine meadow on the central Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change has been found to substantially influence the phenology of rangeland, especially on the Tibetan Plateau. However, there is considerable controversy about the trends and causes of rangeland phenology owing to different phenological exploration methods and lack of ground validation. Little is known about the uncertainty in the exploration accuracy of vegetation phenology. Therefore, in this study, we selected a typical alpine rangeland near Damxung national meteorological station as a case study on central Tibetan Plateau, and identified several important sources influencing phenology to better understand their effects on phenological exploration. We found man-made land use was not easily distinguished from natural rangelands, and therefore this may confound phenological response to climate change in the rangeland. Change trends of phenology explored by four methods were similar, but ratio threshold method (RTM) was more suitable for exploring vegetation phenology in terms of the beginning of growing season (BGS) and end of growing season (EGS). However, some adjustments are needed when RTM is used in extreme drought years. MODIS NDVI/EVI dataset was most suitable for exploring vegetation phenology of BGS and EGS. The discrimination capacities of vegetation phenology declined with decreasing resolution of remote sensing images from MODIS to GIMMS AVHRR datasets. Additionally, distinct trends of phenological change rates were indicated in different terrain conditions, with advance of growing season in high altitudes but delay of season in lower altitudes. Therefore, it was necessary to eliminate interference of complex terrain and man-made land use to ensure the representativeness of natural vegetation. Moreover, selecting the appropriate method to explore rangelands and fully considering the impact of topography are important to accurately analyze the effects of climate change on vegetation phenology.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variations of Vegetation Response to Dynamic Change of Meteorological Factors and Groundwater in the Heihe River Basin, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction of meteorological factors and groundwater depth affects vegetation coverage and growth, particularly in semi-arid regions where groundwater is extracted for human use. This paper analyzed the characteristics of temporal and spatial variations in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between 1998 and 2008 to clarify the response of NDVI to variations in meteorological factors and groundwater depth in the Heihe River Basin, China. The results indicated that: (1) there was a statistically significant response of NDVI to temperature variation, and this was greater than the response to precipitation. Partial years showed a time-lag in response to temperature and precipitation, and NDVI-temperature had a faster response time than NDVI-precipitation. (2) Groundwater depth less than 7.3 m had the greatest effect on NDVI. Salinization, the capillary height and the maximum vegetation root zone were the main factors to increase or reduce the growth of vegetation. The relationship between NDVI and groundwater depth could be fitted with a logistic correlation curve.

AB  - The accurate and efficient detection of the water depth of coral reefs through remote sensing imagery is crucial for navigation, marine engineering, and marine safety, among others. This study proposed a water depth inversion method that is processed using a two-step strategy. First, a log-dual-band ratio transform model is employed by combining blue, yellow, red, and red edge bands. Second, a multivariable linear regression model is constructed to determine water depth. The experimental study is conducted in a reef island in the South China Sea, and the WorldView-2 satellite data is used as the test data. Results demonstrated that the proposed method needs a few parameters in the model, and can effectively and reliably characterize the correlation between the spectral features and water depth.

TI  - Predictingmattic epipedons in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using Random Forest
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mattic epipedon (ME), a special diagnostic surface horizon for soils in alpine meadow, plays an important role in carbon storage, soil water retention, and indication of alpine meadow degradation. At the global scale, it mainly distributes in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and other similar alpine environments. However, its spatial patterns and the relations with environmental conditions remain unknown. This study attempts to explore key environmental variables responsible for the occurrence of the special surface soil horizon and based on those factors to predict and map digitally the spatial distribution of ME. By combining a variable selection procedure and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, the variables extracted from Landsat 5 TM mosaic image, ASTER GDEM, and climate data were optimized and their importance was measured. The classification accuracy was compared with that obtained from binary logistic regression algorithm. In addition, a land use/land cover (LULC) map-based modification was conducted to further improve the classification accuracy. Results showed that the variable selection procedure had little effect in improving prediction accuracy. However, the number of used variables markedly reduced from 26 to 6 with a 77% decrease, which could speed up the training of the RF model (about one-third of the computation time could be saved). Analysis of variable importance showed that band 3 of TM and normalized difference vegetation index were the most important environmental variables influencing the occurrence of ME. The final overall accuracy of the ME map was predicted to be 84%. Our results demonstrate that the proposed procedure, which combined the proposed variables (derived from remote sensing, GDEM, and climate data), the variable selection approach, the RF algorithm, and the LULC map-based modification method can identify key environmental variables influencing the occurrence of ME and map the spatial distribution of ME effectively on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Estimating High Resolution Daily Air Temperature Based on Remote Sensing Products and Climate Reanalysis Datasets over Glacierized Basins: A Case Study in the Langtang Valley, Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near surface air temperature (Ta) is one of the key input parameters in land surface models and hydrological models as it affects most biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes of the earth surface system. For distributed hydrological modeling over glacierized basins, obtaining high resolution Ta forcing is one of the major challenges. In this study, we proposed a new high resolution daily Ta estimation scheme under both clear and cloudy sky conditions through integrating the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and China Meteorological Administration (CMA) land data assimilation system (CLDAS) reanalyzed daily Ta. Spatio-temporal continuous MODIS LST was reconstructed through the data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) method. Multi-variable regression models were developed at CLDAS scale and then used to estimate Ta at MODIS scale. The new Ta estimation scheme was tested over the Langtang Valley, Nepal as a demonstrating case study. Observations from two automatic weather stations at Kyanging and Yala located in the Langtang Valley from 2012 to 2014 were used to validate the accuracy of Ta estimation. The RMSEs are 2.05, 1.88, and 3.63 K, and the biases are 0.42, -0.68 and -2.86 K for daily maximum, mean and minimum Ta, respectively, at the Kyanging station. At the Yala station, the RMSE values are 4.53, 2.68 and 2.36 K, and biases are 4.03, 1.96 and -0.35 K for the estimated daily maximum, mean and minimum Ta, respectively. Moreover, the proposed scheme can produce reasonable spatial distribution pattern of Ta at the Langtang Valley. Our results show the proposed Ta estimation scheme is promising for integration with distributed hydrological model for glacier melting simulation over glacierized basins.

TI  - Spike-Like Blending Noise Attenuation Using Structural Low-Rank Decomposition
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spikelike noise is a common type of random noise existing in many geoscience and remote sensing data sets. The attenuation of spike-like noise has become extremely important recently, because it is the main bottleneck when processing the simultaneous source data that are generated from the modern seismic acquisition. In this letter, we propose a novel low-rank decomposition algorithm that is effective in rejecting the spikelike noise in the seismic data set. The specialty of the low-rank decomposition algorithm is that it is applied along the morphological direction of the seismic data sets with a prior knowledge of the morphology of the seismic data, which we call local slope. The seismic data are of much lower rank along the morphological direction than along the space direction. The morphology of the seismic data (local slope) is obtained via a robust plane-wave destruction method. We use two simulated field data examples to illustrate the algorithm workflow and its effective performance.

TI  - SPATIOTEMPORAL CHANGES IN COTTON GROWING AREAS IN XINJIANG (2000-2015)
T2  - BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton planting is the important basis of local and national economic development. In this study, cotton growing areas were first regionalized according to environmental, social and economic conditions, and then an optimized model of extracting cotton growing area from MODIS data was constructed for each individual region. The method was used to map the cotton growing area in Xinjiang, over the past 16 years and to analyze the spatiotemporal changes in cotton growing area and the related environmental and socioeconomic drivers behind these changes. The results show that: (1) the method of extracting cotton growing area has a high accuracy at a regional level with a determination coefficient R-2 of 0.983 for the linear correlation between the growing areas obtained from remote-sensing and statistical data; (2) the cotton growing area in Xinjiang showed an upward trend during the period of 2000 - 2015 with a major increase in southern Xinjiang, a substantial increase in the east, and a relatively smaller increase in the north; (3) the spatial pattern of change in cotton growing area in the southern Xinjiang Aksu and Kashi regions exhibited the most significant spatial expansion, followed by the Tacheng, and Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture region in northern Xinjiang; and (4) from 2000 to 2013, the natural factors have little effect on cotton growing area changes. However, socio-economic factors, such as the agricultural output value, total power of agricultural machinery, and effective irrigation area, significantly affected the spatial and temporal changes in cotton growing area.

TI  - Assessing the population coverage of a health demographic surveillance system using satellite imagery and crowd-sourcing
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data can serve as an independent source of information about the location of residential structures in areas under demographic and health surveillance. We report on results obtained combining satellite imagery, imported from Bing, with location data routinely collected using the built-in GPS sensors of tablet computers, to assess completeness of population coverage in a Health and Demographic Surveillance System in Malawi. The Majete Malaria Project Health and Demographic Surveillance System, in Malawi, started in 2014 to support a project with the aim of studying the reduction of malaria using an integrated control approach by rolling out insecticide treated nets and improved case management supplemented with house improvement and larval source management. In order to support the monitoring of the trial a Health and Demographic Surveillance System was established in the area that surrounds the Majete Wildlife Reserve (1600 km2), using the OpenHDS data system. We compared house locations obtained using GPS recordings on mobile devices during the demographic surveillance census round with those acquired from satellite imagery. Volunteers were recruited through the crowdcrafting. org platform to identify building structures on the images, which enabled the compilation of a database with coordinates of potential residences. For every building identified on these satellite images by the volunteers (11,046 buildings identified of which 3424 (ca. 30%) were part of the censused area), we calculated the distance to the nearest house enumerated on the ground by fieldworkers during the census round of the HDSS. A random sample of buildings (85 structures) identified on satellite images without a nearby location enrolled in the census were visited by a fieldworker to determine how many were missed during the baseline census survey, if any were missed. The findings from this ground-truthing effort suggest that a high population coverage was achieved in the census survey, however the crowd-sourcing did not locate many of the inhabited structures (52.3% of the 6543 recorded during the census round). We conclude that using auxiliary data can play a useful role in quality assurance in population based health surveillance, but improved algorithms would be needed if crowd-sourced house locations are to be used as the basis of population databases.

TI  - Remote sensing measurements of sea surface temperature as an indicator of <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> in oyster meat and human illnesses
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp) is a naturally occurring bacterium found in marine environments worldwide. It can cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, primarily through raw oyster consumption. Water temperatures, and potentially other environmental factors, play an important role in the growth and proliferation of Vp in the environment. Quantifying the relationships between environmental variables and indicators or incidence of Vp illness is valuable for public health surveillance to inform and enable suitable preventative measures. This study aimed to assess the relationship between environmental parameters and Vp in British Columbia (BC), Canada.Methods: The study used Vp counts in oyster meat from 2002-2015 and laboratory confirmed Vp illnesses from 2011-2015 for the province of BC. The data were matched to environmental parameters from publicly available sources, including remote sensing measurements of nighttime sea surface temperature (SST) obtained from satellite readings at a spatial resolution of 1 km. Using three separate models, this paper assessed the relationship between (1) daily SST and Vp counts in oyster meat, (2) weekly mean Vp counts in oysters and weekly Vp illnesses, and (3) weekly mean SST and weekly Vp illnesses. The effects of salinity and chlorophyll a were also evaluated. Linear regression was used to quantify the relationship between SST and Vp, and piecewise regression was used to identify SST thresholds of concern.Results: A total of 2327 oyster samples and 293 laboratory confirmed illnesses were included. In model 1, both SST and salinity were significant predictors of log(Vp) counts in oyster meat. In model 2, the mean log(Vp) count in oyster meat was a significant predictor of Vp illnesses. In model 3, weekly mean SST was a significant predictor of weekly Vp illnesses. The piecewise regression models identified a SST threshold of approximately 14 degrees C for both model 1 and 3, indicating increased risk of Vp in oyster meat and Vp illnesses at higher temperatures.Conclusion: Monitoring of SST, particularly through readily accessible remote sensing data, could serve as a warning signal for Vp and help inform the introduction and cessation of preventative or control measures.

T2  - BIOSCIENCE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study explores the correlation of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) protein expression with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis and prognosis of breast cancer. The breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were obtained from patients with primary breast cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the mRNA level of HER-2. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation of HER-2 expression with SLN metastasis. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of breast cancer patients were investigated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore factors influencing SLN metastasis and prognosis of breast cancer. Compared with adjacent tissues, HER-2 expression was significantly up-regulated in breast cancer tissues. HER-2 expression was correlated with the pathological type, tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging, histological grade, blood vessel invasion, SLN metastasis, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR). The expression level of HER-2 was positively related to the SLN metastasis (r= 0.548). Median DFS and OS were longer in patients with negative HER-2 expression than in patients with positive HER-2 expression. TNM staging, SLN metastasis, and expression levels of HER-2 and ER were independent factors for DFS of breast cancer patients, while TNM staging, blood vessel invasion, histological grade, SLN metastasis, and expression levels of HER-2 and PR were independent factors for OS of breast cancer patients. Our study suggests that high expression of HER-2 promoted SLN metastasis. HER-2 expression and SLN metastasis were the independent factors for the prognosis of breast cancer.

TI  - Using advanced InSAR techniques to monitor landslide deformations induced by tunneling in the Northern Apennines, Italy
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) is used to make measurements of small surface displacements in different situations including ground -settlement, landslides and excavations. We document the deformation history of four dormant deep-seated landslides in the Northern Apennines of Italy that were reactivated by the excavation of a double road tunnel. The tunnel is part of a larger infrastructure project that involves the improvement of the Al highway which connects Bologna and Florence. The excavation of the tunnel under the landslides' basal shear surfaces started in 2011, and with the advance of the tunnel front, deformation began to occur, causing damages to homes and infrastructures. The tunnel passes under the small villages of Ripoli and Santa Maria Maddalena. The deformation slowed down after the tunnel was completed in November 2014, and low surface displacement rates were registered for the period between October 2014 and June 2016. We show the results of an InSAR analysis designed to measure surface movements between 2003 and 2016. The InSAR displacements are derived from the Envisat, COSMO SkyMed, and Sentinel 1 datasets and cover the main construction phase of the tunnel (2011-2015). A detailed geological and geomorphological mapping of the slope is developed based on the field evidence and on the spatial pattern of surface deformation provided by our InSAR analysis. Together with the map, a new conceptual geological model of the slope in tectonically sheared and weathered flysch is presented. The satellite InSAR data show good agreement with available ground based monitoring data that include inclinometer and GPS-measurements, while small differences occur with respect to deformation time series obtained from a ground -based InSAR instrument. In particular, the InSAR results for the X -Band data of COSMO SkyMed demonstrate the close relationship between the position of the excavation front and the displacement rates of previously dormant landslide deposits. Conversely, the concurrent rainfall does not appear to significantly influence the observed behavior and, if any, had only a minor influence on the displacement history of the investigated landslides.

TI  - What difference does a century make? Shifts in the ecosystem structure of the Ross Sea, Antarctica, as evidenced from a sentinel species, the Weddell seal
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The arrival of humans to Antarctica's Ross Sea (100+ years ago) led to a slow, but sustained increase in human activities in the area. To investigate if human presence has influenced the structure of the ecosystem over the last century, we compared historical (ca 100 years old) and modern samples of a sentinel species, the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), using both bulk tissue and compound-specific stable isotope analysis. The historical isotopic niche of Weddell seals was over five times larger than the modern niche. The isotopic values of individual amino acids showed a clear segregation between historical and modern samples, indicative of differences at the base of the trophic web. Further, we found no significant differences in the trophic position of Weddell seals between the two periods. Our study revealed that the Ross Sea has undergone detectable changes (i.e. in the primary producers community) in the last century, but the presence of humans has not disrupted trophic interactions supporting Weddell seals.

TI  - Influences of forest on MODIS snow cover mapping and snow variations in the Amur River basin in Northeast Asia during 2000-2014
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study applies the improved cloud-free moderate resolution imaging spectral radiometer daily snow cover product (MODMYD_MC) to investigate the snow cover variations from snow hydrologic year (HY) HY2000 to HY2013 in the Amur River basin (ARB), Northeast Asia. The fractions of forest cover were 38%, 63%, and 47% in 2009 in China (the southern ARB), Russia (the northern ARB), and ARB, respectively. Validation results show that MODMYD_MC has a snow agreement of 88% against in situ snow depth (SD) observations (SD >= 4 cm). The agreement is about 10% lower at the forested stations than at the nonforested stations. Snow cover durations (SCDs) from MODMYD_MC are 20 days shorter than ground observations (SD >= 1 cm) at the forested stations, whereas they are just 8 days shorter than ground observations (SD >= 1 cm) at the nonforested stations. Annual mean SCDs from MODMYD_MC in the forested areas are 21 days shorter than those in the nearby farmland in the Sanjiang Plain. This indicates forest has a complex influence on the snow accumulation and melting processes and even on optical satellite snow cover mapping. Meanwhile, SCD and mean snow cover are negatively correlated with air temperature in ARB, especially in the snow melting season, when mean air temperature in March and April can explain 86% and 74% of the mean snow cover variations in China ARB and Russia ARB, respectively. From 1961 to 2015, the annual mean air temperature presented an increased trend by 0.33 degrees C/decade in both China ARB and Russia ARB, whereas it had a decrease trend from HY2000 to HY2013. The decrease of air temperature led to an increase of snow cover, which is different from the global decrease trend of snow cover variations. SCD and snow cover had larger increase rates in China ARB than in Russia ARB, and they were larger in the forested areas than in the nearby farmland in the Sanjiang Plain.

TI  - Sea ice local surface topography from single-pass satellite InSAR measurements: a feasibility study
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative parameters characterizing the sea ice surface topography are needed in geophysical investigations such as studies on atmosphere-ice interactions or sea ice mechanics. Recently, the use of space-borne single-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for retrieving the ice surface topography has attracted notice among geophysicists. In this paper the potential of InSAR measurements is examined for several satellite configurations and radar frequencies, considering statistics of heights and widths of ice ridges as well as possible magnitudes of ice drift. It is shown that, theoretically, surface height variations can be retrieved with relative errors <= 0.5 m. In practice, however, the sea ice drift and open water leads may contribute significantly to the measured interferometric phase. Another essential factor is the dependence of the achievable interferometric baseline on the satellite orbit configurations. Possibilities to assess the influence of different factors on the measurement accuracy are demonstrated: signal-to-noise ratio, presence of a snow layer, and the penetration depth into the ice. Practical examples of sea surface height retrievals from bistatic SAR images collected during the TanDEM-X Science Phase are presented.

TI  - Combination of Fluorescence-Guided Surgery With Photodynamic Therapy for the Treatment of Cancer
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Specific visualization of body parts is needed during surgery. Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) uses a fluorescence contrast agent for in vivo tumor imaging to detect and identify both malignant and normal tissues. There are several advantages and clinical benefits of FGS over other conventional medical imaging modalities, such as its safety, effectiveness, and suitability for real-time imaging in the operating room. Recent advancements in contrast agents and intraoperative fluorescence imaging devices have led to a greater potential for intraoperative fluorescence imaging in clinical applications. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an alternative modality to treat tumors, which uses a light-sensitive drug (photosensitizers) and special light to destroy the targeted tissues. In this review, we discuss the fluorescent contrast agents, some newly developed imaging devices, and the successful clinical application of FGS. Additionally, we present the combined strategy of FGS with PDT to further improve the therapeutic effect for patients with cancer. Taken together, this review provides a unique perspective and summarization of FGS.

TI  - Prognostic modeling of oral cancer by gene profiles and clinicopathological co-variables
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate staging and outcome prediction is a major problem in clinical management of oral cancer patients, hampering high precision treatment and adjuvant therapy planning. Here, we have built and validated multivariable models that integrate gene signatures with clinical and pathological variables to improve staging and survival prediction of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Gene expression profiles from 249 human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative OSCCs were explored to identify a 22-gene lymph node metastasis signature (LNMsig) and a 40-gene overall survival signature (OSsig). To facilitate future clinical implementation and increase performance, these signatures were transferred to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays and validated in an independent cohort of 125 HPV-negative tumors. When applied in the clinically relevant subgroup of early-stage (cT1-2N0) OSCC, the LNMsig could prevent overtreatment in two-third of the patients. Additionally, the integration of RT-qPCR gene signatures with clinical and pathological variables provided accurate prognostic models for oral cancer, strongly outperforming TNM. Finally, the OSsig gene signature identified a subpopulation of patients, currently considered at low-risk for disease-related survival, who showed an unexpected poor prognosis. These well-validated models will assist in personalizing primary treatment with respect to neck dissection and adjuvant therapies.

TI  - Dynamic analysis and ecological evaluation of urban heat islands in Raipur city, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial-temporal distribution of the urban heat islands (UHI) and their changes over Raipur city have been analyzed using multitemporal Landsat satellite data from 1995 to 2016. Land surface temperature (LST) was retrieved through a mono-window algorithm. Some selected land use/land cover (LU-LC) indices were analyzed with LST using linear regression. The urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) was applied to measure the thermal comfort level of the city. Results show that during the observed period, the study area experienced a gradual increasing rate in mean LST (> 1% per annum). The UHI developed especially along the north-western industrial area and south-eastern bare land of the city. A difference in mean LST between UHI and non-UHI for different time periods (2.6 degrees C in 1995, 2.85 degrees C in 2006, 3.42 degrees C in 2009, and 3.63 degrees C in 2016) reflects the continuous warming status of the city. The LST map also shows the existence of a few urban hot spots near the industrial areas, metal roofs, and high density transport parking lots, which are more abundant in the northwestern part of the city. The UTFVI map associated with UHI indicates that the inner parts of the city are ecologically more comfortable than the outer peripheries.

TI  - Evolution of the vegetation system in the Heihe River basin in the last 2000 years
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of vegetation systems to the long-term changes in climate, hydrology, and social-economic conditions in river basins is critical for sustainable river basin management. This study aims to investigate the evolution of natural and crop vegetation systems in the Heihe River basin (HRB) over the past 2000 years. Archived Landsat images, historical land use maps and hydrological records were introduced to derive the long-term spatial distribution of natural and crop vegetation and the corresponding biomass levels. The major findings are that (1) both natural and crop vegetation experienced three development stages: a pre-development stage (before the Republic of China), a rapid development stage (Republic of China - 2000), and a post-development stage (after 2000). Climate and hydrological conditions did not show significant impacts over crop vegetation, while streamflow presented synchronous changes with natural vegetation in the first stage. For the second stage, warmer temperature and increasing streamflow were found to be important factors for the increase in both natural and crop vegetation in the middle reaches of the HRB. For the third stage, positive climate and hydrological conditions, together with policy interventions, supported the overall vegetation increase in both the middle and lower HRB; (2) there was a significantly faster increase in crop biomass than that of native vegetation since 1949, which could be explained by the technological development; and (3) the ratio of natural vegetation to crop vegetation decreased from 16 during the Yuan Dynasty to about 2.2 since 2005. This ratio reflects the reaction of land and water development to a changing climate and altering social-economic conditions at the river basin level; therefore, it could be used as an indicator of water and land management at river basins.

TI  - Cloud occurrences and cloud radiative effects (CREs) from CERES-CALIPSO-CloudSat-MODIS (CCCM) and CloudSat radar-lidar (RL) products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Two kinds of cloud products obtained from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), CloudSat, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are compared and analyzed in this study: Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES)-CALIPSO-CloudSat-MODIS (CCCM) product and CloudSat radar-lidar products such as GEOPROF-LIDAR and FLXHR-LIDAR. Compared to GEOPROF-LIDAR, low-level (< 1 km) cloud occurrences in CCCM are larger over tropical oceans because the CCCM algorithm uses a more relaxed threshold of cloud-aerosol discrimination score for CALIPSO Vertical Feature Mask product. In contrast, midlevel (1-8 km) cloud occurrences in GEOPROF-LIDAR are larger than CCCM at high latitudes (>40 degrees). The difference occurs when hydrometeors are detected by CALIPSO lidar but are undetected by CloudSat radar. In the comparison of cloud radiative effects (CREs), global mean differences between CCCM and FLXHR-LIDAR are mostly smaller than 5 W m(-2), while noticeable regional differences are found. For example, CCCM shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) CREs are larger than FXLHR-LIDAR along the west coasts of Africa and America because the GEOPROF-LIDAR algorithm misses shallow marine boundary layer clouds. In addition, FLXHR-LIDAR SW CREs are larger than the CCCM counterpart over tropical oceans away from the west coasts of America. Over midlatitude storm-track regions, CCCM SW and LW CREs are larger than the FLXHR-LIDAR counterpart.

TI  - The impact of aerosol vertical distribution on aerosol optical depth retrieval using CALIPSO and MODIS data: Case study over dust and smoke regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global quantitative aerosol information has been derived from MODerate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) observations for decades since early 2000 and widely used for air quality and climate change research. However, the operational MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products Collection 6 (C6) can still be biased, because of uncertainty in assumed aerosol optical properties and aerosol vertical distribution. This study investigates the impact of aerosol vertical distribution on the AOD retrieval. We developed a new algorithm by considering dynamic vertical profiles, which is an adaptation of MODIS C6 Dark Target (C6_DT) algorithm over land. The new algorithm makes use of the aerosol vertical profile extracted from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) measurements to generate an accurate top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance for the AOD retrieval, where the profile is assumed to be a single layer and represented as a Gaussian function with the mean height as single variable. To test the impact, a comparison was made between MODIS DT and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD, over dust and smoke regions. The results show that the aerosol vertical distribution has a strong impact on the AOD retrieval. The assumed aerosol layers close to the ground can negatively bias the retrievals in C6_DT. Regarding the evaluated smoke and dust layers, the new algorithm can improve the retrieval by reducing the negative biases by 3-5%.

TI  - Predictive Value of Clinicopathological Characteristics for Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is one of the preferred treatments for breast cancer including clinically negative lymph node breast cancer. However, for 60-70% of patients this invasive axilla surgery is unnecessary. Our study aimed to identify the predictors for sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in early breast cancer patients and provide evidence for rational decision-making in specified clinical situations.Material/Methods: Medical records of 417 breast cancer patients who were treated with a breast surgical procedure and SLNB in Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Eastern Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the correlation between SLN metastasis and clinicopathological characteristics, including patient age, menstrual status, body mass index (BMI), family history, tumor size, laterality of tumor, histological grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), Ki67 index, and molecular subtypes of the tumor.Results: In the cohort of 417 cases, the ratio of SLNM was 23.0%. Univariate analysis found that age, tumor size, histological grade, and Ki67 index were associated with SLN metastasis. However, age, tumor size, and histological grade were the only three independent predictors for SLN metastasis by multivariate logistic regression analysis. When these three factors were considered together, three different levels of SLN metastasis groups could be classified: low-risk group with the ratio of 14.3%, moderate-risk group with the ratio of 31.4%, and highrisk group with the ratio of 66.7%.Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that age, tumor size, and histological grade were three independent predictive factors for SLN metastasis in early breast cancer patients. This finding may help surgeons in the decision-making process for early breast cancer patients before considering axilla surgical procedure.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility mapping on a global scale using the method of logistic regression
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a statistical model for mapping global landslide susceptibility based on logistic regression. After investigating explanatory factors for landslides in the existing literature, five factors were selected for model landslide susceptibility: relative relief, extreme precipitation, lithology, ground motion and soil moisture. When building the model, 70% of landslide and nonlandslide points were randomly selected for logistic regression, and the others were used for model validation. To evaluate the accuracy of predictive models, this paper adopts several criteria including a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve method. Logistic regression experiments found all five factors to be significant in explaining landslide occurrence on a global scale. During the modeling process, percentage correct in confusion matrix of landslide classification was approximately 80% and the area under the curve (AUC) was nearly 0.87. During the validation process, the above statistics were about 81% and 0.88, respectively. Such a result indicates that the model has strong robustness and stable performance. This model found that at a global scale, soil moisture can be dominant in the occurrence of landslides and topographic factor may be secondary.

TI  - The prevalence and incidence of active syphilis in women in Morocco, 1995-2016: Model-based estimation and implications for STI surveillance
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundEvolving health priorities and resource constraints mean that countries require data on trends in sexually transmitted infections (STI) burden, to inform program planning and resource allocation. We applied the Spectrum STI estimation tool to estimate the prevalence and incidence of active syphilis in adult women in Morocco over 1995 to 2016. The results from the analysis are being used to inform Morocco's national HIV/STI strategy, target setting and program evaluation.MethodsSyphilis prevalence levels and trends were fitted through logistic regression to data from surveys in antenatal clinics, women attending family planning clinics and other general adult populations, as available post-1995. Prevalence data were adjusted for diagnostic test performance, and for the contribution of higher-risk populations not sampled in surveys. Incidence was inferred from prevalence by adjusting for the average duration of infection with active syphilis.ResultsIn 2016, active syphilis prevalence was estimated to be 0.56% in women 15 to 49 years of age (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.3%-1.0%), and around 21,675 (10,612 +/- 37,198) new syphilis infections have occurred. The analysis shows a steady decline in prevalence from 1995, when the prevalence was estimated to be 1.8% (1.0 +/- 3.5%). The decline was consistent with decreasing prevalences observed in TB patients, fishermen and prisoners followed over 2000-2012 through sentinel surveillance, and with a decline since 2003 in national HIV incidence estimated earlier through independent modelling.ConclusionsPeriodic population-based surveys allowed Morocco to estimate syphilis prevalence and incidence trends. This first-ever undertaking engaged and focused national stakeholders, and confirmed the still considerable syphilis burden. The latest survey was done in 2012 and so the trends are relatively uncertain after 2012. From 2017 Morocco plans to implement a system to record data from routine antenatal programmatic screening, which should help update and re-calibrate next trend estimations.

TI  - Long-term spatial distributions and trends of the latent heat fluxes over the global cropland ecosystem using multiple satellite-based models
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating cropland latent heat flux (LE) from continental to global scales is vital to modeling crop production and managing water resources. Over the past several decades, numerous LE models were developed, such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer LE (MOD16) algorithm, revised remote sensing-based Penman-Monteith LE algorithm (RRS), the Priestley-Taylor LE algorithm of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) and the modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor LE algorithm (MS-PT). However, these LE models have not been directly compared over the global cropland ecosystem using various algorithms. In this study, we evaluated the performances of these four LE models using 34 eddy covariance (EC) sites. The results showed that mean annual LE for cropland varied from 33.49 to 58.97 W/m(2) among the four models. The interannual LE slightly increased during 1982-2009 across the global cropland ecosystem. All models had acceptable performances with the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of approximately 35 W/m(2). MS-PT had good overall performance across the cropland ecosystem with the highest R-2, lowest RMSE and a relatively low bias. The reduced performances of MOD16 and RRS, with R-2 ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 and RMSEs from 30 to 39 W/m(2), might be attributed to empirical parameters in the structure algorithms and calibrated coefficients.

TI  - Medical Students' Perceptions of Emergency Medicine Careers.
T2  - Cureus
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction Previous studies on specialty choice have investigated specialty characteristics that are appealing to undergraduate students. Little is known about how students' attitudes towards Emergency Medicine (EM) careers evolve over their schooling. Methods An open-ended survey of medical students' career interests was distributed five times over the four-year undergraduate curriculum from 1999 to 2008 at Memorial University. We tested specialty choices across genders, and looked at how likely a student's choice in their first year influenced their final year choice, a metric we termed "endurance". The qualitative data wascoded to identify key themes and sentinel quotes. Lastly, we conducted semi-structured interviews with academic emergency physicians at Dalhousie University to assess the relevance of these findings to postgraduate training. Results Males expressed more interest in EM than females. EM had more endurance than internal medicine, but less than family medicine, over the four-year curriculum. The biggest drawbacks for EM included lack of patient follow-up and lack of EM experience; positive perspectives focused on clinical variety and elective experiences. Lifestyle was prominent, seen as both positive and negative. Emergency physicians considered EM lifestyle attractive, and characterized medical students' perceptions as "skewed," highlighting lack of insight into system flaws. Conclusions Medical students' opinions towards EM tended to shift over time, particularly the perception of the work. Medical students' perceptions differ from that of experienced emergency physicians. Medical schools may be able to improve clinical exposure and provide more informed counselling or mentoring with respect to EM.

TI  - Source attribution of human campylobacteriosis at the point of exposure by combining comparative exposure assessment and subtype comparison based on comparative genomic fingerprinting
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human campylobacteriosis is a common zoonosis with a significant burden in many countries. Its prevention is difficult because humans can be exposed to Campylobacter through various exposures: foodborne, waterborne or by contact with animals. This study aimed at attributing campylobacteriosis to sources at the point of exposure. It combined comparative exposure assessment and microbial subtype comparison with subtypes defined by comparative genomic fingerprinting (CGF). It used isolates from clinical cases and from eight potential exposure sources (chicken, cattle and pig manure, retail chicken, beef, pork and turkey meat, and surface water) collected within a single sentinel site of an integrated surveillance system for enteric pathogens in Canada. Overall, 1518 non-human isolates and 250 isolates from domestically-acquired human cases were subtyped and their subtype profiles analyzed for source attribution using two attribution models modified to include exposure. Exposure values were obtained from a concurrent comparative exposure assessment study undertaken in the same area. Based on CGF profiles, attribution was possible for 198 (79%) human cases. Both models provide comparable figures: chicken meat was the most important source (65-69% of attributable cases) whereas exposure to cattle (manure) ranked second (14-19% of attributable cases), the other sources being minor (including beef meat). In comparison with other attributions conducted at the point of production, the study highlights the fact that Campylobacter transmission from cattle to humans is rarely meat borne, calling for a closer look at local transmission from cattle to prevent campylobacteriosis, in addition to increasing safety along the chicken supply chain.

TI  - Development of nomograms to predict axillary lymph node status in breast cancer patients
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Prediction of axillary lymph node (ALN) status preoperatively is critical in the management of breast cancer patients. This study aims to develop a new set of nomograms to accurately predict ALN status.Methods: We searched the National Cancer Database to identify eligible female breast cancer patients with profiles containing critical information. Patients diagnosed in 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 were designated the training (n = 99,618) and validation (n = 101,834) cohorts, respectively. We used binary logistic regression to investigate risk factors for ALN status and to develop a new set of nomograms to determine the probability of having any positive ALNs and N2-3 disease. We used ROC analysis and calibration plots to assess the discriminative ability and accuracy of the nomograms, respectively.Results: In the training cohort, we identified age, quadrant of the tumor, tumor size, histology, ER, PR, HER2, tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion as significant predictors of ALNs status. Nomogram-A was developed to predict the probability of having any positive ALNs (P_any) in the full population with a C-index of 0.788 and 0.786 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. In patients with positive ALNs, Nomogram-B was developed to predict the conditional probability of having N2-3 disease (P_con) with a C-index of 0.680 and 0.677 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The absolute probability of having N2-3 disease can be estimated by P_any*P_con. Both of the nomograms were well-calibrated.Conclusions: We developed a set of nomograms to predict the ALN status in breast cancer patients.

At present, passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing data are the only efficient way to monitor temporal and spatial variations in snow depth at large scale. However, existing snow depth products show the largest uncertainties across the QTP. In this study, MODIS fractional snow cover product, point, line and intense sampling data are synthesized to evaluate the accuracy of snow cover and snow depth derived from PMW remote sensing data and to analyze the possible causes of uncertainties. The results show that the accuracy of snow cover extents varies spatially and depends on the fraction of snow cover. Based on the assumption that grids with MODIS snow cover fraction >10% are regarded as snow cover, the overall accuracy in snow cover is 66.7 %, overestimation error is 56.1 %, underestimation error is 21.1 %, commission error is 27.6 % and omission error is 47.4 %. The commission and overestimation errors of snow cover primarily occur in the northwest and southeast areas with low ground temperature. Omission error primarily occurs in cold desert areas with shallow snow, and underestimation error mainly occurs in glacier and lake areas. With the increase of snow cover fraction, the overestimation error decreases and the omission error increases. A comparison between snow depths measured in field experiments, measured at meteorological stations and estimated across the QTP shows that agreement between observation and retrieval improves with an increasing number of observation points in a PMW grid. The misclassification and errors between observed and retrieved snow depth are associated with the relatively coarse resolution of PMW remote sensing, ground temperature, snow characteristics and topography. To accurately understand the variation in snow depth across the QTP, new algorithms should be developed to retrieve snow depth with higher spatial resolution and should consider the variation in brightness temperatures at different frequencies emitted from ground with changing ground features.

TI  - Effects of changing environmental conditions on synthetic aperture radar backscattering coefficient, scattering mechanisms, and class separability in a forest area
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental conditions have considerable effects on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Therefore, assessing these effects is important for obtaining accurate and reliable results. In this study, three series of RADARSAT-2 SAR images were evaluated. In each of these series, the sensor configuration was fixed, but the environmental conditions differed. The effects of variable environmental conditions were also investigated on co- and cross-polarized backscattering coefficients, Freeman-Durden scattering contributions, and the pedestal height in different classes of a forest area in Ottawa, Ontario. It was observed that the backscattering coefficient of wet snow was up to 2 dB more than that of dry snow. The absence of snow also caused a decrease of up to 3 dB in the surface scattering of ground and up to 5 dB in that of trees. In addition, the backscatter coefficients of ground vegetation, hardwood species, and softwood species were more similar at temperatures below 0 degrees C than those at temperatures above 0 degrees C. Moreover, the pedestal height was generally greater at temperatures above 0 degrees C than at temperatures below 0 degrees C. Finally, the highest class separability was observed when the temperature was at or above 0 degrees C and there was no snow on the ground or trees.

TI  - Sensitivity of the tropical stratospheric ozone response to the solar rotational cycle in observations and chemistry-climate model simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical stratospheric ozone response to solar UV variations associated with the rotational cycle (similar to 27 days) is analyzed using MLS satellite observations and numerical simulations from the LMDz-Reprobus chemistry-climate model. The model is used in two configurations, as a chemistry-transport model (CTM) where dynamics are nudged toward ERA-Interim reanalysis and as a chemistry-climate model (free-running) (CCM). An ensemble of five 17-year simulations (1991-2007) is performed with the CCM. All simulations are forced by reconstructed time-varying solar spectral irradiance from the Naval Research Laboratory Solar Spectral Irradiance model. We first examine the ozone response to the solar rotational cycle during two 3-year periods which correspond to the declining phases of solar cycle 22 (October 1991-September 1994) and solar cycle 23 (September 2004-August 2007), when the satellite ozone observations of the two Microwave Limb Sounders (UARS MLS and Aura MLS) are available. In the observations, during the first period, ozone and UV flux are found to be correlated between about 10 and 1 hPa with a maximum of 0.29 at similar to 5 hPa; the ozone sensitivity (% change in ozone for 1% change in UV) peaks at similar to 0.4. Correlation during the second period is weaker and has a peak ozone sensitivity of only 0.2, possibly due to the fact that the solar forcing is weaker during that period. The CTM simulation reproduces most of these observed features, including the differences between the two periods. The CCM ensemble mean results comparatively show much smaller differences between the two periods, suggesting that the amplitude of the rotational ozone signal estimated from MLS observations or the CTM simulation is strongly influenced by other (non-solar) sources of variability, notably dynamics. The analysis of the ensemble of CCM simulations shows that the estimation of the ensemble mean ozone sensitivity does not vary significantly either with the amplitude of the solar rotational fluctuations or with the size of the time window used for the ozone sensitivity retrieval. In contrast, the uncertainty of the ozone sensitivity estimate significantly increases during periods of decreasing amplitude of solar rotational fluctuations (also coinciding with minimum phases of the solar cycle), and for decreasing size of the time window analysis. We found that a minimum of 3- and 10-year time window is needed for the 1 sigma uncertainty to drop below 50 and 20 %, respectively. These uncertainty sources may explain some of the discrepancies found in previous estimates of the ozone response to the solar rotational cycle.

TI  - Spectral-spatial feature learning for hyperspectral imagery classification using deep stacked sparse autoencoder
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is one of the most popular topics because of its intrinsic potential to gather spectral signatures of materials and provides distinct abilities to object detection and recognition. In the last decade, an enormous number of methods were suggested to classify hyperspectral remote sensing data using spectral features, though some are not using all information and lead to poor classification accuracy; on the other hand, the exploration of deep features is recently considered a lot and has turned into a research hot spot in the geoscience and remote sensing research community to enhance classification accuracy. A deep learning architecture is proposed to classify hyperspectral remote sensing imagery by joint utilization of spectral-spatial information. A stacked sparse autoencoder provides unsupervised feature learning to extract high-level feature representations of joint spectralspatial information; then, a soft classifier is employed to train high-level features and to fine-tune the deep learning architecture. Comparative experiments are performed on two widely used hyperspectral remote sensing data (Salinas and PaviaU) and a coarse resolution hyperspectral data in the long-wave infrared range. The obtained results indicate the superiority of the proposed spectral-spatial deep learning architecture against the conventional classification methods.

TI  - Global and regional estimates of warm cloud droplet number concentration based on 13 years of AQUA-MODIS observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present and evaluate a climatology of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) based on 13 years of Aqua-MODIS observations. The climatology provides monthly mean 1 x 1 degrees CDNC values plus associated uncertainties over the global ice-free oceans. All values are incloud values, i.e. the reported CDNC value will be valid for the cloudy part of the grid box. Here, we provide an overview of how the climatology was generated and assess and quantify potential systematic error sources including effects of broken clouds, and remaining artefacts caused by the retrieval process or related to observation geometry. Retrievals and evaluations were performed at the scale of initial MODIS observations (in contrast to some earlier climatologies, which were created based on already gridded data). This allowed us to implement additional screening criteria, so that observations inconsistent with key assumptions made in the CDNC retrieval could be rejected. Application of these additional screening criteria led to significant changes in the annual cycle of CDNC in terms of both its phase and magnitude. After an optimal screening was established a final CDNC climatology was generated. Resulting CDNC uncertainties are reported as monthly-mean standard deviations of CDNC over each 1 x 1 degrees grid box. These uncertainties are of the order of 30% in the stratocumulus regions and 60 to 80% elsewhere.

TI  - Evaporation from cultivated and semi-wild Sudanian Savanna in west Africa
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rain-fed farming is the primary livelihood of semi-arid west Africa. Changes in land cover have the potential to affect precipitation, the critical resource for production. Turbulent flux measurements from two eddy-covariance towers and additional observations from a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations combine to relate land cover (savanna forest and agriculture) to evaporation in a small (3.5 km(2)) catchment in Burkina Faso, west Africa. We observe larger sensible and latent heat fluxes over the savanna forest in the headwater area relative to the agricultural section of the watershed all year. Higher fluxes above the savanna forest are attributed to the greater number of exposed rocks and trees and the higher productivity of the forest compared to rain-fed, hand-farmed agricultural fields. Vegetation cover and soil moisture are found to be primary controls of the evaporative fraction. Satellite-derived vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture are determined to be good predictors of evaporative fraction, as indicators of the physical basis of evaporation. Our measurements provide an estimator that can be used to derive evaporative fraction when only NDVI is available. Such large-scale estimates of evaporative fraction from remotely sensed data are valuable where groundbased measurements are lacking, which is the case across the African continent and many other semi-arid areas. Evaporative fraction estimates can be combined, for example, with sensible heat from measurements of temperature variance, to provide an estimate of evaporation when only minimal meteorological measurements are available in remote regions of the world. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of forest fragments for climate regulation and may provide support to local decision makers and rural farmers in the maintenance of the forest areas.

TI  - Source characteristics of the 2015 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake and its <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.2 aftershock from space geodesy
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - On April 25, 2015, a destructive M-w 7.8 earthquake struck the capital of Nepal, Kathmandu, killing more than 8800 people and destroying numerous historical structures. We analyze six coseismic interferograms from several satellites (ALOS-2, Sentinel-1 A, and RADARSAT-2), as well as three-dimensional displacements at six GPS stations to investigate fault structure and slip distribution of the Gorkha earthquake. Using a layered crustal structure, the best-fit slip model shows that the preferred dip angle of the mainshock fault is 6 +/- 3.5 degrees and the major slip is concentrated within depths of 8-15 km. The maximum slip of similar to 6.0 m occurs at a depth of 11 km, 70 km south east of the epicenter. The coseismic rupture extends similar to 150 km eastward of the epicentre with a cumulative'geodetic moment of 7.8 x 10(20) Nm, equivalent to an earthquake of Mw 7.84. We also investigate the Mw 7.2 aftershock on 12 May 2015 using another three postseismic interferograms from ALOS2, RADARSAT-2, and Sentinel-1 A. The InSAR-based best-fit slip model of the largest aftershock implies that its major slip is next to the eastern lower end of the mainshock rupture with a similar maximum slip of similar to 6 mat a depth of similar to 13 km. This study generates various coseismic geodetic measurements to determine the source parameters of the Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake and 12 May Mw 72 afershock, providing an additional chance to understand the local fault structure and slip extent.

TI  - Managing fire risk during drought: the influence of certification and El Nino on fire-driven forest conversion for oil palm in Southeast Asia
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia and Malaysia have emerged as leading producers of palm oil in the past several decades, expanding production through the conversion of tropical forests to industrial plantations. Efforts to produce "sustainable" palm oil, including certification by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), include guidelines designed to reduce the environmental impact of palm oil production. Fire-driven deforestation is prohibited by law in both countries and a stipulation of RSPO certification, yet the degree of environmental compliance is unclear, especially during El Nino events when drought conditions increase fire risk. Here, we used time series of satellite data to estimate the spatial and temporal patterns of fire-driven deforestation on and around oil palm plantations. In Indonesia, fire-driven deforestation accounted for one-quarter of total forest losses on both certified and noncertified plantations. After the first plantations in Indonesia received RSPO certification in 2009, forest loss and fire-driven deforestation declined on certified plantations but did not stop altogether. Oil palm expansion in Malaysia rarely involved fire; only 5% of forest loss on certified plantations had coincident active fire detections. Interannual variability in fire detections was strongly influenced by El Nino and the timing of certification. Fire activity during the 2002, 2004, and 2006 El Nino events was similar among oil palm plantations in Indonesia that would later become certified, noncertified plantations, and surrounding areas. However, total fire activity was 75% and 66% lower on certified plantations than noncertified plantations during the 2009 and 2015 El Nino events, respectively. The decline in fire activity on certified plantations, including during drought periods, highlights the potential for RSPO certification to safeguard carbon stocks in peatlands and remaining forests in accordance with legislation banning fires. However, aligning certification standards with satellite monitoring capabilities will be critical to realize sustainable palm oil production and meet industry commitments to zero deforestation.

TI  - On the spatio-temporal representativeness of observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The discontinuous spatio-temporal sampling of observations has an impact when using them to construct climatologies or evaluate models. Here we provide estimates of this so-called representation error for a range of timescales and length scales (semi-annually down to sub-daily, 300 to 50 km) and show that even after substantial averaging of data significant representation errors may remain, larger than typical measurement errors. Our study considers a variety of observations: ground-site or in situ remote sensing (PM2.5, black carbon mass or number concentrations), satellite remote sensing with imagers or lidar (extinction). We show that observational coverage (a measure of how dense the spatio-temporal sampling of the observations is) is not an effective metric to limit representation errors. Different strategies to construct monthly gridded satellite L3 data are assessed and temporal averaging of spatially aggregated observations (super-observations) is found to be the best, although it still allows for significant representation errors. However, temporal collocation of data (possible when observations are compared to model data or other observations), combined with temporal averaging, can be very effective at reducing representation errors. We also show that ground-based and wide-swath imager satellite remote sensing data give rise to similar representation errors, although their observational sampling is different. Finally, emission sources and orography can lead to representation errors that are very hard to reduce, even with substantial temporal averaging.

TI  - Supine MRI for regional breast radiotherapy: imaging axillary lymph nodes before and after sentinel-node biopsy
T2  - PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional radiotherapy (RT) is increasingly used in breast cancer treatment. Conventionally, computed tomography (CT) is performed for RT planning. Lymph node (LN) target levels are delineated according to anatomical boundaries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could enable individual LN delineation. The purpose was to evaluate the applicability of MRI for LN detection in supine treatment position, before and after sentinel-node biopsy (SNB). Twenty-three female breast cancer patients (cTis-3N0M0) underwent 1.5 T MRI, before and after SNB, in addition to CT. Endurance for MRI was monitored. Axillary levels were delineated. LNs were identified and delineated on MRI from before and after SNB, and on CT, and compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. LN locations and LN-based volumes were related to axillary delineations and associated volumes. Although postoperative effects were visible, LN numbers on postoperative MRI (median 26 LNs) were highly reproducible compared to preoperative MRI when adding excised sentinel nodes, and higher than on CT (median 11, p < 0.001). LN-based volumes were considerably smaller than respective axillary levels. Supine MRI of LNs is feasible and reproducible before and after SNB. This may lead to more accurate RT target definition compared to CT, with potentially lower toxicity. With the MRI techniques described here, initiation of novel MRI-guided RT strategies aiming at individual LNs could be possible.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To observe the effects of axial vascular network flap of scalp or anterolateral thigh perforator flap with fascia lata on repairing defects after radical resection of scalp carcinoma in patients. Methods: From February 2006 to December 2015, twenty-one patients with scalp carcinoma were admitted to our hospital, and the carcinoma invaded external lamina or full-thickness of skull and dura mater. After perfect preoperative examination, carcinoma and scalp tissue in 3 to 5 cm from the edge of carcinoma, external lamina or full-thickness of skull and invaded dura mater were resected and sentinel lymph nodes around carcinoma were cleaned in 3 to 4 days after admission. The postoperative defects with size reached from 11 cm*8 cm to 22 cm*18 cm. The flap transplantation was performed at the same time when quick frozen pathological examination results of resected scalp carcinoma margin tissue, skull, dura mater margin and basal tissue, and sentinel lymph nodes showed completely negative. Defects in 3 elderly patients were repaired by single or multiple axial scalp vascular network flaps, with the resected flaps size ranged from 12 cm*7 cm to 19 cm*14 cm. Defects in the other 18 patients were repaired by anterolateral thigh perforator flaps with fascia lata, with the resected flaps size ranged from 13 cm*10 cm to 23 cm*19 cm and the resected fascia lata size ranged from 8 cm*7 cm to 10 cm*10 cm. The head donor site of flap was repaired by medium thickness skin of head and back; the thigh donor site of flap was repaired by medium thickness skin of thigh on the same side. All patients gave up postoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and other follow-up treatments. Results: After operation, the flap and skin in all patients survived completely, with no vascular crisis or other condition. During the follow-up for 6 months to 9 years, all patients showed good appearance except for baldness in operation area of head, with no obvious malformation in head donor site of flap and skin, no swollen external hernia in the brain tissue, and no local recurrence or distant metastasis of carcinoma. The appearance of thigh donor site of flap and skin was good, with normal muscle strength and movement of lower limbs. Conclusions: Patients with scalp carcinoma were performed with radical resection of carcinoma, and axial vascular network flap of scalp or anterolateral thigh perforator flap with fascia lata were applied to repair the postoperative defects, with good appearance of head operation area and no local recurrence or distant metastasis of carcinoma.

TI  - Optical tool for salinity detection by remote sensing spectroscopy: application on Oran watershed, Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a complex problem that affects groundwater aquifers and agricultural lands in the semiarid regions. Remote sensing and spectroscopy database systems provide accuracy for salinity autodetection and dynamical delineation. Salinity detection techniques using polychromatic wavebands by field geocomputation and experimental data are time consuming and expensive. This paper presents an automated spectral detection and identification of salt minerals using a monochromatic waveband concept from multispectral bands-Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) and spectroscopy United States Geological Survey database. For detecting mineral salts related to electrolytes, such as electronical and vibrational transitions, an integrated approach of salinity detection related to the optical monochromatic concept has been addressed. The purpose of this paper is to discriminate waveband intrinsic spectral similarity using the Beer-Lambert and Van't Hoff laws for spectral curve extraction such as transmittance, reflectance, absorbance, land surface temperature, molar concentration, and osmotic pressure. These parameters are primordial for hydrodynamic salinity modeling and continuity identification using chemical and physical approaches. The established regression fitted models have been addressed for salt spectroscopy validation for suitable calibration and validation. Furthermore, our analytical tool is conducted for better decision interface using spectral salinity detection and identification in the Oran watershed, Algeria.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Herpes Simplex Virus type-2 (HSV-2) among pregnant women who participated in a national HIV surveillance activity in Haiti
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), one the most common causes of genital ulcers, appears to increase both the risk of HIV acquisition and HIV transmission. HSV-2/HIV co-infection among pregnant women may increase the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV. This study describes rates of HSV-2 among pregnant women in Haiti and HSV-2 test performance in this population.Methods: Unlinked residual serum specimens from the 2012 National HIV and Syphilis Sentinel Surveillance Survey among pregnant women in Haiti were tested using two commercial kits (Focus HerpeSelect, Kalon) for HSV-2 antibodies. We evaluated rates of HSV-2 seropositivity and HSV-2/HIV co-infection, associations between HSV-2 and demographic characteristics using multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling, and HSV-2 test performance in this population.Results: Serum samples from 1000 pregnant women (all 164 HIV positive and 836 random HIV negative) were selected. The overall weighted prevalence of HSV-2 was 31.4% (95% CI: 27.7-35.4) and the prevalence of HIV-positivity among HSV-2 positive pregnant women was five times higher than the prevalence among HSV-2 negative women (4.8% [95% CI: 3. 9-6.0] vs. 0.9% [95% CI: 0.6-1.3], respectively). Factors significantly associated with HSV-2 positivity were HIV-positivity (PR: 2.27 [95% CI: 1.94-2.65]) and older age (PRs: 1.41 [95% CI: 1.05-1.91] for 20-24 years, 1.71 [95% CI: 1.13-2.60] for 3034 years, and 1.55 [95% CI: 1.10-2.19] for 35 years or greater]), while rural residence was negatively associated with HSV-2 positivity (PR 0.83 [95% CI: 0.69-1.00]), after controlling for other covariables. For this study a conservative Focus index cutoff of 3.5 was used, but among samples with a Focus index value >= 2.5, 98.4% had positive Kalon tests.Conclusion: The prevalence of HSV-2 is relatively high among pregnant women in Haiti. Public health interventions to increase access to HSV-2 screening in antenatal services are warranted.

TI  - Comparison of the impacts of urban development and climate change on exposing European cities to pluvial flooding
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The economic and human consequences of extreme precipitation and the related flooding of urban areas have increased rapidly over the past decades. Some of the key factors that affect the risks to urban areas include climate change, the densification of assets within cities and the general expansion of urban areas. In this paper, we examine and compare quantitatively the impact of climate change and recent urban development patterns on the exposure of four European cities to pluvial flooding. In particular, we investigate the degree to which pluvial floods of varying severity and in different geographical locations are influenced to the same extent by changes in urban land cover and climate change. We have selected the European cities of Odense, Vienna, Strasbourg and Nice for analyses to represent different climatic conditions, trends in urban development and topographical characteristics. We develop and apply a combined remote-sensing and flood-modelling approach to simulate the extent of pluvial flooding for a range of extreme precipitation events for historical (1984) and present-day (2014) urban land cover and for two climate-change scenarios (i.e. representative concentration pathways, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Changes in urban land cover are estimated using Landsat satellite imagery for the period 1984-2014. We combine the remote-sensing analyses with regionally downscaled estimates of precipitation extremes of current and expected future climate to enable 2-D overland flow simulations and flood-hazard assessments. The individual and combined impacts of urban development and climate change are quantified by examining the variations in flooding between the different simulations along with the corresponding un certainties. In addition, two different assumptions are examined with regards to the development of the capacity of the urban drainage system in response to urban development and climate change. In the "stationary" approach, the capacity resembles present-day design, while it is updated in the "evolutionary" approach to correspond to changes in imperviousness and precipitation intensities due to urban development and climate change respectively. For all four cities, we find an increase in flood exposure corresponding to an observed absolute growth in impervious surfaces of 7-12% during the past 30 years of urban development. Similarly, we find that climate change increases exposure to pluvial flooding under both the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The relative importance of urban development and climate change on flood exposure varies considerably between the cities. For Odense, the impact of urban development is comparable to that of climate change under an RCP 8.5 scenario (2081-2100), while for Vienna and Strasbourg it is comparable to the impacts of an RCP 4.5 scenario. For Nice, climate change dominates urban development as the primary driver of changes in exposure to flooding. The variation between geographical locations is caused by differences in soil infiltration properties, historical trends in urban development and the projected regional impacts of climate change on extreme precipitation. Developing the capacity of the urban drainage system in relation to urban development is found to be an effective adaptation measure as it fully compensates for the increase in runoff caused by additional sealed surfaces. On the other hand, updating the drainage system according to changes in precipitation intensities caused by climate change only marginally reduces flooding for the most extreme events.

TI  - Inconsistent estimates of forest cover change in China between 2000 and 2013 from multiple datasets: differences in parameters, spatial resolution, and definitions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese National Forest Inventory (NFI) has reported increased forest coverage in China since 2000, however, the new satellite-based dataset Global Forest Change (GFC) finds decreased forest coverage. In this study, four satellite datasets are used to investigate this discrepancy in forest cover change estimates in China between 2000 and 2013: forest cover change estimated from MODIS Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), existing MODIS Land Cover (LC) and Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) products, and the Landsat-based GFC. Among these satellite datasets, forest loss shows much better agreement in terms of total change area and spatial pattern than do forest gain. The net changes in forest cover as a proportion of China's land area varied widely from increases of 1.56% in NBR, 1.93% in VCF, and 3.40% in LC to a decline of - 0.40% in GFC. The magnitude of net forest increase derived from MODIS datasets (1.56-3.40%) is lower than that reported in NFI (3.41%). Algorithm parameters, different spatial resolutions, and inconsistent forest definitions could be important sources of the discrepancies. Although several MODIS datasets support an overall forest increase in China, the direction and magnitude of net forest change is still unknown due to the large uncertainties in satellite-derived estimates.

TI  - The contribution of human agricultural activities to increasing evapotranspiration is significantly greater than climate change effect over Heihe agricultural region
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component linking the water, energy, and carbon cycles. Understanding changes in ET and the relative contribution rates of human activity and of climate change at the basin scale is important for sound water resources management. In this study, changes in ET in the Heihe agricultural region in northwest China during 1984-2014 were examined using remotely-sensed ET data with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Correlation analysis identified the dominant factors that influence change in ET per unit area and those that influence change in total ET. Factor analysis identified the relative contribution rates of the dominant factors in each case. The results show that human activity, which includes factors for agronomy and irrigation, and climate change, including factors for precipitation and relative humidity, both contribute to increases in ET per unit area at rates of 60.93% and 28.01%, respectively. Human activity, including the same factors, and climate change, including factors for relative humidity and wind speed, contribute to increases in total ET at rates of 53.86% and 35.68%, respectively. Overall, in the Heihe agricultural region, the contribution of human agricultural activities to increased ET was significantly greater than that of climate change.

TI  - Evaluation of piperonyl butoxide in enhancing the efficacy of pyrethroid insecticides against resistant <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> <i>s.l.</i> in Ghana
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malaria vector control methods involving the use of pyrethroids remain the strategies being used against malaria vectors in Ghana. These methods include the use of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying in many areas in Ghana. However, there is evidence that pyrethroid resistance is widespread in many areas in Ghana. Synergists have been shown to be useful in inhibiting the enzymes that are responsible for the development of resistance and hence enhance the insecticide susceptibility of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) in many areas. The present study investigated the effect of piperonyl butoxide (PBO) on the susceptibility status of An. gambiae s.l. across some sentinel sites in Ghana.Methods: Three to five day old An. gambiae s.l. reared from larvae were used in WHO susceptibility tube assays. Batches of 20-25 female adult An. gambiae s.l. were exposed simultaneously to the insecticide alone and to the PBO + insecticide. The knock down rate after 60 min and mortality at 24 h were recorded.Results: Deltamethrin and permethrin resistance of An. gambiae s.l. was observed in all the sites in 2015 and 2016. The mortality after 24 h post exposure for deltamethrin ranged from 16.3% in Weija to 82.3% in Kade, whereas that for permethrin ranged from 3.8% in Gomoa Obuasi to 91.3% in Prestea. A significant increase in susceptibility to deltamethrin and less to permethrin was observed during both 2015 and 2016 years in most of the sites when An. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes were pre-exposed to PBO.Conclusion: Findings from this study showed that the use of PBO significantly enhanced the susceptibility of An. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes in most of the sentinel sites. It is recommended that vector control strategies incorporating PBO as a synergist can be effective in killing mosquitoes in the presence of deltamethrin and permethrin resistance.

TI  - Introducing navigation during melanoma-related sentinel lymph node procedures in the head-and-neck region
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intraoperative sentinel node (SN) identification in patients with head-and-neck malignancies can be challenging due to unexpected drainage patterns and anatomical complexity. Here, intraoperative navigation-based guidance technologies may provide outcome. In this study, gamma camera-based freehandSPECT was evaluated in combination with the hybrid tracer ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid.Materials and methods: Eight patients with melanoma located in the head-and-neck area were included. Indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nanocolloid was injected preoperatively, whereafter lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT imaging were performed in order to define the location of the SN(s). FreehandSPECT scans were generated in the operation room using a portable gamma camera. For lesion localization during surgery, freehandSPECT scans were projected in an augmented reality video-view that was used to spatially position a gamma-ray detection probe. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging was used to confirm the accuracy of the navigation-based approach and identify the exact location of the SNs.Results: Preoperatively, 15 SNs were identified, of which 14 were identified using freehandSPECT. Navigation towards these nodes using the freehandSPECT approach was successful in 13 nodes. Fluorescence imaging provided optical confirmation of the navigation accuracy in all patients. In addition, fluorescence imaging allowed for the identification of (clustered) SNs that could not be identified based on navigation alone.Conclusions: The use of gamma camera-based freehandSPECT aids intraoperative lesion identification and, with that, supports the transition from pre- to intraoperative imaging via augmented reality display and directional guidance.

TI  - A rare case of acute toxoplasmosis in a stray dog due to infection of <i>T.</i> <i>gondi</i>i clonal type I: public health concern in urban settings with stray animals?
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Typing of Toxoplasma gondii strains is important in epidemiological surveys, to understand the distribution and virulence of different clones of the parasite among human and animal populations. Stray dogs can be consider sentinel animals for contaminated environments playing an important but probably under-evaluated role in the epidemiology of T. gondii. We reported a rare case of acute toxoplasmosis in a stray dog due to clonal type I infection. The clonal type I, sporadic in Europe, is frequently associated with severe toxoplasmosis in humans and the control of its circulation is particularly relevant for public health. The symptomatology suggested a potential infection with the high similar parasite Neospora caninum but differential diagnosis showed that only T. gondii was involved highlighting the importance of multiple diagnostic methods beyond the clinical signs.Case presentation: A female stray dog approximately six-month of age presented muscular atrophy of the femoral region and hyperextension of hind limbs. Body condition score (BCS) was 20% below ideal weight, ribs had almost no fat and the sensor state was depressed. Haematological values were normal and the dog did not show any neurological abnormalities. Serological analysis showed a positive response for T. gondii immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and exclude N. caninum infection.To confirm T. gondii infection, a muscle biopsy was performed and genomic DNA was extracted. PCR analysis resulted positive to T. gondii and strain genotyping reveals clonal type I infection. The dog recovered after 4 weeks of treatment with clindamycin hydrochloride and aquatic physiotherapy.Conclusions: Our study reports a rare and severe case of T. gondii clonal type I infection in a stray dog feeding in garbage containers. The data confirm the importance of an in vivo early diagnosis for toxoplasmosis in dog. Clinical signs are often related to specific T. gondii genotype and parasite genotyping is important in the epidemiological survey of toxoplasmosis in public health. The detection of parasitic DNA in the tissue could be an useful diagnostic method in facilitating early treatment of the disease, which is important for a timely clinical recovery.

TI  - National-scale cropland mapping based on spectral-temporal features and outdated land cover information
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of sufficient ground truth data has always constrained supervised learning, thereby hindering the generation of up-to-date satellite-derived thematic maps. This is all the more true for those applications requiring frequent updates over large areas such as cropland mapping. Therefore, we present a method enabling the automated production of spatially consistent cropland maps at the national scale, based on spectral-temporal features and outdated land cover information. Following an unsupervised approach, this method extracts reliable calibration pixels based on their labels in the outdated map and their spectral signatures. To ensure spatial consistency and coherence in the map, we first propose to generate seamless input images by normalizing the time series and deriving spectral-temporal features that target salient cropland characteristics. Second, we reduce the spatial variability of the class signatures by stratifying the country and by classifying each stratum independently. Finally, we remove speckle with a weighted majority filter accounting for per-pixel classification confidence. Capitalizing on a wall-to-wall validation data set, the method was tested in South Africa using a 16-year old land cover map and multi-sensor Landsat time series. The overall accuracy of the resulting cropland map reached 92%. A spatially explicit validation revealed large variations across the country and suggests that intensive grain-growing areas were better characterized than smallholder farming systems. Informative features in the classification process vary from one stratum to another but features targeting the minimum of vegetation as well as short-wave infrared features were consistently important throughout the country. Overall, the approach showed potential for routinely delivering consistent cropland maps over large areas as required for operational crop monitoring.

TI  - Regional distribution of large blowdown patches across Amazonia in 2005 caused by a single convective squall line
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In mid-January 2005 a convective squall line traversed 4.5 x 10(6) km(2) of Amazonia from southwest to northeast. As seen in Landsat images, this atypical convective storm left blowdown imprints with diffuse geometry, unlike the fan-shaped wind disturbance of much more frequent east-to-west propagating squall lines. Previous work reported 0.2% of the forest area damaged by this one relatively rare event within one Landsat image and assumed similar disturbance across the entire traverse. We mapped convective wind damage impact to the region in 2005 by identifying large-scale (>4 ha) blowdown imprints in 30 Landsat images. The diffuse-type imprints associated with this single squall line contributed up to 60-72% of total 2005 wind-disturbed area detected across the region, but damage was highly concentrated in central Amazonia. Consequently, the distribution of large wind damage patches in 2005 across Amazonia was very different from long-term average. Regional distribution of wind-driven tree mortality for smaller patch sizes remains unknown.

TI  - Springtime major pollution events by aerosol over Paris Area: From a case study to a multiannual analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A study of the intense spring pollution events occurring between 2007 and 2016 on the Paris Area is presented using ground-based and spaceborne measurements. Emphasis is placed on 2011 where data included ground-based lidar measurements. This last period corresponds with the highest regional pollution levels of the past decade. The information threshold (daily average of (mass concentration of particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10m) PM10>50gm(-3)) was exceeded 16 times, while the alert threshold (daily average of PM10>80gm(-3)) was exceeded twice. The information (alert) threshold exists to protect the most fragile people (the entire population). Ground-based and spaceborne measurements demonstrate the benefit of their synergy as each is representative of specific space and time scales. The operational products of the spaceborne instruments Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer are used. For 2011, CALIOP vertical profiles are inversed to assess the backscatter to extinction ratio, which is then successfully compared with similar results derived from the CALIOP operational products, a ground-based lidar and Sun photometers. The aerosols are identified to be polluted continental and polluted dust aerosols following the criteria used for the inversion of the CALIOP profiles. Aerosol typing is consistent between the ground-based and spaceborne lidars, demonstrating the importance of CALIOP for other years where the ground-based lidar was not in operation. The main pollution sources responsible for the spring aerosol pollution, occurring during anticyclonic meteorological conditions, are identified as coming from Western Europe: Benelux, Rhine-Ruhr area, and the Lorraine area.

TI  - Remote estimation of colored dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll-a in Lake Huron using Sentinel-2 measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Colored dissolved organic matter ( CDOM) and chlorophyll-a (Chla) are important water quality parameters and play crucial roles in aquatic environment. Remote sensing of CDOM and Chla concentrations for inland lakes is often limited by low spatial resolution. The newly launched Sentinel-2 satellite is equipped with high spatial resolution (10, 20, and 60 m). Empirical band ratio models were developed to derive CDOM and Chla concentrations in Lake Huron. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used for model calibration and validation. The best CDOM retrieval algorithm is a B3/B5 model with accuracy coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.884, root-mean-squared error (RMSE) = 0.731 m(-1), relative root-meansquared error (RRMSE) = 28.02%, and bias = -0.1 m(-1). The best Chla retrieval algorithm is a B5/B4 model with accuracy R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 9.972 mg/m(3), RRMSE = 48.47%, and bias = -0.116 mg/m(3). Neural network models were further implemented to improve inversion accuracy. The applications of the two best band ratio models to Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m x 10 m pixel size presented the high potential of the sensor for monitoring water quality of inland lakes.

TI  - Characterizing the information content of cloud thermodynamic phase retrievals from the notional PACE OCI shortwave reflectance measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We rigorously quantify the probability of liquid or ice thermodynamic phase using only shortwave spectral channels specific to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, and the notional future Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem imager. The results show that two shortwave-infrared channels (2135 and 2250nm) provide more information on cloud thermodynamic phase than either channel alone; in one case, the probability of ice phase retrieval increases from 65 to 82% by combining 2135 and 2250nm channels. The analysis is performed with a nonlinear statistical estimation approach, the GEneralized Nonlinear Retrieval Analysis (GENRA). The GENRA technique has previously been used to quantify the retrieval of cloud optical properties from passive shortwave observations, for an assumed thermodynamic phase. Here we present the methodology needed to extend the utility of GENRA to a binary thermodynamic phase space (i.e., liquid or ice). We apply formal information content metrics to quantify our results; two of these (mutual and conditional information) have not previously been used in the field of cloud studies.

TI  - An assessment of thin cloud detection by applying bidirectional reflectance distribution function model-based background surface reflectance using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI): A case study for South Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a new assessment of thin cloud detection with the application of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model-based background surface reflectance was undertaken by interpreting surface spectra characterized using the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) over a land surface area. Unlike cloud detection over the ocean, the detection of cloud over land surfaces is difficult due to the complicated surface scattering characteristics, which vary among land surface types. Furthermore, in the case of thin clouds, in which the surface and cloud radiation are mixed, it is difficult to detect the clouds in both land and atmospheric fields. Therefore, to interpret background surface reflectance, especially underneath cloud, the semiempirical BRDF model was used to simulate surface reflectance by reflecting solar angle-dependent geostationary sensor geometry. For quantitative validation, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data were used to make a comparison with the proposed cloud masking result. As a result, the new cloud masking scheme resulted in a high probability of detection (POD=0.82) compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (POD=0.808) for all cloud cases. In particular, the agreement between the CALIPSO cloud product and new GOCI cloud mask was over 94% when detecting thin cloud (e.g., altostratus and cirrus) from January 2014 to June 2015. This result is relatively high in comparison with the result from the MODIS Collection 6 cloud mask product (MYD35).

TI  - Snow thickness profiling on Antarctic sea ice with GPR-Rapid and accurate measurements with the potential to upscale needles to a haystack
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow thickness on sea ice is a largely undersampled parameter yet of importance for the sea ice mass balance and for satellite-based sea ice thickness estimates and thus our general understanding of global ice volume change. Traditional direct thickness measurements with meter sticks can provide accurate but only spot information, referred to as "needles" due to their pinpoint focus and information, while airborne and satellite remote sensing snow products, referred to as "the haystack," have large uncertainties due to their scale. We demonstrate the remarkable accuracy and applicability of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) snow thickness measurements by comparing them with in situ meter stick data from two field campaigns to Antarctica in late winter/early spring. The efficiency and millimeter-to-centimeter accuracy of GPR enables practitioners to acquire extensive, semiregional data with the potential to upscale needles to the haystack and to potentially calibrate satellite remote sensing products that we confirm to derive roughly 30% of the in situ thickness. We find the radar wave propagation velocity in snow to be rather constant (+/- 6%), encouraging regional snow thickness surveys. Snow thinner than 10 cm is under the detection limit with the off-the-shelf GPR setup utilized in our study.Plain Language Summary Snow on sea ice, especially on Antarctic sea ice, plays a significant role in climate analysis due to its contribution to the mass and volume balance of the cryosphere. The thickness of snow on sea ice is not known in full detail as it is hard to derive from satellite data. Based on an extensive data set from two Antarctic winter/spring expeditions, we show the efficiency and accuracy of ground-penetrating radar to map snow thickness on a semiregional scale. Such surveys could potentially be extended to larger scales and contribute to satellite snow thickness algorithm calibration schemes.

TI  - The OCO-2 oxygen A-band response to liquid marine cloud properties from CALIPSO and MODIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectra of reflected sunlight in the oxygen A-band contain information about cloud properties such as cloud top pressure, optical depth, and pressure thickness. Here we show, for the first time, that high-spectral-resolution A-band Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) spectra respond largely as simulated to the optical properties of water clouds over ocean during November 2015 (N=184,318) using input cloud properties from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization on Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). In A-band continuum channels the standard deviation of simulated minus observed radiance is 37%. Selecting horizontally homogeneous clouds to mitigate three-dimensional cloud effects and collocation error with the other satellites, the standard deviation of the residuals is reduced to 18%. Using a look-up table developed from simulations, OCO-2's estimated cloud top pressure for low clouds (P-top>680hPa) has a standard deviation of 61hPa relative to CALIPSO retrievals, and bias is dependent on assumed cloud pressure thickness, with our smallest value being -5hPa. Versus MODIS optical depth, the standard deviation is 9.0 and the bias is -2.0, although these shrink for clouds of styled-content style-type=mathematics 30. These values include collocation error between the different satellites, meaning that they place an upper bound on the OCO-2 retrieval uncertainty. The theoretical precision limit from OCO-2's instrumental uncertainty is shown to be +/- 2.4hPa in above-cloud path and +/- 0.2% in optical depth for a two-channel retrieval. Options for retrieving cloud optical depth, cloud top pressure, and pressure thickness are discussed in the context of a formal OCO-2 cloud property retrieval.

TI  - Correlations of oriented ice and precipitation in marine midlatitude low clouds using collocated CloudSat, CALIOP, and MODIS observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In April 2006, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) launched aboard the CALIPSO satellite and into the A-Train constellation of satellites with its transmitter pointed near nadir. This proved problematic due to specular reflection from horizontally oriented ice crystals occurring more frequently than expected. Because the specular backscatter from oriented ice crystals has large attenuated backscatter and almost no depolarization, the standard lidar inversions cannot be applied. To mitigate this issue, the CALIOP transmitter was moved to 3 degrees off nadir in November 2007. Though problematic for global CALIOP retrievals, the sensitivity to oriented ice during the first year of observations provides a unique data set to investigate scenes of this ice crystal signature. This study focuses on the CALIOP-oriented signature that occurs in midlatitude ocean regions whose cloud tops are relatively warm and low, existing below 6km. A significant seasonal dependence is found in the Northern Hemisphere with up to 19% of clouds below 6km yielding specular reflection by CALIOP during the colder months. In contrast, the Southern Hemisphere lacks such seasonal dependence and sees fewer oriented ice crystals. Using collocated CloudSat observations with both CALIOP and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), we investigate the correlations of the oriented signature with MODIS cloud properties. Comparing with CloudSat precipitation retrievals, we find that the oriented signature is strongly correlated with surface precipitation with 64% of CALIOP-oriented ice crystal cases precipitating compared to 40% for nonoriented cases.

TI  - Dust load and rainfall characteristics and their relationship over the South Asian monsoon region under various warming scenarios
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Present study investigates the similarities and differences in the pattern of dust load and rainfall and their relationship over the South Asian monsoon region under various future warming scenarios with respect to the historical period using multiple coupled climate model runs that participated in Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Based on statistically robust significance tests, we unravel several likely changes in the pattern of the dust load and rainfall over the South Asia under different future warming scenarios by the end of 21st century compared to the historical period. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results reveal a significant change (at 5% significance level) in the amount of dust and rainfall under different warming scenarios over the study region. Northern part of the Indian subcontinent is likely to witness increased dust loading in future, and regions with increase in dust load are also likely to be the regions of increased rainfall over North India. Positive correlation between rainfall over the Indian region and dust over the Arabian region is also likely to strengthen in future. Considerable changes in the spatial correlation pattern between dust and rainfall are noted under different representative concentration pathways; however, no noteworthy changes are recorded in their temporal relationship. Notable intermodel differences in the patterns of dust load and rainfall relationship over South Asia are possibly caused by variations in the dust emission schemes among the CMIP5 models as well as the parameterization of aerosol indirect effect in addition to the differences in the meteorology simulated by various models under identical forcing scenarios.

TI  - Serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in children ≤ 5 years with invasive pneumococcal disease in India - A systematic review
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of childhood diseases that result in significant morbidity and mortality in India. Commercially licensed and available pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) include ten (PCV-10) and 13 (PCV-13) pneumococcal serotypes. Vaccines with other serotype combinations are under development. Reviewing and reporting trends and distribution of pneumococcal serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease in India will be useful for policy making as PCV is being introduced into India's universal immunization program.Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of hospital based observational studies (both peer reviewed and gray literature published in English) from India available from January 1990 to December 2016. Studies that documented data on the prevalence of serotype distribution and the antimicrobial resistance pattern of S. pneumoniae in children <= 5 years of age were included.Result: We screened a total number of 116 studies, of which 109 studies were excluded. Final analysis included seven studies. The most frequent pneumococcal serotypes causing invasive disease among children <= 5 years were 14, 1, 19F, 6B, 5, 6A, 9V and 23F. Serotype 14 and 19A were represented in most of the geographical regions studied in the reviewed articles. Currently available PCV formulations included 67.3-78.4% of all serotypes contributing to IPD among Indian children <= 5 years. Pneumococcal resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin and cefotaxime was seen in 81%, 37%, 10%, 8%, 6% and 4% of all pneumococcal isolates respectively, while vancomycin resistance was not reported.Conclusion: The present review demonstrates that up to 78.4% of reported invasive pneumococcal disease in children <= 5 years in India are currently caused by serotypes that are included in the available licensed PCVs. However, sentinel surveillance must be continued in representative parts of the country to assess the changing trends in distribution of pneumococcal serotypes and their implication for vaccine selection and rollout in India.

TI  - The El Nino-Southern Oscillation effect on tropical outgoing longwave radiation: A daytime versus nighttime perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Trends of tropical (30 degrees N-30 degrees S) mean daytime and nighttime outgoing longwave radiations (OLRs) from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) are analyzed using data from 2003 to 2013. Both the daytime and nighttime OLRs from these instruments show decreasing trends because of El Nino conditions early in the period and La Nina conditions at the end. However, the daytime and nighttime OLRs decrease at different rates with the OLR decreasing faster during daytime than nighttime. The daytime-nighttime OLR trend is consistent across CERES Terra, Aqua observations, and computed OLR based upon AIRS and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals. To understand the cause of the differing decreasing rates of daytime and nighttime OLRs, high cloud fraction and effective temperature are examined using cloud retrievals from MODIS and AIRS. Unlike the very consistent OLR trends between CERES and AIRS, the trends in cloud properties are not as consistent, which are likely due to the different cloud retrieval methods used. When MODIS and AIRS cloud properties are used to compute OLR, the daytime and nighttime OLR trends based upon MODIS cloud properties are approximately half as large as the trends from AIRS cloud properties, but their daytime-nighttime OLR trends are in agreement. This demonstrates that though the current cloud retrieval algorithms lack the accuracy to pinpoint the changes of daytime and nighttime clouds in the tropics, they do provide a radiatively consistent view for daytime and nighttime OLR changes. The causes for the larger decreasing daytime OLR trend than that for nighttime OLR are not clear and further studies are needed.Plain Language Summary In this study, trends of tropical (30 degrees N-30 degrees S) mean daytime and nighttime outgoing longwave radiations (OLRs) from the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instruments are analyzed using data from January 2003 to December 2013. Both the daytime and the nighttime OLR data records from these instruments show decreasing trends owing to the occurrence of El Nino conditions early in the period and La Nina conditions at the end. However, the daytime and nighttime OLRs decrease at different rates with the daytime OLR decreasing faster than the nighttime OLR. The daytime-nighttime OLR trend is consistent across CERES Terra, Aqua observations, and computed OLR based upon AIRS and MODIS retrievals. Cloud retrievals from multiple satellite sensors are examined to understand the cause of the changes in OLR.

TI  - Quantifying black carbon deposition over the Greenland ice sheet from forest fires in Canada
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Black carbon (BC) concentrations observed in 22 snowpits sampled in the northwest sector of the Greenland ice sheet in April 2014 have allowed us to identify a strong and widespread BC aerosol deposition event, which was dated to have accumulated in the pits from two snow storms between 27 July and 2 August 2013. This event comprises a significant portion (57% on average across all pits) of total BC deposition over 10 months (July 2013 to April 2014). Here we link this deposition event to forest fires burning in Canada during summer 2013 using modeling and remote sensing tools. Aerosols were detected by both the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (on board CALIPSO) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Aqua) instruments during transport between Canada and Greenland. We use high-resolution regional chemical transport modeling (WRF-Chem) combined with high-resolution fire emissions (FINNv1.5) to study aerosol emissions, transport, and deposition during this event. The model captures the timing of the BC deposition event and shows that fires in Canada were the main source of deposited BC. However, the model underpredicts BC deposition compared to measurements at all sites by a factor of 2-100. Underprediction of modeled BC deposition originates from uncertainties in fire emissions and model treatment of wet removal of aerosols. Improvements in model descriptions of precipitation scavenging and emissions from wildfires are needed to correctly predict deposition, which is critical for determining the climate impacts of aerosols that originate from fires.

TI  - Estimation of optimal dispersion model source parameters using satellite detections of volcanic ash
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we demonstrate how parameters describing the geometry of the volcanic ash source for a particular volcanic ash dispersion model (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT)) may be inferred by the use of satellite data and multiple trial simulations. The areas of space likely to be contaminated by ash are identified with the aid of various remote sensing techniques, and polygons are drawn around these areas as they would be in an operational setting. Dispersion model simulations are initialized by either a cylindrical source or a specified ash distribution depending on the context. Parameters of interest such as the base and top height, diameter, and optimal release time of the cylindrical source or the height of the specified ash distribution are inferred by forming a parameter grid and running multiple simulations for each parameter grid point value. Optimal values of the parameter values are identified by calculating spatial correlations between the model simulations and observations. We demonstrate that the methodology can be used to correctly infer various model parameters and improve volcanic ash forecasts in various eruption case studies.Plain Language Summary Airborne volcanic ash is a hazard to aviation. Accurate forecasts of airspace likely to be contaminated by ash are therefore crucial for effective risk management. In this paper we show how information about the location of ash-contaminated areas at times prior to the issuance of the latest forecast can be used to estimate various model parameters that are not easily obtained by other means such as the height of the ash column at the volcano. This in turn leads to better forecasts of ash transport. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using several case studies.

TI  - Relative risk estimation of dengue disease at small spatial scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dengue is a high incidence arboviral disease in tropical countries around the world. Colombia is an endemic country due to the favourable environmental conditions for vector survival and spread. Dengue surveillance in Colombia is based in passive notification of cases, supporting monitoring, prediction, risk factor identification and intervention measures. Even though the surveillance network works adequately, disease mapping techniques currently developed and employed for many health problems are not widely applied. We select the Colombian city of Bucaramanga to apply Bayesian areal disease mapping models, testing the challenges and difficulties of the approach.Methods: We estimated the relative risk of dengue disease by census section (a geographical unit composed approximately by 1-20 city blocks) for the period January 2008 to December 2015. We included the covariates normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST), obtained by satellite images. We fitted Bayesian areal models at the complete period and annual aggregation time scales for 2008-2015, with fixed and space-varying coefficients for the covariates, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we used Cohen's Kappa agreement measures to compare the risk from year to year, and from every year to the complete period aggregation.Results: We found the NDVI providing more information than LST for estimating relative risk of dengue, although their effects were small. NDVI was directly associated to high relative risk of dengue. Risk maps of dengue were produced from the estimates obtained by the modeling process. The year to year risk agreement by census section was sligth to fair.Conclusion: The study provides an example of implementation of relative risk estimation using Bayesian models for disease mapping at small spatial scale with covariates. We relate satellite data to dengue disease, using an areal data approach, which is not commonly found in the literature. The main difficulty of the study was to find quality data for generating expected values as input for the models. We remark the importance of creating population registry at small spatial scale, which is not only relevant for the risk estimation of dengue but also important to the surveillance of all notifiable diseases.

TI  - Fire spread predictions: Sweeping uncertainty under the rug
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting fire spread and behavior correctly is crucial to minimize the dramatic consequences of wildfires. However, our capability of accurately predicting fire spread is still very limited, undermining the utility of such simulations to support decision-making. Improving fire spread predictions for fire management purposes, by using higher quality input data or enhanced models, can be expensive, unfeasible or even impossible. Fire managers would benefit from fast and inexpensive ways of improving their decision-making. In the present work, we focus on i) understanding if fire spread predictions can be improved through model parameter calibration based on information collected from a set of large historical wildfires in Portugal; and ii) understanding to what extent decreasing parametric uncertainty can counterbalance the impact of input data uncertainty. Our results obtained with the Fire Area Simulator (FARSITE) modeling system show that fire spread predictions can be continuously improved by 'learning' from past wildfires. The uncertainty contained in the major input variables (wind speed and direction, ignition location and fuel models) can be 'swept under the rug' through the use of more appropriate parameter sets. The proposed framework has a large potential to improve future fire spread predictions, increasing their reliability and usefulness to support fire management and decision making processes, thus potentially reducing the negative impacts of wildfires.

We extracted prospectively acquired Australian surveillance data from 2 studies nested within the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) network: the Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN) study and the Australian Childhood Encephalitis (ACE) study between 2013 and 2015. We described the clinical features and severity of IAND in children, including influenza-associated encephalitis/encephalopathy (IAE). We calculated the proportion of hospitalized influenza that is associated with IAND and IAE, and incidence of IAE.Results. Over 3 influenza seasons, we identified 54 cases of IAND at 2 tertiary children's hospitals from Australia that accounted for 7.6% of hospitalized influenza. These included 10 cases of IAE (1.4% hospitalized influenza). The mean annual incidence of IAE among Australian children (aged <= 14 years) was 2.8 per 1 000 000. The spectrum of IAND was broad and included IAE (n = 10) including distinct acute encephalopathy syndromes, simple febrile seizures (n = 14), other seizures (n = 16), acute ataxia (n = 4), and other subacute syndromes (transverse myelitis [n = 1], opsoclonus myoclonus [n = 1]). Two-thirds of children with IAND were aged <= 4 years; less than half had preexisting neurological disease or other risk factors for severe influenza. IAE caused death or neurological morbidity in half of cases.Conclusions. Seasonal influenza is an important cause of acute neurological disease in Australian children. The spectrum of seasonal IAND appears similar to that described during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. IAE is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Some unique surface patterns on ignimbrites on Earth: A "bird's eye" view as a guide for planetary mappers
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Observations of terrestrial analogs are critical to aiding planetary mappers in interpreting surface lithologies on other planets. For instance, the presence of ignimbrites on Mars has been debated for over three decades and is supported by analogy with deposits on Earth. Critical evidence includes the geomorphic and surface expression of the deposits, and those in the Central Andes of South America are amongst the most-cited analogs. Herein we describe some prominent surface textures and patterns seen in ignimbrites on the scale of high-resolution remotely sensed data (10-1 m per pixel). These include pervasive joints and fractures that contribute to yardang form and development as well as prominent mounds, fissures, and fracture networks ("spiders", "bugs", "boxworks") on ignimbrite surfaces. While all these features are related to intrinsic cooling and degassing processes, the involvement of external water buried by hot pyroclastic flows enhances fumarolic activity, advective cooling, and joint development. Observations of these geomorphic expressions using remote sensing are only possible with the highest resolution data and limited surface erosion. For Mars, where similarly high resolution datasets are available (for example, the High Resolution Imaging Sensor Experiment or HiRISE) extensive dust cover may limit the recognition of similar features there. However significant relief on some of these features on Earth indicate they might still be detectable on Mars. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Applicability of different non-invasive methods for tree mass estimation: A review
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Biomass estimations of trees are used at various different special scales. Along with the scale, there are diverse demands on accuracy and technical requirements. This paper reports the state of the art of different methods for non-invasive tree mass estimation technics. Different studies about biomass estimations at different spatial scales were compared on basis of three assessment criteria: accuracy, efficiency, and technical requirements. Publications were searched via Google Scholar, Web of Science and ScienceDirect including years from 1980 to 2016. References of 20 studies could be used to compare 10 methods of biomass estimation.Allometric approaches are comparably accurate but are suitable for small area applications only. Remote sensing techniques are less accurate but more efficient. Lidar and SfM appear to be the most efficient and most accurate techniques for medium sized area applications. Especially SfM applications are promising due to lower technical requirements. Optical images are suitable for coarse but large area applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Snow observations in Mount Lebanon (2011-2016)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - We present a unique meteorological and snow observational dataset in Mount Lebanon, a mountainous region with a Mediterranean climate, where snowmelt is an essential water resource. The study region covers the recharge area of three karstic river basins (total area of 1092 km(2) and an elevation up to 3088 m). The dataset consists of (1) continuous meteorological and snow height observations, (2) snowpack field measurements, and (3) medium-resolution satellite snow cover data. The continuous meteorological measurements at three automatic weather stations (MZA, 2296 m; LAQ, 1840 m; and CED, 2834 m a.s.l.) include surface air temperature and humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, incoming and reflected shortwave irradiance, and snow height, at 30 min intervals for the snow seasons (November-June) between 2011 and 2016 for MZA and between 2014 and 2016 for CED and LAQ. Precipitation data were filtered and corrected for Geonor under-catch. Observations of snow height (HS), snow water equivalent, and snow density were collected at 30 snow courses located at elevations between 1300 and 2900m a.s.l. during the two snow seasons of 2014-2016 with an average revisit time of 11 days. Daily gap-free snow cover extent (SCA) and snow cover duration (SCD) maps derived from MODIS snow products are provided for the same period (2011-2016). We used the dataset to characterize mean snow height, snow water equivalent (SWE), and density for the first time in Mount Lebanon. Snow seasonal variability was characterized with high HS and SWE variance and a relatively high snow density mean equal to 467 kgm(-3). We find that the relationship between snow depth and snow density is specific to the Mediterranean climate. The current model explained 34% of the variability in the entire dataset (all regions between 1300 and 2900m a.s.l.) and 62% for high mountain regions (elevation 2200-2900 m a.s.l.). The dataset is suitable for the investigation of snow dynamics and for the forcing and validation of energy balance models. Therefore, this dataset bears the potential to greatly improve the quantification of snowmelt and mountain hydrometeorological processes in this data-scarce region of the eastern Mediterranean.

TI  - Evaluation of the influence of surfactants in the bioaccumulation kinetics of sulfamethoxazole and oxazepam in benthic invertebrates
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential ecotoxicological effects of mixtures of contaminants in the aquatic environment are generating a global concern. Benthic invertebrates, such as the crustacean Gammarus fossarum, are key in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and are frequently used as sentinel species of water quality status. The aim of this work was to study the effects of amixture of themost frequently detected surfactants in the bioconcentration kinetics of two pharmaceuticals in G. fossarum, evaluating their potential enhancing or suppressing effects. Laboratory exposure experiments for both pharmaceuticals and surfactants (concentration ratio 1: 25) were set up for two individual compounds, the anxiolytic oxazepam and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole. Gammarid samples were processed using microQuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) extraction. Pharmaceuticals concentration in the organisms was followed-up by means of nanoliquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). Results indicated a similar mode of action of the surfactants in the bioconcentration kinetics of both drugs, decreasing the accumulation rate in the organism. Oxazepam showed a higher accumulation potential than sulfamethoxazole in all cases. Depuration experiments for oxazepam also demonstrated the high depurative capacity of gammarids, eliminating N50% of the concentration of oxazepam in <6 h. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evidence for ice-ocean albedo feedback in the Arctic Ocean shifting to a seasonal ice zone
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice-albedo feedback due to the albedo contrast between water and ice is a major factor in seasonal sea ice retreat, and has received increasing attention with the Arctic Ocean shifting to a seasonal ice cover. However, quantitative evaluation of such feedbacks is still insufficient. Here we provide quantitative evidence that heat input through the open water fraction is the primary driver of seasonal and interannual variations in Arctic sea ice retreat. Analyses of satellite data (1979-2014) and a simplified ice-upper ocean coupled model reveal that divergent ice motion in the early melt season triggers large-scale feedback which subsequently amplifies summer sea ice anomalies. The magnitude of divergence controlling the feedback has doubled since 2000 due to a more mobile ice cover, which can partly explain the recent drastic ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean.

TI  - Remote sensing and water quality indicators in the Korean West coast: Spatio-temporal structures of MODIS-derived chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow Sea is a shallow marginal sea with a large tidal range. In this study, ten areas located along the western coast of the Korean Peninsula are investigated with respect to remotely sensed water quality indicators derived from NASA MODIS aboard of the satellite Aqua. We found that there was a strong seasonal trend with spatial heterogeneity. In specific, a strong six-month phase-lag was found between chlorophyll-a and total suspended solid owing to their inversed seasonality, which could be explained by different dynamics and environmental settings. Chlorophyll-a concentration seemed to be dominantly influenced by temperature, while total suspended solid was largely governed by local tidal forcing and bottom topography. This study demonstrated the potential and applicability of satellite products in coastal management, and highlighted find that remote-sensing would be a promising tool in resolving orthogonality of large spatio-temporal scale variabilities when combining with proper time series analyses.

TI  - Detections and simulations of tropospheric water vapor fluctuations due to trapped lee waves by ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ScanSAR interferometry
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed wave-like spatial patterns of atmospheric propagation delay signals associated with mountain lee waves were detected in Hokkaido and Tohoku by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) with the ScanSAR mode observation data of a Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 on board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2. Both cases occurred under stable atmosphere conditions. The InSAR-observed peak-to-trough line of sight changes in the mountain wave signals was 4 and 5 cm with the horizontal wavelengths of 9 and 15 km in Hokkaido and Tohoku, respectively. Locations of positive phase maxima in the mountain wave signals coincides with locations of cloud streets observed by visible satellite imagery, indicating that crests of mountain waves contain relatively much water vapor compared with wave troughs. Numerical weather simulations with the horizontal grid spacing of 1 km were performed to reproduce InSAR phase variations, and as a result those simulations could reasonably reproduce observed wave amplitudes and wavelengths in both cases. On the other hand, numerical simulations tended to overestimate wave attenuation rates: simulated mountain waves decreased as the wave propagated faster than those of observed signals. Because the simulated wave attenuation rate is sensitive to physics in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), we investigated the reproducibility of five PBL schemes implemented in the WRF model. As a result, all the PBL schemes showed little attenuation except for the Yonsei University scheme (YSU), while the wavelength in the YSU was most close to the observation. Our study demonstrated the uniqueness and usefulness of InSAR for meteorological application as the ability to map the detailed water vapor distribution regardless of cloud cover. In addition, the reasonable reproducibility of the water vapor delay signal due to lee waves by the numerical weather model encourages researchers who tackle the correction of the tropospheric propagation delay, increasing the accuracy in detecting surface deformations.

TI  - Changing Dynamics of HIV Transmission in Cote d'Ivoire: Modeling Who Acquired and Transmitted Infections and Estimating the Impact of Past HIV Interventions (1976-2015)
T2  - JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Understanding the impact of past interventions and how it affected transmission dynamics is key to guiding prevention efforts. We estimated the population-level impact of condom, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and prevention of mother-to-child transmission activities on HIV transmission and the contribution of key risk factors on HIV acquisition and transmission.Methods: An age-stratified dynamical model of sexual and vertical HIV transmission among the general population, female sex workers (FSW), and men who have sex with men was calibrated to detailed prevalence and intervention data. We estimated the fraction of HIV infections averted by the interventions, and the fraction of incident infections acquired and transmitted by different populations over successive 10-year periods (1976-2015).Results: Overall, condom use averted 61% (95% credible intervals: 56%-66%) of all adult infections during 1987-2015 mainly because of increased use by FSW (46% of infections averted). In comparison, ART prevented 15% (10%-19%) of adult infections during 2010-2015. As a result, FSW initially (1976-1985) contributed 95% (91%-97%) of all new infections, declining to 19% (11%-27%) during 2005-2015. Older men and clients mixing with non-FSW are currently the highest contributors to transmission. Men who have sex with men contributed <= 4% transmissions throughout. Young women (15-24 years; excluding FSW) do not transmit more infections than they acquired.Conclusions: Early increases in condom use, mainly by FSW, have substantially reduced HIV transmission. Clients of FSWs and older men have become the main source of transmission, whereas young women remain at increased risk. Strengthening prevention and scaling-up of ART, particularly to FSW and clients of female sex workers, is important.

TI  - Coupled LAI assimilation and BEPS model for analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern and heterogeneity of carbon fluxes of the bamboo forest in Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo forests are widely distributed in the tropical and sub-tropical regions, and have a great carbon sequestration capacity. However, the carbon dynamics of bamboo forest are still poorly understood. This study developed an algorithm for assimilating LAI dynamics based on an integrated ensemble Kalman filter using MODIS LAI data, MODIS reflectance data, and canopy reflectance data modeled by PROSAIL for two typical bamboo forests. The assimilated LAI was highly consistent with the observed LAI, yielding correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84 and 0.94 for Moso bamboo forest and Lei bamboo forest, respectively. Then, the spatiotemporal pattern of the CO2 fluxes within bamboo forest were modeled for Zhejiang Province during 2011-2014 using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator model driven by assimilated LAI. The modeled CO2 fluxes were in agreement with the CO2 fluxes measured by eddy covariance technology at two selected sites within the study region. Average r, absolute deviation, and root mean square error values were 0.77, 0.65 g C m(-2) day(-1), and 0.82 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Bamboo stands with high Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) values were found to be distributed throughout mountainous areas in the northwest, southwest, and northeast of Zhejiang, while low NEE stands were located in the mountain basin areas, high altitude areas, and the majority of coastal areas. Among the eleven cities in Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou was the highest annual total NEE city (0.34 +/- 0.06 Tg C yr(-1)), and Huzhou was the highest NEE density city (7.65 +/- 1.02 Mg C hm(-2) yr(-1)). The carbon sequestrated by bamboo forest was 1.74 Tg C yr(-1), accounted 6.36 Tg CO2 yr(-1), which indicated the bamboo forested area in Zhejiang Province was a carbon sink. The spatial heterogeneity of CO2 fluxes of bamboo forest can be revealed by an exponential semivariance model. The analysis of the model structure indicated that the spatial heterogeneity of CO2 fluxes of bamboo forest was characterized by significant autocorrelation, with an average autocorrelation range of 3.00 km, however the effect of random factors (management levels, management measures, etc.) cannot be ignored. This is the first time that the CO2 fluxes of bamboo forest in Zhejiang Province have been mapped and this study provides a new estimate of CO2 fluxes in this region.

TI  - Glacial lake inventory and lake outburst potential in Uzbekistan
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has been shown to increase the number of mountain lakes across various mountain ranges in the World. In Central Asia, and in particular on the territory of Uzbekistan, a detailed assessment of glacier lakes and their evolution over time is, however lacking. For this reason we created the first detailed inventory of mountain lakes of Uzbekistan based on recent (2002-2014) satellite observations usingWorldView-2, SPOT5, and IKONOS imagery with a spatial resolution from 2 to 10 m. This record was complemented with data from field studies of the last 50 years. The previous data were mostly in the form of inventories of lakes, available in Soviet archives, and primarily included localized in-situ data. The inventory of mountain lakes presented here, by contrast, includes an overview of all lakes of the territory of Uzbekistan. Lakes were considered if they were located at altitudes above 1500 m and if lakes had an area exceeding 100 m(2). As in other mountain regions of the World, the ongoing increase of air temperatures has led to an increase in lake number and area. Moreover, the frequency and overall number of lake outburst events have been on the rise as well. Therefore, we also present the first outburst assessment with an updated version of well-known approaches considering local climate features and event histories. As a result, out of the 242 lakes identified on the territory of Uzbekistan, 15% are considered prone to outburst, 10% of these lakes have been assigned low outburst potential and the remainder of the lakes have an average level of outburst potential. We conclude that the distribution of lakes by elevation shows a significant influence on lake area and hazard potential. No significant differences, by contrast, exist between the distribution of lake area, outburst potential, and lake location with respect to glaciers by regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases of dogs in North-west New South Wales and the Northern Territory, Australia
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vector-borne diseases of dogs in Australian Aboriginal communities are relatively unexplored. These dogs represent a unique group with variable ecto-and endo-parasitic burdens, nutritional stresses and a general lack of veterinary intervention. We investigated haemoprotozoal and bacterial pathogen prevalences in relation to erythrocyte and platelet numbers in dogs from North-West New South Wales (N-W NSW) and the Northern Territory (NT; Central Australia).Methods: Real-time PCR (qPCR) amplification of Anaplasma platys, Babesia vogeli, Mycoplasma haemocanis, Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum and Bartonella spp., serological screening for Coxiella burnetii, and Bartonella spp. and haematological analyses were performed on dogs from the two cohorts (96 dogs in total). Brucella suis serology was determined additionally for the N-W NSW cohort.Results: Anaplasma platys (n = 26 dogs), Babesia vogeli (n = 7), Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum (n = 10 dogs), and Mycoplasma haemocanis (n = 14) were detected in the sample population (n = 96) using qPCR. There were significant associations between (i) A. platys and anaemia (OR 8.7, CI 2.4-31.7; P < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (OR 12.1, CI 3.4-43.2; P < 0.001) and breed (OR 16.1, CI 2.1-121.5; P = 0.007), and (ii) between B. vogeli and anaemia (OR 11.8, CI 2.3-61.6; P = 0.003). Neither protozoal nor bacterial DNA loads, estimated using qPCR, were positively correlated with anaemia or thrombocytopenia. Haemotropic mycoplasmas were not associated with any haematologic abnormality. Four dogs from the NT were seropositive for Coxiella burnetii, while no dogs were seropositive for Brucella suis or to a panel of Bartonella spp. antigens. Despite directed efforts, Bartonella DNA was not detected in blood from any of the cohorts studied. A sample of dogs from the NT recruited specifically for Bartonella a proteobacteria growth medium enrichment blood culture were also Bartonella PCR negative.Conclusions: Vector-borne pathogens occur in dogs free ranging near Aboriginal communities, with higher detection rates in NT than N-W NSW. The preponderant haematologic abnormalities were anaemia and thrombocytopenia, likely attributable to A. platys and B. vogeli infections, but also probably affected by nutritional, parasitic, lactational and environmental stressors. The absence of Bartonella spp. is of importance to the Australian setting, and work needs to be extended to tropical coastal communities where fleas are present as well as ticks. Dogs living in and around Aboriginal communities may provide valuable sentinel information on disease infection status of human public health significance.

TI  - Improving global terrestrial evapotranspiration estimation using support vector machine by integrating three process-based algorithms
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) for each plant functional type (PFT) is a key variable for linking the energy, water and carbon cycles of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. Process-based algorithms have been widely used to estimate global terrestrial ET, yet each ET individual algorithm has exhibited large uncertainties. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) method was introduced to improve global terrestrial ET estimation by integrating three process-based ET algorithms: MOD16, PT-JPL and SEMI-PM. At 200 FLUXNET flux tower sites, we evaluated the performance of the SVM method and others, including the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method and the general regression neural networks (GRNNs) method together with three process-based ET algorithms. We found that the SVM method was superior to all other methods we evaluated. The validation results showed that compared with the individual algorithms, the SVM method driven by tower-specific (Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, MERRA) meteorological data reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) by approximately 0.20 (0.15) mm/day for most forest sites and 0.30 (0.20) mm/day for most crop and grass sites and improved the squared correlation coefficient (R-2) by approximately 0.10 (0.08) (95% confidence) for most flux tower sites. The water balance of basins and the global terrestrial ET calculation analysis also demonstrated that the regional and global estimates of the SVM-merged ET were reliable. The SVM method provides a powerful tool for improving global ET estimation to characterize the long-term spatiotemporal variations of the global terrestrial water budget.

AB  - We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems for FY 2018. Some of these changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Pathway for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform Act of 2013, the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, the 21st Century Cures Act, and other legislation. We also are making changes relating to the provider-based status of Indian Health Service (IHS) and Tribal facilities and organizations and to the low-volume hospital payment adjustment for hospitals operated by the IHS or a Tribe. In addition, we are providing the market basket update that will apply to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits for FY 2018. We are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) for FY 2018.  In addition, we are establishing new requirements or revising existing requirements for quality reporting by specific Medicare providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, LTCHs, and inpatient psychiatric facilities). We also are establishing new requirements or revising existing requirements for eligible professionals (EPs), eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) participating in the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs. We are updating policies relating to the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program.  We also are making changes relating to transparency of accrediting organization survey reports and plans of correction of providers and suppliers; electronic signature and electronic submission of the Certification and Settlement Summary page of the Medicare cost reports; and clarification of provider disposal of assets.

TI  - Prognostic Value of Multiple Draining lymph node Basins in Melanoma: a Matched-Pair analysis Based on the John Wayne cancer institute experience
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The prognostic significance of multiple draining basins is controversial in melanoma because analyses have not adequately controlled for standard prognostic variables. We hypothesized that an analysis based on prognostically matched pairs of patients with multiple versus single drainage basins would clarify any independent role of basin number.study design: We identified patients in our 40-year prospective database, who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative sentinel node biopsy and wide local excision for cutaneous melanoma. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared in patients with multiple versus single drainage basins after matching by age, sex, Breslow depth, primary site, and stage at diagnosis.Results: We identified 274 patients with multibasin drainage and 1,413 patients with single draining lymph node basins. Matching yielded 259 pairs (226 trunk, 27 head/neck, 6 extremity). Among matched pairs, multibasin drainage did not affect rates of lymph node metastasis (p = 0.84), OS (p = 0.23), DSS (p = 0.53), overall recurrence (p = 0.65), locoregional recurrence (p = 0.58), or distant recurrence (p = 1.0). Multivariable analysis linked higher T stage, ulceration, older age, and lymph node positivity to decreased DSS (p < 0.01) and DFS (p < 0.001). Number of drainage basins was not significant on univariable or multivariable analysis.conclusion: This analysis, the first to match for standard prognostic factors, suggests that multiplebasin drainage as identified by lymphoscintigraphy has no independent biological or prognostic significance in primary cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Peripheral Isolates as Sources of Adaptive Diversity under Climate Change
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - As climate change progresses, there is increasing focus on the possibility of using targeted gene flow (TGF, the movement of pre-adapted individuals into declining populations) as a management tool. Targeted gene flow is a relatively cheap, low-risk management option, and will almost certainly come into increased use over the coming decades. Before such action can be taken, however, we need to know where to find pre-adapted individuals. We argue that, for many species, the obvious place to look for this diversity is in peripheral isolates: isolated populations at the current edges of a species' range. Both evolutionary and ecological considerations suggest that the bulk of a species' adaptive variation may be contained in the total set of these peripheral isolates. Moreover, by exploring both evolutionary and ecological perspectives it becomes clear that we should be able to assess the potential value of each isolate using remotely sensed data and three measurable axes of variation in patch traits: population size, connectivity, and climatic environment. Locating the "sweet spot" in this trait space, however, remains a challenge. Throughout, we illustrate these ideas using Australia's Wet Tropics rainforests as a model system.

TI  - Current approach of the axilla in patients with early-stage breast cancer.
T2  - Lancet (London, England)
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - The surgical approach of the axilla in patients with early-stage breast cancer has witnessed considerable evolution during the past 25 years. The previously undisputed gold standard of axillary-lymph-node dissection for staging has now been replaced by sentinel-lymph-node biopsy for patients with clinically negative axilla. For selected patients with limited sentinel-lymph-node involvement, completion axillary-lymph-node dissection can be omitted or replaced by axillary radiotherapy, reducing morbidity. The clinical interest of axillary staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is increasing and this approach might contribute to morbidity reduction, and to the further tailoring of future systemic and locoregional treatment decisions by response assessment. Refinement of the sentinel-lymph-node biopsy technique might overcome the slightly impaired success rates in this setting. New techniques for lymphatic mapping attempt to further simplify the procedure. In view of the declining influence of axillary nodal status on adjuvant therapy decision-making, ongoing clinical trials will evaluate whether sentinel-lymph-node biopsy can be avoided altogether in selected patients.

TI  - Clinical and molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistant falciparum malaria in Myanmar (2009-2013)
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Emergence of artemisinin-resistant malaria in Southeast Asian countries threatens the global control of malaria. Although K13 kelch propeller has been assessed for artemisinin resistance molecular marker, most of the mutations need to be validated. In this study, artemisinin resistance was assessed by clinical and molecular analysis, including k13 and recently reported markers, pfarps10, pffd and pfmdr2.Methods: A prospective cohort study in 1160 uncomplicated falciparum patients was conducted after treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), in 6 sentinel sites in Myanmar from 2009 to 2013. Therapeutic efficacy of ACT was assessed by longitudinal follow ups. Molecular markers analysis was done on all available day 0 samples.Results: True recrudescence treatment failures cases and day 3 parasite positivity were detected at only the southern Myanmar sites. Day 3 positive and k13 mutants with higher prevalence of underlying genetic foci predisposing to become k13 mutant were detected only in southern Myanmar since 2009 and comparatively fewer mutations of pfarps10, pffd, and pfmdr2 were observed in western Myanmar. K13 mutations, V127M of pfarps10, D193Y of pffd, and T448I of pfmdr2 were significantly associated with day 3 positivity (OR: 6.48, 3.88, 2.88, and 2.52, respectively).Conclusions: Apart from k13, pfarps10, pffd and pfmdr2 are also useful for molecular surveillance of artemisinin resistance especially where k13 mutation has not been reported. Appropriate action to eliminate the resistant parasites and surveillance on artemisinin resistance should be strengthened in Myanmar.

TI  - Advanced Photoacoustic Imaging Applications of Near-Infrared Absorbing Organic Nanoparticles
T2  - SMALL
M3  - Review
AB  - Progress of nanotechnology in recent years has stimulated fast development of nanoparticles in biomedical research. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging as an emerging non-invasive technique in molecular imaging has improved imaging depth relative to conventional optical imaging, demonstrating great potential in clinical applications. The convergence of nanotechnology and PA imaging has enabled a broad spectrum of new opportunities in fundamental biology and translation medicine. This review focuses on the recent advances of organic nanoparticles in PA imaging applications. Near-infrared absorbing organic nanoparticles are classified and discussed according to their different imaging applications, which include tumor imaging, gastrointestinal imaging, sentinel lymph node imaging, disease microenvironment imaging and real-time drug imaging. The chemistry and PA properties of organic nanoparticles are discussed in details to highlight their own merits, and their challenges and perspectives in PA imaging are also discussed.

TI  - Burnout Disrupts Anxiety Buffer Functioning Among Nurses: A Three-Way Interaction Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 40 years, job burnout has attracted a great deal of attention among researchers and practitioners and, after decades of research and interventions, it is still regarded as an important issue. With the aim of extending the Anxiety Buffer Disruption Theory (ABDT), in this paper we argue that high levels of burnout may disrupt the anxiety buffer functioning that protects people from death concerns. ABDT was developed from Terror Management Theory (TMT). According to TMT, reminders of one's mortality are an essential part of humans' daily experience and have the potential to awake paralyzing fear and anxiety. In order to cope with death concerns, people typically activate an anxiety-buffering system centered on their cultural worldview and self-esteem. Recent ABDT research shows that individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder are unable to activate such anxiety buffering defenses. In line with these results, we hypothesized that the burnout syndrome may have similar effects, and that individuals with higher levels of burnout will be less likely to activate an anxiety buffering response when their mortality is made salient. Participants were 418 nurses, who completed a questionnaire including: a mortality salience (MS) manipulation, a delay manipulation, and measures of burnout, work-related self-efficacy, and representation of oneself as a valuable caregiver. Nurses are daily exposed both to the risk of burnout and to mortality reminders, and thus constituted an ideal population for this study. In line with an anxiety buffer disruption hypothesis, we found a significant three-way interaction between burnout, MS and delay. Participants with lower levels of burnout reported higher levels of self-efficacy and a more positive representation as caregivers in the MS condition compared to the control condition, when there was a delay between MS manipulation and the assessment of the dependent measures. The difference was non-significant for participants with higher levels of burnout. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

TI  - A reduction in malaria transmission intensity in Northern Ghana after 7 years of indoor residual spraying
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is being implemented as one of the malaria prevention methods in the Northern Region of Ghana. Changes in longevity, sporozoite and entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) of major malaria vectors were monitored to assess the impact of IRS in selected districts.Methods: Monthly human landing catches (HLCs) were used to collect mosquitoes from sentinel sites in three adjacent districts between July 2009 and December 2014: Savelugu Nanton (SND) where IRS had been implemented from 2008 to 2014; Tolon Kumbungu (TKD) where IRS had been implemented between 2008 and 2012 and Tamale Metropolis (TML) with no history of IRS. Mosquitoes were morphologically identified to species level and into sibling species, using PCR. Samples of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) were examined for parity and infectivity. EIR was calculated from biting and infectivity rates of malaria vectors.Results: Parity rates of An. gambiae s.l. decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) in SND from 44.8% in 2011 to 28.1% by 2014, and in TKD from 53.3% in 2011 to 46.6% in 2012 (p = 0.001). However 2 years after IRS was discontinued in TKD, the proportion of parous An. gambiae s.l. increased significantly to 68.5% in 2014 (p < 0.0001). Parity rates in the unsprayed district remained high throughout the study period, ranging between 68.6% in 2011 and 72.3% in 2014. The sum of monthly EIRs post-IRS season (July-December) in SND ranged between 2.1 and 6.3 infective bites/person/season (ib/p/s) during the 3 years that the district was sprayed with alphacypermethrin. EIR in SND was reduced to undetectable levels when the insecticide was switched to pirimiphos methyl CS in 2013 and 2014. Two years after IRS was withdrawn from TKD the sum of monthly EIRs (July-December) increased by about fourfold from 41.8 ib/p/s in 2012 to 154.4 ib/p/s in 2014. The EIR in the control area, TML, ranged between 35 ib/p/s in 2009 to 104.71 ib/p/s by 2014.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that IRS application did have a significant impact on entomological indicators of malaria transmission in the IRS project districts of Northern Ghana. Transmission indicators increased following the withdrawal of IRS from Tolon Kumbungu District.

AB  - A healthy 56-year-old postmenopausal woman discovered a palpable mass at the one o'clock position of the left breast. After an initial biopsy confirmed breast cancer, she underwent mastectomy and axillary node dissection for a left-sided breast cancer that measured 3.5 cm. There was extensive lymphovascular invasion. Pathology review indicated a poorly differentiated, grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ (largest focus, 3.5 cm). The margins were negative. Two of the 11 axillary lymph nodes contained metastatic carcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies previously obtained on the core biopsy indicated that the tumor was positive for estrogen receptor expression (50%), negative for progesterone receptor expression, and had a Ki-67 score of 60%. There was no amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu gene. Staging scans were negative for metastatic disease. Our multidisciplinary tumor board recommended adjuvant chemotherapy, postmastectomy radiation therapy, and endocrine therapy.A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with a palpable mass of the right breast. An initial core biopsy confirmed carcinoma in the breast. She underwent quadrantectomy and axillary node dissection. The final pathology report disclosed a moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (diameter, 2.5 cm). The margins were negative. None of the three sentinel lymph nodes contained metastatic carcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the tumor was positive for estrogen receptor expression (90%) and for progesterone receptor expression (40%) and had a Ki-67 score of 20%. There was no amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu gene. Staging scans were negative for metastatic disease. A genomic assay was obtained and suggested an intermediate to high risk of recurrence. Her past medical history was notable for hypertension and moderately overweight status (body mass index, 39 kg/m(2)). Our multidisciplinary tumor board recommended adjuvant chemotherapy, postsurgical radiation therapy, and endocrine therapy.

TI  - Understanding of morphometric features for adequate water resource management in arid environments
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological characteristics such as topographic parameters, drainage attributes, and land use/land cover patterns are essential to evaluate the water resource management of a watershed area. In the current study, delineation of a watershed and calculation of morphometric characteristics were undertaken using the ASTER global digital elevation model (GDEM). The drainage density of the basin was estimated to be very high, which indicates that the watershed possesses highly permeable soils and low to medium relief. The stream order of the area ranges from first to sixth order, showing a semi-dendritic and radial drainage pattern that indicates heterogeneity in textural characteristics, and it is influenced by structural characteristics in the study area. The bifurcation ratio (Rb) of the basin ranges from 2.0 to 4.42, and the mean bifurcation ratio is 3.84 in the entire study area, which signifies that the drainage pattern of the entire basin is controlled much more by the lithological and geological structure. The elongation ratio is 0.14, which indicates that the shape of the basin has a narrow and elongated shape. A land use/land cover map was generated by using a Landsat-8 image acquired on 10 August 2015 and classified to distinguish mainly the alluvial deposit from the mountainous rock.

TI  - Prognostic significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations in melanoma: a German study from routine care
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hotspot mutations of the oncogenes BRAF and NRAS are the most common genetic alterations in cutaneous melanoma. Specific inhibitors of BRAF and MEK have shown significant survival benefits in large phase III trials. However, the prognostic significance of BRAF and NRAS mutations outside of clinical trials remains unclear.Methods: The mutational status of BRAF (exon 15) and NRAS (exon 2 and 3) was determined in melanoma samples of 217 patients with pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing. The genotypes were correlated with clinical outcomes and pathologic features of the primary tumors. Time to disease progression was calculated with the cumulative incidence function. Survival analyses were performed with Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Relative survival was calculated with the Ederer-II method. Treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) was allowed.Results: Mutations in BRAF and NRAS were identified in 40.1 and 24.4% of cases, respectively. Concurrent mutations in both genes were detected in further 2.3%. The remaining 33.2% were wild type for the investigated exons (WT). BRAF mutations were significantly associated with younger age at first diagnosis (p < 0.001) and truncal localization of the culprit primary (p = 0.002). The nodular subtype was most common in the NRAS cohort. In addition, NRAS-mutant melanoma patients showed a higher frequency of nodal relapse (p = 0.013) and development of metastatic disease (p = 0.021). The time to loco- regional nodal relapse was shortest in NRAS-mutant melanoma (p = 0.002). Presence of NRAS mutation was an independent risk factor for disease progression in multivariate analysis (HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.02-3.98). BRAF-mutant melanoma patients showed a tendency for better overall and relative survival. Genotype was not a consistent risk factor in multivariate analysis. Instead, positive sentinel lymph node status (HR 2.65; 95% CI 1.15-6.10) and treatment with ICB in stage IV disease (HR 0.17; 95% CI 0.06-0.48) were significant multivariate risk factors.Conclusion: NRAS-mutant tumors tended to behave more aggressively particularly in early stages of the disease in this high-risk melanoma population. Treatment with immune checkpoint blockade improved survival in stage IV disease in a real-world setting.

AB  - Objective: To understand the dominant pathogens of febrile respiratory syndrome (FRS) patients in Gansu province and to establish the Bayes discriminant function in order to identify the patients infected with the dominant pathogens. Methods: FRS patients were collected in various sentinel hospitals of Gansu province from 2009 to 2015 and the dominant pathogens were determined by describing the composition of pathogenic profile. Significant clinical variables were selected by stepwise discriminant analysis to establish the Bayes discriminant function. Results: In the detection of pathogens for FRS, both influenza virus and rhinovirus showed higher positive rates than those caused by other viruses (13.79%, 8.63%), that accounting for 54.38%, 13.73% of total viral positive patients. Most frequently detected bacteria would include Streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenza (44.41%, 18.07%) that accounting for 66.21% and 24.55% among the bacterial positive patients. The original-validated rate of discriminant function, established by 11 clinical variables, was 73.1%, with the cross-validated rate as 70.6%. Conclusion: Influenza virus, Rhinovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were the dominant pathogens of FRS in Gansu province. Results from the Bayes discriminant analysis showed both higher accuracy in the classification of dominant pathogens, and applicative value for FRS.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2014/15 influenza epidemic caused a work overload for healthcare facilities in France. The French national public health agency announced the start of the epidemic - based on indicators aggregated at the national level - too late for many hospitals to prepare. It was therefore decided to improve the influenza alert procedure through (i) the introduction of a pre-epidemic alert level to better anticipate future outbreaks, (ii) the regionalisation of surveillance so that healthcare structures can be informed of the arrival of epidemics in their region, (iii) the standardised use of data sources and statistical methods across regions. A web application was developed to deliver statistical results of three outbreak detection methods applied to three surveillance data sources: emergency departments, emergency general practitioners and sentinel general practitioners. This application was used throughout the 2015/16 influenza season by the epidemiologists of the headquarters and regional units of the French national public health agency. It allowed them to signal the first influenza epidemic alert in week 2016-W0(3), in Brittany, with 11 other regions in pre-epidemic alert. This application received positive feedback from users and was pivotal for coordinating surveillance across the agency's regional units.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the epidemiologic and behavioral characteristics of HIV among community population in Liangshan prefecture. Methods: We collected social demographic, behavioral and serological information by means of the monitoring questionnaire and serological tests. Data was analyzed by using the chi-square test and logistic regression. Results: From April to June of 2010 to 2015, 14 092 cases of community population were selected as the study objects, with 267 cases diagnosed as HIV positive patients. The HIV positive rates were 3.24%, 3.07%, 1.17%, 1.38%,1.42% and 1.25%, respectively. We observed that when community population having the following characteristics as: living in Butuo country (OR=3.83), being males (OR=1.77), being Yi nationality (OR=4.40) being widowed (OR=28.57), with history of drug abuse (OR=3.71) or injecting drug use (PWID) (OR=4.92), or history of needle sharing among PWID (OR=8.53), were under higher risks for HIV infection. With histories as: having had secondary or above levels of schooling (OR=0.59), having protected sex with regular partners (OR=0.21) and with non-regular partners (OR=0.46), they seemed to be somehow protected for getting HIV infection. Conclusion: The positive HIV rates of HIV among community population in Dechang, Ningnan and Butuo varied from 0.10% to 8.77% while the HIV transmission among general population remained challenging.

TI  - Network analysis of inter-organizational relationships and policy use among active living organizations in Alberta, Canada
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Coordinated partnerships and collaborations can optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of service and program delivery in organizational networks. However, the extent to which organizations are working together to promote physical activity, and use physical activity policies in Canada, is unknown. This project sought to provide a snapshot of the funding, coordination and partnership relationships among provincial active living organizations (ALOs) in Alberta, Canada. Additionally, the awareness, and use of the provincial policy and national strategy by the organizations was examined.Methods: Provincial ALOs (N = 27) answered questions regarding their funding, coordination and partnership connections with other ALOs in the network. Social network analysis was employed to examine network structure and position of each ALO. Discriminant function analysis determined the extent to which degree centrality was associated with the use of the Active Alberta (AA) policy and Active Canada 20/20 (AC 20/20) strategy.Results: The funding network had a low density level (density = .20) and was centralized around Alberta Tourism Parks and Recreation (ATPR; degree centralization = 48.77%, betweenness centralization = 32.43%). The coordination network had a moderate density level (density = .31), and was low-to-moderately centralized around a few organizations (degree centralization = 45.37%, betweenness centrality = 19.92%). The partnership network had a low density level (density = .15), and was moderate-to-highly centralized around ATPR. Most organizations were aware of AA (89%) and AC 20/20 (78%), however more were using AA (67%) compared to AC 20/20 (33%). Central ALOs in the funding network were more likely to use AA and AC 20/20. Central ALOs in the coordination network were more likely to use AC 20/20, but not AA.Conclusions: Increasing formal and informal relationships between organizations and integrating disconnected or peripheral organizations could increase the capacity of the network to promote active living across Alberta. Uptake of the AA policy within the network is high and appears to be facilitated by the most central ALO. Promoting policy use through a central organization appeared to be an effective strategy for disseminating the province-level physical activity policy and could be considered as a policy-uptake strategy by other regions.

TI  - Understanding the drivers of marine liquid-water cloud occurrence and properties with global observations using neural networks
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of aerosols, clouds and their interactions with radiation remain among the largest unknowns in the climate system. Even though the processes involved are complex, aerosol-cloud interactions are often analyzed by means of bivariate relationships. In this study, 15 years (2001-2015) of monthly satellite-retrieved near-global aerosol products are combined with reanalysis data of various meteorological parameters to predict satellite-derived marine liquid-water cloud occurrence and properties by means of region-specific artificial neural networks. The statistical models used are shown to be capable of predicting clouds, especially in regions of high cloud variability. On this monthly scale, lower-tropospheric stability is shown to be the main determinant of cloud fraction and droplet size, especially in stratocumulus regions, while boundary layer height controls the liquid-water amount and thus the optical thickness of clouds. While aerosols show the expected impact on clouds, at this scale they are less relevant than some meteorological factors. Global patterns of the derived sensitivities point to regional characteristics of aerosol and cloud processes.

TI  - Selective targeting of melanoma using <i>N</i>-(2-diethylaminoethyl) 4-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluoroethoxy benzamide (4-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]FEBZA): a novel PET imaging probe
T2  - EJNMMI RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to develop a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probe that is easy to synthesize and selectively targets melanoma in vivo. Herein, we report the synthesis and preclinical evaluation of N-(2-diethylaminoethyl) 4-[F-18]Fluoroethoxy benzamide (4-[F-18]FEBZA). A one-step synthesis was developed to prepare 4-[F-18]FEBZA in high radiochemical yields and specific activity. The binding affinity, the in vitro binding, and internalization studies were performed using B16F1 melanoma cell line. The biodistribution studies were performed in C57BL/6 normal mice, C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F1 melanoma tumor xenografts, and nu/nu athymic mice bearing HT-29 human adenocarcinoma tumor and C-32 amelanotic melanoma tumor xenografts. MicroPET studies were performed in mice bearing B16F1 and HT-29 tumor xenografts.Results: 4-[F-18]FEBZA was prepared in 53 +/- 14% radiochemical yields and a specific activity of 8.7 +/- 1.1 Ci/mu mol. The overall synthesis time for 4-[F-18]FEBZA was 54 +/- 7 min. The in vitro binding to B16F1 cells was 60.03 +/- 0.48% after 1 h incubation at 37 degrees C. The in vivo biodistribution studies show a rapid and high uptake of F-18 in B16F1 tumor with 8.66 +/- 1.02% IA/g in this tumor at 1 h. In contrast, the uptake at 1 h in HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma and C-32 amelanotic melanoma tumors was significantly lower with 3.68 +/- 0.47% IA/g and 3.91 +/- 0.23% IA/g in HT-29 and C-32 tumors, respectively. On microPET images, the melanoma tumor was clearly visible by 10 min post-injection and the intensity in the tumor continued to increase with time. In contrast, the HT-29 tumor was not visible on the microPET scans.Conclusions: A rapid and facile synthesis of 4-[F-18]FEBZA is developed. This method offers a reliable production of 4-[F-18]FEBZA in high radiochemical yields and specific activity. A high binding affinity to melanoma cells and high uptake in tumor was noted. The microPET scan clearly delineates the melanoma tumor by 10 min post-injection. The results from these preclinical studies support the potential of 4-[F-18]FEBZA as an effective probe to image melanoma.

TI  - Molecular and Biochemical Methods Useful for the Epigenetic Characterization of Chromatin-Associated Proteins in Bivalve Molluscs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bivalve molluscs constitute a ubiquitous taxonomic group playing key functions in virtually all ecosystems, and encompassing critical commercial relevance. Along with a sessile and filter-feeding lifestyle in most cases, these characteristics make bivalves model sentinel organisms routinely used for environmental monitoring studies in aquatic habitats. The study of epigenetic mechanisms linking environmental exposure and specific physiological responses (i.e., environmental epigenetics) stands out as a very innovative monitoring strategy, given the role of epigenetic modifications in acclimatization and adaptation. Furthermore, the heritable nature of many of those modifications constitutes a very promising avenue to explore the applicability of epigenetic conditioning and selection in management and restoration strategies. Chromatin provides a framework for the study of environmental epigenetic responses. Unfortunately, chromatin and epigenetic information are very limited in most non-traditional model organisms and even completely lacking in most environmentally and ecologically relevant organisms. The present work aims to provide a comprehensive and reproducible experimental workflow for the study of bivalve chromatin. First, a series of guidelines for the molecular isolation of genes encoding chromatin-associated proteins is provided, including information on primers suitable for conventional PCR, Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE), genome walking and quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments. This section is followed by the description of methods specifically developed for the analysis of histone and SNBP proteins in different bivalve tissues, including protein extraction, purification, separation and immunodetection. Lastly, information about available antibodies, their specificity and performance is also provided. The tools and protocols described here complement current epigenetic analyses (usually limited to DNA methylation) by incorporating the study of structural elements modulating chromatin dynamics.

TI  - Temporal and spatial distribution characteristics in the natural plague foci of Chinese Mongolian gerbils based on spatial autocorrelation
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The nest flea index of Meriones unguiculatus is a critical indicator for the prevention and control of plague, which can be used not only to detect the spatial and temporal distributions of Meriones unguiculatus, but also to reveal its cluster rule. This research detected the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the plague natural foci of Mongolian gerbils by body flea index from 2005 to 2014, in order to predict plague outbreaks.Methods: Global spatial autocorrelation was used to describe the entire spatial distribution pattern of the body flea index in the natural plague foci of typical Chinese Mongolian gerbils. Cluster and outlier analysis and hot spot analysis were also used to detect the intensity of clusters based on geographic information system methods. The quantity of M. unguiculatus nest fleas in the sentinel surveillance sites from 2005 to 2014 and host density data of the study area from 2005 to 2010 used in this study were provided by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Results: The epidemic focus regions of the Mongolian gerbils remain the same as the hot spot regions relating to the body flea index. High clustering areas possess a similar pattern as the distribution pattern of the body flea index indicating that the transmission risk of plague is relatively high. In terms of time series, the area of the epidemic focus gradually increased from 2005 to 2007, declined rapidly in 2008 and 2009, and then decreased slowly and began trending towards stability from 2009 to 2014. For the spatial change, the epidemic focus regions began moving northward from the southwest epidemic focus of the Mongolian gerbils from 2005 to 2007, and then moved from north to south in 2007 and 2008.Conclusions: The body flea index of Chinese gerbil foci reveals significant spatial and temporal aggregation characteristics through the employing of spatial autocorrelation. The diversity of temporary and spatial distribution is mainly affected by seasonal variation, the human activity and natural factors.

TI  - An A-train and MERRA view of cloud, thermodynamic, and dynamic variability within the subtropical marine boundary layer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global-scale patterns and covariances of subtropical marine boundary layer (MBL) cloud fraction and spatial variability with atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamic fields remain poorly understood. We describe an approach that leverages coincident NASA A-train and the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) data to quantify the relationships in the subtropical MBL derived at the native pixel and grid resolution. A new method for observing four subtropical oceanic regions that capture transitions from stratocumulus to trade cumulus is demonstrated, where stratocumulus and cumulus regimes are determined from infrared-based thermodynamic phase. Visible radiances are normally distributed within stratocumulus and are increasingly skewed away from the coast, where trade cumulus dominates. Increases in MBL depth, wind speed, and effective radius (r(e)), and reductions in 700-1000 hPa moist static energy differences and 700 and 850 hPa vertical velocity correspond with increases in visible radiance skewness. We posit that a more robust representation of the cloudy MBL is obtained using visible radiance rather than retrievals of optical thickness that are limited to a smaller subset of cumulus. The method using the combined A-train and MERRA data set has demonstrated that an increase in r(e) within shallow cumulus is strongly related to higher MBL wind speeds that further correspond to increased precipitation occurrence according to CloudSat, previously demonstrated with surface observations. Hence, the combined data sets have the potential of adding global context to process-level understanding of the MBL.

TI  - Temporal characteristics of atmospheric ammonia and nitrogen dioxide over China based on emission data, satellite observations and atmospheric transport modeling since 1980
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - China is experiencing intense air pollution caused in large part by anthropogenic emissions of reactive nitrogen (N-r). Atmospheric ammonia (NH3 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 are the most important precursors for N-r compounds (including N2O5, HNO3, HONO and particulate NO3- and NH4+) in the atmosphere. Understanding the changes in NH3 and NO2 has important implications for the regulation of anthropogenic N-r emissions and is a requirement for assessing the consequence of environmental impacts. We conducted the temporal trend analysis of atmospheric NH3 and NO2 on a national scale since 1980 based on emission data (during 1980-2010), satellite observation (for NH3 since 2008 and for NO2 since 2005) and atmospheric chemistry transport modeling (during 2008-2015).Based on the emission data, during 1980-2010, significant continuous increasing trends in both NH3 and NOx were observed in REAS (Regional Emission inventory in Asia, for NH3 0.17 and for NOx 0.16 kgNha(-1) yr(-2) and EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, for NH3 0.24 and for NOx 0.17 kgNha(-1) yr(-2) over China. Based on the satellite data and atmospheric chemistry transport model (CTM) MOZART-4 (Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers, version 4), the NO2 columns over China increased significantly from 2005 to 2011 and then decreased significantly from 2011 to 2015; the satellite-retrieved NH3 columns from 2008 to 2014 increased at a rate of 2.37% yr(-1). The decrease in NO2 columns since 2011 may result from more stringent strategies taken to control NOx emissions during the 12th Five Year Plan, while no control policy has focused on NH3 emissions. Our findings provided an overall insight into the temporal trends of both NO2 and NH3 since 1980 based on emission data, satellite observations and atmospheric transport modeling. These findings can provide a scientific background for policy makers that are attempting to control atmospheric pollution in China. More-over, the multiple datasets used in this study have implications for estimating long-term N-r deposition datasets to assess its impact on soil, forest, water and greenhouse balance.

TI  - Open-source sea ice drift algorithm for Sentinel-1 SAR imagery using a combination of feature tracking and pattern matching
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - An open-source sea ice drift algorithm for Sentinel-1 SAR imagery is introduced based on the combination of feature tracking and pattern matching. Feature tracking produces an initial drift estimate and limits the search area for the consecutive pattern matching, which provides small- to medium-scale drift adjustments and normalised cross-correlation values. The algorithm is designed to combine the two approaches in order to benefit from the respective advantages. The considered feature-tracking method allows for an efficient computation of the drift field and the resulting vectors show a high degree of independence in terms of position, length, direction and rotation. The considered pattern-matching method, on the other hand, allows better control over vector positioning and resolution. The preprocessing of the Sentinel-1 data has been adjusted to retrieve a feature distribution that depends less on SAR backscatter peak values. Applying the algorithm with the recommended parameter setting, sea ice drift retrieval with a vector spacing of 4aEuro<overline>km on Sentinel-1 images covering 400aEuro<overline>kmaEuro<overline> x aEuro<overline>400aEuro<overline>km, takes about 4aEuro<overline>min on a standard 2.7aEuro<overline>GHz processor with 8aEuro<overline>GB memory. The corresponding recommended patch size for the pattern-matching step that defines the final resolution of each drift vector is 34aEuro<overline> x aEuro<overline>34 pixels (2.7aEuro<overline> x aEuro<overline>2.7aEuro<overline>km). To assess the potential performance after finding suitable search restrictions, calculated drift results from 246 Sentinel-1 image pairs have been compared to buoy GPS data, collected in 2015 between 15 January and 22 April and covering an area from 80.5 to 83.5A degrees aEuro<overline>N and 12 to 27A degrees aEuro<overline>E. We found a logarithmic normal distribution of the displacement difference with a median at 352.9aEuro<overline>m using HV polarisation and 535.7aEuro<overline>m using HH polarisation. All software requirements necessary for applying the presented sea ice drift algorithm are open-source to ensure free implementation and easy distribution.

TI  - Field evaluation of two commercial mosquito traps baited with different attractants and colored lights for malaria vector surveillance in Thailand
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sampling for adult mosquito populations is a means of evaluating the efficacy of vector control operations. The goal of this study was to evaluate and identify the most efficacious mosquito traps and combinations of attractants for malaria vector surveillance along the Thai-Myanmar border.Methods: In the first part of the study, the BG-Sentinel(TM) Trap (BGS Trap) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light trap (CDC LT) baited with different attractants (BG-lure (R) and CO2) were evaluated using a Latin square experimental design. The six configurations were BGS Trap with BG-lure, BGS Trap with BG-lure plus CO2, BGS Trap with CO2, CDC LT with BG-lure, CDC LT with BG lure plus CO2, and CDC LT with CO2. The second half of the study evaluated the impact of light color on malaria vector collections. Colors included the incandescent bulb, ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diode (LED), green light stick, red light stick, green LED, and red LED.Results: A total of 8638 mosquitoes consisting of 42 species were captured over 708 trap-nights. The trap types, attractants, and colored lights affected numbers of female anopheline and Anopheles minimus collected (GLM, P < 0.01). Results revealed that BGS Trap captured many anophelines but was significantly less than the CDC LT. The CDC LT, when baited with BG-lure plus CO2 captured the greatest number of anopheline females with a catch rate significantly higher than the CDC LT baited with BG-lure or CO2 alone (P < 0.05). The number of anopheline females collected from the CDC LT baited with CO2 was greater than the CDC LT baited with BG-lure (646 vs 409 females). None of the alternative lights evaluated exceeded the performance of the incandescent light bulb in terms of the numbers of anopheline and An. minimus collected.Conclusion: We conclude that the CDC LT augmented with an incandescent light shows high potential for malaria vector surveillance when baited with CO2 and the BG-lure in combination and can be effectively used as the new gold standard technique for collecting malaria vectors in Thailand.

TI  - Can natural selection encode Bayesian priors?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolutionary success of many organisms depends on their ability to make decisions based on estimates of the state of their environment (e.g., predation risk) from uncertain information. These decision problems have optimal solutions and individuals in nature are expected to evolve the behavioural mechanisms to make decisions as if using the optimal solutions. Bayesian inference is the optimal method to produce estimates from uncertain data, thus natural selection is expected to favour individuals with the behavioural mechanisms to make decisions as if they were computing Bayesian estimates in typically-experienced environments, although this does not necessarily imply that favoured decision-makers do perform Bayesian computations exactly. Each individual should evolve to behave as if updating a prior estimate of the unknown environment variable to a posterior estimate as it collects evidence. The prior estimate represents the decision-maker's default belief regarding the environment variable, i.e., the individual's default 'worldview' of the environment. This default belief has been hypothesised to be shaped by natural selection and represent the environment experienced by the individual's ancestors.We present an evolutionary model to explore how accurately Bayesian prior estimates can be encoded genetically and shaped by natural selection when decision-makers learn from uncertain information. The model simulates the evolution of a population of individuals that are required to estimate the probability of an event. Every individual has a prior estimate of this probability and collects noisy cues from the environment in order to update its prior belief to a Bayesian posterior estimate with the evidence gained. The prior is inherited and passed on to offspring. Fitness increases with the accuracy of the posterior estimates produced. Simulations show that prior estimates become accurate over evolutionary time. In addition to these 'Bayesian' individuals, we also introduce 'frequentist' individuals that do not use a prior and instead use frequentist inference when estimating the probability. Competition between the two shows that the former tend to have an evolutionary advantage over the latter, as predicted by the literature, and that this advantage is lowest when the information available to individuals poses the least uncertainty.

TI  - Prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and infrastructure for its diagnosis in Madagascar: implication for the WHO's elimination strategy
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: WHO developed a global strategy to eliminate hepatitis B by 2030 and set target to treat 80% of people with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection eligible for antiviral treatment. As a first step to achieve this goal, it is essential to conduct a situation analysis that is fundamental to designing national hepatitis plans. We therefore estimated the prevalence of chronic HBV infection, and described the existing infrastructure for HBV diagnosis in Madagascar.Methods: We conducted a stratified multi-stage serosurvey of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in adults aged >= 18 years using 28 sentinel surveillance sites located throughout the country. We obtained the list of facilities performing HBV testing from the Ministry of Health, and contacted the person responsible at each facility.Results: A total of 1778 adults were recruited from the 28 study areas. The overall weighted seroprevalence of HBsAg was 6.9% (95% CI: 5.6-8.6). Populations with a low socio-economic status and those living in rural areas had a significantly higher seroprevalence of HBsAg. The ratio of facilities equipped to perform HBsAg tests per 100,000 inhabitants was 1.02 in the capital city of Antananarivo and 0.21 outside the capital. There were no facilities with the capacity to perform HBV DNA testing or transient elastography to measure liver fibrosis. There are only five hepatologists in Madagascar.Conclusion: Madagascar has a high-intermediate level of endemicity for HBV infection with a severely limited capacity for its diagnosis and treatment. Higher HBsAg prevalence in rural or underprivileged populations underlines the importance of a public health approach to decentralize the management of chronic HBV carriers in Madagascar by using simple and low-cost diagnostic tools.

TI  - Evidence of compounded disturbance effects on vegetation recovery following high-severity wildfire and spruce beetle outbreak
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) outbreaks are rapidly spreading throughout subalpine forests of the Rocky Mountains, raising concerns that altered fuel structures may increase the ecological severity of wildfires. Although many recent studies have found no conclusive link between beetle outbreaks and increased fire size or canopy mortality, few studies have addressed whether these combined disturbances produce compounded effects on short-term vegetation recovery. We tested for an effect of spruce beetle outbreak severity on vegetation recovery in the West Fork Complex fire in southwestern Colorado, USA, where much of the burn area had been affected by severe spruce beetle outbreaks in the decade prior to the fire. Vegetation recovery was assessed using the Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) two years after the fire, which occurred in 2013. Beetle outbreak severity, defined as the basal area of beetle-killed trees within Landsat pixels, was estimated using vegetation index differences (dVls) derived from pre outbreak and post-outbreak Landsat images. Of the seven dVls tested, the change in Normalized Difference Moisture Index (dNDMI) was most strongly correlated with field measurements of beetle-killed basal area (R-2 = 0.66). dNDMI was included as an explanatory variable in sequential autoregressive (SAR) models of NDVI2015. Models also included pre disturbance NDVI, topography, and weather conditions at the time of burning as covariates. SAR results showed a significant correlation between NDVI2015 and dNDMI, with more severe spruce beetle outbreaks corresponding to reduced post-fire vegetation cover. The correlation was stronger for models which were limited to locations in the red stage of outbreak (outbreak <= 5 years old at the time of fire) than for models of gray-stage locations (outbreak >5 years old at the time of fire). These results indicate that vegetation recovery processes may be negatively impacted by severe spruce beetle outbreaks occurring within a decade of stand-replacing wildfire.

TI  - Tailoring Biomaterials for Cancer Immunotherapy: Emerging Trends and Future Outlook
T2  - ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy, as a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, has recently received tremendous attention. The active cancer vaccination, immune checkpoint blockage (ICB) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) for T-cell-based adoptive cell transfer are among these developments that have achieved a significant increase in patient survival in clinical trials. Despite these advancements, emerging research at the interdisciplinary interface of cancer biology, immunology, bioengineering, and materials science is important to further enhance the therapeutic benefits and reduce side effects. Here, an overview of the latest studies on engineering biomaterials for the enhancement of anticancer immunity is given, including the perspectives of delivery of immunomodulatory therapeutics, engineering immune cells, and constructing immune-modulating scaffolds. The opportunities and challenges in this field are also discussed.

TI  - A machine learning approach to estimation of downward solar radiation from satellite-derived data products: An application over a semi-arid ecosystem in the US
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shortwave solar radiation is an important component of the surface energy balance and provides the principal source of energy for terrestrial ecosystems. This paper presents a machine learning approach in the form of a random forest (RF) model for estimating daily downward solar radiation flux at the land surface over complex terrain using MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) remote sensing data. The model-building technique makes use of a unique network of 16 solar flux measurements in the semi-arid Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed and Critical Zone Observatory, in southwest Idaho, USA. Based on a composite RF model built on daily observations from all 16 sites in the watershed, the model simulation of downward solar radiation matches well with the observation data (r(2) = 0.96). To evaluate model performance, RF models were built from 12 of 16 sites selected at random and validated against the observations at the remaining four sites. Overall root mean square errors (RMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) are small (range: 37.17 W/m(2) -81.27 W/m(2), -48.31 W/m(2) -15.67 W/m(2), and 26.56 W/m(2) -63.77 W/m(2), respectively). When extrapolated to the entire watershed, spatiotemporal patterns of solar flux are largely consistent with expected trends in this watershed. We also explored significant predictors of downward solar flux in order to reveal important properties and processes controlling downward solar radiation. Based on the composite RF model built on all 16 sites, the three most important predictors to estimate downward solar radiation include the black sky albedo (BSA) near infrared band (0.858 mu m), BSA visible band (0.3-0.7 mu m), and clear day coverage. This study has important implications for improving the ability to derive downward solar radiation through a fusion of multiple remote sensing datasets and can potentially capture spatiotemporally varying trends in solar radiation that is useful for land surface hydrologic and terrestrial ecosystem modeling.

TI  - Repeated seasonal influenza vaccination among elderly in Europe: Effects on laboratory confirmed hospitalised influenza
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Europe, annual influenza vaccination is recommended to elderly. From 2011 to 2014 and in 2015-16, we conducted a multicentre test negative case control study in hospitals of 11 European countries to measure influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against laboratory confirmed hospitalised influenza among people aged >= 65 years. We pooled four seasons data to measure IVE by past exposures to influenza vaccination.We swabbed patients admitted for clinical conditions related to influenza with onset of severe acute respiratory infection <= 7 days before admission. Cases were patients RT-PCR positive for influenza virus and controls those negative for any influenza virus. We documented seasonal vaccination status for the current season and the two previous seasons.We recruited 5295 patients over the four seasons, including 465A(H1N1)pdm09, 642A(H3N2), 278 B case-patients and 3910 controls. Among patients unvaccinated in both previous two seasons, current seasonal IVE (pooled across seasons) was 30% (95%CI: -35 to 64), 8% (95%CI: -94 to 56) and 33% (95%CI: -43 to 68) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B respectively. Among patients vaccinated in both previous seasons, current seasonal IVE (pooled across seasons) was -1% (95%CI: -80 to 43), 37% (95%CI: 7-57) and 43% (95%CI: 1-68) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B respectively.Our results suggest that, regardless of patients' recent vaccination history, current seasonal vaccine conferred some protection to vaccinated patients against hospitalisation with influenza A(H3N2) and B. Vaccination of patients already vaccinated in both the past two seasons did not seem to be effective against A(H1N1)pdm09. To better understand the effect of repeated vaccination, engaging in large cohort studies documenting exposures to vaccine and natural infection is needed. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Mast cell coupling to the Kallikrein-Kinin system Fuels intracardiac Parasitism and Worsens heart Pathology in experimental chagas Disease
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the course of Chagas disease, infectious forms of Trypanosoma cruzi are occasionally liberated from parasitized heart cells. Studies performed with tissue culture trypomastigotes (TCTs, Dm28c strain) demonstrated that these parasites evoke neutrophil/CXCR2-dependent microvascular leakage by activating innate sentinel cells via toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Upon plasma extravasation, proteolytically derived kinins and C5a stimulate immunoprotective Th1 responses via cross-talk between bradykinin B2 receptors (B2Rs) and C5aR. Awareness that TCTs invade cardiovascular cells in vitro via interdependent activation of B2R and endothelin receptors [endothelin A receptor (ETAR)/endothelin B receptor (ETBR)] led us to hypothesize that T. cruzi might reciprocally benefit from the formation of infection-associated edema via activation of kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). Using intravital microscopy, here we first examined the functional interplay between mast cells (MCs) and the KKS by topically exposing the hamster cheek pouch (HCP) tissues to dextran sulfate (DXS), a potent "contact" activator of the KKS. Surprisingly, although DXS was inert for at least 30 min, a subtle MC-driven leakage resulted in factor XII (FXII)-dependent activation of the KKS, which then amplified inflammation via generation of bradykinin (BK). Guided by this mechanistic insight, we next exposed TCTs to "leaky" HCP-forged by low dose histamine application-and found that the proinflammatory phenotype of TCTs was boosted by BK generated via the MC/KKS pathway. Measurements of footpad edema in MC-deficient mice linked TCT-evoked inflammation to MC degranulation (upstream) and FXII-mediated generation of BK (downstream). We then inoculated TCTs intracardiacally in mice and found a striking decrease of parasite DNA (quantitative polymerase chain reaction; 3 d.p.i.) in the heart of MC-deficient mutant mice. Moreover, the intracardiac parasite load was significantly reduced in WT mice pretreated with (i) cromoglycate (MC stabilizer) (ii) infestin-4, a specific inhibitor of FXIIa (iii) HOE-140 (specific antagonist of B2R), and (iv) bosentan, a non-selective antagonist of ETAR/ETBR. Notably, histopathology of heart tissues from mice pretreated with these G protein-coupled receptors blockers revealed that myocarditis and heart fibrosis (30 d.p.i.) was markedly and redundantly attenuated. Collectively, our study suggests that inflammatory edema propagated via activation of the MC/KKS pathway fuels intracardiac parasitism by generating infection-stimulatory peptides (BK and endothelins) in the edematous heart tissues.

AB  - Pasture performance of 924 dairy farms in a major irrigation district of Australia was investigated for their water use and water productivity during the 2015-2016 summer which was the peak irrigation period. Using satellite images from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, estimates of crop coefficient (Kc) were determined on the basis of a strong linear relationship between crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and vegetation index (NDVI) of pasture in the region. Utilizing estimates of Kc and crop water requirement (CWR), NDVI-dependent estimates of Irrigation Water Requirement (IWR) were derived based on the soil water balance model. In combination with daily weather information and seasonal irrigation water supply records, IWR was the key component in the understanding of current irrigation status at farm level, and deriving two irrigation performance indicators: (1) Relative Irrigation Water Use (RIWU) and (2) Total Irrigation Water Productivity (TIWP). A slightly higher proportion of farm irrigators were found to be either matching the irrigation requirement or under-watering (RIWU <= 1.0). According to TIWP, a few dairy farms (3%) were found to be in the category of high yield potential with excess water use, and very few (1%) in the category of limited water supply to pastures of high yield potential. A relatively high number of farms were found to be in the category where excess water was supplied to pastures of low-medium yield potential (27%), and farms where water supply compromised pastures with a sub-maximal vegetation status (15%). The results of this study will assist in objectively identifying where significant improvement in efficient irrigation water use can be achieved.

TI  - Model Building to Investigate the Role of Spatial Location in Classifying Satellite Image Using SVM, CART and mBACT: A Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the importance of spatial location of pixels in terms of row-column as an additional explanatory variable in classification along with available spectral bands of remotely sensed data. In view of this, a forward step-wise variable selection algorithm is used to select significant bands/variables and build an optimal model to extract the maximum accuracy. Author performed a case study on the area of town of Wolfville acquired by LANDSAT 5 TM data containing six 30 m resolution spectral bands and pixel location as an additional variable. Data are classified into seven classes using three advanced classifiers i.e. classification and regression trees (CART), support vector machines (SVM) and multi-class Bayesian additive classification tree (mBACT). Traditionally, it is assumed that addition of more explanatory variables always increase the accuracy of classified satellite images. However, results of this study show that adding more variables may sometimes confuse the classifier, that is, if selected carefully, fewer variables can provide the more accurate classification. Importance of row-column information turns out to be more beneficial for mBACT followed by SVM. Interestingly, spatial locations did not turn out to be useful for CART. Based on the findings of this study, mBACT appears to be a slightly better classifier than SVM and a substantially better than CART.

TI  - Geomorphic and lithologic characteristics of Wadi Feiran basin, southern Sinai, Egypt, using remote sensing and field investigations
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wadi Feiran is an important drainage basin in southern Sinai Peninsula covering an area of about 1785 km(2), its streams drain into the Gulf of Suez crossing variety of rocks and sedimentary units varied in age from Precambrian to Quaternary. Field investigations, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing studies including Landsat-7 ETM+, Radarsat-1, and SRTM DEM were integrated to reveal its lithologic, geologic and geomorphic features. Besides the field investigations, rock units including basement and pre- and syn-rift sedimentary units were discriminated using band ratios and principal component analysis techniques (PCA). Such techniques revealed that the crystalline rocks covering W. Feiran are unaltered rocks lacking OH-bearing minerals. Radar data successfully displayed the structures and geomorphic features related to topography. Moreover, the techniques allowed the extraction of the dyke-like structures along faults and shear zones. This also characterized the topographic variations through analysis of the shaded terrain and the altitudinal profiles. The results of data integration, lineament analysis and lineament density maps revealed that the structural grain in the present study has four different trends: N20-45E, N30-45W, N-S and E-W. Based on analysis of radar data and geomorphic indices, W. Feiran is an asymmetrical basin, its left side occupies similar to 34% of the total area that leads to a supposedly massive tilt towards the south which caused the southwestward slope.

TI  - Monitoring of Land-Surface Deformation in the Karamay Oilfield, Xinjiang, China, Using SAR Interferometry
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry is a technique that provides high-resolution measurements of the ground displacement associated with various geophysical processes. To investigate the land-surface deformation in Karamay, a typical oil-producing city in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were acquired for the period from 2007 to 2009, and a two-pass differential SAR interferometry (D-InSAR) process was applied. The experimental results showed that two sites in the north-eastern part of the city exhibit a clear indication of land deformation. For a further evaluation of the D-InSAR result, the Persistent Scatterer (PS) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS)-InSAR techniques were applied for 21 time series Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) C-band Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data from 2003 to 2010. The comparison between the D-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR measurements had better agreement than that from the PS-InSAR measurement. The maximum deformation rate attributed to subsurface water injection for the period from 2003 to 2010 was up to approximately 33 mm/year in the line of sight (LOS) direction. The interferometric phase change from November 2007 to June 2010 showed a clear deformation pattern, and the rebound center has been expanding in scale and increasing in quantity.

TI  - Assessment of emerging hydrological, water quality issues and policy discussion on water sharing of transboundary Kabul River
T2  - WATER POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transboundary water sharing policy between Pakistan and Afghanistan along with emerging issues over the Transboundary Kabul River have been discussed incorporating long-term hydrological trend analysis, water quality issues and temporal changes in land cover/land use. The annual (1977-2015) mean river flow of 26.32 billion (109) cubic metres (BCM) with a range of 13.77 to 42.2 BCM and standard deviation of 6.026 BCM revealed no significant trend in annual inflow data of the Kabul River. Afghanistan planned developments in the basin were analysed in the light of reduction in the transboundary flow. Faecal coliforms, pH (7.90 to 8.06), Escherichia coli and other water quality parameters were found to be within permissible limits, however, dissolved oxygen was just above the permissible limits to sustain aquatic life. Water was found unsuitable for drinking while suitable for agriculture and aquatic life. Remote sensing data used for temporal change detection showed an increase in built-up-areas and cultivated areas along Kabul River inside Pakistan by 50 and 47%, respectively. Significant changes were observed at two locations in the river course. Insights of emerging Kabul River issues and a way forward have been discussed which could serve as the basis for formulation of adaption strategies leading to a 'Kabul River Water Treaty'.

TI  - Features of the propagation of pseudorandom pulse signals from the shelf to deep water in the presence of gyre formation on the acoustic track
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses the results of an experiment conducted in the Sea of Japan in March 2016 on an acoustic track 194 km long in winter hydrological conditions. The most complex case of propagation of pseudorandom pulse signals from the shelf to deep water in the presence of gyre formation on the acoustic track. An analysis of the experimentally obtained pulse characteristics show that at all points, a maximum, in terms of amplitude, first arrival of acoustic energy is recorded. This is evidence that at a given depth horizon, pulses that have passed the shortest distance through a near-surface sound channel at small angles close to zero are received first. The calculation method of mean sound velocity on the track, based on the satellite data of surface temperature monitoring, is proposed. We expect that the results obtained with this method can be successfully used for the purposes of acoustic range finding and navigation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Jizan is one of the Saudi Arabian coastal cities endowed with diverse natural settings, which includes Ash Shuqayq in the north, Turfah in the centre and Jizan in the South. This work analysed specific environmental characteristics, such as spits, sabkhas and wadis. Assessments used Landsat imagery to examine coastal change between 1973 and 2011. The cumulative temporal change identified regression trends given by coefficients of determination that explained a significant percentage of data variation for Jizan (R-2 = 69%) and Turfah (R-2 = 72%), while Ash Shuqayq was insignificant ( R-2 = 14%). Inter-survey results predicted future change, although trends were not significant, i.e. Jizan (R-2 = 22%), Turfah (R-2 = 14%) and Ash Shuqayq (R-2 = 3 and 61% with outlying value removed). Aerial photos showed regional coastal changes, which included a maximum accretion of 36.4 m and maximum erosion of 12.9 m. These are scientifically effective techniques to monitor regional coastal change, i.e. erosion and accretion and identified rates of 0.59, 1.80 and 3.53 myr(-1) for Ash Shuqayq, Turfah and Jizan.

TI  - Retrieval of Specific Leaf Area From Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance Data Using Statistical and Physical Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the key traits in the assessment of ecosystem functions is a specific leaf area (SLA). The main aim of this study was to examine the potential of new generation satellite images, such as Landsat-8 imagery, for the retrieval of SLA at regional and global scales. Therefore, both statistical and radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion approaches for estimating SLA from the new Landsat-8 product were evaluated. Field data were collected for 33 sample plots during a field campaign in summer 2013 in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, while Landsat-8 image data concurrent with the time of field campaign were acquired. Estimates of SLA were examined using different Landsat-8 spectral bands, vegetation indices calculated from these bands, and the inversion of a canopy RTM. The RTM inversion was performed utilizing continuous wavelet analysis and a look-up table (LUT) approach. The results were validated using R-2 and the root-meansquare error (RMSE) between the estimated andmeasured SLA. In general, SLAwas estimated accurately by both statistical andRTM inversion approaches. The relationships between measured and estimated SLA using the enhanced vegetation index were strong (R-2 = 0.77 and RMSE = 4.44%). Furthermore, the predictive model developed from combination of the wavelet features at 654.5 nm (scale 9) and 2200.5 nm (scale 2) correlated strongly with SLA (R-2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 7.52%). The inversion of LUT using a spectral subset consisting of bands 5, 6, and 7 of Landsat-8 (R-2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 5.33%) yielded a higher accuracy and precision than any other spectral subset. The findings of this study provide insights into the potential of the new generation of multispectral medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, for accurate retrieval and mapping of SLA using either statistical or RTM inversion methods.

TI  - Intersensor Statistical Matching for Pansharpening: Theoretical Issues and Practical Solutions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the authors investigate the statistical matching of the panchromatic (Pan) image to the multispectral (MS) bands, also known as the histogram matching, for the two main classes of pansharpening methods, i.e., those based on component substitution (CS) or spectral methods and those based on multiresolution analysis (MRA) or spatial methods. Also, hybrid methods combining CS with MRA, like the widespread additive wavelet luminance proportional (AWLP), are investigated. It is shown that all spectral, spatial, and hybrid methods must perform a dynamics matching of the enhancing Pan to the individual MS bands for MRA or a combination of them (the component that shall be substituted) for CS. For hybrid methods, the problem is more complex and both types of histogram matching may be suitable. Such an intersensor balance may be either explicit or implicitly performed by the detail-injection model, e.g., the popular projective and multiplicative injection models. An experimental setup exploiting IKONOS and WorldView-2 data sets demonstrates that a correct histogram matching is the key to attain extra performance from established methods. As a first result of this paper, the AWLP method has been revisited and its performance significantly improved by simply performing the histogram matching of Pan to the individual MS bands, rather than to the intensity component, thereby losing the original proportionality feature.

TI  - Simultaneous extraction of roads and buildings in remote sensing imagery with convolutional neural networks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of man-made objects (e.g., roads and buildings) from remotely sensed imagery plays an important role in many urban applications (e.g., urban land use and land cover assessment, updating geographical databases, change detection, etc). This task is normally difficult due to complex data in the form of heterogeneous appearance with large intra-class and lower inter-class variations. In this work, we propose a single patch-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for extraction of roads and buildings from high-resolution remote sensing data. Low-level features of roads and buildings (e.g., asymmetry and compactness) of adjacent regions are integrated with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features during the post -processing stage to improve the performance. Experiments are conducted on two challenging datasets of high-resolution images to demonstrate the performance of the proposed network architecture and the results are compared with other patch-based network architectures. The results demonstrate the validity and superior performance of the proposed network architecture for extracting roads and buildings in urban areas.

TI  - Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture Dryness Index (TVMDI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While SoilMoisture (SM) can be used as a direct indictor of dryness, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and vegetation status are indirectly related to SM, and consequently, affect the degree of dryness. Each of these three variables has been individually used to assess the dryness. Furthermore, a combination of the LST and vegetation information has also been applied for dryness estimation through the scatter-plot of the LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, a combination of these three variables has not been used to estimate the dryness. In this study, a 3 Dimensional (3D) space of the LST, Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI), and SM was developed to define a new dryness index named the Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture Dryness Index (TVMDI). The TVMDI was evaluated against in situ SM and soil temperature data, as well as the NDVI. The results demonstrated that the TVMDI values were highly correlated with the field soil temperature data and the NDVI (R = 0.78 and R = -0.87, respectively). However, even though the dryness values estimated from the TVMDI were not highly correlated with the in situ SM data, the correlation was still acceptable (R = -0.65). Furthermore, a comparison between the proposed index and several satellite-based dryness indices, including the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), Second Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI1), and Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), concluded that the TVMDI was the most accurate index. Moreover, using the TVMDI and multi-temporal Landsat 8 images two dryness maps were produced for the Yanco area to show the effectiveness of the proposed index in depicting the temporal and spatial variation of dryness values for medium spatial resolution images. To show the effectiveness of the TVMDI in large scale applications, two dryness maps from the all of Australia and Iran were also produced using the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. Overall, it was concluded that the TVMDI had a high potential to map dryness over different regions, and is a promising index for early awareness of drought risk management. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for small reservoirs extraction in semiarid environment. The task is accomplished through the introduction of a pseudoprobability index derived from multitemporal synthetic aperture radar RGB images. These products are characterized by the ease of interpretation for nonexpert users, and the possibility to be processed using simple algorithms, allowing, in this case, for the definition of an ad hoc band ratio for feature extraction. The reliability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study in Burkina Faso in which 19 reservoirs up to about 6000 m(2) extent were tested. The obtained accuracy with respect to the available ground truth is higher than 88%.

TI  - Diffusion-Based Inpainting for Coding Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inpainting techniques based on partial differential equations (PDEs), such as diffusion processes, are gaining growing importance as a novel family of image compression methods. Nevertheless, the application of inpainting in the field of hyperspectral imagery has been mainly focused on filling in missing information or dead pixels due to sensor failures. In this letter, we propose a novel PDE-based inpainting algorithm to compress hyperspectral images. The method inpaints separately the known data in the spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, it applies a prediction model to the final inpainting solution to obtain a representation much closer to the original image. Experimental results over a set of hyperspectral images indicate that the proposed algorithm can perform better than a recent proposed extension to prediction-based standard CCSDS-123.0 at low bit rate, better than JPEG 2000 Part 2 with the DWT 9/7 as a spectral transform at all bit rates, and competitive to JPEG 2000 with principal component analysis, the optimal spectral decorrelation transform for Gaussian sources.

TI  - Hyperspectral and Radar Airborne Imagery over Controlled Release of Oil at Sea
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques are commonly used by Oil and Gas companies to monitor hydrocarbon on the ocean surface. The interest lies not only in exploration but also in the monitoring of the maritime environment. Occurrence of natural seeps on the sea surface is a key indicator of the presence of mature source rock in the subsurface. These natural seeps, as well as the oil slicks, are commonly detected using radar sensors but the addition of optical imagery can deliver extra information such as thickness and composition of the detected oil, which is critical for both exploration purposes and efficient cleanup operations. Today, state-of-the-art approaches combine multiple data collected by optical and radar sensors embedded on-board different airborne and spaceborne platforms, to ensure wide spatial coverage and high frequency revisit time. Multi-wavelength imaging system may create a breakthrough in remote sensing applications, but it requires adapted processing techniques that need to be developed. To explore performances offered by multi-wavelength radar and optical sensors for oil slick monitoring, remote sensing data have been collected by SETHI (Systeme Experimental de Teledection Hyperfrequence Imageur), the airborne system developed by ONERA (the French Aerospace Lab), during an oil spill cleanup exercise carried out in 2015 in the North Sea, Europe. The uniqueness of this dataset lies in its high spatial resolution, low noise level and quasi-simultaneous acquisitions of different part of the EM spectrum. Specific processing techniques have been developed to extract meaningful information associated with oil-covered sea surface. Analysis of this unique and rich dataset demonstrates that remote sensing imagery, collected in both optical and microwave domains, allows estimating slick surface properties such as the age of the emulsion released at sea, the spatial abundance of oil and the relative concentration of hydrocarbons remaining on the sea surface.

TI  - Microplastics pollution after the removal of the Costa Concordia wreck: First evidences from a biomonitoring case study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) represent a matter of growing concern for the marine environment. Their ingestion has been documented in several species worldwide, but the impact of specific anthropogenic activities remains largely unexplored. In this study, MPs were characterized in different benthic fish sampled after 2.5 years of huge engineering operations for the parbuckling project on the Costa Concordia wreck at Giglio Island. Fish collected in proximity of the wreck showed a high ingestion of microplastics compared to both fish from a control area and values reported worldwide. Also the elevated percentage of nylon, polypropylene lines and the presence of polystyrene are quite unusual for marine organisms sampled in natural field conditions, thus supporting the possible relationship of ingested microplastics with maritime operations during wreck removal. On the other hand, the use of transplanted mussels revealed a lower frequency of ingested MPs, and did not discriminate differences between the wreck and the control area. Some variations were observed in terms of typology and size of particles between surface and bottom-caged mussels highlighting the influence of a different distribution of MPs along the water column. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that MPs pollution in the area of Costa Concordia was more evident on benthonic environment than on seawater column, providing novel insights on the possibility of using appropriate sentinel organisms for monitoring specific anthropogenic sources of MPs pollution in the marine environment.

TI  - Suitability assessment and mapping of Oyo State, Nigeria, for rice cultivation using GIS
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most preferred food crops in Nigeria. However, local rice production has declined with the oil boom of the 1970s causing demand to outstrip supply. Rice production can be increased through the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and crop-land suitability analysis and mapping. Based on the key predictor variables that determine rice yield mentioned in relevant literature, data on rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, slope, and soil of Oyo state were obtained. To develop rice suitability maps for the state, two MCE-GIS techniques, namely the Overlay approach and weighted linear combination (WLC), using fuzzy AHP were used and compared. A Boolean land use map derived from a landsat imagery was used in masking out areas currently unavailable for rice production. Both suitability maps were classified into four categories of very suitable, suitable, moderate, and fairly moderate. Although the maps differ slightly, the overlay and WLC (AHP) approach found most parts of Oyo state (51.79 and 82.9 % respectively) to be moderately suitable for rice production. However, in areas like Eruwa, Oyo, and Shaki, rainfall amount received needs to be supplemented by irrigation for increased rice yield.

TI  - Soil Moisture Data Assimilation in a Hydrological Model: A Case Study in Belgium Using Large-Scale Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, we focus on the assimilation of satellite observations for Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) in a hydrological model. The satellite data are produced in the framework of the EUMETSAT project H-SAF and are based on measurements with the Advanced radar Scatterometer (ASCAT), embarked on the Meteorological Operational satellites (MetOp). The product generated with these measurements has a horizontal resolution of 25 km and represents the upper few centimeters of soil. Our approach is based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter technique (EnKF), where observation and model uncertainties are taken into account, implemented in a conceptual hydrological model. The analysis is carried out in the Demer catchment of the Scheldt River Basin in Belgium, for the period from June 2013-May 2016. In this context, two methodological advances are being proposed. First, the generation of stochastic terms, necessary for the EnKF, of bounded variables like SSM is addressed with the aid of specially-designed probability distributions, so that the bounds are never exceeded. Second, bias due to the assimilation procedure itself is removed using a post-processing technique. Subsequently, the impact of SSM assimilation on the simulated streamflow is estimated using a series of statistical measures based on the ensemble average. The differences from the control simulation are then assessed using a two-dimensional bootstrap sampling on the ensemble generated by the assimilation procedure. Our analysis shows that data assimilation combined with bias correction can improve the streamflow estimations or, at a minimum, produce results statistically indistinguishable from the control run of the hydrological model.

TI  - An Up-Scaled Vegetation Temperature Condition Index Retrieved From Landsat Data with Trend Surface Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought causes great losses in regional agricultural production and decreases socioeconomic growth. The vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) has a distinct advantage in monitoring the onset, duration, and intensity of droughts. With the development of modern remote sensing technologies, remotely sensed data with variable spatial and temporal resolution are used to generate multiscale maps of droughts. Therefore, understanding the scale effect and developing appropriate up-scaling methods to retrieve spatiotemporal drought variables across different scales is valuable. As an alternative to the commonly used window averaging (WA) method, we develop the trend surface analysis (TSA) method based on multiple regression analysis to up-scale Landsat-derived VTCI (Landsat-VTCI) images from a finer to a coarser resolution. The two methods are systematically evaluated in a case study according to various statistical indicators, including the spatial and frequency distributions of features, and the correlation coefficients and root mean square errors between up-scaled Landsat-VTCI images and moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived VTCI (MODIS-VTCI) images. The results show that TSA is reliable and more suitable than WA for non-normally distributed Landsat-derived VTCIs, whereas the WA results are similar to the TSA results for normal distributions. The TSA method is flexible for any type of distribution of Landsat-VTCIs within a study area and can be programmed to up-scale spatial drought variables from a finer to a coarser spatial resolution because of its efficiency and flexibility compared to the WA method.

TI  - Validation of Suomi-NPP VIIRS sea ice concentration with very high-resolution satellite and airborne camera imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Two independent VIIRS-based Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) products are validated against SIC as estimated from Very High Spatial Resolution Imagery for several VIIRS overpasses. The 375 m resolution VIIRS SIC from the Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS) SIC algorithm is compared against estimates made from 2 m DigitalGlobe (DG) WorldView-2 imagery and also against estimates created from 10 cm Digital Mapping System (DMS) camera imagery. The 750 m VIIRS SIC from the Enterprise SIC algorithm is compared against DG imagery. The IDPS vs. DG comparisons reveal that, due to algorithm issues, many of the IDPS SIC retrievals were falsely assigned ice-free values when the pixel was clearly over ice. These false values increased the validation bias and RMS statistics. The IDPS vs. DMS comparisons were largely over ice-covered regions and did not demonstrate the false retrieval issue. The validation results show that products from both the IDPS and Enterprise algorithms were within or very close to the 10% accuracy (bias) specifications in both the non-melting and melting conditions, but only products from the Enterprise algorithm met the 25% specifications for the uncertainty (RMS).

T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA is a dynamic and living organization. Looking at it through the optics of cybernetics, we can describe it as an autopoietic system. It has to sustain itself, and compete successfully to be viable. Its organizational elements have to interact with the broader environment by maintaining and improving its processes that generate the means for future sustainability. It also needs to bring up follow-on generations who are not simply aligning with the status quo, but also improve the system's viability. For government-run programs, organizational, programmatic and project management practices are often rigidly linear. They can be characterized as observed first-order cybernetic systems, where the paradigm is bound by well-established requirements. At the implementation level this does not readily accommodate flexibility and change. To address this, broadening the system's worldview is needed from the strategic level. This corresponds to an observing second-order cybernetic system, where strategic leadership can overwrite the rules of a first-order system. Changing the worldview of an organization can be complex and face much resistance. Still, with the appropriate strategic-level support, it can be achieved by introducing novel languages, new perspectives, and adding new disciplines to existing ones. In effect, this helps to broaden the organizational paradigm, and subsequently influence its mission, impact the culture, and open up its core processes. These changes can be effectively introduced through design conversations in the early formulation stages, when new ideas are conceived. Within NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, early-stage concept developments are performed at a specially formulated environment, called the Innovation Foundry. Within this office, a continuous effort is being made on designing the design processes, which helps to broaden the variety of the option trades. It is achieved by an added focus on conversations and the inclusion of non-engineering disciplines, such as industrial and graphic design, human centered design, and even art. Communicating the information more effectively through conversations and symbolic means benefits from the skills of human centered designers and artists. In this paper we will discuss how design is being designed at JPL's Innovation Foundry, by focusing on novel languages, storytelling, conversations, boundary objects in support of improved communications both externally to stakeholders and sponsors, and internally within the design teams. We will also highlight how these new design driven approaches provide a strategic strength for the organization when competing for funding in a resource constrained environment.

TI  - Evidence of MLT propagation of the plasmapause inferred from THEMIS data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The cross-correlation analysis is applied to the comprehensive database of THEMIS plasmapause crossings (6840 L-PP s) and both solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices (thereafter L-PP indicators). We estimate MLTs of the plasmapause formation and further monitor the motion of the new plasmapause at high MLT resolution. Our results show that plasmapause is firstly formed within 23-07 MLT and then propagates around the Earth with the velocity estimated to amounts for 1.10 and 0.45 of the corotation velocity in sectors 07-15 MLT and 15-23 MLT, respectively. Two branches within 23-07 MLT are identified, one at low time lags (T-lag s) and second at high T-lag s which we relate to the formation of the new plasmapause and to the propagation of the plasmapause formed one MLT-cycle before. This study can be used to improve the current understanding of the plasmapause formation and propagation.

TI  - A Lightweight Contextual Arithmetic Coder for On-Board Remote Sensing Data Compression
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has issued several data compression standards devised to reduce the amount of data transmitted from satellites to ground stations. This paper introduces a contextual arithmetic encoder for on-board data compression. The proposed arithmetic encoder checks the causal adjacent neighbors, at most, to form the context and uses only bitwise operations to estimate the related probabilities. As a result, the encoder consumes few computational resources, making it suitable for on-board operation. Our coding approach is based on the prediction and mapping stages of CCSDS-123 lossless compression standard, an optional quantizer stage to yield lossless or near-lossless compression and our proposed arithmetic encoder. For both lossless and near-lossless compression, the achieved coding performance is superior to that of CCSDS-123, M-CALIC, and JPEG-LS. Taking into account only the entropy encoders, fixed-length codeword is slightly better than MQ and interleaved entropy coding.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (PEM) is an uncommon, recently described entity with unknown biologic behavior. There is a high rate of regional metastases, but limited evidence of distant metastases or disease-related death.Objective: We sought to report our series of patients given a diagnosis of PEM at our institution and provide mutational analysis of genes commonly implicated in melanoma in 2 cases.Methods: The pathology database was queried for cases of PEM diagnosed at the University of Rochester. Charts were reviewed for follow-up information. Mutational analysis of melanoma-associated genes was performed on 2 cases.Results: Nine cases of PEM were retrieved in a 10-year retrospective review. Five patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy with 3 of 5 having a positive sentinel lymph node. All 9 patients are alive and disease-free with average follow-up of 38.75 months. Two tumors were tested for common melanoma-associated mutations, and were negative, except for a telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter deletion detected in 1 sample. The deletion has not been associated with melanoma, and therefore its biologic significance is unclear.Limitations: Small sample size, retrospective nature, and single institution experience are limitations.Conclusions: PEM appears to have an indolent behavior. However, currently the evidence is too limited to provide insight into its true biologic potential.

TI  - Validation of Automatically Generated Global and Regional Cropland Data Sets: The Case of Tanzania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a need to validate existing global cropland maps since they are used for different purposes including agricultural monitoring and assessment. In this paper we validate three recent global products (ESA-CCI, GlobeLand30, FROM-GC) and one regional product (Tanzania Land Cover 2010 Scheme II) using a validation data set that was collected by students through the Geo-Wiki tool. The ultimate aim was to understand the usefulness of these products for agricultural monitoring. Data were collected wall-to-wall for Kilosa district and for a sample across Tanzania. The results show that the amount of and spatial extent of cropland in the different products differs considerably from 8% to 42% for Tanzania, with similar values for Kilosa district. The agreement of the validation data with the four different products varied between 36% and 54% and highlighted that cropland is overestimated by the ESA-CCI and underestimated by FROM-GC. The validation data were also analyzed for consistency between the student interpreters and also compared with a sample interpreted by five experts for quality assurance. Regarding consistency between the students, there was more than 80% agreement if one difference in cropland category was considered (e.g., between low and medium cropland) while most of the confusion with the experts was also within one category difference. In addition to the validation of current cropland products, the data set collected by the students also has potential value as a training set for improving future cropland products.

TI  - A national surveillance project on chronic kidney disease management in Canadian primary care: a study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Effective chronic disease care is dependent on well-organised quality improvement (QI) strategies that monitor processes of care and outcomes for optimal care delivery. Although healthcare is provincially/territorially structured in Canada, there are national networks such as the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) as important facilitators for national QI-based studies to improve chronic disease care. The goal of our study is to improve the understanding of how patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are managed in primary care and the variation across practices and provinces and territories to drive improvements in care delivery.Methods and analysis The CPCSSN database contains anonymised health information from the electronic medical records for patients of participating primary care practices (PCPs) across Canada (n=1200). The dataset includes information on patient sociodemographics, medications, laboratory results and comorbidities. Leveraging validated algorithms, case definitions and guidelines will help define CKD and the related processes of care, and these enable us to: (1) determine prevalent CKD burden; (2) ascertain the current practice pattern on risk identification and management of CKD and (3) study variation in care indicators (eg, achievement of blood pressure and proteinuria targets) and referral pattern for specialist kidney care. The process of care outcomes will be stratified across patients' demographics as well as provider and regional (provincial/territorial) characteristics. The prevalence of CKD stages 3-5 will be presented as age-sex standardised prevalence estimates stratified by province and as weighted averages for population rates with 95% CIs using census data. For each PCP, age-sex standardised prevalence will be calculated and compared with expected standardised prevalence estimates. The process-based outcomes will be defined using established methods.Ethics and dissemination The CPCSSN is committed to high ethical standards when dealing with individual data collected, and this work is reviewed and approved by the Network Scientific Committee. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at relevant national and international scientific meetings.

TI  - The equatorial electrojet (EEJ) current deduced from CHAMP satellite and ground magnetic measurements in West Africa
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The equatorial electrojet (EEJ) is an intense day-time ionospheric current that circulates eastward along the geomagnetic dip equator. In this work, the EEJ current intensity was studied from ground-based magnetic data and CHAllenging Minisatellite Playoad (CHAMP) satellite observations. The ground-basedmagnetic data were recorded along a meridian chain of three stations across the dip equator in West Africa. These stations were operated by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP). For the CHAMP satellite data, vector magnetometer records during geomagnetically quiet periods with Kp <= 2 were used. To estimate the EEJ current intensity, we have first isolated its magnetic effect from CHAMP satellite observations for 10 years (from July 2000 to September 2010). The results were used to analyze the EEJ seasonal variability and the local time and longitude dependence. In addition, a comparison between ground-based and satellite observations of the EEJ current intensity was made. A good correlation was found between satellite and ground-based EEJ current intensity, with an average correlation coefficient of r(2) similar to 0.93. This performed correlation show that the technique used in this study can be extended to all ground magnetic stations for modeling the EEJ phenomena.

TI  - Lymph node retrieval rates in melanoma: a quality assessment parameter
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Regional lymph node dissection (RLND) for melanoma with nodal metastasis is a specialized procedure that is associated with improved disease-specific survival in selected patients. Furthermore, there is evidence that a higher lymph node retrieval rate (LNRR) is associated with improved local control. Currently, no consensus has been reached on the definition of an adequate LNRR. A minimum LNRR has been proposed as a quality assessment parameter that has to be validated.Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (University Health Network, Toronto, ON). The LNRRS for all patients who underwent RLND for malignant cutaneous melanoma during 2000-2010 were recorded. Indications for RLND were a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy or clinical lymphadenopathy (palpable or radiologically detected).Results Of the 207 identified RLNDS, 146 (70.5%) were subsequent to a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy, and 61 (29.5%) were performed for clinical lymphadenopathy. The median LNRR was 24 nodes (range: 9-47 nodes; 10th percentile: 14 nodes) for axillary , 12 nodes (range: 5-30 nodes;10th percentile: 8 nodes) for inguinal RLND, and 16 nodes (range: 10-21 nodes; 10th percentile: 11 nodes) for ilioinguinal RLND. The results were similar when comparing patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes and those with clinical lymphadenopathy, and the same surgical techniques were used in both groups.Conclusions The LNRRS at our institution are similar to rates reported at other tertiary-care melanoma centres. A minimum acceptable LNRR can be considered a quality assessment parameter in the surgical management of melanoma with nodal metastasis.

TI  - Spatial variability of vegetation index and soil properties in an integrated crop-livestock system
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of soil property spatial variability is useful for determining the rational use of inputs, such as the site-specific application of lime and fertilizer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the vegetation index and spatial variability of physical and chemical soil properties in an integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS). Soil samples were taken from a 6.9 ha area in a regular hexagon grid at 0-0.20 m depths. Soil P, K, Ca, Mg, and cation exchange capacity - CEC; base saturation; clay and sand were analyzed. Soil electrical conductivity (ECa) was measured with a contact sensor. The site was evaluated at the end of the corn season (April) and during forage production (October) using Landsat 5 images, remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system (GIS). Results showed that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was associated with ECa and soil parameters, indicating crop and pasture variations in the ICLS. Geostatistics and GIS were effective tools for collecting data regarding the spatial variability of soil and crop indicators, identifying variation trends in the data, and assisting data interpretation to determine adequate management strategies.

TI  - Characteristics of non-vitreoretinal ocular injury in child maltreatment: a systematic review
T2  - EYE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose To identify the spectrum of non-vitreoretinal ocular injury due to child maltreatment.Methods All language search of MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE, AMED, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases, 1950-2015, was conducted. Inclusion criteria: explicit confirmation of injury aetiology, age <18 years, examination conducted by an ophthalmologist. Exclusion: post-mortem data, organic diseases, review articles. Standardised critical appraisal and narrative synthesis was conducted of included publications by two independent reviewers.Results Of 1492 studies identified, 153 full texts were assessed, 49 underwent full review, resulting in five included studies: three case series and two case reports. The 26 included cases describe a wide variety of ocular, facial and skeletal injuries occurring as a consequence of child maltreatment. Ocular signs included periorbital oedema, chemosis, injection, abrasion, hyphaema, and cataract. Of interest all children that had suffered physical abuse with ocular injury had subconjunctival haemorrhages. Children presenting with abusive ocular injuries had a mean age of 13.9 months (range 1-68), while those who suffered violent corporal punishment were considerably older (mean 96 months). All cases, apart from severe corporal punishment, underwent screening for occult fractures, but neuroimaging only apparent in 2/5 eligible cases.Conclusion Although, the face is the most common site of abusive injury, there is a paucity of high-quality data on non-vitreoretinal ocular abusive injury. Thus, while subconjunctival haemorrhages are a potential sentinel injury of maltreatment, and may warrant further evaluation, the lack of large-scale published data limits our ability to highlight further specific characteristics of non-vitreoretinal ocular injury indicative of child abuse.

TI  - Generation and validation of the Chilean Wave Atlas database
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper summarizes the calibration and validation of a 35-year wave hindcast database used to create the Chilean Wave Atlas. The hindcast was generated with the Wavewatch III wave model and consists of: i) time series of wave statistical parameters in a 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid throughout the Pacific Ocean; ii) spectral data at points latitudinally spaced every 2 degrees off the Chilean coast. A comprehensive calibration process was undertaken in order to assess the performance of statistical parameters at different locations under normal and extreme conditions. A multi-criteria performance score was defined to select the optimal Wavewatch III model configuration. Few buoy records available and a broad set of satellite data were used in this process. A correction method was then applied to the statistical parameters in order to reduce systematic errors of the model. The Atlas showed better performance when compared to existing databases under normal wave conditions. However, the accuracy was shown to be lesser for the highest wave heights, consistently following the behaviour of other databases. This deficiency in the estimate of extreme values has important consequences in the design of coastal structures, and its improvement remains to be solved. (C) 2017 ElsevierLtd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring fractional green vegetation cover dynamics over a seasonally inundated alpine wetland using dense time series HJ-1A/B constellation images and an adaptive endmember selection LSMM model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series fractional green vegetation cover (FVC) is crucial for monitoring vegetation cover status monitoring, simulating growth processes and modeling land surfaces. Through the integration of remotely sensed data and FVC estimation models, FVC can be routinely and periodically monitored using remote sensing images over large areas. However, due to frequent cloud contamination and trade-offs in satellite sensor design, the FVC estimates from remote sensing data are not continuous, either spatially or temporally, and cannot simultaneously depict details in spatio-temporal variation. Taking the seasonally inundated Zoige alpine wetland in China as a case area, the objective of this paper is to develop a practical and effective approach to quantifying the explicit vegetation FVC details with both high spatial and temporal resolution. In this approach, 30-m multi-spectral images from the Chinese HJ-1A/B (HuanJing (HJ), which means environment in Chinese) satellite constellation with a 2-day revisit time were first composited at 16-day intervals to improve spatio-temporal continuity. Then, a new adaptive endmember selection linear spectral mixture model (ASLSMM) was proposed to improve the accuracy of FVC estimation by considering the endmember dynamics for each pixel. FVC time series were finally estimated by applying the ASLSMM to the cloudless HJ composites. The performance of the model and the spatio-temporal representational capability of the FVC estimation results were comprehensively evaluated using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) reference images and ground measurements from an integrated, multi-scale remote sensing experiment. A traditional LSMM with fixed endmembers and the Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) model were also used for model performance comparison. The results showed that the R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from the proposed model and the UAV reference were 0.7315 and 0.1016 (unitless) respectively, which was better than the results from the linear spectral mixture model with a fixed number of endmembers, with R-2 of 0.5924 and RMSE of 0.3821. The R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from MESMA and the UAV reference were 0.6327 and 0.1578, which was comparable with the ASLSMM. The accuracy evaluation usingmulti-temporal in situ measurements indicated the consistently high performance of the ASLSMM. This study highlights the feasibility of using HJ satellite constellation images to generate the temporally dense and fine spatial resolution FVC estimations for wetland and wetland-like heterogeneous landscape monitoring. The proposed approach can be viewed as a reference for generating FVC datasets from the on-going HJ constellation and similar constellation missions such as Sentinel-2A/B. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Satellite Data and Machine Learning for Weather Risk Management and Food Security
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events poses challenges for the agricultural sector in developing economies and for food security globally. In this article, we demonstrate how machine learning can be used to mine satellite data and identify pixel-level optimal weather indices that can be used to inform the design of risk transfers and the quantification of the benefits of resilient production technology adoption. We implement the model to study maize production in Mozambique, and show how the approach can be used to produce countrywide risk profiles resulting from the aggregation of local, heterogeneous exposures to rainfall precipitation and excess temperature. We then develop a framework to quantify the economic gains from technology adoption by using insurance costs as the relevant metric, where insurance is broadly understood as the transfer of weather-driven crop losses to a dedicated facility. We consider the case of irrigation in detail, estimating a reduction in insurance costs of at least 30%, which is robust to different configurations of the model. The approach offers a robust framework to understand the costs versus benefits of investment in irrigation infrastructure, but could clearly be used to explore in detail the benefits of more advanced input packages, allowing, for example, for different crop varieties, sowing dates, or fertilizers.

TI  - Evaluation of the NDVI-Based Pixel Selection Criteria of the MODIS C6 Dark Target and Deep Blue Combined Aerosol Product
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The moderate resolution and imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (C6) level 2 operational aerosol product (MOD04) contains the Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) combined aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations (DTB) at 10 km resolution, which is generated using the selection criteria based on the static normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as follows: 1) the DT AOD data are used for NDVI > 0.3; 2) the DB AOD data are used for NDVI < 0.2; and 3) the average of both algorithms or AOD data with highest quality flag are used for <= 0.2 NDVI <= 0.3. The objective of this study is to evaluate the NDVI pixel selection criteria used in the DTB AOD product. For this, the DT, the DB, and the DTB AOD retrievals are evaluated using the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) level 2.0 cloud-screened and quality-controlled AOD data over Beijing from 2002 to 2014, Lahore from 2007 to 2013, and Paris from 2005 to 2014. The DT and DB AOD retrievals considered by the DTB product are tabulated. For comparison purposes, the MODIS level 3 monthly NDVI product (MOD13A3) at 1 km resolution is also tabulated indicating how the NDVI-based pixel selection criteria operate for the DT and DB AOD retrievals used in the DTB product. Results show that the DT AOD retrievals for NDVI <= 0.3 are used in the DTB product, and this increases the mean bias and percentage of retrievals above the expected error. These results conclude that the DTB AOD product must follow the dynamic NDVI values for pixel selection criteria.

TI  - New customized methods for improvement of the MODIS C6 Dark Target and Deep Blue merged aerosol product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate resolution and Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level 2 operational aerosol products (MOD04/MYD04), based on the Dark Target (DT) and the enhanced Deep Blue (DB) algorithms, have been providing daily global aerosol information. The MOD04/MYD04 has different data coverage for the DT and the DB algorithms due to differences in their retrieval methods. Recently in the collection 6 (C6), a DT and DB merged (DTBC6) AOD product has been introduced based on different thresholds of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to improve the data coverage. The main objective of this study is to increase the data coverage and reduce the error in the merged DTBC6 AOD product by introducing three new customized methods (DTBMX): (i) DTBM1: "use an average of the DT and DB AOD retrievals or the available one for all the NDVI values", as it is independent of the NDVI values, (ii) DTBM2: "use an average of the DT and DB AOD retrievals or the available one for NDVI >= 0.2, and use the DB retrievals for NDVI < 0.2", and (iii) DTBM3: "use AOD retrievals from the DB algorithm for NDVI NDVI > 0.3, and use an average of the DT and DB retrievals or the available one for NDVI <= 0.3". Validation of the DTBMX is conducted at a global scale from 2004 to 2014 using AERONET AOD measurements from 68 sites located in Asia (9), Europe (22), Southern Africa (8), and North (23) and South America (8), and for comparison purpose, the DTBC6 is evaluated for the same period. Results showed that the number of coincident observations of the DTBMX methods compared to the DTBC6 is increased by 31%, 41% 30%, and 108% for Asian, European, Southern African, and North and South American sites, respectively. At global scale, the number of coincident observations are increased for the DTBM1, DTBM2, and DTBM3 from 29,088 for DTBC6, to 45,937, 45,028, 37,393 which are 58%, 57%, and 29%, respectively more than the for DTBC6 observations. For an equal number of coincident observations, the percentage of retrievals within the EE is increased by between 17% to 20% and the RMSE is decreased by up to 15% for the DTBMX methods, but R is the same as for the DTBC6. The percentage above the EE is also decreased by between 43% to 55% due to greater contribution of the DB retrievals. Overall, the performance of all the DTBMX methods is much better than the DTBC6, but the DTBM1 is the most robust as it is independent of NDVI values, and significantly increases the data coverage. Therefore, it can be used operationally for global merged AOD retrievals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Satellite-retrieved direct radiative forcing of aerosols over North-East India and adjoining areas: climatology and impact assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to understand the climatic implications of atmospheric aerosols, top of atmosphere (TOA) shortwave (SW, 0.3-5 mu m) fluxes and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm retrieved simultaneously by clouds and the earth's radiant energy system (CERES) and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, respectively, are analysed over North-East India and its adjoining areas for the period July 2002-December 2013. The aerosol-free TOA flux obtained by establishing the linear regression between CERES SW TOA fluxes and MODIS AODs exhibits strong seasonality with peak values in monsoon and minimum in winter. Same seasonality is captured by the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model, but with difference in absolute values. SBDART code is used to extend instantaneous radiative forcing estimates into 24-h averages. AOD over the North East India region with complex terrain shows altitudinal variation with maximum value at the lowest elevation site Dhaka and minimum value at the high-altitude locations Shillong and Aizwal. In general, strong seasonality in AOD is observed with a peak in pre-monsoon (March-May) and dip in post-monsoon (October-November) at all the locations. The direct instantaneous TOA shortwave aerosol radiative forcing (SWARF) shows maximum values in pre-monsoon over all the locations except at Guwahati, Banmauk, Aizawl, and Shillong. The lowest value of instantaneous SWARF is observed in post-monsoon except at Banmauk and Shillong. Climatologically TOA diurnally averaged SWARF varies between -6.95 W m(-2) in Aizawl to -20.39 W m(-2) in Shillong. In general, the TOA SW forcing efficiency is highest in monsoon at all the locations. The radiative forcing efficiency is found to be less negative when surface reflectance increases.

TI  - Remote Sensing Techniques for Urban Heating Analysis: A Case Study of Sustainable Construction at District Level
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, many new districts in urban centres have been planned and constructed to reshape the structure and functions of specific areas. Urban regeneration strategies, planning and design principles have to take into account both socioeconomic perspectives and environmental sustainability. A district located in the historical city centre of Terni (Italy), Corso del Popolo, was analysed to assess the construction effects in terms of surface urban heat island (SUHI) mitigation. This district is an example of urban texture modification planned in the framework of the regeneration of the ancient part of the town. The changes were realised starting from 2006; the new area was completed on June 2014. The analysis was carried out by processing Landsat 7 ETM+ images before and after the interventions, retrieving land surface temperature (LST) and albedo maps. The map analysis proved the SUHI reduction of the new area after the interventions: as confirmed by the literature, such SUHI mitigation can be ascribed to the presence of green areas, the underground parking, the partial covering of the local roadway and the shadow effect of new multi-storey buildings. Moreover, an analysis of other parameters linked to the impervious surfaces (albedo, heat transfer and air circulation) driving LST variations is provided to better understand SUHI behaviour at the district level. The district regeneration shows that wisely planned and developed projects in the construction sector can improve urban areas not only economically and socially, but can also enhance the environmental impact.

TI  - Similarity of the Jovian satellite footprints: Spots multiplicity and dynamics
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, the intense interaction of the satellites Io, Europa, Ganymede and Enceladus with their surrounding plasma environment leaves a signature in the aurora of the planet. Called satellite footprints, these auroral features appear either as a single spot (Europa and Enceladus) or as multiple spots (10 and Ganymede). Moreover, they can be followed by extended trailing tails in the case of lo and Europa, while no tail has been reported for Ganymede and Enceladus, yet. Here we show that all Jovian footprints can be made of several spots. Furthermore, the footprints all experience brightness variations on timescale of 2-3 min. We also demonstrate that the satellite location relative to the plasma sheet is not the only driver for the footprint brightness, but that the plasma environment and the magnetic field strength also play a role. These new findings demonstrate that the Europa and Ganymede footprints are very similar to the Io footprint. As a consequence, the processes expected to take place at Io, such as the bi-directional electron acceleration by Alfven waves or the partial reflection of these waves on plasma density gradients, can most likely be extended to the other footprints, suggesting that they are indeed universal processes.

TI  - Microfluidics for rapid cytokeratin immunohistochemical staining in frozen sections
T2  - LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Frozen sections (FS) of tumor samples represent a cornerstone of pathological intraoperative consultation and have an important role in the microscopic analysis of specimens during surgery. So far, immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings on FS have been demonstrated for a few markers using manual methods. Microfluidic technologies have proven to bring substantial improvement in many fields of diagnostics, though only a few microfluidic devices have been designed to improve the performance of IHC assays. In this work, we show optimization of a complete pan-cytokeratin chromogenic immunostaining protocol on FS using a microfluidic tissue processor into a protocol taking <12 min. Our results showed specificity and low levels of background. The dimensions of the microfluidic prototype device are compatible with the space constraints of an intraoperative pathology laboratory. We therefore anticipate that the adoption of microfluidic technologies in the field of surgical pathology can significantly improve the way FSs influence surgical procedures.

AB  - This article argues that Herman Bavinck's organic worldview allows him to use classical and modern thinkers in an eclectic yet theologically principled manner. To vindicate this claim, the article observes Bavinck's self-conscious comments regarding the task of Reformed catholicity, his use of Schleiermacher and Augustine to construct a theological account of self-consciousness, and his resituating of Thomistic motifs within an organic framework in his epistemology. In so doing, the article suggests that Bavinck's catholicity is broader than previously observed, thus generating a different way of interpreting Bavinck's use of thinkers who are often thought to be in tension.

Starting from the highest resolution bands, band-dependent information (reflectance) is separated from information that is common to all bands (geometry of scene elements). This model is then applied to unmix low-resolution bands, preserving their reflectance, while propagating band-independent information to preserve the subpixel details. A reference implementation is provided, with an application example for super-resolving Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of Multi-Spectral Littoral Images Using a PHOTONS/AERONET-Based Regional Aerosol Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial resolution is the main instrumental requirement for the multi-spectral optical space missions that address the scientific issues of marine coastal systems. This spatial resolution should be at least decametric. Aquatic color data processing associated with these environments requires specific atmospheric corrections (AC) suitable for the spectral characteristics of high spatial resolution sensors (HRS) as well as the high range of atmospheric and marine optical properties. The objective of the present study is to develop and demonstrate the potential of a ground-based AC approach adaptable to any HRS for regional monitoring and security of littoral systems. The in Situ-based Atmospheric CORrection (SACOR) algorithm is based on simulations provided by a Successive Order of Scattering code (SOS), which is constrained by a simple regional aerosol particle model (RAM). This RAM is defined from the mixture of a standard tropospheric and maritime aerosol type. The RAM is derived from the following two processes. The first process involved the analysis of a 6-year data set composed of aerosol optical and microphysical properties acquired through the ground-based PHOTONS/AERONET network located at Arcachon (France). The second process was related to aerosol climatology using the NOAA hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Results show that aerosols have a bimodal particle size distribution regardless of the season and are mainly represented by a mixed coastal continental type. Furthermore, the results indicate that aerosols originate from both the Atlantic Ocean (53.6%) and Continental Europe (46.4%). Based on these results, absorbing biomass burning, urban-industrial and desert dust particles have not been considered although they represent on average 19% of the occurrences. This represents the main current limitation of the RAM. An assessment of the performances of SACOR is then performed by inter-comparing the water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)) retrievals with three different AC methods (ACOLITE, MACCS and 6SV using three different standard aerosol types) using match-ups (N = 8) composed of Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes and field radiometric measurements. Results indicate consistency with the SWIR-based ACOLITE method, which shows the best performance, except in the green channel where SACOR matches well with the in-situ data (relative error of 7%). In conclusion, the study demonstrates the high potential of the SACOR approach for the retrieval of rho(w). In the future, the method could be improved by using an adaptive aerosol model, which may select the most relevant local aerosol model following the origin of the atmospheric air mass, and could be applied to the latest HRS (Sentinel-2/MSI, SPOT6-7, Pleiades 1A-1B).

TI  - Global land surface evaporation trend during the past half century: Corroboration by Clausius-Clapeyron scaling
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses of satellite data mainly over the world's ocean surfaces have shown that during 1986-2006 global average values of atmospheric water vapor, precipitation and evaporation have increased at a relative rate of 0.0013 a(-1); this is roughly in accordance with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for the average temperature trend during this period, and amounts to 0.065K(-1) at the average temperature of T = 14 degrees C. Application of this concept over the world's land surfaces yields an average global evaporation trend during the past half century of around 0.4 to 0.5 mm a(-2); this confirms the values obtained in previous studies with totally different methods.

TI  - Extension of a Fast GLRT Algorithm to 5D SAR Tomography of Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes a method for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Tomographic (TomoSAR) imaging, allowing the detection of multiple scatterers that can exhibit time deformation and thermal dilation by using a CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) approach. In the last decade, several methods for TomoSAR have been proposed. The objective of this paper is to present the results obtained on high resolution tomographic SAR data of urban areas, by using a statistical test for detecting multiple scatterers that takes into account phase variations due to possible deformations and/or thermal dilation. The test can be evaluated in terms of probability of detection (PD) and probability of false alarm (PFA), and is based on an approximation of a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT), denoted as Fast-Sup-GLRT. It was already applied and validated by the authors in the 3D case, while here it is extended and experimented in the 5D case. Numerical experiments on simulated and on StripMap TerraSAR-X (TSX) data have been carried out. The presented results show that the adopted method allows the detection of a large number of scatterers and the estimation of their position with a good accuracy, and that the consideration of the thermal dilation and surface deformation helps in recovering more single and double scatterers, with respect to the case in which these contributions are not taken into account. Moreover, the capability of method to provide reliable estimates of the deformations in urban structure suggests its use in structure stress monitoring.

TI  - Hybrid intraoperative imaging techniques in radioguided surgery: present clinical applications and future outlook
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - This review aims to summarise the hybrid modality radioguidance techniques currently in clinical use and development, and to discuss possible future avenues of research. Due to the novelty of these approaches, evidence of their clinical relevance does not yet exist. The purpose of this review is to inform nuclear medicine practitioners of current cutting edge research in radioguided surgery which may enter standard clinical practice within the next 5-10 years. Hybrid imaging is of growing importance to nuclear medicine diagnostics, but it is only with recent advances in technology that hybrid modalities are being investigated for use during radioguided surgery. These modalities aim to overcome some of the difficulties of surgical imaging while maintaining many benefits, or providing entirely new information unavailable to surgeons with traditional radioguidance.A literature review was carried out using online reference databases (Scopus, PubMed). Review articles obtained using this technique were citation mined to obtain further references.In total, 2367 papers were returned, with 425 suitable for further assessment. 60 papers directly related to hybrid intraoperative imaging in radioguided surgery are reported on. Of these papers, 25 described the clinical use of hybrid imaging, 22 described the development of new hybrid probes and tracers, and 13 described the development of hybrid technologies for future clinical use. Hybrid gamma-NIR fluorescence was found to be the most common clinical technique, with 35 papers associated with these modalities. Other hybrid combinations include gamma-bright field imaging, gamma-ultrasound imaging, gamma-beta imaging and beta-OCT imaging. The combination of preoperative and intraoperative images is also discussed.Hybrid imaging offers new possibilities for assisting clinicians and surgeons in localising the site of uptake in procedures such as in sentinel node detection.

TI  - Detecting dryland degradation using Time Series Segmentation and Residual Trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland degradation is an issue of international significance as dryland regions play a substantial role in global food production. Remotely sensed data provide the only long term, large scale record of changes within dryland ecosystems. The Residual Trend, or RESTREND, method is applied to satellite observations to detect dryland degradation. Whilst effective inmost cases, it has been shown that the RESTREND method can fail to identify degraded pixels if the relationship between vegetation and precipitation has broken-down as a result of severe or rapid degradation. This paper presents an extended version of the RESTREND methodology that incorporates the Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend method to identify step changes in the time series that are related to significant structural changes in the ecosystem, e.g. land use changes. When applied to Australia, this new methodology, termed Time Series Segmentation and Residual Trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND), was able to detect degradation in 5.25% of pixels compared to only 2.0% for RESTREND alone. This modified methodology was then assessed in two regions with known histories of degradation where it was found to accurately capture both the timing and directionality of ecosystem change.

TI  - Organic molecules with propeller structures for efficient photoacoustic imaging and photothermal ablation of cancer cells
T2  - MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic (PA) imaging has recently attracted great attention due to its noninvasive and nonionizing properties and high penetration depth. This technique is particularly attractive for sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging, which is highly desirable during sentinel lymph node biopsy for the detection of breast cancer metastasis. In this work, we report the design and synthesis of BTPETTQ with a propeller structure and a donor-acceptor-donor configuration, which exhibits strong NIR absorption, extremely weak fluorescence and a high PA signal in solution as molecular species. After being encapsulated into a polymeric matrix, BTPETTQ nanoparticles (NPs) also show excellent PA signal output, which is superior to the widely used gold nanorods based on the same mass and is also better than that from the NPs based on the core molecule of TTQ without tetraphenylethene modification. High-resolution PA imaging of SLN is achieved after injection of BTPETTQ NPs into the left paw of rats. The good photothermal conversion efficiency (40%) of BTPETTQ NPs also ensures their good performance in photothermal therapy, which is validated by the effective killing of HeLa cells upon 808 nm laser irradiation. This work demonstrates the great potential of compounds with propeller structures for PA imaging and photothermal therapy applications.

TI  - Living with floods - Household perception and satellite observations in the Barotse floodplain, Zambia
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Barotse Floodplain, a designated Ramsar site, is home to thousands of indigenous people along with an extensive wetland ecosystem and food production system. Increasingly it is also a popular tourist destination with its annual ICuomboka festival which celebrates the relocation of the king and the Lozi people to higher ground before the onset of the flood season. This paper presents an integrated approach which cross validates and combines the floodplain residents' perceptions about recent floods with information on flood inundation levels derived from satellite observations. Local residents' surveys were conducted to assess farmers' perception on the flooding patterns and the impact on their livelihoods. Further, a series of flood inundation maps from 1989 to 2014 generated from remotely sensed Landsat imagery were used to assess the recent patterns of floods. Results show that the floodplain has a population of 33 thousand living in 10,849 small permeant or temporary buildings with a total cropland area of 4976 ha. The floodplain hydrology and flooding patterns have changed, confirmed by both surveys and satellite image analysis, due to catchment development and changing climate. The average annual inundated areas have increased from about 316 thousand ha in 1989-1998 to 488 thousand ha in 2005 2014. As a result the inundated cropland and houses increased from 9% to 6% in 1989 to 73% and 47% in 2014, respectively. The timing of the floods has also changed with both delaying and early onset happening more frequently. These changes cause increasing difficulties in flood forecast and preparation using indigenous knowledge, therefore creating greater damages to crops, livestock, and houses. Current floodplain management system is inadequate and new interventions are needed to help manage the floods at a systematic manner. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of MODIS sensor calibration updates on Greenland Ice Sheet surface reflectance and albedo trends
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) surface reflectance and albedo trends using the newly released Collection 6 (C6) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products over the period 2001-2016. We find that the correction of MODIS sensor degradation provided in the new C6 data products reduces the magnitude of the surface reflectance and albedo decline trends obtained from previous MODIS data (i.e., Collection 5, C5). Collection 5 and 6 data product analysis over GrIS is characterized by surface (i.e., wet vs. dry) and elevation (i.e., 500-2000 m, 2000m and greater) conditions over the summer season from 1 June to 31 August. Notably, the visible-wavelength declining reflectance trends identified in several bands of MODIS C5 data from previous studies are only slightly detected at reduced magnitude in the C6 versions over the dry snow area. Declining albedo in the wet snow and ice area remains over the MODIS record in the C6 product, albeit at a lower magnitude than obtained using C5 data. Further analyses of C6 spectral reflectance trends show both reflectance increases and decreases in select bands and regions, suggesting that several competing processes are contributing to Greenland Ice Sheet albedo change. Investigators using MODIS data for other ocean, atmosphere and/or land analyses are urged to consider similar re-examinations of trends previously established using C5 data.

TI  - A landscape ecological perspective of the impacts of urbanization on urban green spaces in the Klang Valley
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is an inevitable process and the majority of the world's population are migrating into cities, particularly in developing countries. Urban development has expanded rapidly in expense of the already limited green spaces in the world. Urban green spaces (UGS) are crucial components of urban sustain ability and are vital for enhancing our quality of living. This study aims at developing a systematic approach to monitor changes of the urban landscape and assessing the conditions of UGS in the Klang Valley. Remote sensing processing techniques were used to extract meaningful data from mid-resolution Landsat satellite images of 1989, 2001, and 2014. We utilised urbanization indices to measure the magnitude and speed of urban development, while landscape metrics were used to describe the composition and configuration of each classes in the landscape. The results revealed that UGS in the Klang Valley have increased by 318.02% in proportion to built-up areas (high density built-up (HDB) and low density built-up (LDB)) from 1989 to 2014. The percentage of UGS compared to both HDB and LDB in 1989, 2001, and 2014 is 12.62%, 19.43%, and 22.51%, respectively. However, the fragmentation of UGS increased by approximately 100% in two decades and mainly occurred in areas with higher HDB. Spatial patterns of UGS in the Klang Valley were described based on the landscape metrics used. The developed approach can assist urban planners and decision makers to obtain a synoptic yet comprehensive view of the urban landscape. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of impervious surface growth in urban environment through remote sensing estimates
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast growth in population and expansion of urban built area has led to the transformation of the natural landscape into impervious surfaces. Remote sensing-based estimate of impervious surface area (ISA) has emerged as an important indicator for the assessment of water resources depletion in urban areas and developed a correlation between land-use change and their potential impact on urban hydrology. In the present work, a remote sensing-based Impervious Surface Area (ISA) was carried out for New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) city, one of the fastest growing cities in National Capital Region (NCR) of India. The impervious surface area (ISA) of NOIDA was calculated for the years 2001, 2007 and 2014 using multi-temporal LANDSAT thermal data by applying linear spectral mixing analysis (LSMA) techniques to monitor the growth rate of impervious surface. The results observed by analysis of multi-temporal satellite images show an extreme temporal change in the growth of ISA in the city. The ISA observed for the year 2001 is 28 sq.km; in 2007, its increase was 48 sq. km and was 132 in 2014. The results were observed from this work through the use of satellite data which is very important for water resource management, planning and prediction of ISA impact on hydrology.

TI  - An Improvement on the Clustering of High-Resolution Satellite Images Using a Hybrid Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The challenge of obtaining training data for supervised classifications of satellite images has led researchers to unsupervised algorithms, i.e. cluster analysis. Numerous researches have been conducted to improve quality and decrease uncertainty of results of this analysis. This study proposes a hybrid cost function as well as a hybrid clustering algorithm-Artificial Bee Colony optimization approach for the clustering of high-resolution satellite images. In order to evaluate viability of the proposed methodology, it is compared to some other classic clustering algorithms such as modified K-Means, K-Medoids, Fuzzy C-Means, and Kernel-based Fuzzy C-Means methods over three different study areas selected from a WorldView-2 satellite image. The Shannon entropy technique, Kappa coefficient, compactness, and separation criteria are used as quality and uncertainty indicators for the evaluation. The results of the study show that, compared to other methods, the hybrid algorithm obtained from the proposed cost function, Kernel-based Fuzzy C-Means method, and ABC algorithm provide clustering capabilities of higher quality and lower uncertainty levels.

TI  - Mapping fire regimes in China using MODIS active fire and burned area data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Relatively little is known about vegetation fire regimes in China. In this study, we investigated fire regime characteristics and their potential drivers, utilizing information extracted from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite. Twelve fire regime variables were selected and computed on a regular grid over all of China, using MODIS burned area and active fire data during the period 2001 to 2016, to identify fire incidence and its inter-annual variability, seasonality, intensity, fire size distribution and vegetation types affected by fire. The variables were normalized and clustered to define six fire regimes with distinctive fire attributes. Results show that 78.6% of the land in China was affected by fire during the study period. The barren or sparsely vegetated lands of western China are nearly fire-free. Active fires were observed in Central China, but area burned was not detectable from MODIS. Forest fires in northeastern China are relatively large, infrequent, with a short fire season that peaks in non winter seasons and higher inter-annual variability, implying a high likelihood of accidental causes. In contrast, forest fires in southern China are relatively small, frequent, with a long fire season that peaks in non-summer seasons, and lower inter-annual variability, suggesting regular use as a land management tool. Low inter-annual variability and low fire intensity were associated with cropland fires, whereas grassland fires generally exhibit the opposite traits. We have also discussed the potential drivers of each fire regime characteristics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predicting Sea Surface Salinity Using an Improved Genetic Algorithm Combining Operation Tree Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the use of an improved genetic algorithm combining operation tree method (IGAOT) and apply it to monitor the salinity of the Taiwan Strait by using remote-sensing data. The genetic algorithm combining operation tree (GAOT) is a data mining method used to automatically discover relationships among nonlinear systems. Based on genetic algorithms (GAs), the relationships between input and output can be expressed as parse trees. The GAOT method typically has the disadvantages of premature convergence, which means it cannot produce satisfying solutions and performs satisfactorily when applied to only low-dimensional problems. Therefore, the GAOT method is enhanced using an automatic incremental procedure to improve the search ability of the method and avoid trapping in a local optimum. In this case study, an IGAOT is used to determine the relationship between the in situ data on the salinity of the Taiwan Strait and the data on the spectral parameters, seven wavebands, of a Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The results indicate that the IGAOT model performs more favorably than do the GAOT and linear regression (LR1 and LR2) models, exhibits higher correlation coefficients, and involves fewer estimating errors. The results of this study indicate that the proposed technique is useful for estimating the Taiwan Strait salinity.

TI  - Recent land cover changes and sensitivity of the model simulations to various land cover datasets for China
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable land cover data are important for improving numerical simulation by regional climate model, because the land surface properties directly affect climate simulation by partitioning of energy, water and momentum fluxes and by determining temperature and moisture at the interface between the land surface and atmosphere. China has experienced significant land cover change in recent decades and accurate representation of these changes is, hence, essential. In this study, we used a climate model to examine the changes experienced in the regional climate because of the different land cover data in recent decades. Three sets of experiments are performed using the same settings, except for the land use/cover (LC) data for the years 1990, 2000, 2009, and the model default LC data. Three warm season periods are selected, which represented a wet (1998), normal (2000) and a dry year (2011) for China in each set of experiment. The results show that all three sets of land cover experiments simulate a warm bias relative to the control with default LC data for near-surface temperature in summertime in most parts of China. It is especially noticeable in the southwest China and south of the Yangtze River, where significant changes of LC occurred. Deforestation in southwest China and to the south of Yangtze River in the experiment cases may have contributed to the negative precipitation bias relative to the control cases. Large LC changes in northwestern Tibetan Plateau for 2000 and 2009 datasets are also associated with changes in surface temperature, precipitation, and heat fluxes. Wind anomalies and energy budget changes are consistent with the precipitation and temperature changes.

AB  - Mating disruption of Ostrinia furnacalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) with its sex pheromone has not been commonly used in NE China due to a lack of information about optimal sex pheromone dosages and the density of release points required in the field. During 2014-2016, first, the two active pheromone ingredients were evaluated in the laboratory alone at ca. 2.5-5.0 mg, or in combination at 0.2-6.0 mg, to disrupt male O. furnacalis mating behaviors. Then, mating disruption areas, with radii of <8.0 m, were determined with those same dosages in corn, an orchard, and soybean fields by comparing male captures in sentinel traps in the control plots with those in corresponding disruption treatments. Finally, 6.0 (F30) and 0.2mg (Fs) dosages were used in fields at 20-640 and 200-6,400 release points/ha. We found that >= 6.0mg of the binary pheromone mixture, or ca. 5.0mg of either of the two single components, completely disrupted mating behaviors, and F30 of the binary mixture provided a 200-m(2) disruption area, with at least 50% capture reductions. At a density of 60-640 and 600-6,400 points/ha in a corn field, F30 and Fs dosages provided >90% mating disruption, leaf protection, and ear protection. The dispenser densities and inverse male catches in traps tended to follow a noncompetitive mechanism of mating disruption. Since 85% disruption of mating with 200-400 0.02mg release points/ha was obtained, that level is recommended as the choice in future NE China O. furnacalis IPM programs.

TI  - Measuring the Coordinated Development of Ecological and Economic Systems in Hengduan Mountain Area
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the expansion of the concept of sustainable development, it has become increasingly important to investigate the means for achieving sustainable eco-economic development. On the basis of Landsat imagery of Hengduan Mountain area of China acquired in 1990, 2000, and 2010, we analyzed the coordination relationships, evolution characteristics, and aggregation modes of the economy and ecology in this region using ecosystem service value (ESV) and ecological economic harmony (eco-economic harmony, EEH) models. The following results were obtained. (1) There was a significant transition in land cover, wherein grassland increased the most and farmland decreased the most, by 1.18 x 10(4) km(2) and 9.41 x 10(3) km(2), respectively. These trends were related to urban expansion and the implementation of ecological measures; (2) From 1990 to 2000, there was a deterioration in the ecological system, whereas after 2000, the ecosystem improved due to implementation of the Chinese government's Returning Farmland to Forest (Grassland) scheme, thereby illustrating the importance of forest to ecosystem stability; (3) Spatially, the EEH index showed a dual-core structure centered on a low conflict zone and potential crisis zone, which signified that there was a trend of coordinated development between the economy and ecology; however, this was not stable; (4) There were four types of EEH evolution zoneslow conflict, potential crisis, slight improvement, and significant improvement zonesof which the improvement zones accounted for 55.15% of the area, thereby indicating that over time the economy has played a positive role in shaping the ecological environment; (5) The spatial aggregation modes of EEH evolution were band coordinated mode, group uncoordinated mode and group improvement mode, which meant the relationship of ecology and economy was always in lowest coordinated state in a banded form, in uncoordinated state and a significant increase in a block form, respectively. These modes were intended to provide a reference for the sustainable development in southwest China.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of GF-4 PMS Sensor Based on Assimilation of Landsat-8 OLI Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data obtained from remote sensors must undergo radiometric calibration before use in quantitative applications. However, the large view angles of the panchromatic multispectral sensor (PMS) aboard the GF-4 satellite pose challenges for cross-calibration due to the effects of atmospheric radiation transfer and the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). To address this problem, this paper introduces a novel cross-calibration method based on data assimilation considering cross-calibration as an optimal approximation problem. The GF-4 PMS was cross-calibrated with the well-calibrated Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) as the reference sensor. In order to correct unequal bidirectional reflection effects, an adjustment factor for the BRDF was established, making complex models unnecessary. The proposed method employed the Shuffled Complex Evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm to find the optimal calibration coefficients and BRDF adjustment factor through an iterative process. The validation results revealed a surface reflectance error of <5% for the new cross-calibration coefficients. The accuracy of calibration coefficients were significantly improved when compared to the officially published coefficients as well as those derived using conventional methods. The uncertainty produced by the proposed method was less than 7%, meeting the demands for future quantitative applications and research. This method is also applicable to other sensors with large view angles.

TI  - A New Air Pollution Source Identification Method Based on Remotely Sensed Aerosol and Improved Glowworm Swarm Optimization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution sources generally cannot be identified as the specific factories but certain industries. Focusing on this issue, a new method, based on an improved glowworm swarm optimization and remotely sensed imagery, was proposed to precisely orientate and quantify air pollution sources in this study. In addition, meteorological data and GIS information were also used to backtrack the pollution source. After that, in order to quantify the pollution of each factory in the study areas, three pollution indices, pollution gross (PG), pollution intensity, and area-normalized pollution (ANP), were proposed. As a result, the polluting contribution of each factory was listed, and the most polluting factories, which were bulletined as the key monitoring factories by the local authority, were accurately extracted. Among the pollution indices, ANP is the most robust, reliable, and recommended. Furthermore, the result also shows factory pollution background information achieved from the historical remote sensing data which can be used to improve the precision of identification. To our knowledge, this study provides the first attempt to address the problem of identifying a pollution source as originating from an individual factory based on remote sensing data. The proposed method provides a useful tool for air quality management, and the result would be meaningful to environmental and economic issue.

TI  - Deep Fusion of Remote Sensing Data for Accurate Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The multisensory fusion of remote sensing data has obtained a great attention in recent years. In this letter, we propose a new feature fusion framework based on deep neural networks (DNNs). The proposed framework employs deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to effectively extract features of multi-/hyperspectral and light detection and ranging data. Then, a fully connected DNN is designed to fuse the heterogeneous features obtained by the previous CNNs. Through the aforementioned deep networks, one can extract the discriminant and invariant features of remote sensing data, which are useful for further processing. At last, logistic regression is used to produce the final classification results. Dropout and batch normalization strategies are adopted in the deep fusion framework to further improve classification accuracy. The obtained results reveal that the proposed deep fusion model provides competitive results in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed deep learning idea opens a new window for future remote sensing data fusion.

TI  - A Spatial and Temporal Nonlocal Filter-Based Data Fusion Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The tradeoff in remote sensing instruments that balances the spatial resolution and temporal frequency limits our capacity to monitor spatial and temporal dynamics effectively. The spatiotemporal data fusion technique is considered as a cost-effective way to obtain remote sensing data with both high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency, by blending observations from multiple sensors with different advantages or characteristics. In this paper, we develop the spatial and temporal nonlocal filter-based fusion model (STNLFFM) to enhance the prediction capacity and accuracy, especially for complex changed landscapes. The STNLFFM method provides a new transformation relationship between the fine-resolution reflectance images acquired from the same sensor at different dates with the help of coarse-resolution reflectance data, and makes full use of the high degree of spatiotemporal redundancy in the remote sensing image sequence to produce the final prediction. The proposed method was tested over both the Coleambally Irrigation Area study site and the Lower Gwydir Catchment study site. The results show that the proposed method can provide a more accurate and robust prediction, especially for heterogeneous landscapes and temporally dynamic areas.

TI  - Lymph Node Fluorescence During Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy With Indocyanine Green: Prospective Dosing Analysis
T2  - CLINICAL GENITOURINARY CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We prospectively assessed fluorescent sentinel lymph node (LN) detection with indocyanine green (ICG) for the detection of LN metastases and the ideal ICG dosing in patients undergoing robot- assisted radical prostatectomy. ICG had low sensitivity for the detection of LN metastases. Fluorescent sentinel LN dissection with ICG does not represent an alternative to a well- performed extended pelvic LN dissection.Objective: To prospectively assess the ideal dosing and the value of fluorescent sentinel lymph node (LN) detection with indocyanine green (ICG) for the detection of LN metastases in intermediate- and high-risk patients undergoing robot-assisted prostatectomy and extended pelvic LN dissection (ePLND). Patients and Methods: Twenty patients received transperineal prostatic injections of ICG. Patients were cycled through 5 doses (1.25, 2.5, 3.75, 5, and 7.5 mg) so optimal ICG dosing could be discovered early. Results: ICG injection was able to identify fluorescent LN (FLN) packets in all 20 patients. Compared to the higher ICG doses, the 1.25 and 2.5 mg doses had fewer FLN packets and were abandoned after 1 dose each. The median number of FLN packets was 4.0, 6.0, and 4.5 for the respective doses of 3.75, 5.0, and 7.5 mg. The external iliac group was the most common site of fluorescence in 27.2% of patients, followed by the common iliac (21.3%), obturator (20.3%), internal iliac (18.5%), and node of Cloquet (7.7%). Seven (35%) of 20 patients had node-positive disease. Of the 5 patients that had fluorescent tissue outside of our ePLND template, 1 had a positive node present in the anterior bladder neck fat. Across all patients, ICG had 62% sensitivity, 50% specificity, 8% positive predictive value, and 95% negative predictive value in detecting LN metastases. Conclusion: The low sensitivity of ICG for the detection of LN metastases highlights why FLN dissection with ICG does not represent an alternative to ePLND.

TI  - Surveillance of upper respiratory infections using a new multiplex PCR assay compared to conventional methods during the influenza season in Taiwan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To improve diagnosis as part of laboratory surveillance in Taiwan, influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance was conducted using a new multiplex PCR assay (FilmArray) and the results compared to those of conventional methods The study was performed during the winter months.Methods: Throat swabs from patients with an ILI presenting to physicians in sentinel practices were collected during the 2016-2017 influenza season.Results: A total of 52 samples tested positive by FilmArray Respiratory Panel. Forty percent were influenza A virus, and subtype H3N2 virus was the major epidemic strain. However, nearly 60% of ILI cases seen at sentinel sites were caused by non-influenza pathogens. The results of the FilmArray assay and cell culture were identical, and this assay was more sensitive than a rapid influenza diagnostic test. Genetic analyses revealed new influenza A H3N2 variants belonging to a novel subclade 3C.2a2.Conclusions: The FilmArray assay facilitates urgent testing and laboratory surveillance for common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. This study demonstrated the use of a highly sensitive assay using clinical samples that is feasible for application worldwide. This may lead to an increased rate of diagnosis of viral infections and to improved patient outcomes, and in particular to a reduction in the overuse of antibiotics and antivirals.

TI  - Assessment of forest recovery at Wu-Ling fire scars in Taiwan using multi temporal Landsat imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), a satellite-derived index widely used to map the burned area and to assess burn severity level, was reconceptualized to propose the indices of post-fire recovery condition and resilience. Time series Landsat imagery during 1994-2015 were used to observe the forest recovery of Wu-Ling fire scars in Taiwan. Burn Recovery Ratio (BRR) was newly developed as the indicator to better clarify the forest recovery status. Results show that BRR coupled with dNBR (bi-temporal NBR) could quantitatively describe the level of forest recovery through the heterogeneity of forest landscape which is confirmed by field investigation. Time of complete recovery (t(c)), indicator of post-fire resilience, were predicted using curve-fitting of forest recovery trajectories to the exponential decay function. The spatial distribution of t(c) could reveal the patterns of post-fire recovery across the fire scars. For wildfire prevention, the issue of fire recurrence should be concerned at the areas of fire-adapted species with low t(c) value. For areas of deterioration sites with high t(c) value, the rehabilitation project should be implemented to accelerate forest restoration.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a model for calculating monthly average hourly diffuse erythemal solar ultraviolet (EUV) radiation under all sky conditions in Thailand was developed. The model is a function of air mass, aerosol optical depth and satellite-derived cloud index, as these parameters are sensitive to diffuse EUV radiation. Diffuse EUV irradiance were measured using UV-biometers equipped with shade ball during April 2011-March 2014 at four stations in Thailand. Data from these stations were used to formulate the model. The model was validated using an independent dataset (April 2014-March 2016) at the same sites. The modeled diffuse EUV irradiance showed good agreement with that from the ground-based measurements, with root mean square difference (RMSD) of 12.7% and mean bias difference (MBD) of -2.8%. The use of satellite data provided a simple and practical method to calculate monthly average hourly diffuse EUV irradiance over Thailand. Spatial monthly distributions are shown as maps.

TI  - Increased Syphilis Testing of Men Who Have Sex With Men: Greater Detection of Asymptomatic Early Syphilis and Relative Reduction in Secondary Syphilis
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Syphilis rates have increased markedly among men who have sex with men (MSM) internationally. We examined trends in syphilis testing and detection of early syphilis among MSM in Australia.Methods. Serial cross-sectional analyses on syphilis testing and diagnoses among MSM attending a national sentinel network of 46 clinics in Australia between 2007 and 2014.Results. 359 313 clinic visits were included. The proportion of MSM serologically tested for syphilis annually increased in HIVnegative (48% to 91%; P-trend < .0001) and HIV-positive MSM (42% to 77%; P-trend < .0001). The mean number of tests per man per year increased from 1.3 to 1.6 in HIV-negative MSM (P-trend < .0001) and from 1.6 to 2.3 in HIV-positive MSM (P-trend < .0001). 2799 and 1032 syphilis cases were detected in HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM, respectively. Among HIV-negative MSM, the proportion of infections that were early latent increased from 27% to 44% (P-trend < .0001), while the proportion that were secondary decreased from 24% to 19% (P-trend =.030). Among HIV-positive MSM, early latent infections increased from 23% to 45% (P-trend <.0001), while secondary infections decreased from 45% to 26% (P-trend =.0003). Among HIV-positive MSM, decreasing secondary syphilis correlated with increasing testing coverage (r = -0.87; P = .005) or frequency (r = -0.93; P = .001).Conclusions. Increases in syphilis screening were associated with increased detection of asymptomatic infectious syphilis and relative falls in secondary syphilis for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM nationally, suggesting interruption of syphilis progression.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intracratonic South Rewa Gondwana Basin occupies the northern part of NW-SE trending Son-Mahanadi rift basin of India. The new gravity data acquired over the northern part of the basin depicts WNW-ESE and ENE-WSW anomaly trends in the southern and northern part of the study area respectively. 3D inversion of residual gravity anomalies has brought out undulations in the basement delineating two major depressions (i) near Tihki in the north and (ii) near Shahdol in the south, which divided into two sub-basins by an ENE-WSW trending basement ridge near Sidi. Maximum depth to the basement is about 5.5 km within the northern depression. The new magnetic data acquired over the basin has brought out ENE-WSW to E-W trending short wavelength magnetic anomalies which are attributed to volcanic dykes and intrusive having remanent magnetization corresponding to upper normal and reverse polarity (29N and 29R) of the Deccan basalt magnetostratigrahy. Analysis of remote sensing and geological data also reveals the predominance of ENE-WSW structural faults. Integration of remote sensing, geological and potential field data suggest reactivation of ENE-WSW trending basement faults during Deccan volcanism through emplacement of mafic dykes and sills. Therefore, it is suggested that South Rewa Gondwana basin has witnessed post rift tectonic event due to Deccan volcanism.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cabeceira Comprida stream's watershed, located in Santa Fe do Sul, Sao Paulo state, has great environmental importance. It is essential for supplying water to the population and generating surpluses for sewage dilution. This study aimed to evaluate the annual performance of the components of water productivity from Landsat-8 images of 2015, using the Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER), calculating the actual evapotranspiration (ETa), biomass (BIO) and water productivity (WP). The annual averages of ETa, BIO and WP were 1.03 mm day(-1), 36.04 kg ha(-1) day(-1) and 3.19 kg m(-3), respectively. The average annual values of ETa for land use and occupation were 1.40, 1.23, 1.05, 0.97 and 1.08 mm day(-1) for the remaining forest (RF), invasive species (IS), pasture (Pa), annual crop (AC) and perennial crop (PC), respectively, with BIO of 57.64, 46.10, 36.78, 32.69, 40.03 kg ha(-1) day(-1) for RF, IS, Pa, AC and PC, respectively, resulting in WP of 3.94, 3.59, 3.25, 3.09, 3.35 kg m(-3) for RF, IS, Pa, AC and PC, respectively. The ETa, BIO and WP adjust to the seasonality of the region, and RF and IS stood out with the highest values.

TI  - Variability and trends in the Arctic Sea ice cover: Results from different techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Variability and trend studies of sea ice in the Arctic have been conducted using products derived from the same raw passive microwave data but by different groups using different algorithms. This study provides consistency assessment of four of the leading products, namely, Goddard Bootstrap (SB2), Goddard NASA Team (NT1), EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF 1.2), and Hadley HadISST 2.2 data in evaluating variability and trends in the Arctic sea ice cover. All four provide generally similar ice patterns but significant disagreements in ice concentration distributions especially in the marginal ice zone and adjacent regions in winter and meltponded areas in summer. The discrepancies are primarily due to different ways the four techniques account for occurrences of new ice and meltponding. However, results show that the different products generally provide consistent and similar representation of the state of the Arctic sea ice cover. Hadley and NT1 data usually provide the highest and lowest monthly ice extents, respectively. The Hadley data also show the lowest trends in ice extent and ice area at -3.88%/decade and -4.37%/decade, respectively, compared to an average of -4.36%/decade and -4.57%/decade for all four. Trend maps also show similar spatial distribution for all four with the largest negative trends occurring at the Kara/Barents Sea and Beaufort Sea regions, where sea ice has been retreating the fastest. The good agreement of the trends especially with updated data provides strong confidence in the quantification of the rate of decline in the Arctic sea ice cover.Plain Language Summary The declining Arctic sea ice cover, especially in the summer, has been the center of attention in recent years. Reports on the sea ice cover have been provided by different institutions using basically the same set of satellite data but different techniques for estimating key parameters such as ice concentration, ice extent, and ice area. In this study, a comparison of results from four different techniques that are frequently used shows significant disagreements in the characterization of the distribution of the sea ice cover primarily in areas that have a large fraction of new ice cover or significant amount of surface melt. However, the actual changes in the ice cover are consistently depicted and the trends in sea ice extent and ice area from the different data sets are practically the same providing strong confidence that satellite data are interpreted consistently by different scientists independently and confirming that the ice extent of the Arctic perennial ice is indeed declining at the rate of about 11% per decade. The results provide useful information for modelers, policy makers, and the general scientific public.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article details our research within a large, publicly traded company to understand the 'corporate culture' within Cultural Resource Management as it is practiced today. We outline the trials, twists, and roadblocks in our attempt to first change, and then to merely understand, the nature of corporate culture in a large-scale environmental assessment company situated within development capitalism. In the end, we share how corporate archaeologists think about engagement with Indigenous communities in British Columbia in an attempt to look within the corporate sector to understand its worldview and perspectives. We then offer 'solutions' to drive internal, structural change in hopes of engendering a community-first approach as first step towards decolonizing commercial archaeology.

TI  - Unscrambling method and methodology in action research traditions: theoretical conceptualization of praxis and emancipation
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Action research is a participatory approach that is used in an array of contexts. From its first proposition it comprises four core principles: participation and collaboration; a constant spiral cycle of self-reflection; knowledge generation; and practice transformation. Praxis and emancipation are two important analytical categories in AR, but are conceptualized differently in the two existing AR traditions. These conceptualizations reveal different AR aims, which lead to either the use of AR as a method (Northern tradition) or as a methodology (Southern tradition). Much depends on the researchers' interest and worldview. Our objective in this paper is to compare how emancipation and praxis are theorized in both traditions. This discussion intends to add insight into the methodological understanding and utilization of AR.

AB  - The vast amount of data obtained from current remote sensing data acquisition technologies represents a wealth of useful and affordable geospatial data for policy and decision makers. However, the consequent computational cost of analyzing these data may become prohibitive. This letter extends previous efforts in exploiting distributed processing to speed up the image interpretation process. In this letter, we propose and evaluate a mechanism to exploit task parallelism in addition to data parallelism. Experiments conducted on cloud computing infrastructure, following an object-based interpretation model, demonstrated that substantial performance gains can be obtained with the proposed mechanism.

TI  - Space technology meets policy: An overview of Earth Observation sensors for monitoring of cultural landscapes within policy framework for Cultural Heritage
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A wide range of satellite sensors that provide potentially useful imagery for digital documentation, mapping and monitoring of archaeological sites and cultural landscapes. Although some satellites have stopped acquiring new data, their archived satellite imagery can still be accessed, downloaded and exploited for monitoring of changes and therefore useful for research domain of archaeology and cultural landscapes. The aim of this paper is 1) to make an overview of past and current satellite earth observation optical sensors useful for land monitoring, with focus on cultural landscapes and 2) to illustrate a policy framework that goes beyond recommendations, suggesting the need of valuable information possibly provided by the in satellite imagery. Paper will put focus on Copernicus programme as the most recent mission that provides imagery on the global scale and free of charge. Paper, furthermore, highlights the need for a more structured consideration of the contribution that space technologies services and products can offer to the non-space sectors. The actions for implementation of strategies regarding the currently renewed attention towards cultural heritage protection and management, could soon benefit from the technological achievements of satellite technologies in terms of dedicated operational services and applications, tailored to the needs of end-users such as archaeologists, landscape professionals, public administration, researchers and students.

T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 15th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference 2017 in Vienna, Austria reviewed substantial new evidence on loco-regional and systemic therapies for early breast cancer. Treatments were assessed in light of their intensity, duration and side-effects, seeking where appropriate to escalate or de-escalate therapies based on likely benefits as predicted by tumor stage and tumor biology. The Panel favored several interventions that may reduce surgical morbidity, including acceptance of 2 mm margins for DCIS, the resection of residual cancer (but not baseline extent of cancer) in women undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, acceptance of sentinel node biopsy following neoadjuvant treatment of many patients, and the preference for neoadjuvant therapy in HER2 positive and triple-negative, stage II and III breast cancer. The Panel favored escalating radiation therapy with regional nodal irradiation in high-risk patients, while encouraging omission of boost in low-risk patients. The Panel endorsed gene expression signatures that permit avoidance of chemotherapy in many patients with ER positive breast cancer. For women with higher risk tumors, the Panel escalated recommendations for adjuvant endocrine treatment to include ovarian suppression in premenopausal women, and extended therapy for postmenopausal women. However, low-risk patients can avoid these treatments. Finally, the Panel recommended bisphosphonate use in postmenopausal women to prevent breast cancer recurrence. The Panel recognized that recommendations are not intended for all patients, but rather to address the clinical needs of the majority of common presentations. Individualization of adjuvant therapy means adjusting to the tumor characteristics, patient comorbidities and preferences, and managing constraints of treatment cost and access that may affect care in both the developed and developing world.

TI  - Implementing a Cervical Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Program: Quality Improvement in Gynaecologic Oncology.
T2  - Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is becoming a reasonable alternative to pelvic lymphadenectomy in early-stage cervical cancer. It is therefore imperative that centres without prior experience are able to successfully implement the procedure. The objectives of the current study were to (1) describe the process of implementing an SLN biopsy program with a novel peer mentorship component and (2) assess post-program quality improvement metrics, including SLN detection rate (DR) and diagnostic parameters.METHODS: An institutional SLN biopsy protocol was developed collaboratively by gynaecologic oncology, nuclear medicine, and pathology departments at University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario. All decisions were based on the best evidence available. Newly diagnosed, early-stage cervical cancer patients undergoing primary surgery were then recruited prospectively for SLN biopsy with combined technique, followed by pelvic lymphadenectomy to evaluate key quality indicators, including SLN DR, sensitivity, and negative predictive value. Surgeons with previous SLN biopsy experience mentored surgeons unfamiliar with the technique. Interim analyses and multidisciplinary rounds were regularly carried out to identify failures of technique or protocol.RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (median age 42) were enrolled in the study between August 2010 and February 2014. The median number of SLNs and total pelvic lymph nodes removed per patient were 3 and 19, respectively. SLN DRs were 92% per patient (36/39), 88.5% per hemipelvis (69/78), and 85% bilaterally (33/39). SLN biopsy correctly identified seven of eight hemipelvises with nodal metastases, yielding a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI 0.47 to 1.00) and a false negative rate of 12% (95% CI 0 to 0.53). Surgeons undergoing peer mentorship (n= 3) performed as effectively (DR100%) as surgeons (n= 2) with prior experience (DR 85%).CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a model upon which other centres can adopt and validate cervical SLN biopsy. High SLN DRs and accurate identification of lymph node metastases can be achieved by focusing on multidisciplinary collaboration, knowledge translation with creation of evidence-based protocols, peer mentorship, and ongoing quality control.

TI  - Functional and molecular responses of the blue mussel <i>Mytilus edulis</i>' hemocytes exposed. to cadmium - An <i>in vitro</i> model and transcriptomic approach
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The bivalve mollusk, Mytilus edulis, is used as a sentinel species in several monitoring programs due to its ability to bio-accumulate contaminants. Its immune system consists of hemocytes and humoral components, which constitute the main part of the hemolymph. The present study is aimed at understanding the effects of Cd on the differentially expressed genes involved in the phagocytosis of M. edulis' hemocytes. Our approach focuses on an in vitro model by exposing hemocytes to different concentrations of Cd ranging from 10(-9) M to 10(-3) M. Phagocytosis and cell viability as functional markers were measured using flow cytometry. The molecular mechanisms regulated by Cd were investigated using RNA-seq and DGE analysis. Results showed that viability and phagocytosis of hemocytes exposed to 10-3 M of Cd were significantly decreased after 21 h of exposure. RNA sequencing data showed that 1112 transcripts (out of 352,976 contigs) were differentially regulated by the highest concentration of Cd. Among these identified transcripts, 1028 and 84 were up and down-regulated respectively. The induction of super oxide dismutase (SOD), glutathion-s-transferase (GST), cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8), multidrug resistance protein (MRP1) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) suggests that Cd can regulate key molecular mechanisms. In addition, several toll-like receptors (TLR) as well as genes involved in phagocytosis (actin and CDC42) and apoptosis (caspase 8 and XIAP/IAP) were induced by Cd. Thus, our model highlights the effect of Cd on the phagocytic function of M. edulis' hemocytes along with the regulation of gene expression involved in innate immunity, detoxification and apoptosis. Further investigations need to be pursued to unravel the effects of Cd on the molecular mechanisms identified in this study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A global geography of synchrony for marine phytoplankton
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Spatial synchrony in plankton is imperfectly understood yet may have far-reaching implications, for example for carbon export to the deep ocean. Several techniques have been used to describe patterns of spatial synchrony, from correlation coefficients to spectral methods. Some studies have used temporally extensive data sets to identify causes of synchrony. This study instead uses the exceptional spatial extent provided by remotely sensed data to describe, for the first time as far as we know, geographical patterns of synchrony in marine phytoplankton. We use these patterns to illuminate drivers of synchrony and of its geography.Location: The oceans.Time period: 2003-2015.Major taxon: Chlorophyll a-containing phytoplankton.Methods: Synchrony in chlorophyll a concentrations is mapped globally. Spatial statistics and model selection are used to illuminate main statistical determinants of synchrony and of geographical patterns in synchrony.Results: The first main result is that there is a pronounced and previously unmapped geography of synchrony for phytoplankton. For instance, synchrony was highest in the open ocean, specifically in gyres, and lowest in coastal regions. Spatial modelling provided the second main result that synchrony in sea surface temperature (SST) was a major statistical determinant of chlorophyll synchrony in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, indicating a strong Moran effect, although possibly an indirect and/or complex one. In the Pacific Ocean, this effect depended on the time-scales on which synchrony was assessed, providing our third result, which is that synchrony of phytoplankton and its geography can be time-scale specific. Synchrony of surface solar irradiance was not associated with synchrony of chlorophyll.Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first to map geography of synchrony in marine plankton. We showed that this geography is pronounced. Geographical patterns illuminated determinants of synchrony. The geography of synchrony is a major phenomenon that has been little explored.

TI  - Automated Quantification of Surface Water Inundation in Wetlands Using Optical Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a fully automated and scalable algorithm for quantifying surface water inundation in wetlands. Requiring no external training data, our algorithm estimates sub-pixel water fraction (SWF) over large areas and long time periods using Landsat data. We tested our SWF algorithm over three wetland sites across North America, including the Prairie Pothole Region, the Delmarva Peninsula and the Everglades, representing a gradient of inundation and vegetation conditions. We estimated SWF at 30-m resolution with accuracies ranging from a normalized root-mean-square-error of 0.11 to 0.19 when compared with various high-resolution ground and airborne datasets. SWF estimates were more sensitive to subtle inundated features compared to previously published surface water datasets, accurately depicting water bodies, large heterogeneously inundated surfaces, narrow water courses and canopy-covered water features. Despite this enhanced sensitivity, several sources of errors affected SWF estimates, including emergent or floating vegetation and forest canopies, shadows from topographic features, urban structures and unmasked clouds. The automated algorithm described in this article allows for the production of high temporal resolution wetland inundation data products to support a broad range of applications.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF TRANSCRIPTIONAL RESPONSES OF NORMALIZING GENES ON <i>CRASSOSTREA BRASILIANA</i> UNDER DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bivalves show remarkable plasticity to environmental changes and have been proposed as sentinel organisms in biomonitoring. Studies related to transcriptional analysis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in these organisms have notably increased, imposing a need to identify and validate adequate reference genes for an accurate and reliable analysis. In the present study, 9 reference genes were selected from transcriptome data of Crassostrea brasiliana to identify their suitability as qRT-PCR normalizer genes. The transcriptional patterns were analyzed in gills of oysters under 3 different conditions: different temperatures (18, 24, or 32 degrees C) and phenanthrene (100 mu gL(-1)) combined exposure; different salinities (10, 25, or 35%) and phenanthrene combined exposure; and 10% of diesel fuel water-accommodated fraction (diesel-WAF) exposure. Reference gene stability was calculated using 5 algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, Delta Ct, RefFinder). Transcripts of ankyrin-like (ANK), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-like (GAPDH), and alpha-tubulin-like (TUBA) genes showed minor changes in different temperature/phenanthrene treatment. Transcripts of ANK, beta-actin-like, and beta-tubulin-like genes showed better stability at salinity/phenanthrene treatment, and ANK, TUBA, and 28S ribosomal protein-like genes showed the most stable transcription pattern in oysters exposed to diesel-WAF exposure. The present study constitutes the first systematic analysis of reference gene selection for qRT-PCR normalization in C. brasiliana. These genes could be employed in studies using qRT-PCR analysis under similar experimental conditions. (C) 2017 SETAC.

TI  - Hyperspectral remote sensing applied to uranium exploration: A case study at the Mary Kathleen metamorphic-hydrothermal U-REE deposit, NW, Queensland, Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The HyMap airborne hyperspectral scanner provides 128 spectral bands between Visible-Near Infrared (VNIR) and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) wavelengths (0.45-2.5 pm). It transcends any currently operational orbital multispectral sensor (ASTER, WV3, Landsat-8) for mineral mapping in exposed areas. Here we employ HyMap data to study the type and spatial distribution of mineral assemblages in the world-class Mary Kathleen metamorphic-hydrothermal Uranium (U)-Rare Earth Elements (REE) deposit, situated in the Mount Isa Province, Australia. The focus is on Ca-bearing silicates and Fe-rich minerals. Two spectral libraries were built for the task based on publicly available data. The VNIR library comprises goethite and andradite. The SWIR library includes hornblende, epidote, calcite, kaolinite and montmorillonite. Scapolite SWIR spectra were yielded autonomously. These mineral spectra were used as endmembers for HyMap data classification and production of mineral abundance maps. Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) were the methods employed for image classification. Results were combined in RGB color composites and enhanced to provide high quality maps of Ca-bearing silicates and other minerals associated with the Ca-skarn hosted U-REE mineralization. The spatial correlation of mineral abundance maps produced here and known exposed surfaces of equivalent minerals in the open pit mine proved plausible. Wallrock alteration halos show characteristic zonal arrangements. Andradite occurs in the outer alteration halo. Selectively pervasive alteration is characterized by calcite, scapolite, epidote and homblende. These specific mineral types and their distribution in the Mary Kathleen deposit indicate multiple stages of metasomatic processes, resulting in high-temperature and retrograde Ca-bearing silicates associations. In addition, kaolinite, montmorillonite and goethite are the surface footprint of the skarn-hosted U-REE mineralization. HyMap proved to be a solid tool to characterize exposed hydrothermal mineral systems associated to skams enriched in U and REE, providing the framework for advanced geologic interpretation and conception of a regional exploration model. The occurrence of goethite, kaolinite and montmorillonite and their zonal relationship with the U-REE mineralization, as also mapped here with HyMap, may be also an additional guide for U exploration in the Mount Isa Province, especially if combined with other exploration methods.

TI  - Assimilation of <i>HY</i>-2<i>A</i> Scatterometer Ambiguous Winds Based on Feature Thinning
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on the data assimilation methods for sea surface winds, based on the level-2B HY-2A satellite microwave scatterometer wind products. We propose a new feature thinning method, which is herein used to screen scatterometer winds while maintaining the key structure of the wind field in the process of data thinning for highresolution satellite observations. We also accomplish feeding the ambiguous wind solutions directly into the data assimilation system, thus making better use of the retrieved information while simplifying the assimilation process of the scatterometer products. A numerical simulation experiment involving Typhoon Danas shows that our method gives better results than the traditional approach. This method may be a valuable alternative for operational satellite data assimilation.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of the newly-launched Landsat 8 sensor in detecting and mapping the spatial configuration of water hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i>) in inland lakes, Zimbabwe
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing of freshwater resources is increasingly becoming important, due to increased patterns of water use and the current or projected impacts of climate change and the rapid invasion by lethal water weeds. This study therefore sought to explore the potential of the recently-launched Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensor in mapping invasive species in inland lakes. Specifically, the study compares the performance of the newly-launched Landsat 8 sensor, with more advanced sensor design and image acquisition approach to the traditional Landsat-7 ETM+ in detecting and mapping the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) invasive species across Lake Chivero, in Zimbabwe. The analysis of variance test was used to identify windows of spectral separability between water hyacinth and other land cover types. The results showed that portions of the visible (B3), NIR (B4), as well as the shortwave bands (Band 8, 9 and 10) of both Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM, exhibited windows of separability between water hyacinth and other land cover types. It was also observed that on the use of Landsat 8 OLI produced high overall classification accuracy of 72%, when compared Landsat 7 ETM, which yielded lower accuracy of 57%. Water hyacinth had optimal accuracies (i.e. 92%), when compared to other land cover types, based on Landsat 8 OLI data. However, when using Landsat 7 ETM data, classification accuracies of water hyacinth were relatively lower (i.e. 67%), when compared to other land cover types (i.e. water with accuracy of 100%). Spectral curves of the old, intermediate and the young water hyacinth in Lake Chivero based on: (a) Landsat 8 OLI, and (b) Landsat 7 ETM were derived. Overall, the findings of this study underscores the relevance of the new generation multispectral sensors in providing primary data-source required for mapping the spatial distribution, and even configuration of water weeds at lower or no cost over time and space.

TI  - Use of Landsat series data to analyse the spatial and temporal variations of land degradation in a dispersive soil environment: A case of King Sabata Dalindyebo local municipality in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation as a result of inappropriate land use practices, such as overgrazing and cultivation on steep slopes, etc. is one of the major global environmental challenges. Specifically, land degradation threatens the productivity and sustainability of the natural environment, agriculture, and most importantly rural economies In most developing countries, particularly the sub-Saharan region. The main aim of this study was therefore, to assess the potential and strength of using the free or readily available Landsat series data in mapping degraded land areas at the King Sabata Dalindyebo local municipality in the Eastern Cape, South Africa (1984-2010). Data analysis was done using a robust non-parametric classification ensemble; Discriminant Analysis (DA). The results show that degraded areas vary over the years. For example, the results show that the year 1994 and 2004 incurred high degradation levels, when compared to the year 1984 and 2010. Moreover, the observed degradation significantly (alpha = 0.05) varies with soil type. The chromic acrisols have the highest levels of erosion (approx. 80% in 1984), when compared to humic-umbric acrisols (less than 10% for the entire period under study). It can also be observed that considerable part of degradation occurred in the northern part of the municipal district. Overall, the findings of this research underlines the importance and efficacy of multispectral Landsat series data-set in mapping and monitoring levels of land degradation in data-scarce catchments.

TI  - SAR-SIFT for Matching Multiple SAR Images and Radargrammetry
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a new application of the SAR-SIFT algorithm proposed by Dellinger et al. (IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens 53: 453-466, 2015) for the automatic generation of tie points (TPs). In particular, SAR-SIFT is applied on stereo-SAR images to extract corresponding points and determine their 3D position. Furthermore, the potential of the combined use of the SAR-SIFT with the SAR-stereo model for extracting reliable TPs is analysed, by evaluating their absolute accuracy in 2D and 3D. The tests are performed with TerraSAR-XHR SpotLight data acquired over Trento, Italy. Single and multiple image pairs have been considered. 3D accuracy assessment of the extracted points is performed relying on LiDAR data; the results show a planimetric accuracy up to 1 m and an elevation accuracy of about 2 m.

TI  - Using multiresolution and multitemporal satellite data for post-disaster landslide inventory in the Republic of Serbia
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on a specific event-based landslide inventory compiled after the May 2014 heavy rainfall episode in Serbia as a part of the post-disaster recovery actions. The inventory was completed for a total of 23 affected municipalities, and the municipality of Krupanj was selected as the location for a more detailed study. Three sources of data collection and analysis were used: a visual analysis of the post-event very high and high (VHR-HR) resolution images (Pl,iades, WorldView-2 and SPOT 6), semi-automatic landslide recognition in pre- and post-event coarse resolution images (Landsat 8) and a landslide mapping field campaign. The results suggest that the visual and semi-automated analyses significantly contributed to the quality of the final inventory, including the associated planning strategies for conducting future field campaigns (as a final stage of the inventorying process), all the more so because the field-based and image-based inventories were focused on different types of landslides. In the most affected municipalities that had very high resolution satellite image coverage (19.52% of the whole study area), the density of the recognized landslides was approximately three times higher than that in those municipalities without satellite image coverage (where only field data were available). The total number of field-mapped landslides for the 23 municipalities was 1785, while image-based inventories, which were available only for the municipalities with satellite image coverage (77.43% of the study area), showed 1298 landslide records. The semi-automated landslide inventory in the test area (Krupanj municipality), which was based on coarse resolution multitemporal images (Landsat 8), counted 490 landslide instances and was in agreement with the visual analysis of the higher resolution images, with an overlap of approximately 40%. These results justify the use of preliminary inventorying via satellite image analysis and suggest a considerable potential use for preliminary visual and semi-automated landslide inventorying as an important supplement to field mapping.

TI  - Shoreline change assessment using multi-temporal satellite images: a case study of Lake Sapanca, NW Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The research summarized here determines historical shoreline changes along Lake Sapanca by using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Six multi-temporal satellite images of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (L1-5 MMS), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (L7 ETM+), and Operational Land Imager Sensors (L8 OLI), covering the period between 17 June 1975 and 15 July 2016, were used to monitor shoreline positions and estimate change rates along the coastal zone. After pre-possessing routines, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and supervised classification techniques were utilized to extract six different shorelines. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), a toolbox that enables transect-based computations of shoreline displacement, was used to compute historical shoreline change rates. The average rate of shoreline change for the entire cost was 2.7 m/year of progradation with an uncertainty of 0.2 m/year. While the great part of the lake shoreline remained stable, the study concluded that the easterly and westerly coasts and deltaic coasts are more vulnerable to shoreline displacements over the last four decades. The study also reveals that anthropogenic activities, more specifically over extraction of freshwater from the lake, cyclic variation in rainfall, and deposition of sediment transported by the surrounding creeks dominantly control spatiotemporal shoreline changes in the region. Monitoring shoreline changes using multi-temporal satellite images is a significant component for the coastal decision-making and management.

TI  - Agricultural Expansion and Intensification in the Foothills of Mount Kenya: A Landscape Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study spatially assesses, quantifies, and visualizes the agricultural expansion and land use intensification in the northwestern foothills of Mount Kenya over the last 30 years: processes triggered by population growth, and, more recently, by large-scale commercial investments. We made use of Google Earth Engine to access the USGS Landsat data archive and to generate cloud-free seasonal composites. These enabled us to accurately differentiate between rainfed and irrigated cropland, which was important for assessing agricultural intensification. We developed three land cover and land use classifications using the random forest classifier, and assessed land cover and land use change by creating cross-tabulation matrices for the intervals from 1987 to 2002, 2002 to 2016, and 1987 to 2016 and calculating the net change. We then applied a landscape mosaic approach to each classification to identify landscape types categorized by land use intensity. We discuss the impacts of landscape changes on natural habitats, biodiversity, and water. Kappa accuracies for the three classifications lay between 78.3% and 82.1%. Our study confirms that rainfed and irrigated cropland expanded at the expense of natural habitats, including protected areas. Agricultural expansion took place mainly in the 1980s and 1990s, whereas agricultural intensification largely happened after 2000. Since then, not only large-scale producers, but also many smallholders have begun to practice irrigated farming. The spatial pattern of agricultural expansion and intensification in the study area is defined by water availability. Agricultural intensification and the expansion of horticulture agribusinesses increase pressure on water. Furthermore, the observed changes have heightened pressure on pasture and idle land due to the decrease in natural and agropastoral landscapes. Conflicts between pastoralists, smallholder farmers, large-scale ranches, and wildlife might further increase, particularly during the dry seasons and in years of extreme drought.

TI  - A Simple Normalized Difference Approach to Burnt Area Mapping Using Multi-Polarisation C-Band SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In fire-prone ecosystems, periodic fires are vital for ecosystem functioning. Fire managers seek to promote the optimal fire regime by managing fire season and frequency requiring detailed information on the extent and date of previous burns. This paper investigates a Normalised Difference alpha-Angle (ND alpha I) approach to burn-scar mapping using C-band data. Polarimetric decompositions are used to derive alpha-angles from pre-burn and post-burn scenes and ND alpha I is calculated to identify decreases in vegetation between the scenes. The technique was tested in an area affected by a wildfire in January 2016 in the Western Cape, South Africa. The quad-pol H-A-alpha decomposition was applied to RADARSAT-2 data and the dual-pol H-alpha decomposition was applied to Sentinel-1A data. The ND alpha I results were compared to a burn scar extracted from Sentinel-2A data. High overall accuracies of 97.4% (Kappa = 0.72) and 94.8% (Kappa = 0.57) were obtained for RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1A, respectively. However, large omission errors were found and correlated strongly with areas of high local incidence angle for both datasets. The combined use of data from different orbits will likely reduce these errors. Furthermore, commission errors were observed, most notably on Sentinel-1A results. These errors may be due to the inability of the dual-pol H-alpha decomposition to effectively distinguish between scattering mechanisms. Despite these errors, the results revealed that burnt areas could be extracted and were in good agreement with the results from Sentinel-2A. Therefore, the approach can be considered in areas where persistent cloud cover or smoke prevents the extraction of burnt area information using conventional multispectral approaches.

TI  - Enabling the Use of Sentinel-2 and LiDAR Data for Common Agriculture Policy Funds Assignment
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive strategy combining remote sensing and field data can be helpful for more effective agriculture management. Satellite data are suitable for monitoring large areas over time, while LiDAR provides specific and accurate data on height and relief. Both types of data can be used for calibration and validation purposes, avoiding field visits and saving useful resources. In this paper, we propose a process for objective and automated identification of agricultural parcel features based on processing and combining Sentinel-2 data (to sense different types of irrigation patterns) and LiDAR data (to detect landscape elements). The proposed process was validated in several use cases in Spain, yielding high accuracy rates in the identification of irrigated areas and landscape elements. An important application example of the work reported in this paper is the European Union (EU) Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) funds assignment service, which would significantly benefit from a more objective and automated process for the identification of irrigated areas and landscape elements, thereby enabling the possibility for the EU to save significant amounts of money yearly.

TI  - Frequency of and risk factors for tumor upstaging after wide local excision of primary cutaneous melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Detecting a more advanced stage of the primary melanoma after wide local excision and reconstruction can complicate patient counseling about prognosis, management of surgical margins, and indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy.Objective: To identify the frequency of and risk factors associated with upstaging after wide local excision of primary melanoma.Methods: Retrospective, single center, cross-sectional study of 1332 consecutive in situ to stage T4a melanomas treated with wide local excision.Results: The overall rate of upstaging of melanoma was 3.9% (52/1332). After multivariate analysis, the greatest risk factor for upstaging was anatomic location on the head, neck, hands, feet, genitals, or pretibial leg (odds ratio [OR] 7.06, P <. 001) followed by extension of the melanoma to the base of the biopsy specimen (OR 3.42, P<. 001); the need for multiple preoperative scouting biopsies (OR 1.89, P =.004); older age (OR 1.03 per year, P =.002); and nonlentigo maligna histologic subtype (OR 3.6, P =.002).Limitations: This was a single-site, retrospective observational study.Conclusions: Clinicopathologic characteristics, particularly anatomic location on the head, neck, hands, feet, genitals, or pretibial leg and subtotal diagnostic biopsies, identify melanomas with an increased risk for upstaging.

TI  - Black carbon emissions in Russia: A critical review
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - This study presents a comprehensive review of estimated black carbon (BC) emissions in Russia from a range of studies. Russia has an important role regarding BC emissions given the extent of its territory above the Arctic Circle, where BC emissions have a particularly pronounced effect on the climate. We assess underlying methodologies and data sources for each major emissions source based on their level of detail, accuracy and extent to which they represent current conditions. We then present reference values for each major emissions source. In the case of flaring, the study presents new estimates drawing on data on Russia's associated petroleum gas and the most recent satellite data on flaring. We also present estimates of organic carbon (OC) for each source, either based on the reference studies or from our own calculations. In addition, the study provides uncertainty estimates for each source. Total BC emissions are estimated at 688 Gg in 2014, with an uncertainty range 401 Gg-1453 Gg, while OC emissions are 9224 Gg with uncertainty ranging between 5596 Gg and 14,736 Gg. Wildfires dominated and contributed about 83% of the total BC emissions: however, the effect on radiative forcing is mitigated in part by OC emissions. We also present an adjusted estimate of Arctic forcing from Russia's BC and OC emissions. In recent years, Russia has pursued policies to reduce flaring and limit particulate emissions from on-road transport, both of which appear to significantly contribute to the lower emissions and forcing values found in this study.

TI  - Characterization of <i>Monkeypox virus</i> infection in African rope squirrels (<i>Funisciurus sp</i>.)
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic disease endemic in Central and West Africa and is caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV), the most virulent Orthopoxvirus affecting humans since the eradication of Variola virus (VARV). Many aspects of the MPXV transmission cycle, including the natural host of the virus, remain unknown. African rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.) are considered potential reservoirs of MPXV, as serosurveillance data in Central Africa has confirmed the circulation of the virus in these rodent species [1,2]. In order to understand the tissue tropism and clinical signs associated with infection with MPXV in these species, wild-caught rope squirrels were experimentally infected via intranasal and intradermal exposure with a recombinant MPXV strain from Central Africa engineered to express the luciferase gene. After infection, we monitored viral replication and shedding via in vivo bioluminescent imaging, viral culture and real time PCR. MPXV infection in African rope squirrels caused mortality and moderate to severe morbidity, with clinical signs including pox lesions in the skin, eyes, mouth and nose, dyspnea, and profuse nasal discharge. Both intranasal and intradermal exposures induced high levels of viremia, fast systemic spread, and long periods of viral shedding. Shedding and luminescence peaked at day 6 post infection and was still detectable after 15 days. Interestingly, one sentinel animal, housed in the same room but in a separate cage, also developed severe MPX disease and was euthanized. This study indicates that MPXV causes significant pathology in African rope squirrels and infected rope squirrels shed large quantities of virus, supporting their role as a potential source of MPXV transmission to humans and other animals in endemic MPX regions.

TI  - Land use and land cover (LULC) of the Republic of the Maldives: first national map and LULC change analysis using remote-sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Maldives islands in recent decades have experienced dramatic land-use change. Uninhabited islands were turned into new resort islands; evergreen tropical forests were cut, to be replaced by fields and new built-up areas. All these changes happened without a proper monitoring and urban planning strategy from the Maldivian government due to the lack of national land-use and land-cover (LULC) data. This study aimed to realize the first land-use map of the entire Maldives archipelago and to detect land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) using high-resolution satellite images and socioeconomic data. Due to the peculiar geographic and environmental features of the archipelago, the land-use map was obtained by visual interpretation and manual digitization of land-use patches. The images used, dated 2011, were obtained from Digital Globe's WorldView 1 and WorldView 2 satellites. Nine land-use classes and 18 subclasses were identified and mapped. During a field survey, ground control points were collected to test the geographic and the matic accuracy of the land-use map. The final product's overall accuracy was 85%. Once the accuracy of themap had been checked, LULCC maps were created using images from the early 2000s derived from Google Earth historical imagery. Post-classification comparison of the classified maps showed that growth of built-up and agricultural areas resulted in decreases in forest land and shrubland. The LULCC maps also revealed an increase in land reclamation inside lagoons near inhabited islands, resulting in environmental impacts on fragile reef habitat. The LULC map of the Republic of the Maldives produced in this study can be used by government authorities to make sustainable landuse planning decisions and to provide better management of land use and land cover.

TI  - Trend analysis of air temperature time series in Greece and their relationship with circulation using surface and satellite data: recent trends and an update to 2013
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the surface and lower tropospheric temperature trends in Greece and their relationship to the atmospheric circulation for the period 1955-2013 were examined, updating the study of Feidas et al. (Theor Appl Climatol 79:185-208, 2004) for data observed during the 12-year period 2002-2013. The trend analysis is based on a combination of three statistical tests. The trends are now examined for all the seasonal time series, new atmospheric circulation indices were added in the analysis, and maps with the spatial distribution of correlation between air temperature and atmospheric circulation were constructed and analysed. The series updated to 2013 for 18 stations reveal a clearer positive trend than that found for the period 1955-2001 on both the annual and the seasonal timescales. The warming signal detected only in summer in the study of Feidas et al. (Theor Appl Climatol 79:185-208, 2004) has now intensified and spread in other seasons. This warming appears to be mainly caused by the very high temperatures in the last decade (after 2004) of the record. At the national scale, there is now a match between surface temperature trends in Greece and Northern Hemisphere (NH) but only for summer, spring and annual time series, which are the only time series presenting a statistically significant warming trend in Greece. Satellite-induced lower tropospheric temperatures now show a statistically significant tropospheric temperature warming trend for the period 1979-2013, for both areas (Greece and NH). Lower tropospheric and surface air temperatures for the same period (1979-2013) show a very good agreement, with differences only in winter and summer for Greece. The influence of atmospheric circulation on the temperature variability in Greece was also examined using two more circulation indices: the Eastern Mediterranean Pattern Index (EMPI) and the North-Sea Caspian Pattern Index (NCPI). EMPI and especially NCPI explain better now the temperature variance in Greece, principally in winter. This connection, however, is not only developed during winter, as expected, but is also present for annual and other seasonal temperatures.

TI  - Comparing Inpatient Satisfaction Collected via a Web-Based Questionnaire Self-Completion and Through a Telephone Interview: An Ancillary Study of the SENTIPAT Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Assessing the satisfaction of patients about the health care they have received is relatively common nowadays. In France, the satisfaction questionnaire, I-Satis, is deployed in each institution admitting inpatients. Internet self-completion and telephone interview are the two modes of administration for collecting inpatient satisfaction that have never been compared in a multicenter randomized experiment involving a substantial number of patients.Objective: The objective of this study was to compare two modes of survey administration for collecting inpatient satisfaction: Internet self-completion and telephone interview.Methods: In the multicenter SENTIPAT (acronym for the concept of sentinel patients, ie, patients who would voluntarily report their health evolution on a dedicated website) randomized controlled trial, patients who were discharged from the hospital to home and had an Internet connection at home were enrolled between February 2013 and September 2014. They were randomized to either self-complete a set of questionnaires using a dedicated website or to provide answers to the same questionnaires administered during a telephone interview. As recommended by French authorities, the analysis of I-Satis satisfaction questionnaire involved all inpatients with a length of stay (LOS), including at least two nights. Participation rates, questionnaire consistency (measured using Cronbach alpha coefficient), and satisfaction scores were compared in the two groups.Results: A total of 1680 eligible patients were randomized to the Internet group (n=840) or the telephone group (n=840). The analysis of I-Satis concerned 392 and 389 patients fulfilling the minimum LOS required in the Internet and telephone group, respectively. There were 39.3% (154/392) and 88.4% (344/389) responders in the Internet and telephone group, respectively (P<.001), with similar baseline variables. Internal consistency of the global satisfaction score was higher (P=.03) in the Internet group (Cronbach alpha estimate=.89; 95% CI 0.86-0.91) than in the telephone group (Cronbach alpha estimate=.84; 95% CI 0.79-0.87). The mean global satisfaction score was lower (P=.03) in the Internet group (68.9; 95% CI 66.4-71.4) than in the telephone group (72.1; 95% CI 70.4-74.6), with a corresponding effect size of the difference at -0.253.Conclusions: The lower response rate issued from Internet administration should be balanced with a likely improved quality in satisfaction estimates, when compared with telephone administration, for which an interviewer effect cannot be excluded.

TI  - The Duffy null genotype is associated with a lower level of CCL2, leukocytes and neutrophil count but not with the clinical outcome of HTLV-1 infection
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. Chemokines are important in the immune response against viral infections, and may play a role in human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) pathogenesis. Polymorphisms in the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), such as rs12075 (A>G; FY*B>FY*A) and rs281477 (46T>C; GATA-1 box) may influence circulating concentrations of proinflammatory chemokines. We investigate whether Duffy genotypes influence the HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) level, HTLV-1 infection outcome and chemokine concentrations in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (AC=162), HAM/TSP patients (HAM=135) and seronegative individuals (SN=71).Methodology. Quantification of plasmatic IL8, CCL2 and CCL5 were performed by flow cytometry and Duffy genotypes were investigated by real-time PCR. HTLV-1 PVL was quantified in peripheral blood. To control for spurious association, individual ancestry profiles in AC and HAM groups were investigated.Results/Key findings. PVL and IL8 level were significantly higher in the HAM group than in the AC group, but were not associated with Duffy genotypes. The highest CCL2 and CCL5 levels were seen in the SN group, and there was no difference when comparing the infected groups. The level of CCL5 was not associated with Duffy genotypes. The polymorphism 46 C/C that abrogates the DARC expression on the erythrocytes was significantly associated with lower levels of CCL2, neutrophil and white blood cell (WBC) counts in HTLV-1-infected individuals.Conclusion. We conclude that although the Duffy null genotype was associated with leukopenia, neutropenia and lower levels of CCL2, the data do not suggest the influence of Duffy genotypes on the neurologic outcome of HTLV-1 infection, but may be a confounding factor in comparison HTLV-1-infected populations with different ancestries, especially when defining inflammatory biomarkers.

TI  - Characterization of Iberian turbid plumes by means of synoptic patterns obtained through MODIS imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbid plumes formed by the main Iberian rivers were analyzed and compared in order to determine similarities and differences among them. Five Atlantic rivers (Minho, Douro, Tagus, Guadiana and Guadalquivir) and one Mediterranean river (Ebro) were considered. Plume extension and turbidity were evaluated through synoptic patterns obtained by means of MODIS imagery over the period 2003-2014.River discharge showed to be the main forcing. In fact, the dependence of plume extension on runoff is moderate or high for all rivers, except for Ebro. In addition, most of river plumes adjust immediately to runoff fluctuations. Only the extension of Tagus and Guadalquivir plumes is lagged with respect to river runoff, due to the high residence time generated by their large estuaries.Wind is a secondary forcing, being only noticeable under high discharges. Actually, the dependence of plume extension on wind is moderate or high for all rivers, except Guadalquivir and Ebro. All the Atlantic rivers show the maximum (minimum) near- field plume extension under landward (oceanward) cross-shore winds. The opposite situation was observed for Ebro River.Tide is also a secondary forcing although less important than wind. Actually, the dependence of plume extension on tide is only high for Guadiana River. Nevertheless, all Atlantic river plumes still have some dependence on semidiurnal tidal cycle, they increase under low tides and decrease under high tides. In addition, Tagus River plume also depends on the fortnightly tidal cycle being larger during spring tides than during neap tides. This is due to particular shape of the estuary, where the river debouches into a semi-enclosed embayment connected to the Atlantic Ocean through a strait.Ebro River constitutes a particular case since it has a low dependence on runoff and wind and a negligible dependence on tide. In fact, its plume is mainly driven by the Liguro-Provencal coastal current. Guadalquivir River also shows some unique features due to its high sediment load. It generates the largest Iberian plume in terms of turbid signal and extension even being the second smallest river in terms of discharge.

TI  - Can We Define the Risk of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer Patients? A Large-Scale, Retrospective Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has emerged as one of the most appreciated techniques for reducing the rate of complete lymph node dissection (LND) performed in patients with early-stage cervical cancer (ECC). However, its performances are still a matter of debate and, to improve them, international guidelines recommend performing at least unilateral LND in case of SLN mapping. In a prior study, we identified a group of patients without evidence of lymph node metastasis (LNM). Our objective is to define a precise risk of LNM for each ECC patient in order to significantly tailor surgery for ECC.Methods. Clinical and pathological data of ECC patients were retrospectively collected by eight Italian institutions. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test along with logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of each variable between patients with or without LNM. Results of logistic regression have been used as a basis to calculate the probability to harboring LNM.Results. A total of 463 ECC patients were identified. No LNM was detected among the 161 (34.8%) patients who met the criteria and were defined as Very Low Risk. In the other 302 patients, the precise risk of LNM was calculated, and it was <1% in 31 (10.3%) patients.Conclusions. Defining the precise risk of LNM could lead to proper selection of patients in whom any lymph nodal procedure, including SLN, could be avoided.

TI  - The complex karst dynamics of the Lisan Peninsula revealed by 25 years of DInSAR observations. Dead Sea, Jordan
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents and analyses the results obtained from Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques applied to ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, ALOS-PALSAR, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1A datasets over the Lisan Peninsula, located in the southern part of the Dead Sea, Jordan. The novelty comes from the integration of three different wavelengths to study the dynamics of a salt dome. The monitoring activity entirely covers the period extending from 1992 to 2016. Five displacement maps have been produced, carefully checked and then fused to provide a total cumulated map of the displacements in the area. The ground movements have been analysed by comparison with in-situ tectonic observations collected by various authors since the mid-1980s. The study shows an episodic rising of the Lisan diapir. The presented results can be useful to update the knowledge of the displacement rates occurring in the area and to better comprehend the complex dynamics of the Lisan Peninsula.

TI  - Contribution of job-exposure matrices for exposure assessment in occupational safety and health monitoring systems: application from the French national occupational disease surveillance and prevention network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To detect new hazards ("signals"), occupational health monitoring systems mostly rest on the description of exposures in the jobs held and on reports by medical doctors; these are subject to declarative bias. Our study aims to assess whether job-exposure matrices (JEMs) could be useful tools for signal detection by improving exposure reporting.Using the French national occupational disease surveillance and prevention network (RNV3P) data from 2001 to 2011, we explored the associations between disease and exposure prevalence for 3 well-known pathology/exposure couples and for one debatable couple. We compared the associations measured when using physicians' reports or applying the JEMs, respectively, for these selected diseases and across non-selected RNV3P population or for cases with musculoskeletal disorders, used as two reference groups; the ratio of exposure prevalences according to the two sources of information were computed for each disease category.Our population contained 58,188 subjects referred with pathologies related to work. Mean age at diagnosis was 45.8 years (95% CI 45.7; 45.9), and 57.2% were men. For experts, exposure ratios increase with knowledge on exposure causality. As expected, JEMs retrieved more exposed cases than experts (exposure ratios between 12 and 194), except for the couple silica/silicosis, but not for the MSD control group (ratio between 0.2 and 0.8).JEMs enhanced the number of exposures possibly linked with some conditions, compared to experts' assessment, relative to the whole database or to a reference group; they are less likely to suffer from declarative bias than reports by occupational health professionals.

TI  - Biomonitoring using tagged sentinel fish and acoustic telemetry in commercial salmon aquaculture: A feasibility study
T2  - AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - We tested if it is technically feasible to monitor fish in real-time in full-scale commercial fish farms using acoustic telemetry. 31 Atlantic salmon were equipped with acoustic transmitter tags containing depth sensors. Tagged fish were monitored for three months in two industrial scale sea-cages containing 180000 and 150000 fish, respectively. Each cage was fitted with two prototype acoustic receiver units designed to collect, interpret and store the information transmitted by the acoustic transmitter tags. Ten in each cage were also equipped with Data Storage Tags (DSTs) containing depth sensors to record individual-based datasets for comparison with the acoustically transmitted datasets. After compensation for sample loss caused by expected acoustic interference between the transmitter tags, the resulting dataset revealed that the receiver units collected 90-95% of the signals in both cages. Acoustic communication conditions in the sea-cages were not strongly impaired by factors such as fish density and local noise. Further, the dataset from the acoustic transmitters had comparable resolution and quality to that produced by the DSTs. However, acoustic tags provide data in real time and enable farmers to respond to the received information with farm management measures, whereas archival tags such as DSTs need to be retrieved and downloaded and hence have no real-time applications. We conclude that acoustic telemetry is feasible as a method to monitor the depth of fish in real-time commercial aquaculture.

T2  - IDEAS Y VALORES
M3  - Article
AB  - The articles discusses the ontology of the event and covers four moments. First, it identifies the general worldview typical of the "metaphysics" of being as event, and seeks to establish a dialogue between the perspective of being in Hans-Georg Gadamer's metaphysics and his ontology. Secondly, it analyzes the structure of the event or the way in which the movement of meaning unfolds, in order to determine the logic of the question as structure of the event. Third, through a dialogue between the idea of event and the category of finitude, the article shows that thinking the ontology of the event leads to the determination of finitude. Finally, the article suggests a few lines of inquiry for further in-depth research of this topic.

AB  - Food security is the topmost priority on the global agenda. Accurate agricultural statistics (i.e., cropped area) are essential for decision making and developing appropriate programs to achieve food security. However, derivation of these essential agricultural statistics, especially in developing countries, is fraught with many challenges including financial, logistical and human capacity limitations. This study investigated the use of fractional cover approaches in mapping cropland area in the heterogeneous landscape of West Africa. Discrete cropland areas identified from multi-temporal Landsat data were upscaled to MODIS resolution using random forest regression. Producer's accuracy and user's accuracy of the cropland class in the Landsat scale analysis averaged 95% and 94%, respectively, indicating good separability between crop and non-crop land. Validation of the fractional cropland cover map at MODIS resolution (MODIS_FCM) revealed an overall mean absolute error of 19%. Comparison of MODIS_FCM with the MODIS land cover product (e.g., MODIS_LCP) demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach to cropped area estimation in smallholder dominant heterogeneous landscapes over existing global solutions. Comparison with official government statistics (i.e., cropped area) revealed variable levels of agreement and partly enormous disagreements, which clearly indicate the need to integrate remote sensing approaches and ground based surveys conducted by agricultural ministries in improving cropped area estimation. The recent availability of a wide range of open access remote sensing data is expected to expedite this integration and contribute missing information urgently required for regional assessments of food security in West Africa and beyond.

TI  - Prognostic impact of macrometastasis linear size in sentinel node biopsy for breast carcinoma
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk of axillary non-sentinel lymph-node metastases (ALN) in breast cancer patients presenting macrometastasis (Mac-m) in the sentinel lymph node (SN).Materials and methods: A retrospective series of 1464 breast cancers from patients who underwent ALN dissection following the diagnosis of Mac-m in the sentinel node (SN) was studied. In all the cases the MAC-m linear size was evaluated and correlated with presence or absence of non-SN ALN metastases.Results: Non-SN metastases were detected in 644 \ 1464 cases (43.98%). The risk of further axillary metastases ranged from 20.2% (37/183) in cases with Mac-m between 2 and 2.9 mm, to 65.3% (262/401) in cases with Mac-m measuring > 10 mm. The risk of non-SN ALN metastases showed a 3% increase, parallel to each mm increment in SN metastasis size. The data evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the Mac-m could be subdivided according to a new cut-off of 7 mm. pT1 tumours, with Mac-m < 7 mm had a risk of non-SN ALN metastases of <30%. Furthermore 109/127 of these (85.8%) had 3 or less non-SN ALN-metastases.Conclusions: The present data give a detailed description on the risk of non-SN ALN involvement, that may be useful in the evaluation of breast cancer patients. It is suggested that a Mac-m size of <7 mm is related to a low residual axillary disease burden in breast cancer patients with small (pT1) tumours.

TI  - Variations in forest aboveground biomass in Miyun Reservoir of Beijing over the past two decades
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In recent years, climate change, particularly rising carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and global warming, has attracted much attention around the world. Forest ecosystems still play a crucial role in global carbon (C) fixation. Quantifying forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and its temporal variations is essential for understanding external impacts (e.g., urbanization, environmental change) as well as assessing the potential of forest ecosystems assimilating the atmospheric CO2.Materials and methods In this study, we established regression models for AGB estimation in the Miyun Reservoir region, based on relationships between Landsat-derived variables and ground truth AGB values, which were obtained from both plot measurements and estimations using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset. The models were applied to calibrated Landsat images acquired in 1990, 2000, and 2010 to track the forest AGB temporal variations and the corresponding spatial distributions for each period. The AGB estimations using LiDAR showed high consistency with values based on the plot measurements, while the established models presented an acceptable accuracy.Result and discussion The AGB density in the Miyun Reservoir experienced an overall increase since 1990 and was averaged at 52.20 and 32.12 t ha(-1), for stand forest and shrub in 2010, respectively. Total AGB in 2010 was estimated to be 4.5 x 10(7) t, which increased by 8% when compared with the level in 1990. Our results are in the similar range of AGB density reported by other studies carried out in Northern China. Ecological programs including Three-North Shelter Forest Project and Returning Farming to Forest promoted the forest expansion and development during this period, while local farming activities exerted certain negative effects on the surrounding forest systems.Conclusion Absolute AGB density values indicated that regions with less external interventions present more consistent biomass accumulation. However, the coarse spatial resolution and 10-year interval of the datasets limited detailed analysis of impacts from urbanization of Beijing City. Future studies incorporating sophisticated ecosystem research methods are expected to uncover the mechanisms and key drivers for the observed variations in the AGB in the Miyun Reservoir region of Beijing, China.

TI  - Grid-cell aerosol direct shortwave radiative forcing calculated using the SBDART model with MODIS and AERONET observations: An application in winter and summer in eastern China
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking winter and summer in eastern China as an example application, a grid-cell method of aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) calculation is examined using the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model with inputs from MODIS and AERONET observations and reanalysis data. Results show that there are significant seasonal and regional differences in climatological mean aerosol optical parameters and ADRF. Higher aerosol optical depth (AOD) occurs in summer and two prominent high aerosol loading centers are observed. Higher single scattering albedo (SSA) in summer is likely associated with the weak absorbing secondary aerosols. SSA is higher in North China during summer but higher in South China during winter. Aerosols induce negative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and surface during both winter and summer, which may be responsible for the decrease in temperature and the increase in relative humidity. Values of ADRF at the surface are four times stronger than those at the TOA. Both AOD and ADRF present strong interannual variations; however, their amplitudes are larger in summer. Moreover, patterns and trends of ADRF do not always correspond well to those of AOD. Differences in the spatial distributions of ADRF between strong and weak monsoon years are captured effectively. Generally, the present results justify that to calculate grid-cell ADRF at a large scale using the SBDART model with observational aerosol optical properties and reanalysis data is an effective approach.

TI  - 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake as predictor for invasion in preoperatively diagnosed breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Significance in cases without mass formation.
T2  - Molecular and clinical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at needle biopsy often changes to that of invasive ductal carcinoma as the definitive pathological diagnosis following the surgical procedure. The present study sought to identify the factors associated with invasive disease in cases diagnosed as DCIS on needle biopsy by analyzing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-proton emission tomography (FDG-PET) findings. The present study retrospectively investigated the cases of 24 consecutive patients with primary breast cancer who were preoperatively diagnosed with DCIS by needle biopsy. The cases were divided into two groups based on the presence of invasion in the primary tumor. Among the 24 patients, 13 (54.7%) patients had invasive carcinoma and 11 (45.8%) had DCIS. The analysis revealed that the presence of FDG uptake in the tumor was the only independent predictor of presence of the invasive disease. No cases without FDG uptake exhibited invasion and all of these were ultimately diagnosed as DCIS. In the present study, all cases, including DCIS, with a nodular growth pattern demonstrated FDG uptake in the tumors, and all cases without FDG uptake were interpreted as having a diffuse growth pattern. The present findings suggested that the presence of FDG uptake in the tumor can be considered a predictor for invasion in cases with DCIS by needle biopsy, particularly in cases with a diffuse growth pattern. Patients preoperatively diagnosed as DCIS without mass formation and without FDG uptake in the tumor may avoid sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Evaluation of positron emission tomography imaging to detect lymph node metastases in patients with extramammary Paget's disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients with extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) have a relatively good prognosis, when spread of the tumor cells is limited to the epidermis. However, invasive EMPD has a poor prognosis, when the patients have regional lymph node metastasis. Detection of nodal metastasis is thus mandatory to manage EMPD. To evaluate the F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging to assess lymph node metastasis, 15 patients with histologically proven primary EMPD were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent whole-body PET prior to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of more than 2.5 was evaluated as positive PET indicative of malignancy. Among 14 cases with the primary genital lesions, 11 cases underwent bilateral SLNB of the inguinal nodal basin and the remaining three cases unilateral SLNB. One case with a primary axillary lesion underwent unilateral SLNB of the axillary nodal basin. Therefore, a total of 26 regional basins were investigated. In general, nodal basins can be categorized into four groups: (i) histologically negative and PET negative (true negative); (ii) histologically positive and PET negative (false negative); (iii) histologically positive and PET positive (true positive); and (iv) histologically negative and PET positive (false positive) groups. In the 26 nodal basins, there were 19 true negative and seven true positive cases, and neither false negative nor false positive cases were observed. The mean SUVmax was significantly higher in the true positive basins (8.03 +/- 3.34) than in the true negative basins (0.26 +/- 0.56). The SUVmax value may be useful for detection of nodal metastasis.

TI  - Mapping and Assessment of PM<sub>10</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> Removal by Woody Vegetation at Urban and Regional Level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is the follow up of the URBAN-MAES pilot implemented in the framework of the EnRoute project. The study aims at mapping and assessing the process of particulate matter (PM10) and tropospheric ozone (O-3) removal by various forest and shrub ecosystems. Different policy levels and environmental contexts were considered, namely the Metropolitan city of Rome and, at a wider level, the Latium region. The approach involves characterization of the main land cover and ecosystems using Sentinel-2 images, enabling a detailed assessment of Ecosystem Service (ES), and monetary valuation based on externality values. The results showed spatial variations in the pattern of PM10 and O-3 removal inside the Municipality and in the more rural Latium hinterland, reflecting the spatial dynamics of the two pollutants. Evergreen species displayed higher PM10 removal efficiency, whereas deciduous species showed higher O-3 absorption in both rural and urban areas. The overall pollution removal accounted for 5123 and 19,074 Mg of PM10 and O-3, respectively, with a relative monetary benefit of 161 and 149 Million Euro for PM10 and O-3, respectively. Our results provide spatially explicit evidence that may assist policymakers in land-oriented decisions towards improving Green Infrastructure and maximizing ES provision at different governance levels.

TI  - Removal of Thin Cirrus Scattering Effects in Landsat 8 OLI Images Using the Cirrus Detecting Channel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin cirrus clouds frequently contaminate images acquired with either Landsat 7 ETM+ or the earlier generation of Landsat series satellite instruments. The situation has changed since the launch of the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) into space in 2013. OLI implemented a cirrus detecting channel (Band 9) centered within a strong atmospheric water vapor absorption band near 1.375 mu m with a width of 30 nm. The specifications for this channel were the same as those specified for the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the early 1990s. The OLI Band 9 has been proven to be very effective in detecting and masking thin cirrus-contaminated pixels at the high spatial resolution of 30 m. However, this channel has not yet been routinely used for the correction of thin cirrus effects in other OLI band images. In this article, we describe an empirical technique for the removal of thin cirrus scattering effects in OLI visible near infrared (IR) and shortwave IR (SWIR) spectral regions. We present results from applications of the technique to three OLI data sets. We also discuss issues associated with parallax anomalies in OLI data.

TI  - CFAR Ship Detection in Nonhomogeneous Sea Clutter Using Polarimetric SAR Data Based on the Notch Filter
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection is an important research topic in the field of maritime applications. The geometrical perturbation-polarimetric notch filter (GP-PNF) was recently proposed to be a promising tool and its usefulness in exploiting polarimetric SAR information for ship detection was demonstrated. The work in this paper is devoted to developing a statistical model of the filter in nonhomogeneous sea clutter to achieve constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection based on the model. First, within the framework of a multiplicative model, the reciprocal of the gamma distribution is used to describe the texture component of sea clutter in nonhomogeneous background. As a result, a statistical model of the GP-PNF is analytically derived and found suitable for sea clutter scenes with a wide range of homogeneity. Second, we theoretically demonstrate that CFAR detection using GP-PNF is unrelated to the parameter in the original GP-PNF. Therefore, a simplified version of the GP-PNF is given. Third, the CFAR threshold of the simplified filter is mathematically derived. Experiments performed on measured L-band ALOS-PALSAR and C-band RADARSAT-2 SAR data verify the good performance of the developed statistical model and demonstrate the usefulness of the CFAR detection based on the simplified filter.

TI  - Impact of model structure on flow simulation and hydrological realism: from a lumped to a semi-distributed approach
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Model intercomparison experiments are widely used to investigate and improve hydrological model performance. However, a study based only on runoff simulation is not sufficient to discriminate between different model structures. Hence, there is a need to improve hydrological models for specific streamflow signatures (e.g., low and high flow) and multi-variable predictions (e.g., soil moisture, snow and groundwater). This study assesses the impact of model structure on flow simulation and hydrological realism using three versions of a hydrological model called MOR-DOR: the historical lumped structure and a revisited formulation available in both lumped and semi-distributed structures. In particular, the main goal of this paper is to investigate the relative impact of model equations and spatial discretization on flow simulation, snowpack representation and evapotranspiration estimation. Comparison of the models is based on an extensive dataset composed of 50 catchments located in French mountainous regions. The evaluation framework is founded on a multi-criterion split-sample strategy. All models were calibrated using an automatic optimization method based on an efficient genetic algorithm. The evaluation framework is enriched by the assessment of snow and evapotranspiration modeling against in situ and satellite data. The results showed that the new model formulations perform significantly better than the initial one in terms of the various streamflow signatures, snow and evapotranspiration predictions. The semi-distributed approach provides better calibration-validation performance for the snow cover area, snow water equivalent and runoff simulation, especially for nival catchments.

TI  - Observations of Increased Cloud Cover over Irrigated Agriculture in an Arid Environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated agriculture accounts for 20% of global cropland area and may alter climate locally and globally, but feedbacks on clouds and rainfall remain highly uncertain, particularly in arid regions. Nonrenewable groundwater in arid regions accounts for 20% of global irrigation water demand, and quantifying these feedbacks is crucial for the prediction of long-term water use in a changing climate. Here, satellite data are used to show how irrigated crops in an arid environment alter land surface properties, cloud cover, and rainfall patterns. Land surface temperatures (LSTs) over the cropland are 5-7K lower than their surroundings, despite a lower albedo, suggesting that Bowen ratio is strongly reduced (and latent heat fluxes increased) over the irrigated cropland. Daytime cloud cover is increased by up to 15% points (a relative increase of 60%), with increased cloud development in the morning and a greater afternoon peak in cloud. Cloud cover is significantly correlated with interannual variations in vegetation and LST. Afternoon rainfall also appears to be enhanced around the irrigation. The cloud feedback is the opposite of what has been previously observed in tropical and semiarid regions, suggesting different processes drive land-atmosphere feedbacks in very dry environments. Increased cloud and rainfall, and associated increases in diffuse radiation and reductions in temperature, are likely to benefit vegetation growth. Predictions of changes in crop productivity due to climate change and the impacts of global land-use change on climate and the use of water resources would therefore benefit from including these effects.

TI  - Influence of topography on glacier changes in the central Himalaya, India
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the impact of topography on glacier changes is vital because, while climate is the driving force behind these changes, the topography may control their heterogeneity. Present study provides a detailed insight into varied responses of 18 glaciers (1994-2015), spread over the central Himalaya (CH), and systematically explores the influence of topographic factors on changing glacier parameters using satellite remote sensing data (Landsat TM/ETM + /OLI, Cartosat-1 PAN, Resoursesat-2 LISS-4, SRTM digital elevation model) and limited field observations. Results show that the total glaciated area decreased from 313.34 +/- 7.95 km(2) in 1994 to 306.36 +/- 8.04 km(2) in 2015 whereas retreat rates varied from 4.75 +/- 2.25 to 28.25 +/- 2.25 m a(-1) during this period. The total debris-covered area also increased from 86.56 +/- 1.29 to 97.99 +/- 1.75 km(2) and the average snowline altitude upshifted by 67 m during 1994-2015. Various topographic factors analyzed here include: glacier area, length, compactness ratio, altitude, slope, aspect, hypsometry, area accumulation ratio and snout characteristics. Multivariate statistical analysis demonstrates that compactness ratio, glacier size, altitude range and mean slope strongly influence the area loss. Whereas glacier length, mean slope, compactness and altitude range influence the retreat rates. Cumulative influence of these factors was assessed using a novel approach which uses ordinal scale relative weighting-rating technique to compute a Topographic Influence Index (no. Breaks in the frequency of TII values were used for categorizing the glaciers into three groups that experienced different degrees of topographic influence on area loss and retreat namely, modest, moderate and strong. It is observed that, out of 18 glaciers, 5 had modest, 8 had moderate and 5 glaciers had strong influence of topography on area loss. Whereas, 6, 8 and 4 glaciers experienced modest, moderate and strong influence of topography on retreat, respectively. Further, we found that similar to 78% and similar to 61% glaciers in case of area loss and retreat, respectively, are also the ones which exhibit higher glacier wastage. This indicates that the observed heterogeneity in the response of studied glaciers is probably topographically induced.

TI  - Predicting tree species richness in urban forests
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been an increasing interest in urban forests and the levels of biodiversity they contain. Currently there are no spatially explicit maps of tree species richness in urban areas. This research tests and identifies GIS and remote sensing metrics (climate, area, productivity, three-dimensional structure) hypothesized to be associated with species richness in native forests and identifies methods that can be applied to predict and map tree species richness in cities. We quantified tree species richness, floristic composition, and structure in 28 1-ha plots in the city of Los Angeles. Climate and remote sensing metrics from highresolution aerial imagery (10 cm), QuickBird (60 cm), Landsat (30 m), MODIS (250 m), and airborne lidar (2 m) were collected for each plot. There were 1208 individual stems and 108 trees identified to species. Species richness ranged from 2 to 31 species per ha and averaged 17 species per ha. Tree canopy cover from QuickBird explained the highest portion of variance (54%) in tree species richness followed by NDVI from Landsat (42%). Tree species richness can be higher in residential urban forests than native forests in the United States. Spatially explicit species richness maps at 1 ha can be created and tested for cities in order to identify both hotspots and coldspots of tree species richness and changes in species richness over time.

TI  - An Internet-Based GIS Platform Providing Data for Visualization and Spatial Analysis of Urbanization in Major Asian and African Cities
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in developing countries has been observed to be relatively high in the last two decades, especially in the Asian and African regions. Although many researchers have made efforts to improve the understanding of the urbanization trends of various cities in Asia and Africa, the absence of platforms where local stakeholders can visualize and obtain processed urbanization data for their specific needs or analysis, still remains a gap. In this paper, we present an Internet-based GIS platform called MEGA-WEB. The Platform was developed in view of the urban planning and management challenges in developing countries of Asia and Africa due to the limited availability of data resources, effective tools, and proficiency in data analysis. MEGA-WEB provides online access, visualization, spatial analysis, and data sharing services following a mashup framework of the MEGA-WEB Geo Web Services (GWS), with the third-party map services using HTML5/JavaScript techniques. Through the integration of GIS, remote sensing, geo-modelling, and Internet GIS, several indicators for analyzing urbanization are provided in MEGA-WEB to give diverse perspectives on the urbanization of not only the physical land surface condition, but also the relationships of population, energy use, and the environment. The design, architecture, system functions, and uses of MEGA-WEB are discussed in the paper. The MEGA-WEB project is aimed at contributing to sustainable urban development in developing countries of Asia and Africa.

TI  - Radiometric inter-sensor cross-calibration uncertainty using a traceable high accuracy reference hyperspectral imager
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical earth observation (EO) satellite sensors generally suffer from drifts and biases relative to their pre-launch calibration, caused by launch and/or time in the space environment. This places a severe limitation on the fundamental reliability and accuracy that can be assigned to satellite derived information, and is particularly critical for long time base studies for climate change and enabling interoperability and Analysis Ready Data. The proposed TRUTHS (Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio-Studies) mission is explicitly designed to address this issue through re-calibrating itself directly to a primary standard of the international system of units (SI) in-orbit and then through the extension of this SI-traceability to other sensors through in-flight cross-calibration using a selection of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) recommended test sites. Where the characteristics of the sensor under test allows, this will result in a significant improvement in accuracy. This paper describes a set of tools, algorithms and methodologies that have been developed and used in order to estimate the radiometric uncertainty achievable for an indicative target sensor through in-flight cross-calibration using a well-calibrated hyperspectral SI-traceable reference sensor with observational characteristics such as TRUTHS. In this study, Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) is evaluated as an example, however the analysis is readily translatable to larger-footprint sensors such as Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This study considers the criticality of the instrumental and observational characteristics on pixel level reflectance factors, within a defined spatial region of interest (ROI) within the target site. It quantifies the main uncertainty contributors in the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The resultant tool will support existing sensor-to-sensor cross-calibration activities carried out under the auspices of CEOS, and is also being used to inform the design specifications for TRUTHS.

TI  - Satellite-based technique for nowcasting of thunderstorms over Indian region
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - India experiences severe thunderstorms during the months, March-June. But these systems are not predicted well, mainly due to the absence of mesoscale observational network over Indian region and the expert system. As these are short lived systems, the nowcast is attempted worldwide based on satellite and radar observations. Due to inadequate radar network, satellite plays the dominant role for nowcast of these thunderstorms. In this study, a nowcast based algorithm ForTracc developed by Vila et al. (Weather Forecast 23: 233-245, 2008) has been examined over the Indian region using Infrared Channel (10.8 mu m) of INSAT-3D for prediction of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS). In this technique, the current location and intensity in terms of Cloud Top Brightness Temperature (CTBT) of the MCS are extrapolated. The purpose of this study is to validate this satellite-based nowcasting technique for Convective Cloud Clusters that helps in optimum utilization of satellite data and improve the nowcasting. The model could predict reasonably the minimum CTBT of the convective cell with average absolute error (AAE) of <7 K for different lead periods (30-180 min). However, it was underestimated for all the lead periods of forecasts. The AAE in the forecasts of size of the cluster varies from about 3 x 10(4) km(2) for 30-min forecast to 7 x 10(4) km(2) for 120-min forecast. The mean absolute error in prediction of size is above 31-38% of actual size for different lead periods of forecasts from 30 to 180 min. There is over estimation in prediction of size for 30 and 60 min forecasts (17% and 2.6% of actual size of the cluster, respectively) and underestimation in 90 to 180-min forecasts (-2.4% to -28%). The direct position error (DPE) based on the location of minimum CTBT ranges from 70 to 144 km for 30-180-min forecast respectively.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of growing-season NDVI and response to climate change in permafrost zone of Northeast China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost is extremely sensitive to climate change. In particular, aboveground vegetation on permafrost has great sensitivity to the change. The permafrost zone of Northeast China, within middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, is the second. largest region of permafrost in China. It is at the southern edge of the Eurasian cryolitho zone. This study analyzed growing-season spatiotemporal variation of the normalization difference vegetation index (NDVI) in this permafrost zone and the correlation between NDVI and climate variables during 1981-2014 based on LTDR, MODIS data set and meteorological data. Mean growing. season NDVI significantly increased by 0.0036 a(-1) over the entire permafrost zone. The spatial dynamics of vegetation cover in the zone had strong heterogeneity on the pixel scale. NDVI showing a significant (P < 0.05) increasing trend accounted for 80.6% of the permafrost area, and NDVI showing a significant (P < 0.05) decreasing trend accounted for 7.7% of the entire study area. The trend of NDVI was variable in different kinds of permafrost zones which increased in order of continuous permafrost zone > discontinuous permafrost zone > sparse island permafrost zone > seasonal frozen region. The proportion of area for maximum increasing trends of NDVI (> 0.004) in different permafrost regions was in order of continuous permafrost zone > discontinuous permafrost zone > sparse island permafrost zone > seasonal frozen region. Additionally, at the entire permafrost zone scale, the mean growing-season NDVI was positively significantly correlated with growing. season mean temperature (r = 0.79, P < 0.01), but weakly negatively related with growing. season precipitation, which indicated that temperature was the dominant influence on vegetation growth during the growing season in the study area. Permafrost degradation in the study area played a positive role in plant growth, especially in continuous permafrost zone and discontinuous permafrost zone. Although increasing ground surface temperature accelerated vegetation cover and growth in the short time, from the long term point of view, permafrost degradation or disappear might hinder vegetation growth.

TI  - Superpixel-Based Adaptive Kernel Selection for Angular Effect Normalization of Remote Sensing Images With Kernel Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering that satellites rarely acquire data from the exact nadir direction, angular effect normalization needs to be conducted as an important preprocessing step to correct reflectance observations from off-nadir directions into the nadir direction. Kernel-based bidirectional reflectance distribution function models have been employed for angular effect correction. The kernels used in the model are often predetermined and fixed for an entire image. However, the fixed kernels are unable to accommodate the various reflective characteristics of different ground cover types present in the imaged area. In this paper, we propose a kernel learning procedure that enables the flexible selection of kernels for different land cover types within a scene. The kernels are selected from kernel dictionaries that contain multiple candidate kernels. The selection is conducted on the superpixel level instead of the pixel level in order to reduce within-class variation and overcome the overfitting problem. Experiments are conducted on multiangular images acquired by the Sentinel-2A satellite over a rural area in southeastern Australia. Cross-validation results show that the proposed method is able to adaptively select appropriate kernels for different land cover types, leading to an improved performance for image normalization.

TI  - Climate and topographic controls on snow cover dynamics in the Hindu Kush Himalaya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow governs interaction between atmospheric and land surface processes in high mountains, and is also source of fresh water. It is thus important to both climate scientists and local communities. However, our understanding of snow cover dynamics in terms of space and time is limited across the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region, which is known to be a climatically sensitive region. We used MODIS snow cover area (SCA) data (2003-2012), APHRODITE temperature data (2000-2007), and monthly long term in-situ river discharge data of the Gandaki (1968-2010), Koshi (1977-2010) and Manas (1987-2004) basins to analyse variations among four basins. We gained insights into short term SCA and temperature, long term discharge trends, and regional variability thereby. Strong correlations were observed among SCA, temperature and discharge thereby highlighting the strong nexus between them. Temporal and spatial snow cover variability across the basins is strongly coupled with the variability of two weather systems: Western Disturbances (WD) and Indian Monsoon System (IMS), and strongly influenced by topography. Manifestation of these variability in terms if downstream discharge can have repercussion to water based sectors: hydropower and agriculture, as low flow seasons is seen affected. This study adds to our knowledge of snow fall and melt dynamics in the HKH region, and intra-annual snow melt contributions to downstream discharges. The study is limited by short span of data and it is desirable to perform a similar study using data representing a much longer time span.

TI  - A graph-based approach to detect spatiotemporal dynamics in satellite image time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhancing the frequency of satellite acquisitions represents a key issue for Earth Observation community nowadays. Repeated observations are crucial for monitoring purposes, particularly when intra-annual process should be taken into account. Time series of images constitute a valuable source of information in these cases. The goal of this paper is to propose a new methodological framework to automatically detect and extract spatiotemporal information from satellite image time series (SITS). Existing methods dealing with such kind of data are usually classification-oriented and cannot provide information about evolutions and temporal behaviors. In this paper we propose a graph-based strategy that combines object-based image analysis (OBIA) with data mining techniques. Image objects computed at each individual timestamp are connected across the time series and generates a set of evolution graphs. Each evolution graph is associated to a particular area within the study site and stores information about its temporal evolution. Such information can be deeply explored at the evolution graph scale or used to compare the graphs and supply a general picture at the study site scale. We validated our framework on two study sites located in the South of France and involving different types of natural, semi-natural and agricultural areas. The results obtained from a Landsat SITS support the quality of the methodological approach and illustrate how the framework can be employed to extract and characterize spatiotemporal dynamics.

TI  - Induction of EROD and BFCOD activities in tissues of barbel (Barbus callensis) from a water reservoir in Algeria
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - EROD and BFCOD activities were measured in liver and gills of barbel (Barbus callensis, a native North African species) captured at Beni Haroun lake, the most important water reservoir in Algeria. This lake receives wastewater from different origins. Thus, we assessed the level of pollution through the induction of detoxification activities in tissues of barbel, evaluating simultaneously the suitability of this species to be used as a sentinel. Fish were collected between March 2015 and January 2016 at three locations taking into account the pollution sources and accessibility. In liver, EROD and BFCOD showed the highest induction in October specially in the location of the dam that received pollutants. In gills, only EROD, but not BFCOD, activity was detected. Maximal EROD induction was noted in samples from January. Fish cell lines (RTG-2 and PLHC-1) were exposed to sediments extracts collected at Beni Haroun lake and enzyme activities (EROD and BFCOD, respectively) were measured. Sediment extracts did not induce BFCOD activity. The EROD induction observed in RTG-2 cells was in line with the results observed in fish tissues. Our results suggest that the lake is at risk from pollution and that Barbus callensis is a good sentinel species.

TI  - Revisiting Ocean Color algorithms for chlorophyll <i>a</i> and particulate organic carbon in the Southern Ocean using biogeochemical floats
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean (SO) ecosystem plays a key role in the carbon cycle by sinking a major part (43%) of the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2, and being an important source of nutrients for primary producers. However, undersampling of SO biogeochemical properties limits our understanding of the mechanisms taking place in this remote area. The Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project has been deploying a large number of autonomous biogeochemical floats to study the SO (as of December 2016, 74 floats out of 200 have been deployed). SOCCOM floats measurements can be used to extend remote sensing chlorophyll a (chl a) and particulate organic carbon (POC) products under clouds or during the polar night as well as adding the depth dimension to the satellite-based view of the SO. Chlorophyll a concentrations measured by a sensor embedded on the floats and POC concentrations derived from backscattering coefficients were calibrated with samples collected during the floats' deployment cruise. Float chl a and POC were compared with products derived from observations of MODIS and VIIRS sensors. We find the Ocean Color Index (OCI) global algorithm to agree well with the matchups (within 9%, on average, for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and 12%, on average, for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS)). SO-specific algorithms estimating chl a are offset by similar to 45% south of the Sea Ice Extent Front (similar to 60 degrees S). In addition, POC estimates based on floats agree well with NASA's POC algorithm.

M3  - Article
AB  - Despite increasing online learning popularity, this environment poses special challenges. Online teaching/learning lacks opportunities to teach interpersonal skills necessary for ''real life'' careers in healthcare administration. Connected synchronously, 14 graduate students including four registered nurses, all provided a role within the simulated root cause analysis team, were able to analyze a sentinel event followed by a debriefing that utilized the PEARLS methods and a submitted reflective assignment. These students expressed much satisfaction with this exercise, finding new insight and experience in this meaningful learning exercise.

TI  - Trans-Atlantic Connections between North African Dust Flux and Tree Growth in the Florida Keys, United States
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric mineral aerosols include multiple, interrelated processes and feedbacks within the context of land-atmosphere interactions and thus are poorly understood. As the largest dust source in the world, North Africa supplies mineral dust aerosols each year to the Caribbean region and southeastern United States that alter cloud processes, ocean productivity, soil development, and the radiation budget. This study uses a suite of Earth Observation and ground-based analyses to reveal a potential novel effect of atmospheric aerosols on Pinus elliottii var. densa cambial growth during the 2010 CE growing season from the Florida Keys. Over the Florida Keys region, the Earth Observation products captured increased aerosol optical thickness with a clear geographical connection to mineral dust aerosols transported from northern Africa. The MODIS Terra and Aqua products corroborated increased Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol optical thickness values. Anomalously high Aerosol Robotic Network aerosol optical depth data corresponding with low angstrom ngstrom coefficients confirm the presence of transported mineral dust aerosols during the period circa 4-20 July 2010. The fraction of photosynthetically absorbed radiation over the region during July 2010 experienced an anomalous decrease, concurrent with reduced incoming total and direct solar radiation resulting in a reduced growth response in P. elliottii. The authors pose one of the primary mechanisms responsible for triggering growth anomalies in P. elliottii is the reduction of total photosynthetically active radiation due to a dust-derived increase in aerosol optical depth. As a rare long-lived conifer (300+years) in a subtropical location, P. elliottii could represent a novel proxy with which to reconstruct annual or seasonal mineral dust aerosol fluxes over the Caribbean region.

TI  - Derivation of Wind Vectors from AVHRR/MetOp at EUMETSAT
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) are derived operationally at EUMETSAT from the AVHRR/3 instrument on the Polar System satellite MetOp-A since 2011. The launch of MetOp-B in 2012 allowed for doubling of the production of AMVs over the polar regions using both MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellite data. In addition to the singleAVHRRpolar wind product, in 2014 EUMETSAT developed a new global A VHRR wind product extracted from a pair of MetOp-A and MetOp-B images. This new product is extracted using the large overlap in the imagery data obtained from the tandem configuration of the two satellites on the same orbital plane but with a phase difference of about 50 min. The tandem configuration also provides the possibility to derive wind vectors over polar areas using a triplet of AVHRR images, keeping the same time period necessary to derive the single MetOp polar wind product but allowing for a temporal consistency check in the calculation of the AMV quality index. Three different AMV products are currently extracted from AVHRR imagery at EUMETSAT, using two or three images taken by one or two satellites having different coverage and time integration.This paper describes the scientific concept of the AVHRR wind extraction algorithm developed at EUMETSAT and presents the performances of the various AVHRR wind products. Intercomparisons of these different products highlight the role of the temporal gap between the images used to extract the wind and the impact of the consistency check on the calculation of the quality index.

TI  - Retrieving Grassland Canopy Water Content by Considering the Information from Neighboring Pixels
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and robust retrieval of grassland canopy water content (CWC) using a radiative transfer model (RTM) is generally affected by the ill-posed inversion problem due to the lack of enough available a priori information. To alleviate this problem when inversing the RTM, a two-step inversion method was proposed. The key point of this method was to simultaneously consider the spectral information from neighboring pixels and the spatial dependency among these pixels, with the purpose to win more information from these neighboring pixels. The proposed methodology was then applied to retrieve CWC using the PROSAIL RTM from Landsat-8 OLI data for a plateau grassland in China. The results showed that the estimated CWC using the proposed method (RMSE = 67.31 g m(-2) and R-2 = 0.81) was better than that from the traditional method (RMSE = 80.11 g m(-2) and R-2 = 0.78) which only considered the information of single pixel.

TI  - Impacts of uncertainty in land surface information on simulated surface temperature and precipitation over China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study mainly focuses on the effects of uncertainty in land surface information on mesoscale numerical simulation. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to simulate meteorological fields over China at a spatial resolution of 10 km during 2006. Near-surface temperature and precipitation values obtained from WRF were evaluated using site observations. The effects of accurate and updated land surface information, including Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land use data, vegetation fraction derived from MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and HarmonizedWorld Soil Database (HWSD) data (LAST simulation), on WRF's performance were investigated by comparison with a simulation using the default land surface information (BASE simulation). WRF reproduced the temporal and spatial variations of near-surface temperature and precipitation over China accurately, although its performance varied significantly by season and region. WRF underestimated near-surface temperatures in most areas of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the Tibetan Plateau, the Northeast Plain, and the southeastern coastal regions, but temperatures were overestimated in most areas of the North China Plain, the Loess Plateau, Sichuan Basin, and western Xinjiang. WRF overestimated (underestimated) precipitation in most humid (arid) areas. A positive (negative) bias in simulated precipitation is found in summer (winter). With updated land surface information, WRF's performance in terms of both daily average values and extremes improved, and the root mean squared error values for daily mean temperature and daily accumulated precipitation decreased by 7 and 2.3%. These improvements are significant for temperature, but not significant for precipitation. The uncertainty in land surface information has a greater influence on temperature than on precipitation. These findings are very important for weather forecasting and studies involving climatological analyses covering East Asia.

TI  - Seroprevalence and risk factors of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> infection in invasive raccoons (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) in Central Europe
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan that causes toxoplasmosis in warm-blooded animals. Most mammals, including humans, can become intermediate host, resulting in subclinical infection or even death. Generally, there is limited information on the epidemiology of T. gondii of game species in Germany. As omnivores, raccoons, which are particularly widespread and abundant in Germany, are particularly exposed to infection the parasite. Here, we report the seroprevalence of T. gondii antibodies from 15 study sites located in Luxembourg and Germany. Using the indirect modified agglutination test (MAT), 170 (37.4%; 95% CI: 33.0-41.9) out of 454 raccoons were surveyed to be T. gondii seropositive. While values ranged from 19.0% to 53.3%, there was no significant difference in seroprevalence between study areas. Animal weight had a strong influence on the presence of T. gondii antibodies in raccoon sera, with heavier animals more likely to be seropositive. Our results show that T. gondii infection is widespread in central European raccoons, suggesting a high degree of ecosystem circulation of the parasite.

TI  - Levels of Organochlorine Pesticides Are Associated with Amyloid Aggregation in Apex Avian Brains
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Organochlorine (OC) pesticides pose a significant environmental risk to wildlife and humans and have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aims to spectroscopically analyze brains from free-flying birds and link the results to OC exposure and consequent amyloid aggregation. As long-lived apex predators, predatory birds represent a sentinel species similar to humans. Therefore, the results have implications for both species and may also add to our understanding of the role OC pesticides play in the development of AD. Brains of wild Sparrowhawks were analyzed using ATR-FTIR and Raman spectroscopy and Congo red staining; results were correlated with OC pesticide concentrations in livers. Effects of OC exposure were sex- and age-dependent and associated alterations were seen in lipids and protein secondary structure. A shift from alpha-helix to beta-sheet conformation of proteins indicated that concentrations of OC pesticides > 7.18 mu g/g may lead to cerebral amyloid aggregation.

TI  - Integrated evaluation of Ecosystem Services in Prawn-Rice rotational crops, Vietnam
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrologic condition in Kien Giang province on the west coast of Vietnam's Mekong Delta is unique in the sense that it has extensive saline water intrusion during the dry season every year. Instead of a triple crop scheme like other areas in the Delta, a prawn and rice rotational cultivation scheme was initiated to facilitate agricultural production in Kien Giang. In this paper, the ecosystem services (ES) generated from the agriculture ecosystem under the prawn and rice rotational crops (PRRC) were assessed using an integrated approach. The specific ES identified here include water and nutrition regulation in the soil together with climate regulation in favor of the cultivated crops. A multi-disciplinary approach including remote sensing, GIS, social surveys and statistical analysis was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the geographical, biophysical, economic and social aspects of the ES. Firstly, Landsat 8 images were processed with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NVDI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to identify the areas cultivating PRRC. The accuracy of image classification was assessed by ground truthing and we found an 80% coincidence between the simulated results and the field observations. Then, the social survey was conducted using face to face interviews at 50 local households to collect data related to farming practices. Economic values of ecosystem services were obtained using the revised market methods by annual crop yields per unit area. The mean estimated value of ES provided through the PRRC was 1300 USD/ha/year (standard deviation of 600 USD/ha/year) which accounted for 38.1% and 59.4% of the averaged economic revenue and net benefit, respectively. The analysis of social survey data revealed the factors having the greatest effects on ecosystem services values were selling prices of prawn and farming experiences. Finally, results were synthesized with GIS to describe how ES values vary across the research area which facilitates effective communication of the importance of ES concepts to policy makers regarding land use planning and natural resources management decisions.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping and staging in endometrial cancer: A Society of Gynecologic Oncology literature review with consensus recommendations
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The emphasis in contemporary medical oncology has been "precision" or "personalized" medicine, terms that imply a strategy to improve efficacy through targeted therapies. Similar attempts at precision are occurring in surgical oncology. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has recently been introduced into the surgical staging of endometrial cancer with the goal to reduce morbidity associated with comprehensive lymphadenectomy, yet obtain prognostic information from lymph node status. The Society of Gynecologic Oncology's (SGO) Clinical Practice Committee and SLN Working Group reviewed the current literature for preparation of this document. Literature-based recommendations for the inclusion of SLN assessment in the treatment of patients with endometrial cancer are presented. This article examines:History and various techniques of SLN mapping in endometrial cancerPathology and clinical outcomes from SLN assessmentControversies and future directions for research in SLN assessment in endometrial cancer.

TI  - Mercury emissions from dynamic monitoring holes of underground coal fires in the Wuda Coalfield, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wuda Coalfield, Inner Mongolia, China, is one of the largest coalfields suffering from coal fires in China, and has experienced fires for > 50 years. With the aim of observing the active state of underground coal seam fires to protect the main roadways of the coal mine, 44 drill holes were drilled in five fire areas of the Suhaitu coal mine to monitor gas emissions. A LumexRA-915 + Portable Mercury Analyzer was used to measure mercury concentrations in the exhaust gas. The drill holes exhibited high gaseous mercury concentrations, with an average of 4165 ng/m(3) (34-62,513 ng/m(3), n = 1584), which was 45 times higher than that measured in the near-surface atmosphere around the drill holes. This finding indicates that the mercury emissions originate from underground coal fires. Furthermore, mercury concentration has a positive correlation with CO content and gas temperature, implying that mercury has the potential to act as a supplementary coal-fire index gases to monitor the prevailing underground coal fire in north China on the basis of traditional indicators. Whether it can perform satisfactorily in practical applications requires further comprehensive study.

TI  - Evaluation of the EUMETSAT Global AVHRR Wind Product
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites fly in the same polar orbit with a 1808 phase difference, which enables the global retrieval of atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs, or "winds") by tracking clouds in a pair of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared-window-channel images taken successively by the tandem platforms within their swath overlap area. This novel global wind product has been operational since 2015. As part of ongoing validation efforts, two months of MetOp global AMVs were compared with a suite of independent wind data, including AMVs from geostationary and polar-orbiter satellites as well as radiosonde and model winds. The performance of the new wind product is generally comparable to that of more established satellite winds. In the tropics, however, high-level MetOp global AMVs show a strong fast speed bias, increased root-mean-square difference, and considerably reduced speed correlation relative to all comparison datasets-an as-yet-unexplained drop in retrieval quality that warrants further investigation. A best-fit wind analysis also indicates that selectively applied height adjustments, such as cloud-base and inversion methods, can be a significant source of discrepancy, leading to very poor height correlation among low-level satellite AMVs. Height assignment is more consistent and better correlated at mid-to high levels, although MetOp heights derived from window-channel brightness temperatures have a bias toward lower heights because of the lack of semi-transparency corrections. Collocated Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer CO2-slicing heights significantly improve the best-fit height-difference statistics at higher altitudes but are available for only similar to 5% of MetOp AMVs.

T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to examine changes in therapeutic practices for early breast cancer TO-2 NO managed by upfront surgery and SLNB.Population: Between 1999 and 2012, 15.508 patients were treated. Four periods were determined: 1999 2003, 2004-2006, 2007-2009 and > 2009. Five tumor subtypes were defined according to hormonal receptors (HR) and Her2: Luminal A (HR + Her2- Grade 1-2), Her2 (Her2+ HR-), Triple-negative (HR-Her2-), Luminal B Her2- (HR + Her2- Grade 3), Luminal B Her2+ (HR + HER2+).Methods: Rates of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), adjuvant chemotherapy +/- trastuzumab, endocrine treatment, mastectomy and post mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) were analyzed according to treatment periods with univariate and multivariate analysis. Overall and disease-free survivals were analyzed according to treatment periods adjusted for HR and then for tumor subtypes.Results: Rates of ALND, adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine treatment varied significantly according to treatment periods, for HR positive and negative tumors. ALND rate decreased for all tumor subtypes with a decrease of adjuvant chemotherapy rate for Luminal A tumors and an increase for Luminal B Her2+ and Her2-tumors. Endocrine treatment rate decreased for Luminal A and increased for Luminal B Her2+ tumors. In multivariate analysis, these modifications with time remained significant. Mastectomy and PMRT rates increased. In multivariate analysis, overall and disease-free survivals increased during successive periods.Conclusion: A global therapeutic de-escalation in ALND and adjuvant systemic treatment, combined with an actual escalation in some specific subsets was demonstrated, but without negative impact on survival.

T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sub-pixel impervious surface percentage (SPIS) is the fraction of impervious surface area in one pixel, and it is an important indicator of urbanization. Using remote sensing data, the spatial distribution of SPIS values over large areas can be extracted, and these data are significant for studies of urban climate, environment and hydrology. To develop a stabilized, multi-temporal SPIS estimation method suitable for typical temperate semi-arid climate zones with distinct seasons, an optimal model for estimating SPIS values within Beijing Municipality was built that is based on the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm. First, models with different input variables for SPIS estimation were built by integrating multi-source remote sensing data with other auxiliary data. The optimal model was selected through the analysis and comparison of the assessed accuracy of these models. Subsequently, multi-temporal SPIS mapping was carried out based on the optimal model. The results are as follows: 1) multi-seasonal images and nighttime light (NTL) data are the optimal input variables for SPIS estimation within Beijing Municipality, where the intra-annual variability in vegetation is distinct. The different spectral characteristics in the cultivated land caused by the different farming characteristics and vegetation phenology can be detected by the multi-seasonal images effectively. NLT data can effectively reduce the misestimation caused by the spectral similarity between bare land and impervious surfaces. After testing, the SPIS modeling correlation coefficient (r) is approximately 0.86, the average error (AE) is approximately 12.8%, and the relative error (RE) is approximately 0.39. 2) The SPIS results have been divided into areas with high-density impervious cover (70%-100%), medium-density impervious cover (40%-70%), low-density impervious cover (10%-40%) and natural cover (0%-10%). The SPIS model performed better in estimating values for high-density urban areas than other categories. 3) Multi-temporal SPIS mapping (1991-2016) was conducted based on the optimized SPIS results for 2005. After testing, AE ranges from 12.7% to 15.2%, RE ranges from 0.39 to 0.46, and r ranges from 0.81 to 0.86. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach for estimating sub-pixel level impervious surface by integrating the CART algorithm and multi-source remote sensing data is feasible and suitable for multi-temporal SPIS mapping of areas with distinct intra-annual variability in vegetation.

TI  - Semi-Analytical Retrieval of the Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient in Large and Shallow Lakes from GOCI, a High Temporal-Resolution Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the dynamic characteristics of the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d(490)) on the basis of the high temporal-resolution satellite data is critical for regulating the ecological environment of lake. By measuring the in-situ K-d(490) and the remote-sensing reflectance, a semi-analytical algorithm for K-d(490) was developed to determine the short-term variation of K-d(490). From 2006 to 2014, the data about 412 samples (among which 60 were used as match-up points, 282 for calibrating dataset and the remaining 70 for validating dataset) were gathered from nine expeditions to calibrate and validate the aforesaid semi-analytical algorithm. The root mean square percentage error (RMSP) and the mean absolute relative error (MAPE) of validation datasets were respectively 27.44% and 22.60 +/- 15.57%, while that of the match-up datasets were respectively 34.29% and 27.57 +/- 20.56%. These percentages indicate that the semi-analytical algorithm and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data are applicable to obtain the short-term variation of K-d(490) in the turbid shallow inland waters. The short-term GOCI-observed K-d(490) shows a significant seasonal and spatial variation and a similar distribution to the matching Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) which derived K-d(490). A comparative analysis on wind (observed by buoys) and GOCI-derived K-d(490) suggests that wind is a primary driving factor of K-d(490) variation, but the lacustrine morphometry affects the wind force that is contributing to K-d(490) variation.

TI  - Technical Evaluation of Sentinel-1 IW Mode Cross-Pol Radar Backscattering from the Ocean Surface in Moderate Wind Condition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) allows sufficient resources for cross-pol wind speed retrievals over the ocean. In this paper, we present technical evaluation on wind retrieval from both Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B IW cross-pol images. Algorithms are based on the existing theoretical and empirical ones derived from the RADARSAT-2 cross-pol data. First, to better understand the Sentinel-1 observed normalized radar cross section (NRCS) values under various environmental conditions, we constructed a dataset that integrates SAR images with wind field information from scatterometer measurements. There are 11,883 matchup data in the experimental dataset. We then calculated the systemic noise floor of Sentinel-1 IW mode, and presented its unique noise characteristics among different sub-bands. Based on the calculated NESZ measurements, the noise is removed for all matchup data. Empirical relationships among the noise free NRCS sigma(0)(VH), wind speed, wind direction, and radar incidence angle are analyzed for each sub-band, and a piecewise model is proposed. We showed that a larger correlation coefficient, r, is achieved by including both wind direction and incidence terms in the model. Validation against scatterometer measurements showed the suitability of the proposed model.

TI  - Biosurveillance: a systematic review of global infectious disease surveillance systems from 1900 to 2016
T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Biosurveillance is crucial to detect, identify and minimise the negative consequences of infectious disease. Its value to society and importance to global public health and global health security are growing. Despite the long history and global importance of biosurveillance, a systematic review of all existing biosurveillance systems across the 'One Health' spectrum has not yet been published. This study conducted a systematic review to identify all extant and defunct biosurveillance systems from 1900 to 2016. Of the 815 systems examined, the majority surveyed human, animal or plant data discretely. Some 105 collected human and animal data, whereas only 31 collected data on all three categories.The authors found a large increase in the number of global biosurveillance systems between 1900 and 2008, but a reduction in the number of biosurveillance systems from 2008 to the present. The number of syndromic systems created, versus laboratory based biosurveillance systems, increased rapidly after 1980 across the globe. However, in 2008, there was a large contraction in the number of biosurveillance systems. The authors also provide the number of biosurveillance systems per capita. Developed nations have greater biosurveillance coverage per capita than developing nations. The database created in this review includes over 800 documented traditional and syndromic surveillance systems used internationally between 1900 and 2016. Finally, the authors discuss the implications of global biosurveillance in relation to the detection of outbreaks of disease.

TI  - Mapping Tree Density in Forests of the Southwestern USA Using Landsat 8 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase of tree density in forests of the American Southwest promotes extreme fire events, understory biodiversity losses, and degraded habitat conditions for many wildlife species. To ameliorate these changes, managers and scientists have begun planning treatments aimed at reducing fuels and increasing understory biodiversity. However, spatial variability in tree density across the landscape is not well-characterized, and if better known, could greatly influence planning efforts. We used reflectance values from individual Landsat 8 bands (bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and calculated vegetation indices (difference vegetation index, simple ratios, and normalized vegetation indices) to estimate tree density in an area planned for treatment in the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico, characterized by multiple vegetation types and a complex topography. Because different vegetation types have different spectral signatures, we derived models with multiple predictor variables for each vegetation type, rather than using a single model for the entire project area, and compared the model-derived values to values collected from on-the-ground transects. Among conifer-dominated areas (73% of the project area), the best models (as determined by corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc)) included Landsat bands 2, 3, 4, and 7 along with simple ratios, normalized vegetation indices, and the difference vegetation index (R-2 values for ponderosa: 0.47, pinon-juniper: 0.52, and spruce-fir: 0.66). On the other hand, in aspen-dominated areas (9% of the project area), the best model included individual bands 4 and 2, simple ratio, and normalized vegetation index (R-2 value: 0.97). Most areas dominated by ponderosa, pinyon-juniper, or spruce-fir had more than 100 trees per hectare. About 54% of the study area has medium to high density of trees (100-1000 trees/hectare), and a small fraction (4.5%) of the area has very high density (> 1000 trees/hectare). Our results provide a better understanding of tree density for identifying areas in need of treatment and planning for more effective treatment. Our analysis also provides an integrated method of estimating tree density across complex landscapes that could be useful for further restoration planning.

T2  - GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild palms contribute significantly to food security and local economy in tropical areas, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In light of this importance, eight palm species were explored [Borassus aethiopum (L.) Mart, Eremospatha macrocarpa (G. Mann et H. Wendl.) H. Wendl., Laccosperma opacum (G. Mann et H. Wendl.) Drude, Hyphaene thebaica (L.) Mart, Phoenix reclinata Jacq., Raphia hookeri G. Mann et H. Wendl., R. sudanica A. Chev., and R. vinifera P. Beauv.] as targets for conservation, domestication, and cultivation in Benin. Cultivation potential was evaluated in a coarse-resolution, first-pass effort using ecological niche models to relate known occurrences of each species to vegetation indices (VEG), gross primary productivity (GPP), and soil characteristics (SOIL), and model outputs were related to human distribution and land-use patterns. Results showed that wild palms responded differentially to different suites of environmental factors: some species showed best model performance with VEG + GPP + SOIL, others with GPP + SOIL or VEG + GPP, or with a single factor. Two species had broad potential distributions across the country; others had potential areas in the north (2 species) or the south (4 species). Raphia hookeri and R. vinifera showed greatest overlap in terms of ecology and distribution, whereas L. opacum and R. sudanica had the lowest similarity. These models constitute initial steps toward a sustainable scheme for planning exploration of the possibility of cultivation of these species.

TI  - A Novel Ship Detector Based on the Generalized-Likelihood Ratio Test for SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, acquired at different working frequencies, is presented in this paper where a novel technique is proposed based on the generalized-likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Suitable electromagnetic models for both the sea clutter and the signal backscattered from the ship are considered in the new technique in order to improve the detector performance. The GLRT is compared to the traditional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm through Monte-Carlo simulations in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and computational load at different bands (S-, C-, and X-). Performances are also compared through simulations with different orbital and scene parameters at fixed values of band and polarization. The GLRT is then applied to real datasets acquired from different sensors (TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and Airbus airborne demonstrator) operating at different bands (S-, C-, and X-). An analysis of the target-to-clutter ratio (TCR) is then performed and detection outcomes are compared with an automatic identification system data when available. Simulations show that the GLRT presents better ROCs than those obtained through the CFAR algorithm. On the other side, results on real SAR images demonstrate that the proposed approach greatly improves the TCR (between 22 and 32 dB on average), but its computational time is 1.5 times slower when compared to the CFAR algorithm.

TI  - Photosynthetic productivity and its efficiencies in ISIMIP2a biome models: benchmarking for impact assessment studies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulating vegetation photosynthetic productivity (or gross primary production, GPP) is a critical feature of the biome models used for impact assessments of climate change. We conducted a benchmarking of global GPP simulated by eight biome models participating in the second phase of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2a) with four meteorological forcing datasets (30 simulations), using independent GPP estimates and recent satellite data of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence as a proxy of GPP. The simulated global terrestrial GPP ranged from 98 to 141 Pg Cyr(-1) (1981-2000 mean); considerable inter-model and inter-data differences were found. Major features of spatial distribution and seasonal change of GPP were captured by each model, showing good agreement with the benchmarking data. All simulations showed incremental trends of annual GPP, seasonal-cycle amplitude, radiation-use efficiency, and water-use efficiency, mainly caused by the CO2 fertilization effect. The incremental slopes were higher than those obtained by remote sensing studies, but comparable with those by recent atmospheric observation. Apparent differences were found in the relationship between GPP and incoming solar radiation, for which forcing data differed considerably. The simulated GPP trends co-varied with a vegetation structural parameter, leaf area index, at model-dependent strengths, implying the importance of constraining canopy properties. In terms of extreme events, GPP anomalies associated with a historical El Nino event and large volcanic eruption were not consistently simulated in the model experiments due to deficiencies in both forcing data and parameterized environmental responsiveness. Although the benchmarking demonstrated the overall advancement of contemporary biome models, further refinements are required, for example, for solar radiation data and vegetation canopy schemes.

TI  - Estimation of Fugacity of Carbon Dioxide in the East Sea Using In Situ Measurements and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean is closely related to global warming and on-going climate change by regulating amounts of carbon dioxide through its interaction with the atmosphere. The monitoring of ocean carbon dioxide is important for a better understanding of the role of the ocean as a carbon sink, and regional and global carbon cycles. This study estimated the fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO(2)) over the East Sea located between Korea and Japan. In situ measurements, satellite data and products from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) and the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) reanalysis data were used through stepwise multi-variate nonlinear regression (MNR) and two machine learning approaches (i.e., support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF)). We used five ocean parameters-colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM; <0.3 m(-1)), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a; <21 mg/m(3)), mixed layer depth (MLD; <160 m), sea surface salinity (SSS; 32-35), and sea surface temperature (SST; 8-28 degrees C)-and four band reflectance (Rrs) data (400 nm-565 nm) and their ratios as input parameters to estimate surface seawater fCO(2) (270-430 mu atm). Results show that RF generally performed better than stepwise MNR and SVR. The root mean square error (RMSE) of validation results by RF was 5.49 mu atm (1.7%), while those of stepwise MNR and SVR were 10.59 mu atm (3.2%) and 6.82 mu atm (2.1%), respectively. Ocean parameters (i.e., sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), and mixed layer depth (MLD)) appeared to contribute more than the individual bands or band ratios from the satellite data. Spatial and seasonal distributions of monthly fCO(2) produced from the RF model and sea-air CO2 flux were also examined.

TI  - Characterization of Fitzroy River Virus and Serologic Evidence of Human and Animal Infection
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - In northern Western Australia in 2011 and 2012, surveillance detected a novel arbovirus in mosquitoes. Genetic and phenotypic analyses confirmed that the new flavivirus, named Fitzroy River virus, is related to Sepik virus and Wesselsbron virus, in the yellow fever virus group. Most (81%) isolates came from Aedes normanensis mosquitoes, providing circumstantial evidence of the probable vector. In cell culture, Fitzroy River virus replicated in mosquito (C6/36), mammalian (Vero, PSEK, and BSR), and avian (DF-1) cells. It also infected intraperitoneally inoculated weanling mice and caused mild clinical disease in 3 intracranially inoculated mice. Specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in sentinel horses (12.6%), cattle (6.6%), and chickens (0.5%) in the Northern Territory of Australia and in a subset of humans (0.8%) from northern Western Australia.

TI  - The Impact of Smoking on Sentinel Node Metastasis of Primary Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Although a well-established causative relationship exists between smoking and several epithelial cancers, the association of smoking with metastatic progression in melanoma is not well studied. We hypothesized that smokers would be at increased risk for melanoma metastasis as assessed by sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy.Methods. Data from the first international Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-I) and the screening-phase of the second trial (MSLT-II) were analyzed to determine the association of smoking with clinicopathologic variables and SLN metastasis.Results. Current smoking was strongly associated with SLN metastasis (p = 0.004), even after adjusting for other predictors of metastasis. Among 4231 patients (1025 in MSLT-I and 3206 in MSLT-II), current or former smoking was also independently associated with ulceration (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Compared with current smoking, never smoking was independently associated with decreased Breslow thickness in multivariate analysis (p = 0.002) and with a 0.25 mm predicted decrease in thickness.Conclusion. The direct correlation between current smoking and SLN metastasis of primary cutaneous melanoma was independent of its correlation with tumor thickness and ulceration. Smoking cessation should be strongly encouraged among patients with or at risk for melanoma.

TI  - A Study of Spatial Soil Moisture Estimation Using a Multiple Linear Regression Model and MODIS Land Surface Temperature Data Corrected by Conditional Merging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to estimate spatial soil moisture in South Korea (99,000 km(2)) from January 2013 to December 2015 using a multiple linear regression (MLR) model and the Terra moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and normalized distribution vegetation index (NDVI) data. The MODIS NDVI was used to reflect vegetation variations. Observed precipitation was measured using the automatic weather stations (AWSs) of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), and soil moisture data were recorded at 58 stations operated by various institutions. Prior to MLR analysis, satellite LST data were corrected by applying the conditional merging (CM) technique and observed LST data from 71 KMA stations. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the original LST and observed LST was 0.71, and the R-2 of corrected LST and observed LST was 0.95 for 3 selected LST stations. The R-2 values of all corrected LSTs were greater than 0.83 for total 71 LST stations. The regression coefficients of the MLR model were estimated seasonally considering the five-day antecedent precipitation. The p-values of all the regression coefficients were less than 0.05, and the R-2 values were between 0.28 and 0.67. The reason for R-2 values less than 0.5 is that the soil classification at each observation site was not completely accurate. Additionally, the observations at most of the soil moisture monitoring stations used in this study started in December 2014, and the soil moisture measurements did not stabilize. Notably, R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE) in winter were poor, as reflected by the many missing values, and uncertainty existed in observations due to freezing and mechanical errors in the soil. Thus, the prediction accuracy is low in winter due to the difficulty of establishing an appropriate regression model. Specifically, the estimated map of the soil moisture index (SMI) can be used to better understand the severity of droughts with the variability of soil moisture.

TI  - Contextual Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network with Multilayer Fusion for SAR Ship Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection has been playing an increasingly essential role in marine monitoring in recent years. The lack of detailed information about ships in wide swath SAR imagery poses difficulty for traditional methods in exploring effective features for ship discrimination. Being capable of feature representation, deep neural networks have achieved dramatic progress in object detection recently. However, most of them suffer from the missing detection of small-sized targets, which means that few of them are able to be employed directly in SAR ship detection tasks. This paper discloses an elaborately designed deep hierarchical network, namely a contextual region-based convolutional neural network with multilayer fusion, for SAR ship detection, which is composed of a region proposal network (RPN) with high network resolution and an object detection network with contextual features. Instead of using low-resolution feature maps from a single layer for proposal generation in a RPN, the proposed method employs an intermediate layer combined with a downscaled shallow layer and an up-sampled deep layer to produce region proposals. In the object detection network, the region proposals are projected onto multiple layers with region of interest (ROI) pooling to extract the corresponding ROI features and contextual features around the ROI. After normalization and rescaling, they are subsequently concatenated into an integrated feature vector for final outputs. The proposed framework fuses the deep semantic and shallow high-resolution features, improving the detection performance for small-sized ships. The additional contextual features provide complementary information for classification and help to rule out false alarms. Experiments based on the Sentinel-1 dataset, which contains twenty-seven SAR images with 7986 labeled ships, verify that the proposed method achieves an excellent performance in SAR ship detection.

TI  - Discriminating the biophysical impacts of coastal upwelling and mud banks along the southwest coast of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal upwelling and mud banks are two oceanographic processes concurrently operating along certain stretches of the southwest (Kerala) coast of India during the Southwest Monsoon period (June-September), facilitating significant enhancement in plankton biomass. Mud banks have scientific and societal attention from time immemorial, predominantly due to the large fisheries associated with them. In this paper, for the first time, the specific biophysical roles of these oceanographic processes have been discriminated, based on a focused 18 weeldy/fortnightly time-series study (April to September 2014) in a mud bank-upwelling area (off Alappuzha, southwest coast of India). In conjunction with standard hydrographical and satellite remote sensing data, we utilised a FlowCAM to track the biophysical linkage in terms of plankton composition abundance and size structure at three locations (Ml, M2 and M3) in the study area. During the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (April-May), the entire study area was warmer with low nitrate concentration in the surface waters, which caused lower biomass of autotrophs compared to the Southwest Monsoon (June-September). By the onset of the Southwest Monsoon (June), drastic hydrographical transformations took place in the study domain due to the Coastal upwelling, reflected as the surfacing of significantly cool, high nutrient and hypoxic waters. Concurrently, mud bank formed at location M2 due to the presence of relatively high-suspended sediments in the region, creating a localised calm environment conducive for fishing activities. In response to the hydrographical transformations in the entire study area during the Southwest Monsoon, the autotrophic plankton biomass and size structure experienced significant change. The micro-autotrophs biomass that was low during the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (av. 0.33 +/- 02 mgCL(-1) at surface and av. 0.07 +/- 0.04 mgC L-1 at subsurface) noticeably increased during the Southwest Monsoon (av. 1.6 +/- 0.4 mgC L-1 at surface and av. 13 +/- 02 mgC L-1 at subsurface). The seasonal mean bio-volume of micro-autotrophs followed the same pattern in all three locations with the dominance of smaller individuals during the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (av. 55 +/- 4.4 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at surface and av. 67.1 +/- 38.4 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at subsurface). Relatively large phytoplankton dominated during the Southwest Monsoon (av. 77.3 +/- 5.5 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at surface and av. 903 +/- 4.9 x 10(3) mu m(3) individual(-1) at subsurface). Similar spatial change in the plankton composition, biomass and size structure in all three locations suggested the dominant role of coastal upwelling, and not the mud bank, in shaping the dominant autotrophic plankton in the study domain. The nutrient enrichment in the region associated with the coastal upwelling facilitated the predominance of a classical short food chain capable of supporting large fish stocks. In addition to relatively calm mud bank, the hypoxic, cool upwelled waters that existed in the subsurface induce the fish stock to concentrate in the surface waters, making the relatively calm mud bank and adjoining areas a rich fishing ground for the native fishers.

TI  - Recurring Emergence of the Mud Islands on Shelf of the Arabian Sea along the Makran Coast of Pakistan - Historical Perspective using Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurring emergences of mud islands on shelf of the Arabian Sea, along the Makran coast of Pakistan are now known to be submarine mud volcanoes. They are expressions of enhanced extrusions of fluidized mud and gases coupled with compressional tectonics in convergent margin settings. Since 1945 the Malan island has emerged four times, and some other mud islands have also been emerging repeatedly, at their own positions.The first known emergence, during November 1945, was concurrent with an earthquake of magnitude 8.0 (M8.0), the 2nd and 3rd emergences, in March 1999 and November 2010 respectively, were not related apparently with earthquakes. The 4th emergence concurred with the Awaran earthquake (M7.7) of 24th September 2013. Landsat images of March 1999 and November 2010 emergences indicate appearance of round-shaped island of 4.4 and 5.2 hectare area, followed by erosion and disappearance. The island was composed of mud breccias and circular vents spewing mud slurry and methane gas.The emergence of Malan island, in March 1999 and November 2010 was compared with earthquake data before and after the emergences. The earthquakes data, two years before March 1999 and November 2010 emergences and two years afterwards, shows correlation with both small and large earthquakes, prior to the emergence, in the radius of over 400 km. It is proposed that mud islands develop in response to the episodes of enhanced mud extrusion, which inturn are related with the enhanced compressional and/or seismic events. These events are followed by periods of relative quiescence characterized by normal activity of mud extrusion and marine erosion.

TI  - Cardiac transplantation in children and adolescents with long QT syndrome
T2  - HEART RHYTHM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a potentially lethal, yet highly treatable, cardiac channelopathy. Cardiac transplantation has been reported anecdotally for patients with severe LQTS refractory to standard therapies.OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for cardiac transplantation in children evaluated and treated in an LQTS specialty center.METHODS This was a retrospective review of 349 children with LQTS (mean age at diagnosis, 8.0 +/- 5.7 years; mean corrected QT interval, 469 +/- 51 ms; long QT syndrome type 1 [LQT1] in 46%, LQT2 in 31%, and LQT3 in 9%) evaluated from 2000 to 2013. A subset analysis was performed on patients referred for cardiac transplantation.RESULTS Only 3 patients (0.9%; all LQT3; 2 female) underwent cardiac transplantation at ages 4, 11, and 17 years. Overall, 90 of 349 (26%) were symptomatic (exhibited LQTS-associated cardiac events) before LQTS diagnosis, including those who ultimately underwent transplant. Age at sentinel event was associated with transplantation (3 of 26 [12%] with an event at,1 year of life were transplanted vs 0 of 64 with an event after age 1; P = .02). Genotype was also a risk factor (3 of 32 patients with LQT3 were transplanted [9.4%] vs 0 of 270 patients with LQT1 or LQT2; P = .001). Before transplant, all patients had recurrent ventricular fibrillation-terminating shocks despite combination drug therapy and bilateral sympathetic denervation. All transplanted patients are alive at follow-up.CONCLUSION Cardiac transplantation is seldom necessary for the management of LQTS. However, patients with LQT3 and in utero/neonatal expressivity are at higher risk of treatment failure and refractory ventricular arrhythmias with standard therapy, and cardiac transplantation should be considered for this malignant subset of LQTS.

TI  - Higher Order Dynamic Conditional Random Fields Ensemble for Crop Type Classification in Radar Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising food demand requires regular agriculture land-cover updates to support food security initiatives. Agricultural areas undergo dynamic changes throughout the year, which manifest varying radar backscatter due to crop phenology. Certain crops can show similar backscatter if their phenology intersects, but vary later when their phenology differs. Hence, classification techniques based on single-date remote sensing images may not offer optimal results for crops with similar phenology. Moreover, methods that stack images within a cropping season as composite bands for classification limit discrimination to one feature space vector, which can suffer from overlapping classes. Nonetheless, phenology can aid classification of crops, because their backscatter varies with time. This paper fills this gap by introducing a crop sequence-based ensemble classification method where expert knowledge and TerraSAR-X multitemporal image-based phenological information are explored. We designed first-order and higher order dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs) including an ensemble technique. The DCRF models have a duplicated structure of temporally connected CRFs, which encode image-based phenology and expert-based phenology knowledge during classification. On the other hand, our ensemble generates an optimal map based on class posterior probabilities estimated by DCRFs. These techniques improved crop delineation at each epoch, with higher order DCRFs (HDCRFs) giving the best accuracy. The ensemble method was evaluated against the conventional technique of stacking multitemporal images as composite bands for classification using maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and CRFs. It surpassed MLC and CRFs based on class posterior probabilities estimated by both first-order DCRFs and HDCRFs.

TI  - Mapping Annual Riparian Water Use Based on the Single-Satellite-Scene Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of water use by groundwater-dependent riparian vegetation is of great importance to sustainable water resource management in arid/semi-arid regions. Remote sensing methods can be effective in this regard, as they capture the inherent spatial variability in riparian ecosystems. The single-satellite-scene (SSS) method uses a derivation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from a single space-borne image during the peak growing season and minimal ground-based meteorological data to estimate the annual riparian water use on a distributed basis. This method was applied to a riparian ecosystem dominated by tamarisk along a section of the lower Colorado River in southern California. The results were compared against the estimates of a previously validated remotely sensed energy balance model for the year 2008 at two different spatial scales. A pixel-wide comparison showed good correlation (R-2 = 0.86), with a mean residual error of less than 104 mm.year(-1) (18%). This error reduced to less than 95 mm.year(-1) (15%) when larger areas were used in comparisons. In addition, the accuracy improved significantly when areas with no and low vegetation cover were excluded from the analysis. The SSS method was then applied to estimate the riparian water use for a 23-year period (1988-2010). The average annual water use over this period was 748 mm.year(-1) for the entire study area, with large spatial variability depending on vegetation density. Comparisons with two independent water use estimates showed significant differences. The MODIS evapotranspiration product (MOD16) was 82% smaller, and the crop-coefficient approach employed by the US Bureau of Reclamation was 96% larger, than that from the SSS method on average.

TI  - Characterization of five-year observation data of fine particulate matter in the metropolitan area of Lahore
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the long-term trend of fine particles (PM2.5; <= 2.5 mu m) at two urban sites of Lahore during 2007-2011. These sites represent two distinct areas: commercial (Townhall) and residential cum industrial (Township). The highest daily mean concentrations of PM2.5 were noted as 389 and 354 mu g m(-3) at the Townhall and Township sites, respectively. As expected, the annual seasonal mean of PM2.5 was about 53 and 101% higher during winter compared with the summer and monsoon/post-monsoon seasons, respectively. On contrary to many observations seen in developing cities, the annual mean PM2.5 during the weekends was higher than weekdays at both monitoring sites. For example, these were 100 (142) and 142 mu g m(-3) (148) during the weekdays (weekends) at the Townhall and Township sites, respectively. The regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation of PM2.5 with SO2, NO2 and CO as opposed to a negative correlation with O-3. The bivariate polar plots suggested a much higher influence of localized sources (e.g., road vehicles) at the Townhall site as opposed to industrial sources affecting the concentrations at the Township site. The imageries from the MODIS Aqua/Terra indicated long-range transport of PM2.5 from India to Pakistan during February to October whereas from Pakistan to India during November to January. This study provides important results in the form of multiscale relationship of PM2.5 with its sources and precursors, which are important to assess the effectiveness of pollution control mitigation strategies in Lahore and similar cities elsewhere.

TI  - Axillary Skip Metastases and the False-Negative Rate of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Breast Cancer Are Related to Negative ALDH-1 Expression and Ki-67 Expression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been hypothesized to be the driving force behind tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this study, we evaluated the relationships between CSC expressions in primary breast cancers and corresponding metastatic sentinel and nonsentinel lymph nodes (SLNs and NSLNs). The clinical implications of these relationships were also investigated. CSC expressions were evaluated in 167 breast cancer specimens and associated lymph node biopsies (when present). We used double immunohistochemistry of CD44/CD24 and single immunohistochemistry of ALDH-1 on paraffin-embedded breast tissue, SLN, and NSLN specimens. Seven cases had metastatic NSLNs without SLN involvementso-called skip metastasis. Fifty cases of SLNs (29.9%) and 33 cases of NSLNs (25.7%) had metastases. In the breast cancers, metastatic SLNs, and NSLNs, the expression rates of CD44(+)/CD24(-) were 47.9%, 26.1%, and 34.6 %, respectively, while the expression rates of ALDH-1(+) were 42.5%, 36.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. Significant relationships were not observed between CSC expressions in breast cancer and metastatic SLNs or NSLNs. The presence of skip metastasis correlated with negative ALDH-1 in breast cancer (P = .04), as well as several clinicopathologic factors: age >50 years (P = .004), negative lymphovascular tumor emboli (P = .02), and high Ki-67 expression (P = .04). Axillary lymph node metastasis showed no significant relationship with any CSC marker. However, CD44(+)/CD24(-) and ALDH-1 expressions of metastatic SLNs correlated with CSCs of primary breast cancers. In summary, skip metastasis correlated with negative expression of ALDH-1 in primary breast cancers, which could be promising as a means of assessing the risk of skip metastasis.

TI  - <i>Vernov</i> Satellite Data of Transient Atmospheric Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on transient atmospheric events (TAEs) were obtained from the Vernov satellite and are presented in this paper. The data are considered in conjunction with previous data obtained by the Universitetsky-Tatiana-1 and Universitetsky-Tatiana-2 satellites. The larger volume of stored scientific data in the Vernov mission and its advanced ultraviolet (UV) and red-infrared (R-IR) radiation detector (DUV) measurements allowed improved TAE-distribution data to be obtained over a wide range of photon numbers. The difference between features of luminous transients and "dim" transients, measured by the Universitetsky-Tatiana-2 satellite, is confirmed by Vernov's data. There are also interesting dim UV events with no R-IR radiation. Such events are expected to be deep in the atmosphere at the level of thunderstorm clouds. They might be radiated by electric discharges of less power than lightning; in fact, at the preliminary stage of lightning. The observation of repeating dim TAEs in various time intervals, starting from tens of milliseconds and up to minutes, indicates that thunderstorm electric activity is much more variable than pure lightning strikes.

TI  - Sebaceous Carcinoma: A Review of the Scientific Literature
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare and potentially aggressive cutaneous malignancy. Commonly reported in the periocular area and the head and neck region, sebaceous carcinoma can arise from any sebaceous gland in the skin. The clinical presentation may be nonspecific, and a biopsy is important to establish a diagnosis and to differentiate from mimickers including benign sebaceous neoplasms, other adnexal tumors, and basal cell carcinoma. A diagnosis of Muir Torre syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with a sebaceous neoplasm. Early treatment is important given the potential of sebaceous carcinoma to spread to the regional lymph nodes and beyond. Sentinel lymph node biopsy and imaging to complete tumor staging may be indicated for larger or more aggressive tumors. Surgery, including Mohs micrographic surgery, remains the primary treatment modality for sebaceous carcinoma. Mohs micrographic surgery has the advantage of complete margin evaluation and low recurrence rates. Advanced cases may be treated with orbital exenteration, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or combination therapy.

TI  - Combined PET-CT and axillary lymph node marking with radioactive iodine seeds (MARI procedure) for tailored axillary treatment in node-positive breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The treatment of axillary lymph node metastases after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) remains debatable and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is still the standard of care. Marking axillary lymph nodes with radioactive iodine seeds (MARI procedure) is accurate in restaging the axilla after NST (false-negative rate 7 per cent). Here, the potential of tailored axillary treatment, determined by combining the results of PET-CT before NST with those of the MARI procedure after NST, was analysed.Methods: A cohort of axillary node-positive patients was used to construct a hypothetical treatment algorithm based on a combination of PET-CT and the MARI procedure. In the algorithm, the number of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid axillary lymph nodes (1-3 versus 4 or more) before NST and the tumour status of the MARI node (positive versus negative) after NST were used to tailor axillary treatment. All patients in the cohort underwent ALND, allowing estimation of potential overtreatment and undertreatment.Results: A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Between one and three FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes were observed in 59 patients, and four or more in 34 patients. The MARI node was tumour-negative in 32 patients and showed residual disease in 61. Treatment according to the constructed algorithm would have resulted in 74 per cent of patients avoiding an ALND, with potential undertreatment in three patients (3 per cent) and overtreatment in 16 (17 per cent).Conclusion: Tailored axillary treatment after NST in node-positive patients, by combining PET-CT before NST and the MARI procedure after NST, has the potential for ALND to be avoided in 74 per cent of patients.

TI  - A 1 cm space debris impact onto the Sentinel-1A solar array
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1A is a 2-ton spacecraft of the Copernicus Earth observation program operated by ESA's Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Sentinel-1A and its sister spacecraft Sentinel-1B operate in a sun synchronous orbit at about 700 km altitude.On 2016/08/23 17:07:37 UTC, Sentinel-1A suffered from an anomaly resulting in a sudden permanent partial power loss and significant impulsive orbit and attitude changes. A deeper investigation identified that an impulsive orbit change against flight direction of 0.7 mm/s, estimated at the time of the event, gave the best results in terms of GPS residuals. At the same time, a peak attitude off-pointing of 0.7 (around the spacecraft yaw axis) and peak attitude rate increase of 0.04 degrees/s (around the same axis) were observed.The simultaneous occurrence of these anomalies, starting from a sudden attitude change and ending with a permanent partial power loss, made an MMOD (Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris) impact onto a solar array a possible explanation for this event. While the spacecraft is able to continue its mission nominally, a detailed investigation involving ESA's Space Debris and Flight Dynamics experts was conducted. An MMOD impact as an explanation gained further credibility, due to the pictures of the solar array taken by the on-board camera displaying a significant damage area. On September 7th, JSpOC (US Joint Space Operations Centre) informed SDO on 8 tracked fragments that are considered to be released by Sentinel-1A after the impact.This paper addresses the analysis that was performed on the data characterising the attitude and orbit change, the on-board camera image, and the tracked fragments. The data helped to identify the linear momentum vector while a flux analysis helped to identify the origin of the impactor and allowed to understand its mass and size characteristics.

TI  - A mixed satellite TV channel transmission scheme to enhance frequency bandwidth utilization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent past, television (TV) industry has started to provide users with ultra high definition (ultra-HD) and/or 3-dimensional TV programs, which on the one hand, can bring users greatly enhanced viewing experience, while on the other hand, considerably increases the transmission bandwidth requirements and may lead to bandwidth shortage situations in many different types of TV systems. In particular, this bandwidth shortage poses a serious challenge in the current satellite TV broadcasting systems because of the strictly limited bandwidth available in C and Ku frequency bands. Aiming at mitigating the bandwidth shortage problem, this paper proposes an innovative mixed channel transmission scheme for the next generation satellite TV systems. The proposed scheme integrates the merits of using both broadcast and multicast methods, both Ku and Ka frequency bands, as well as both wide-shaped and spot antenna beam types. According to the conducted comprehensive simulation experiments, this mixed scheme is able to effectively enhance the frequency bandwidth utilization with still providing users affordable quality of experience. Moreover, to cope with the impact brought by ever increasing number of provided TV channels, this paper enhances the proposed scheme by using multicast method to transmit those least popular global channels, which can efficiently reduce the quality of experience degradation up to 90% in Ku- and Ka-band frequency resource restricted scenarios.

TI  - Associations between Greenness, Impervious Surface Area, and Nighttime Lights on Biomarkers of Vascular Aging in Chennai, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: India is undergoing rapid urbanization with simultaneous increases in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). As urban areas become home to an increasing share of the world's population, it is important to understand relationships between the built environment and progression towards CVD.OBJECTIVE: We assessed associations between multiple measures of the built environment and biomarkers of early vascular aging (EVA) in the Population Study of Urban, Rural and Semiurban Regions for the Detection of Endovascular Disease and Prevalence of Risk Factors and Holistic Intervention Study (PURSE: HIS)in Chcnnai, India.METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 3,150 study participants. EVA biomarkers included systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), central pulse pressure (cPP) and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). Multiple approaches were used to assign residential exposure to factors of the built environment: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a measure of vegetation health and greenness; Landsat-derived impervious surface area (ISA); and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (V1IRS)derived nighttime lights (NTL). Multivariable regression models were used to assess associations between each built environment measure and biomarkers of EVA, adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), cooking fuel type, energy intake, sex, physical activity, smoking, socioeconomic status, and stress. RESULTS: Residing in areas with higher ISA or NTL, or lower greenness, was significantly associated with elevated SBP, DBP, and cPP, and with lower FMD, adjusting for age, BMI, sex, smoking status, and other CVD risk factors. An interquartile range decrease in greenness had the largest increase in SBP [4.3 mmHg (95% CT 2.9, 5.6)1, DBP [1.2 mmHg (95% CI: 0.4, 2.0)1 and cPP [3A mmHg (95% CE 2.0, 4.1)1, and the largest decrease in FMD [-1.5% (95%CI: 2.2%, 0.9%1.CONCLUSION: Greenness, ISA, and NTE were associated with increased SBP, DBP, and cPP, and with reduced FMD, suggesting a possible additional EVA pathway for the relationship between urbanization and increased CVD prevalence in urban India.

TI  - Validating MODIS and Sentinel-2 NDVI Products at a Temperate Deciduous Forest Site Using Two Independent Ground-Based Sensors
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the accuracy of remote sensing products is a timely endeavor given the rapid increase in Earth observation missions. A validation site for Sentinel-2 products was hence established in central Germany. Automatic multispectral and hyperspectral sensor systems were installed in parallel with an existing eddy covariance flux tower, providing spectral information of the vegetation present at high temporal resolution. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from ground-based hyperspectral and multispectral sensors were compared with NDVI products derived from Sentinel-2A and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The influence of different spatial and temporal resolutions was assessed. High correlations and similar phenological patterns between in situ and satellite-based NDVI time series demonstrated the reliability of satellite-based phenological metrics. Sentinel-2-derived metrics showed better agreement with in situ measurements than MODIS-derived metrics. Dynamic filtering with the best index slope extraction algorithm was nevertheless beneficial for Sentinel-2 NDVI time series despite the availability of quality information from the atmospheric correction procedure.

TI  - Impact of absorbing aerosol deposition on snow albedo reduction over the southern Tibetan plateau based on satellite observations
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the snow albedo variation in spring over the southern Tibetan Plateau induced by the deposition of light-absorbing aerosols using remote sensing data from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Terra satellite during 2001-2012. We have selected pixels with 100 % snow cover for the entire period in March and April to avoid albedo contamination by other types of land surfaces. A model simulation using GEOS-Chem shows that aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a good indicator for black carbon and dust deposition on snow over the southern Tibetan Plateau. The monthly means of satellite-retrieved land surface temperature (LST) and AOD over 100 % snow-covered pixels during the 12 years are used in multiple linear regression analysis to derive the empirical relationship between snow albedo and these variables. Along with the LST effect, AOD is shown to be an important factor contributing to snow albedo reduction. We illustrate through statistical analysis that a 1-K increase in LST and a 0.1 increase in AOD indicate decreases in snow albedo by 0.75 and 2.1 % in the southern Tibetan Plateau, corresponding to local shortwave radiative forcing of 1.5 and 4.2 W m(-2), respectively.

TI  - Super-Resolution for Remote Sensing Images via Local-Global Combined Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution is an image processing technology that recovers a high-resolution image from a single or sequential low-resolution images. Recently deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made a huge breakthrough in many tasks including super-resolution. In this letter, we propose a new singleimage super-resolution algorithm named local-global combined networks (LGCNet) for remote sensing images based on the deep CNNs. Our LGCNet is elaborately designed with its "multifork" structure to learn multilevel representations of remote sensing images including both local details and global environmental priors. Experimental results on a public remote sensing data set (UC Merced) demonstrate an overall improvement of both accuracy and visual performance over several state-of-the-art algorithms.

TI  - Azimuth Ambiguities Removal in Littoral Zones Based on Multi-Temporal SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most important techniques for ocean monitoring. Azimuth ambiguities are a real problem in SAR images today, which can cause performance degradation in SAR ocean applications. In particular, littoral zones can be strongly affected by land-based sources, whereas they are usually regions of interest (ROI). Given the presence of complexity and diversity in littoral zones, azimuth ambiguities removal is a tough problem. As SAR sensors can have a repeat cycle, multi-temporal SAR images provide new insight into this problem. A method for azimuth ambiguities removal in littoral zones based on multi-temporal SAR images is proposed in this paper. The proposed processing chain includes co-registration, local correlation, binarization, masking, and restoration steps. It is designed to remove azimuth ambiguities caused by fixed land-based sources. The idea underlying the proposed method is that sea surface is dynamic, whereas azimuth ambiguities caused by land-based sources are constant. Thus, the temporal consistence of azimuth ambiguities is higher than sea clutter. It opens up the possibilities to use multi-temporal SAR data to remove azimuth ambiguities. The design of the method and the experimental procedure are based on images from the Sentinel data hub of Europe Space Agency (ESA). Both Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Stripmap (SM) mode images are taken into account to validate the proposed method. This paper also presents two RGB composition methods for better azimuth ambiguities visualization. Experimental results show that the proposed method can remove azimuth ambiguities in littoral zones effectively.

TI  - Internal and International Mobility as Adaptation to Climatic Variability in Contemporary Mexico: Evidence from the Integration of Census and Satellite Data
T2  - POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Migration provides a strategy for rural Mexican households to cope with, or adapt to, weather events and climatic variability. Yet prior studies on environmental migration in this context have not examined the differences between choices of internal (domestic) or international movement. In addition, much of the prior work relied on very coarse spatial scales to operationalise the environmental variables such as rainfall patterns. To overcome these limitations, we use fine-grain rainfall estimates derived from NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite. The rainfall estimates are combined with population and agricultural census information to examine associations between environmental changes and municipal rates of internal and international migration during 2005-2010. Our findings suggest that municipal-level rainfall deficits relative to historical levels are an important predictor of both international and internal migration, especially in municipalities with predominantly rainfed agriculture. Although our findings do not contradict results of prior studies using coarse spatial resolution, they offer clearer evidence and a more spatially nuanced examination of migration as related to social and environmental vulnerability.

TI  - A likelihood-based spatial statistical transformation model (LBSSTM) of regional economic development using DMSP/OLS time-series nighttime light imagery
T2  - SPATIAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In a regional economy, the central city of a metropolitan area has a radiative effect and an accumulative effect on its surrounding cities. Considering the limitations of traditional data sources (e.g., its subjectivity) and the advantages of nighttime light data, including its objectivity, availability and cyclicity, this paper proposes a likelihood spatial statistical transformation model (LBSSTM) to invert for the gross domestic product (GDP) of the surrounding cities, using time series of Sum of Lights (SOL) data covering the central city and taking advantage of the economic and spatial association between the central city and the surrounding cities within a metropolitan area and the correlation between SOL and GDP. The Wuhan Metropolitan Area is chosen to verify the model using time series analysis and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed LBSSTM. The prediction accuracy of our model is verified by cross-validation using data from 1998, 2004 and 2011, based on the 3 sigma rule. This model can quantitatively express the agglomeration and diffusion effect of the central city and reveal the spatial pattern of this effect. The results of this work are potentially useful in making spatiotemporal economic projections and filling in missing data from some regions, as well as gaining a deeper quantitative and spatio-temporal understanding of the laws underlying regional economic development.

TI  - Relationship between Gut Microbiota and Type 2 Diabetic Erectile Dysfunction in Sprague-Dawley Rats
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and type 2 diabetic erectile dysfunction (T2DED), we analyzed the characteristics of gut microbiota in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with T2DED. Thirty-five SD rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group (n=15) with normal diet, and experimental group (n=20) with construction of T2D model. Faecal and serum samples were collected at 2nd and 8th week after establishment of T2D model, respectively. Faecal samples were used for analysis of gut microbiota, and serum samples for detection of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and inflammatory factors like interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-10, and monocyte chemoattractantprotein-1 (MCP-1). The main compositions of gut microbiota were Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes at the phylum level, and Oscillospira, Allobaculum, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, SMB53, Prevotella, Coprococcus, Sutterella and Blautia at the genus level with relatively higher abundance in all SD rats. The relative abundance of Enterococcus, Corynebacterium, Aerococcus, Facklamia (opportunistic pathogens in most case) increased, and that of Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Anaerotruncus (beneficial bacteria) decreased in T2DED group as compared with that at 2nd week after establishment of T2D model (T2D2 group). The serum contents of TMAO, LPS, IL-1, IL-2, IL-10 and MCP-1 in T2DED group were significantly higher than those in control group. The gut microbiota of T2DED rats was inhibited. The gut microbiota of T2DED rats had changed, as the relative abundance of beneficial bacterium was decreased while that of opportunistic pathogens was increased. The variations of gut microbiota might lead to inflammation and prompt the emergence of erectile dysfunction in the rats with T2D. TMAO might play an important role in the formation of T2DED.

TI  - Recovering low quality MODIS-Terra data over highly turbid waters through noise reduction and regional vicarious calibration adjustment: A case study in Taihu Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of water quality in turbid coastal and inland waters requires accurate atmospheric correction, which is technically challenging. While previous efforts have shown the advantage of using the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands instead of near-infrared (NIR) bands for atmospheric correction, such an approach could only be applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite (MODISA). This is because MODIS data from the Terra satellite (MODIST) contain more noise and other sensor artifacts, thus this sensor has been generally regarded by the ocean color research community as not being able to provide science quality data. Here, we address this technical challenge through noise reduction and regional vicarious calibration adjustment, and demonstrate preliminary success using turbid Taihu Lake as an example. The noise in the three SWIR bands was evaluated first, and then reduced through a noise reduction method. The SWIR bands were adjusted over open-ocean waters using the well-calibrated NIR ocean bands (1-km resolution) and radiative transfer, which were then used to adjust the land bands (250-m and 500-m resolution) in the visible and NIR over turbid waters where concurrent field-measured reflectance spectra are available. Of all three combinations of SWIR bands, the combination of 1240 and 1640-nm bands was found to perform the best, showing significantly improved retrieval accuracy for Taihu Lake, leading to recovery of low-quality MODIST data to higher-quality data comparable to MODISA, and thus doubling valid data coverage. Testing of this approach on another highly turbid lake (Chaohu Lake, China) showed similar results. While the general application of this approach to turbid lakes still needs to be tested as local tuning of the calibration coefficients may be required, these results suggest that MODIST may be used as effectively as MODISA for monitoring Taihu Lake water quality.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Remote Sensing and Modeling to Assess an Anomalously High Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Event during Summer 2015 in the South Central Red Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An anomalously high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) event (>2 mg/m(3)) during June 2015 in the South Central Red Sea (17.5 degrees to 22 degrees N, 37 degrees to 42 degrees E) was observed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. This differs from the low Chl-a values (<0.5 mg/m(3)) usually encountered over the same region during summertime. To assess this anomaly and possible causes, we used a wide range of oceanographical and meteorological datasets, including Chl-a concentrations, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), mixed layer depth (MLD), ocean current velocity and aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from different sensors and models. Findings confirmed this anomalous behavior in the spatial domain using Hovmoller data analysis techniques, while a time series analysis addressed monthly and daily variability. Our analysis suggests that a combination of factors controlling nutrient supply contributed to the anomalous phytoplankton growth. These factors include horizontal transfer of upwelling water through eddy circulation and possible mineral fertilization from atmospheric dust deposition. Coral reefs might have provided extra nutrient supply, yet this is out of the scope of our analysis. We thought that dust deposition from a coastal dust jet event in late June, coinciding with the phytoplankton blooms in the area under investigation, might have also contributed as shown by our AOD findings. However, a lag cross correlation showed a two-month lag between strong dust outbreak and the high Chl-a anomaly. The high Chl-a concentration at the edge of the eddy emphasizes the importance of horizontal advection in fertilizing oligotrophic (nutrient poor) Red Sea waters.

TI  - Estimating Subpixel Surface Heat Fluxes through Applying Temperature-Sharpening Methods to MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using high-resolution satellite data to perform routine (i.e., daily to weekly) monitoring of surface evapotranspiration, evapotranspiration (ET) (or LE, i.e., latent heat flux) has not been feasible because of the low frequency of satellite coverage over regions of interest (i.e., approximately every two weeks). Cloud cover further reduces the number of useable observations, and the utility of these data for routine ET or LE monitoring is limited. Moderate-resolution satellite imagery is available multiple times per day; however, the spatial resolution of these data is too coarse to enable the estimation of ET from individual agricultural fields or variations in ET or LE. The objective of this study is to combine high-resolution satellite data collected in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands with data from the MODIS thermal-infrared (TIR) bands to estimate subpixel surface LE. Two temperature-sharpening methods, the disaggregation procedure for radiometric surface temperature (DisTrad) and the geographically-weighted regression (GWR)-based downscaling algorithm, were used to obtain accurate subpixel land surface temperature (LST) within the Zhangye oasis in China, where the surface is heterogeneous. The downscaled LSTs were validated using observations collected during the HiWATER-MUSOEXE (Multi-Scale Observation Experiment on Evapotranspiration) project. In addition, a remote sensing-based energy balance model was used to compare subpixel MODIS LST-based turbulent heat fluxes estimates with those obtained using the two LST downscaling approaches. The footprint validation results showed that the direct use of the MODIS LST approach does not consider LST heterogeneity at all, leading to significant errors (i.e., the root mean square error is 73.15 W.m(-2)) in LE, whereas the errors in the LE estimates obtained using DisTrad and GWR were 45.84 W.m(-2) and 47.38 W.m(-2), respectively. Furthermore, additional analysis showed that the ability of DisTrad and GWR to capture subpixel LST variations depends on the value of Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and the surface type within the flux contribution source area.

TI  - Monitoring snow cover variability (2000-2014) in the Hengduan Mountains based on cloud-removed MODIS products with an adaptive spatio-temporal weighted method
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the variability of snow cover is necessary and meaningful because snow cover is closely connected with climate and ecological change. In this work, 500 m resolution MODIS daily snow cover products from 2000 to 2014 were adopted to analyze the status in Hengduan Mountains. In order to solve the spatial discontinuity caused by clouds in the products, we propose an adaptive spatio-temporal weighted method (ASTWM), which is based on the initial result of a Terra and Aqua combination. This novel method simultaneously considers the temporal and spatial correlations of the snow cover. The simulated experiments indicate that ASTWM removes clouds completely, with a robust overall accuracy (OA) of above 93% under different cloud fractions, The spatio-temporal variability of snow cover in the Hengduan Mountains was investigated with two indices: snow cover days (SCD) and snow fraction. The results reveal that the annual SCD gradually increases and the coefficient of variation (CV) decreases with elevation. The pixel-wise trends of SCD first rise and then drop in most areas. Moreover, intense intra-annual variability of the snow fraction occurs from October to March, during which time there is abundant snow cover. The inter-annual variability, which mainly occurs in high elevation areas, shows an increasing trend before 2004/2005 and a decreasing trend after 2004/2005. In addition, the snow fraction responds to the two climate factors of air temperature and precipitation. For the intra-annual variability, when the air temperature and precipitation decrease, the snow cover increases. Besides, precipitation plays a more important role in the inter-annual variability of snow cover than temperature. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ionospheric electron heating associated with pulsating auroras: A Swarm survey and model simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we report a study on the plasma signatures (electron temperature, plasma density, and field-aligned current) of patchy pulsating auroras in the upper F region ionosphere using Swarm satellite data. Via a survey of 38 patch crossing events, we repeatedly identify a strong electron temperature enhancement associated with the pulsating aurora. On average, the electron temperature at Swarm satellite altitudes (similar to 460 km) increases from similar to 2200 K at subauroral latitudes to a peak of similar to 3000 K within the pulsating auroral patch. This indicates that pulsating auroras may act as an important heating source for the nightside ionosphere. On the other hand, no well-defined trend of plasma density variations associated with pulsating auroras is identified at Swarm altitudes. The field-aligned currents within the pulsating aurora patch are mostly upward, with mean magnitudes on order of similar to 1 mu A/m(2). We then perform a numerical simulation to explore the potential mechanisms underlying the strong electron heating associated with the pulsating aurora. Via simulations we find that to account for the realistic electron temperature observation in a major portion of our events, pulsating auroras are likely accompanied by substantial magnetospheric heat fluxes around the order of similar to 10(10) eV/cm(2). We propose that such magnetospheric heat fluxes may be pertinent to one long-hypothesized feature of pulsating auroras, namely, the coexistence of an enhanced low-energy plasma population in magnetic flux tubes threading the pulsating aurora, in addition to the energetic electron precipitation. Via a Swarm survey we repeatedly find a strong electron temperature enhancement associated with the pulsating aurora The field-aligned currents within pulsating auroras are moderately upward, with mean magnitudes on the order of similar to 1e-6 A/m(2) To explain the observed electron heating, pulsating auroras are likely accompanied by magnetospheric heat fluxes around similar to 1E+10 eV/cm(2)/s.

TI  - Long-term spatial and temporal variations of vegetative drought based on vegetation condition index in China
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information concerning the spatial and temporal characteristics of vegetative drought is essential for decision-making and for many environmental and agricultural applications. This study presents a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of vegetative drought conditions that used the vegetation condition index (VCI) data product obtained from NOAA/AVHRR (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) to reveal the vegetative drought patterns across China from 1981 to 2015. Considering the characteristics of VCI as drought indicators, multiple methods were designed for these analyses, including drought frequency analysis, trend analysis, anomaly index analysis, and Mann-Kendall testing. The results show that China is a country with high vegetative drought frequency, but that most areas experienced only slight or moderate periods of drought. In addition, drought has obvious seasonal and geographical differences and occurs with greater frequencies in regions that are highly affected by monsoons such as the northern and southern regions-particularly in the spring and autumn. In contrast, vegetative drought frequencies in regions less affected by monsoons such as the Tibetan Plateau and the northwestern regions were much lower except in northern Sinkiang, eastern Inner Mongolia, and southern Tibet. During 1981-2015, the VCI had an increasing trend in most areas of China (except in the southern region, where it decreased), indicating a reduced frequency of vegetative drought throughout the country. Moreover, the trend was wavelike rather than a one-way change and could be divided into four phases: (1) a slowly increasing phase from 1981 to 1990, (2) an intensively fluctuating phase from 1991 to 2000, (3) a steadily increasing phase from 2001 to 2010, and (4) a slowly decreasing phase after 2010. Mann-Kendall analysis further suggested that upward trends of the VCI were more evident in spring and autumn than in summer and that both trends mutated in 1997. Specifically, the trend reached the 0.05 level of significance in the spring.

TI  - Satellite Radiance Data Assimilation within the Hourly Updated Rapid Refresh
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilation of satellite radiance data in limited-area, rapidly updating weather model/assimilation systems poses unique challenges compared to those for global model systems. Principal among these is the severe data restriction posed by the short data cutoff time. Also, the limited extent of the model domain reduces the spatial extent of satellite data coverage and the lower model top of regional models reduces the spectral usage of radiance data especially for infrared data. These three factors impact the quality of the feedback to the bias correction procedures, making the procedures potentially less effective. Within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Rapid Refresh (RAP) hourly updating prediction system, satellite radiance data are assimilated using the standard procedures within the Grid-point Statistical Interpolation (GSI) analysis package. Experiments for optimizing the operational implementation of radiance data into RAP and for improving benefits of radiance data have been performed. The radiance data impact for short-range forecasts has been documented to be consistent and statistically significantly positive in systematic RAP retrospective runs using real-time datasets. The radiance data impact has also been compared with conventional observation datasets within RAP. The configuration for RAP satellite radiance assimilation evaluated here is that implemented at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in August 2016.

TI  - Heterogeneity of systolic dysfunction in patients with severe aortic stenosis and preserved ejection fraction
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aim: Left ventricular (LV) systolic strain has been shown to be an early marker of LV dysfunction in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) despite preserved ejection fraction (EF). Echocardiography has provided useful data on regional LV strain patterns, but is not as sensitive as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). No prior studies have used MRI-based strain analysis to characterize regional three-dimensional strain in patients with severe AS.Methods: Twelve patients with severe AS and preserved EF underwent MRI-based multiparametric strain analysis. Circumferential and longitudinal strain values were calculated at individual points throughout the LV and analyzed in 12 discrete regions. Strain values were compared to a database of normal controls.Results: Compared to control patients, circumferential strain in AS patients was significantly reduced at the base (P = 0.002), mid (P = 0.042), and inferior walls (P < 0.001). Longitudinal strain was significantly reduced at the base (P < 0.001), mid (P < 0.001), anterior (P < 0.001), and septal (P < 0.001) walls. Among patients with AS, there was heterogeneity in the location and severity of abnormalities in circumferential and longitudinal strains despite the presence of a preserved EF and lack of prior myocardial infarction.Conclusions: LV systolic strain is significantly impaired in patients with AS and preserved EF compared to healthy volunteers. Abnormalities in circumferential and longitudinal strains were heterogeneously distributed across the LV of patients with AS, allowing us to identify sentinel regions that may reflect the earliest signs of developing LV dysfunction.

TI  - Lymph node status in different molecular subtype of breast cancer: triple negative tumours are more likely lymph node negative
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: To investigate the association between different molecular subtype (MST) and the axillary lymph nodal (ALN) status.Materials and Methods: A total of 528 female patients with primary breast cancer were collected. Survival estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.Results: Triple negative and Luminal A breast cancers were more frequently node-negative (N0) when compared to Luminal B and Her-2 positive cancers (77.4% and 73.4% vs. 45.3% and 40.0%, respectively; P < 0.0001). We observed a clearly significant difference among ALN status in patients with Her-2 positive (P = 0.001) and Luminal B (P < 0.0001) breast cancer. While no significant prognostic diffreence among different LN status was detected in the Triple negative (P = 0.070) and Luminal A subtype (P = 0.660). On the other hand, we detected no prognostic diffreence among different MST in N1 and N3 subgroups (P = 0.569 and P = 0.484, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that lymph node status (P < 0.01), molecular subtype (P < 0.01), and tumor size (P < 0.01) were significantly and independently prognostic factors. The c-index of the prognosis nomogram for recurrence prediction was 0.70.Conclusion: Triple negative breast cancer is not associated more frequently with a higher number of involved nodes. The prognosis nomogram can predict the probability of recurrence patients within 3 or 5 years.

TI  - A New Urban Index for Expressing Inner-City Patterns Based on MODIS LST and EVI Regulated DMSP/OLS NTL
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid pace of urban expansion, comprehensively understanding urban spatial patterns, built environments, green-spaces distributions, demographic distributions, and economic activities becomes more meaningful. Night Time Lights (NTL) images acquired through the Operational Linescan System of the US Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP/OLS NTL) have long been utilized to monitor urban areas and their expansion characteristics since this system detects variation in NTL emissions. However, the pixel saturation phenomenon leads to a serious limitation in mapping luminance variations in urban zones with nighttime illumination levels that approach or exceed the pixel saturation limits of OLS sensors. Consequently, we propose an NTL-based city index that utilizes the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) images to regulate and compensate for desaturation on NTL images acquired from corresponding urban areas. The regulated results achieve good performance in differentiating central business districts (CBDs), airports, and urban green spaces. Consequently, these derived imageries could effectively convey the structural details of urban cores. In addition, compared with the Vegetation Adjusted NTL Urban Index (VANUI), LST-and-EVI-regulated-NTL-city index (LERNCI) reveals superior capability in delineating the spatial structures of selected metropolis areas across the world, especially in the large cities of developing countries. The currently available results indicate that LERNCI corresponds better to city spatial patterns. Moreover, LERNCI displays a remarkably better "goodness-of-fit" correspondence with both the Version 1 Nighttime Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band Composite (NPP/VIIRS DNB) data and the WorldPop population-density data compared with the VANUI imageries. Thus, LERNCI can act as a helpful indicator for differentiating and classifying regional economic activities, population aggregations, and energy-consumption and city-expansion patterns. LERNCI can also serve as a valuable auxiliary reference for decision-making processes that concern subjects such as urban planning and easing the central functions of metropolis.

TI  - Electron dropout echoes induced by interplanetary shock: A statistical study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - "Electron dropout echo" as indicated by repeated moderate dropout and recovery signatures of the flux of energetic electron in the outer radiation belt region has been investigated systematically. The electron moderate dropout and its echoes are usually found for higher-energy (>300 keV) channel fluxes, whereas the flux enhancements are obvious for lower energy electrons simultaneously after the interplanetary shock arrives at the Earth's geosynchronous orbit. The electron dropout echo events are found to be usually associated with the interplanetary shocks arrival. The 104 dropout echo events have been found from 215 interplanetary shock events from 1998 to 2007 based on the Los Alamos National Laboratory satellite data. In analogy to substorm injections, these 104 events could be naturally divided into two categories: dispersionless (49 events) or dispersive (55 events) according to the energy dispersion of the initial dropout. It is found that locations of dispersionless events are distributed mainly in the duskside magnetosphere. Further, the obtained locations derived from dispersive events with the time-of-flight technique of the initial dropout regions are mainly located at the duskside as well. Statistical studies have shown that the effect of shock normal, interplanetary magnetic field B-z and solar wind dynamic pressure may be insignificant to these electron dropout events. We suggest that the similar to 1 min electric field impulse induced by the interplanetary shock produces a more pronounced inward migration of electrons at the duskside, resulting in the observed duskside moderate dropout of electron flux and its consequent echoes.

TI  - Spring green-up date derived from GIMMS3g and SPOT-VGT NDVI of winter wheat cropland in the North China Plain
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite temporal resolution affects the fitting accuracy of vegetation growth curves. However, there are few studies that evaluate the impact of different satellite data (including temporal resolution and time series change) on spring green-up date (GUD) extraction. In this study, four GUD algorithms and two different temporal resolution satellite data (GIMMS3g during 1982-2013 and SPOT-VGT during 1999-2013) were used to investigate winter wheat GUD in the North China Plain. Four GUD algorithms included logistic-NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), logistic-cumNDVI (cumulative NDVI), polynomial-NDVI and polynomial-cumNDVI algorithms. All algorithms and data were first regrouped into eight controlled cases. At site scale, we evaluated the performance of each case using correlation coefficient (r), bias and root mean square error (RMSE). We further compared spatial patterns and inter-annual trends of GUD inferred from different algorithms, and then analyzed the difference between GIMMS3g-based GUD and SPOT-VGT-based GUD. Our results showed that all satellite-based GUD were correlated with observations with r ranging from 0.32 to 0.57 (p < 0.01). SPOT-VGT-based GUD generally had better correlations with observed GUD than those of GIMMS3g. Spatially, SPOT-VGT-based GUD performed more reasonable spatial distributions. Inter-annual regional averaged satellite-based GUD presented overall advanced trends during 1982-2013 (0.3-2.0 days/decade) while delayed trends were observed during 1999-2013 (1.7-7.4 days/decade for GIMMS3g and 3.8-7.4 days/decade for SPOTVGT). However, their significance levels were highly dependent on the data and algorithms used. Our findings suggest cautions on previous results of inter-annual variability of phenology from a single data/method. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

TI  - HEAVY METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN FEMALE WILD MINK (<i>NEOVISON VISON</i>) IN SWEDEN: SOURCES OF VARIATION AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH INTERNAL ORGAN WEIGHTS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The American mink is an invasive species in Sweden, and it is legally hunted all year. Therefore, the mink is well suited as a sentinel species for environmental monitoring. In the present study female mink (n = 91) from 6 different areas in Sweden were analyzed for the concentrations of silver, cadmium, mercury and lead in liver tissue using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The wet concentrations in liver tissue were 42.6 +/- 52.7 ng/g for silver, 99.5 +/- 100 ng/g for cadmium, 652 +/- 537 ng/g formercury, and 196 +/- 401 ng/g for lead (expressed as mean + standard deviation). There were associations between the sample area and the concentrations of silver, lead, and mercury. The concentrations of lead and cadmium varied with season of capture and lead, cadmium, and mercury were positively associated with increasing age. Relative liver weight was positively associated with concentrations of mercury and negatively associated with lead and cadmium. Relative kidney weight was negatively associated with lead concentrations. In summary, it is of importance to take age and season of capture into account when assessing levels of heavy metals in wild mink. Also, liver and kidneys seem to be potential targets for heavy metal toxicity in wild female mink in Sweden. (C) 2016 The Authors.
