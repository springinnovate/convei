AB  - Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) has three micro satellites in orbit: LAPAN-A1/TUBSAT, LAPAN-A2/ORARI, and LAPAN-A3/IPB satellites. To operate these satellites, LAPAN has five ground stations in Indonesia and ground station in Spitsbergen, Norway. The ground station in Indonesia consists of ground station in Rumpin and Rancabungur (Bogor, West Java), Bukittinggi (West Sumatra), Parepare (South Sulawesi) and Biak (Papua). These ground stations operate daily to support satellite operations, namely Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) and satellite data acquisition. The information showing the performance of the TT&C ground station is needed as a reference in carrying out periodic maintenance of the ground stations. The performance of TT&C ground station can be calculated from the ratio of success and failure in sending commands and receiving telemetry data from satellites. To accommodate these data necessities, an information system with the ability to measure the performance of the TT&C ground station is needed. This paper describes the results of the development of a web-based TT&C performance information system for ground stations supporting LAPAN satellite operations. This information system can work well, successfully tested to calculate TT&C ground station performance on July 2021, and has four main views which have dashboard page, Pass data page, Command data page, and summary page of search result by satellite, ground station, and time including chart with three types of charts, namely three graphs with polar, geo-map, and two axes which are x as azimuth and y as elevation.

TI  - Public health precautions for preventing malaria using environmental data

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Geospatial Informatics XI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Considering the public health impact of a global pandemic, the reliance on data to understand disease outbreak is important now more than ever. Malaria is the most common mosquito-transmitted disease endemic to certain regions, leading to millions of serious illnesses and deaths each year. Because mosquito vectors are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity, it is possible to map areas currently or imminently at high risk for disease outbreaks using satellite remote sensing. In this paper the authors propose the development of an operational geospatial system for malaria early warning. This can be done by bringing together geographic information system (GIS) tools, artificial neural networks (ANN) for efficient pattern recognition, the best available ground-based environmental data such as epidemiological and vector ecology data, and current satellite remote sensing capabilities.The authors use Vegetation Health Indices (VHI) derived from visible and infrared radiances measured by satellite-mounted Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) and available weekly at 4-km resolution as one predictor of malaria risk in Bangladesh. As a study area, we focus on Bangladesh where malaria is a serious public health threat. The technology developed will, however, be largely portable to other countries in the world and applicable to other disease threats. A malaria early warning system will be a boon to international public health, enabling resources to be focused where they will do the most good for stopping pandemics, and will be an invaluable decision support tool for national security assessment and potential troop deployment in regions susceptible to disease outbreaks.

AB  - Rice is a commodity of rice-producing food crops that plays a vital role in the Indonesian economy. For anticipating increased food needs, accurate information about the amount of harvest becomes very important. Information on the number of harvests, one of which can be known by estimating rice productivity. Rice productivity estimation can be monitored by remote sensing. This study used a remote sensing approach by employing satellite imagery from Sentinel-2A sensors to generate vegetation index. This study used NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to determine rice plants' age and estimate rice productivity. This study analyzes rice productivity and the spatial distribution of rice crop productivity in the Nagrak Sub-district, Sukabumi Regency. The results of this study are Sentinel 2-A and algorithm could provide rice productivity estimation and know the range of the largest rice productivity is greater than 6 ton per hectare, which is widely spread at an altitude of 500 -1000 meter above sea level and a slope of 8 to 15 percent, and a distance of 0 - 150 meters from the river.

TI  - Forecasting land-use changes in Mashhad Metropolitan area using Cellular Automata and Markov chain model for 2016-2030
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to simulate land-use and land cover (LULC) changes in Mashhad metropolitan area. These changes were measured for 2016-2020 and forecast for 2020-2030. To this end, Sentinel-2A satellite imagery, Cellular Automata (CA), and the Markov chain model in ArcGIS and TerrSet software were used. LULC was classified into seven groups, using maximum likelihood estimation, KAPPA coefficient, and ROC curve. According to the study results, the area is 105243.6 hectares, and there are 177 rural settlements (2016). During the period 2016-2020 in the study area, 7845 hectares of LULC changes occurred. Most of the land-use increase is associated with barren lands with 7174 hectares (91.45%) and built-up with 436.32 hectares (5.56%). In the same period, the highest decrease in land-use is related to mass and light vegetation with 1335 hectares (17.01%) and 5241 hectares (66.81%), respectively. Predicting LULC change for the period 2020-2030 using the CA Markov chain model showed that the land-use change would occur in the study area of 2626.2 hectares. Three land uses with positive changes (barren lands 5.5%, built lands 13.5% and mountainous lands 2.32%) and four cases (light vegetation-5.70%, dense vegetation -23.35%, Road 0.34%, and water level (-23.40%) will face negative changes. To confirm these classifications' accuracy, the KAPPA coefficient = 0.58 and the area under the curve =0.61 in the ROC curve were calculated. Spatial-temporal conversion in land-use from agriculture and vegetation to the barren land and built-up will occur mostly in the north and east of the city. These findings provide a basis to support decision-making and planning systems for sustainable land-use development.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Image Scene Classification: A Comparison between Sen2Cor and a Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the continuous increase in the global population, the food manufacturers are advocated to either intensify the use of cropland or expand the farmland, making land cover and land usage dynamics mapping vital in the area of remote sensing. In this regard, identifying and classifying a high-resolution satellite imagery scene is a prime challenge. Several approaches have been proposed either by using static rule-based thresholds (with limitation of diversity) or neural network (with data-dependent limitations). This paper adopts the inductive approach to learning from surface reflectances. A manually labeled Sentinel-2 dataset was used to build a Machine Learning (ML) model for scene classification, distinguishing six classes (Water, Shadow, Cirrus, Cloud, Snow, and Other). This models was accessed and further compared to the European Space Agency (ESA) Sen2Cor package. The proposed ML model presents a Micro-F1 value of 0.84, a considerable improvement when compared to the Sen2Cor corresponding performance of 0.59. Focusing on the problem of optical satellite image scene classification, the main research contributions of this paper are: (a) an extended manually labeled Sentinel-2 database adding surface reflectance values to an existing dataset; (b) an ensemble-based and a Neural-Network-based ML models; (c) an evaluation of model sensitivity, biasness, and diverse ability in classifying multiple classes over different geographic Sentinel-2 imagery, and finally, (d) the benchmarking of the ML approach against the Sen2Cor package.

TI  - Assessment of channel shifting of Karnali Megafan in Nepal using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - River flow exhibits morphological changes over time. The shifting of river channels is a common natural phenomenon which often poses risk to life and property. Channel shifting is mostly associated with weak geology, extreme floods, and land cover alterations. Here we assess the changing morphology of the largest depositional landform in Nepal, called the Karnali Megafan, over the period of 1977-2013. We applied geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing techniques to analyse the spatiotemporal changes in the Karnali Megafan. We obtained historical channel information from Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TRIS) satellite image, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Thematic Mapper (TM) and Multispectral Scanner (MSS) for years 1977, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2013. The channel shifting depicts a generally increasing trend in the right branch while the trend is less prominent in the left branch. We find that the extreme rainfall and flooding contribute to channel shifting in the Karnali Megafan. This study identifies the channel shifting spatiotemporal trends along the Karnali Megafan and are of practical use in developing and implementing appropriate river management strategies.

CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Expansion of built-up land can lead to changes in land use and land cover (LULC), especially in urban areas. Expansion of built up land can occur due to an increase in population and the level of urbanization. Urbanization and changes in LULC have led to a substantial increase in the urban population due to migration, which has brought many acute problems in the urban environmental system. This study aims to map LULC conditions in 2008, 2013, and 2018 and to analyze the spatial pattern of urban growth from 2008 to 2018. The maximum likelihood method was used to classify LULC based on Landsat imagery and to analyze urban growth spatial patterns. Spatial analysis was carried out by dividing the four locations into 4 (four) quadrants adjusted to the cardinal directions. From the analysis conducted, the accuracy of the research in 2008 was 88%, in 2013 was 86%, and in 2018 was 88%. From this study, the urban growth of the city in Purwokerto spreads in all directions, but urban growth is more dominated in quadrant I or the northeast direction. Quadrant 1 has a strong pull from Purbalingga Regency and is traversed by the main connecting road between districts and provinces to the north and east so that it can cause expansion of built-up land in quadrant 1. The results of this study can be used as recommendations in making urban spatial plans in Purwokerto City.

AB  - The rice monitoring based on Sentinel-2 (SC-S2) has been developed for over nine months. It has been observed as the first and only system which generate rice growth stages maps in 10 m spatial resolution using machine learning in Indonesia. However, the SC-S2 use Support Vector Machine to separate the rice growth stages, which may have poor performances. The objective of this study is to investigate the performance of other classifiers to increase the performance of SC-S2. We used survey data from the field campaign in 2018 and synchronized with Sentinel-2 bands. The model dataset was trained using 61 machine learning algorithms to create 61 rice growth stages models. The models were applied to the Sentinel-2 image of part of Indramayu area. The accuracy, computational time and visual inspection score were collected, and the final score was calculated. The results are the highest final score is Shrinkage Discriminant Analysis, with overall accuracy 88.1% (p<0.001) and the average accuracy of all classifiers is 76.2% (p<0.05). The implication of this study is to propose some changes in the classification process into the SC-S2 for increasing the overall performance, which will provide better information for agricultural policymakers.

AB  - Sustainability of rice production is a critical issue to ensure food security and needs to be monitored on time. Therefore, the online monitoring system using Sentinel-2 has been introduced to monitor rice fields in Indonesia. However, the system needs to be coupled with precipitation to improve user usage. In this study, the spatial correlation using Pearson's correlation analysis and linear regression between the floods and the vegetative stages area of the rice monitoring maps and the precipitation data from CHIRPS was investigated. The analysis was conducted with the two datasets with 439 regencies in Indonesia on a monthly basis from December 2019 until May 2020. The result shows that 96 regencies have a highly positive correlation (r>0.6, p>0.05, n=6) with 57 regencies have a high R-2 (R-2>0.6). Also, there are 83 regencies has a profoundly negative correlation (r=-0.6, p<0.05, n=6) with 32 regencies with high R-2 (R-2>0.6), On the other hand, there are 79 regencies have medium R-2 (0.4=R-2<0.6), and 271 regencies have the lowest R-2 value (R-2=0.4). These early-stage results show an opportunity to combine two datasets to produce early warning systems or recommended cropping calendar in a timely and accurate manner to the stakeholders or the farmers.

AB  - Monitoring rice growth stages is important for maintaining food security, especially from flood and drought, which is more frequent due to climate change. The Sentinel-2 Rice Growth Stages (S-2 RGS) monitoring project from the Ministry of Agriculture is one of the ongoing monitoring systems (http://katam.litbang.pertanian.go.id/sc). However, S-2 RGS has difficulty providing a cloud-free project, especially in the wet season. Sentinel-1 (S-1) has recently been used to identify mapping rice area due to better spatial resolution than the MODIS dataset. This study focuses on mapping the vegetative stage using a multi-look of S-1 dataset with a deep learning method. Deep learning has been proven to be one of the classification methods on non-parametric approaches that give high accuracy, high computation speed, and less memory usage. The method of this study is as follows: First, the S-1 images downloaded from Google Earth Engine, which has been preprocessed accordingly. Secondly, the rice growth stages condition of Indramayu Regency was extracted from S-2 RGS using random sampling on 16 May 2020. Next step, both multilook S-1 (Ascending, Descending). Third, the values of RGS was reclassified from four classes (Bare land, Vegetative, Reproductive, and Ripening) into two class (vegetative and non-vegetative). Finally, the vegetative stage was modeled from four predictors (DESC-VH, DESC-VV, ASC-VH, ASC-VV) using deep learning using two layers with a training dataset (n=9,319). The accuracy of the model is 73.6% (n=3,994). This result shows that deep learning can predict a vegetative stage map with high accuracy where it can fill a cloudy area in the RGS-2 system to provide a cloud-free rice growth stages map in near real-time.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Nilgiri Biosphere, being one of the critical catchments, a small agricultural watershed of Udhagamandalam has been analysed to show the need to improve the agriculture by reducing the soil erosion. For this study, the land use and land cover classification was undertaken using Landsat images to highlight the changes that have occurred between 1981 and 2019. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) method and the Geographic Information System (GIS) was used in this study to determine the soil erosion vulnerability of Sillahalla watershed in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamilnadu. This study will help to promote the economic development of the watershed with proper agricultural planning and erosion management. This study focuses on the estimation of the average annual soil loss and to classify the spatial distribution of the soil loss as a map with the RUSLE method and GIS. To estimate the average annual soil loss of the study area, GIS layers of the RUSLE factors like rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), slope length and steepness (LS), cover management (C) and conservation practice (P) were computed in a raster data format. The total soil loss and average annual soil loss of the study area for 1981-1990,1991-2000, 2001-2010, 2011-2019 were found to be 0.2, 0.254, 0.3, 0.35 million t/year and 31.33, 37.78, 46.7, 51.89 t/ha/year, respectively. The soil erosion rate is classified into different classes as per the FAO guidelines and this severity classification map was prepared to identify the vulnerable areas.

TI  - Genetic Variants in Immune Related Genes as Predictors of Responsiveness to BCG Immunotherapy in Metastatic Melanoma Patients
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary: The study objective was to determine if an SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)-based immune multi-gene panel has the ability to predict adjuvant BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) immunotherapy responsiveness post-tumor resection in AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stages III and IV metastatic melanoma patients. A pilot study followed by further verification and control melanoma patient cohorts involving three phase III multicenter clinical trials was used to verify if an immune gene SNP panel could identify if adjuvant BCG therapy correlates with disease outcomes. We found a specific immune gene SNP panel that could identify which patients would respond to adjuvant BCG immunotherapy, but it was not applicable in the control non-immunotherapy treated patients. These studies provide evidence that SNP immune-gene assessment has utility in predicting melanoma patient's immunotherapy responses to adjuvant BCG immunotherapy.Adjuvant immunotherapy in melanoma patients improves clinical outcomes. However, success is unpredictable due to inherited heterogeneity of immune responses. Inherent immune genes associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may influence anti-tumor immune responses. We assessed the predictive ability of 26 immune-gene SNPs genomic panels for a clinical response to adjuvant BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) immunotherapy, using melanoma patient cohorts derived from three phase III multicenter clinical trials: AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage IV patients given adjuvant BCG (pilot cohort; n = 92), AJCC stage III patients given adjuvant BCG (verification cohort; n = 269), and AJCC stage III patients that are sentinel lymph node (SLN) positive receiving no immunotherapy (control cohort; n = 80). The SNP panel analysis demonstrated that the responder patient group had an improved disease-free survival (DFS) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.84, 95% CI 1.09-3.13, p = 0.021) in the pilot cohort. In the verification cohort, an improved overall survival (OS) (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.07-2.67, p = 0.025) was observed. No significant differences of SNPs were observed in DFS or OS in the control patient cohort. This study demonstrates that SNP immune genes can be utilized as a predictive tool for identifying melanoma patients that are inherently responsive to BCG and potentially other immunotherapies in the future.

TI  - Monitoring the extreme drought in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in 2019 from GRACE-FO satellites
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the summer and autumn of 2019. an extreme drought lasting 0.5 year in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River had a major impact on local agricultural production and the ecological environment. Traditionally, drought severity assessment relies on drought-related parameters observed by in situ measurements, such as precipitation_ evapotranspiration_ runoff, and soil moisture. In the past two decades, GRACE/GRACE-FO gravity satellite data have been widely used to estimate global and regional terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA). but there are still limited studies on the quantitative assessment of the severity of drought using GRACE/GRACE-FO data. The objective of this study was to analyse the drought severity in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the summer and autumn of 2019 using GRACE/GRACE-FO data and to compare our estimates with the traditional drought index.The GRACE-based drought severity index (GRACE-DSI) is a monthly global drought severity index based on the TWSA from the GRACE/GRACE-FO (GRACE-TWSA). In this study, we used spherical harmonic (SH) products from the GRACE/GRACE-FO to obtain the TWSA. GRACE data processing includes replacing the degree-1 and C-20, removing the 2004-2009 mean SH, filtering to reduce correlated errors, Gaussian smoothing, calculating the equivalent water layer thickness on 1 degrees x 1 degrees grids, and correcting leakage errors with scale factors. We then calculated the GRACE-DSI based on the GRACE-TWSA with the trend and seasonal cycles removed. To ensure consistency, we processed the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) similar to the GRACE data and standardised the new SPEI as the SPEI-Z.Our results indicated that the GRACE-DSI can successfully monitor the occurrence and development of drought in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in spatiotemporal domains. The GRACE/GRACE-FO successfully detected the extreme drought event that occurred in the east of Hubei, north of Jiangxi, and south of Anhui during the summer and autumn of 2019. In July, the arid region was located in the north of the Yangtze River basin, including Henan and Shandong provinces. In August, the drought intensified and moved south to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, reaching a maximum in September, especially in Hubei. Jiangxi. and Anhui provinces. The drought was weakened in October, but intensified again in November and December and expanded through the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to the coastal regions. such as Fujian and Guangzhou provinces.The mean time series of the GRACE-DSI over Hubei. Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan provinces showed good agreement with the SPE1-Z in both amplitude and phase on the six month time scale (SPEI06-Z) with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. The time series of the GRACE-DSI and SPEI06-Z both clearly showed the extreme drought events that occurred in Hubei, Jiangxi. Anhui. and Hunan provinces during the spring and summer of 2011 and the summer and autumn of 2019. Our results also indicate that the GRACE-FO has the same drought monitoring capability as the GRACE.

TI  - Estimation of flood influencing characteristics of watershed and their impact on flooding in data-scarce region
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The research is focused on the integrated use of satellite remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), and extensive field observation techniques for a better understanding of the impacts of watershed characteristics on hydrological processes and floods. It aims to create a methodology for assessing flood hazards and risk on a regional and local scale so that protective measures can be designed. Floods have occurred in the study area for many years, causing serious damage to infrastructure and civic structures. The present study evaluates the linear, aerial and relief morphometric parameters using the Cartosat-1 digital elevation model (30 metres) along with the curve number for assessing the flood influencing characteristics of the Vishwamitri River's subwatersheds. The study prioritizes five sub-watersheds as high, medium, and low based on their flood influencing characteristics and compound value, as a result, needs the highest priority for flood mitigation measures. The sub-watersheds I and IV of Vishwamitri watershed have been categorized into high priority, sub-watersheds II and V into moderate priority, and subwatershed III into low priority. The geologic stage of development and erosion proneness of the watershed is quantified by hypsometric integral bearing value as 0.04, indicating the landscape to be in monadnock phase in landscape evolution indicative of a marked old stage in the basin's evolution. Moreover, the ability of the rain-on-grid model at the watershed scale to simulate flood events and predict flood-prone areas, considering multiple rain gauge data, which will facilitate more accurate flood inundation where ground-based observational data are unavailable is shown.

T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Sentinel-2 data are widely used to estimate phenological parameters for agronomic applications, although processing methods are often difficult to reproduce and the efficiency of estimations is often not verified. In this contribution we describe a workflow used in the framework of E-crops project (https://bit.ly/cnr-ecrops) for the analysis of Bonifiche Ferraresi farm in Arborea (Sardinia): creation of the data archive (2018-2020), extraction and smoothing of MSAVI2 time series, identification and interpolation of relevant crop cycles and computation of phenological metrics. Algorithms were developed as R functions and publicly released in the R package "sen2rts" (https://sen2rts.ranghetti.info), so to facilitate reproducibility and methodology generalisation. Estimates were validated using farm information: good agreement was found between detected seasons and cultivated crops and among SOS estimates and sowing dates. These findings are encouraging to further develop "sen2rts" in order to manage a wider range of crop types and to extract additional information (e.g. crop categories).

TI  - RETRIEVAL OF MAIZE BIOPHYSICAL VARIABLES FROM MULTISPECTRAL AND HYPERSPECTRAL EO DATA USING A HYBRID APPROACH
T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Assessing crops health and status is becoming relevant to support farmers' decisions and actions for a sustainable agriculture. The use of remote sensing techniques in agriculture has become widely popular during the past years. Earth Observing (EO) data can greatly contribute to constantly monitor crops phenology and to estimate important vegetation biophysical parameters.This work presents a hybrid approach, which exploits the PROSAIL-PRO model and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, to estimate maize biophysical variables, such as Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). The test site is represented by two maize fields located near Grosseto (Tuscany, IT), where two field campaigns were carried out in July 2018. During the same period, the airborne sensor Hyplant-DUAL acquired two images of the test site. These images were used to simulate PRISMA and Sentinel-2 data in order to investigate the difference of the retrieval performance between hyperspectral and multispectral EO data. Results show similar performance between Sentinel-2 and PRISMA. The ML algorithms, providing the best performance (GPR and NN) within the hybrid framework, were then applied to actual Sentinel-2 images. The retrieval results for LAI and CCC were compared to estimations assessed through the ESA S2Toolbox. The comparison showed that the proposed method provides better results than those achieved through S2Toolbox, for both LAI (R-2 = 0.85 and MAE = 0.39; S2Toolbox: R-2 = 0.35 and MAE = 0.87) and CCC (R-2 = 0.73 and MAE = 0.20; S2Toolbox: R-2 = 0.29 and MAE = 0.68).

TI  - Soil Moisture Change Monitoring from C and L-band SAR Interferometric Phase Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil moisture changes (Delta M-v) have a significant influence on forestry, hydrology, meteorology, agriculture, and climate change. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), as a potential remote sensing tool for change detection, was relatively less investigated for monitoring this parameter. DInSAR phase (phi) is sensitive to the changes in soil moisture (M-v), and thus, can be potentially used for monitoring Delta M-v. In this article, the relations between phi and Delta M-v over wheat, canola, corn, soybean, weed, peas, and bare fields were investigated using an empirical regression technique. To this end, dual-polarimetric C-band Sentinel-1A and quad-polarimetric L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) airborne datasets were employed. The regression model showed the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 40% to 56% and RMSE of 4.3 vol.% to 6.1 vol.% between the measured and estimated Delta M-v for different crop types when the temporal baseline (Delta T) was very short. As expected, higher accuracies were obtained using UAVSAR given its very short Delta T and its longer wavelength with R-2 of 47% to 59% and RMSE of 4.1 vol.% to 6.7 vol.% for different crop types. However, using the Sentinel-1 data with the long Delta T and shorter wavelength (5.6 cm), the accuracies of Delta M-v estimations decreased significantly. The results of this study demonstrated that using the phi information from Sentinel-1 data is a promising approach for monitoring Delta M-v at an early growing season or before the crop starts growing, but using L-band SAR data and lower temporal baselines are recommended once the biomass increases.

TI  - A Study of Completely Inverse Paramedial AG-Groupoids
T2  - PUNJAB UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A magma S that meets the identity, xy. z = zy .x , for all x, y, z epsilon S is called an AG-groupoid. An AG-groupoid S gratifying the paramedial law: uv . wx = xv . wu, for all u, v, w, x epsilon S is called a paramedial AG- groupoid. Every AG-grouoid with a left identity is paramedial. We extend the concept of inverse AG-groupoid [4, 7] to paramedial AG-groupoid and investigate various of its properties. We prove that inverses of elements in an inverse paramedial AG-groupoid are unique. Further, we initiate and investigate the notions of congruences, partial order and compatible partial orders for inverse paramedial AG-groupoid and strengthen this idea further to a completely inverse paramedial AG-groupoid. Furthermore, we introduce and characterize some congruences on completely inverse paramedial AG-groupoids and introduce and characterize the concept of separative and completely separative ordered, normal sub-groupoid, pseudo normal congruence pair, and normal congruence pair for the class of completely inverse paramedial AG-groupoids. We also provide a variety of examples and counterexamples for justification of the produced results.

TI  - Retrieval of Ocean Surface Radial Velocities With RADARSAT-2 Along-Track Interferometry
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides a detailed presentation of the dual-aperture synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing scheme for the retrieval of ocean surface radial velocities.This scheme includes processing of raw SAR data, coregistration of along-track interferometric samples, magnitude and absolute phase calibration, and coherent averaging (multilooking). Several approaches for the absolute phase calibration are provided and compared. Some of the attempted approaches can potentially be used over open ocean (i.e., in scenes that do not contain any land). Main goal of attempting different approaches for the absolute phase calibration was to determine their relative performance, and determine the potential feasibility of some approaches over open ocean. The data processing scheme is applied to a RADARSAT-2 dual-channel MODEX-1 acquisition over a section of the Florida Current. For the dataset used in this study, different absolute phase calibration methods yielded similar radial velocity estimates, with relative mean and RMS differences within approximately 0.1 m/s. Estimates from SAR ATI were also compared to estimates from NASA's OSCAR dataset. Comparison of visually identified currents showed close spatial overlap between estimates from the two sources. The RMS difference was found to be approximately 0.30 m/s. This difference can be attributed to the physical and temporal differences between the estimates.

TI  - A Comprehensive Review of Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning Approaches With Special Emphasis on Palm Oil Yield Prediction
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Review
AB  - An early and reliable estimation of crop yield is essential in quantitative and financial evaluation at the field level for determining strategic plans in agricultural commodities for import-export policies and doubling farmer's incomes. Crop yield predictions are carried out to estimate higher crop yield through the use of machine learning algorithms which are one of the challenging issues in the agricultural sector. Due to this developing significance of crop yield prediction, this article provides an exhaustive review on the use of machine learning algorithms to predict crop yield with special emphasis on palm oil yield prediction. Initially, the current status of palm oil yield around the world is presented, along with a brief discussion on the overview of widely used features and prediction algorithms. Then, the critical evaluation of the state-of-the-art machine learning-based crop yield prediction, machine learning application in the palm oil industry and comparative analysis of related studies are presented. Consequently, a detailed study of the advantages and difficulties related to machine learning-based crop yield prediction and proper identification of current and future challenges to the agricultural industry is presented. The potential solutions are additionally prescribed in order to alleviate existing problems in crop yield prediction. Since one of the major objectives of this study is to explore the future perspectives of machine learning-based palm oil yield prediction, the areas including application of remote sensing, plant's growth and disease recognition, mapping and tree counting, optimum features and algorithms have been broadly discussed. Finally, a prospective architecture of machine learning-based palm oil yield prediction has been proposed based on the critical evaluation of existing related studies. This technology will fulfill its promise by performing new research challenges in the analysis of crop yield prediction and the development of an extremely effective model for the prediction of palm oil yields with the most minimal computational difficulty.

TI  - Wildfire Detection From Multisensor Satellite Imagery Using Deep Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving the extent of areas affected by wildfires is critical to fire management, protection of the population, damage assessment, and better understanding of the consequences of fires. In the past two decades, several algorithms utilizing data from Earth observation satellites have been developed to detect fire-affected areas. However, most of these methods require the establishment of complex functional relationships between numerous remote sensing data parameters. In contrast, more recently, deep learning has found its way into the application, having the advantage of being able to detect patterns in complex data by learning from examples automatically. In this article, a workflow for the detection of fire-affected areas from satellite imagery acquired in the visible, infrared, and microwave domains is described. Using this workflow, the fire detection potentials of four sources of freely available satellite imagery were investigated: the C-SAR instrument on board Sentinel-1, the multispectral instrument on board Sentinel-2, the sea and land surface temperature instrument on board Sentinel-3, and the MODIS instrument on board Terra and Aqua. For each of them, a single-input convolutional neural network based on the well-known U-Net architecture was trained on a newly created dataset. The performance of the resulting four single-instrument models was evaluated in presence of clouds and in clear conditions. In addition, the potential of combining predictions from pairs of single-instrument models was investigated. The results show that fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data provides the best detection rate in clear conditions, whereas the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data shows a significant benefit in cloudy weather.

TI  - Updated System for the Sea Wave Operational Forecast of the Black Sea Marine Forecasting Center
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The work is aimed at updating the sea wave forecasting system developed in the Black Sea Marine Forecasting Center by including the block of wind wave forecast in the Sevastopol region and by improving the wave forecast accuracy using the proposed procedure for the SWAN model tuning.Methods and Results. In the updated forecasting system, the possibility of performing the joint operational sea wave forecasts for the Black Sea and the Sevastopol region (with the 5 and 1 km spatial resolutions, respectively) became possible due to the nested grid method applied. To improve accuracy of the wave forecasts, the procedure for the SWAN model tuning was proposed. It is based on changing the parameterization of the surface friction coefficient C-d(V), where V is the surface wind speed. This permits to reduce the deviations of the forecasted wave heights from those obtained from the satellite altimetry measurements. Efficiency of the proposed procedure was assessed through comparison of the forecasting results with the remote sensing data. It is shown that in the forecasts supplied with an optimal choice of functional dependence C-d(V), the scattering index between the forecasted and measured values can be reduced by 20 %.Conclusions. Represented is the updated system of the Black Sea Marine Forecasting Center intended for the joint operational sea wave forecasts in the Black Sea and in the Sevastopol region. The results of model validation have shown that the procedure proposed for tuning the SWAN model makes it possible to reduce the deviations of the forecasted wave heights from those measured by the sensors installed at the altimetry satellites.

TI  - Effect of group size and experience on the ontogeny of sentinel calling behaviour in meerkats
T2  - ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased vulnerability to predation results in young individuals of many species experiencing higher predation pressure than adults. Consequently, the production of antipredator-related calls by young can differ from that of the same vocalizations given by adults. Sentinel behaviour is a coordinated vigilance behaviour, where one individual climbs on an elevated position and scans the surroundings for predators, while the rest of the group is mainly foraging. Meerkat, Suricata suricatta, sentinels produce six distinct sentinel call types, which inform other group members about the perceived predation risk, resulting in the adjustment of personal vigilance behaviour in foraging group members. Here, we investigated the onset of sentinel behaviour and the ontogeny of the different sentinel call types as well as the development of individual vocal signatures in meerkats. We found that meerkats started acting as a sentinel around 200 days of age, but this was highly dependent on group size, with individuals from smaller groups exhibiting sentinel behaviour earlier than individuals from larger groups. All six sentinel call types were already present in the repertoire upon first emergence of the behaviour; however, call rates of 'all-clear' calls increased while 'warning' calls decreased with increasing experience as sentinel. Analysis of one of the most frequent sentinel calls, the double note calls, indicated that fundamental frequency, mean amplitude, duration and entropy differed consistently between individuals, but we found no effect of age. Rather, our results provide evidence that individual signatures in this call type were already developed when young meerkats first started to act as sentinel and changed little with age. To conclude, we showed little ontogenetic change in overall sentinel behaviour as well as in its vocal coordination, indicating potentially high selection pressures on antipredator behaviours, such as the sentinel system, resulting in consistent behavioural responses upon first emergence.

T2  - ACTA HISTORICA TALLINNENSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article sheds light on the patterns of filling pastoral positions in the Latvian-language area of Livland province, i.e. the Vidzeme rural parishes. Above all, attention is given to the education background of the pastors who imparted biographical information in the published church archives and how their path to become a pastor progressed. Secondly, the problem of pastors' self-image is examined. Thirdly, an attempt is made to find out whether the church materials deposited in the general framework of the Swedish Church Law of 1686 may reflect the intellectual impulses received by pastors from German universities. The focus is on whether the increased interest in the state of the physical environment, above all weather, as one of the manifestations of the enlightened worldview, is reflected in church chronicles.

TI  - MONITORING OF THE GROUND DEFORMATION IN PENANG ISLAND, MALAYSIA USING PERMANENT SCATTERER INTERFEROMETRY SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (PS-INSAR) AND GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR (GPR) TECHNIQUES
T2  - ACTA GEODYNAMICA ET GEOMATERIALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformations (e.g., landslide and subsidence) have substantially risen recently around Penang Island, Malaysia. The development of hillslopes for rapid urbanisation and heavy rainfall has detrimental impacts on Penang Island soil layers. Modelling, simulation, and the development of susceptibility maps were past methods used to predict potential ground deformations of Penang Island. There is no published work on the Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique, where ground deformation of the region has been holistically studied. This work integrates the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique with Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to monitor the deformation on the island and identify possible subsurface causes for the disturbance. Twenty-four descending Sentinel-1A datasets acquired between 14th July 2017 and 13th October 2018 were processed to monitor and map ground deformation areas with a focus on three selected regions- Batu Feringghi (BF), Paya Terubong (PT), and Tanjung Bungah (TB), where multiple landslides occurred between 2017 and 2018. InSAR results were later analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) tool and validated by the available Global Positioning System (GPS) analysis. InSAR analyses reveal the mean deformation values of -3.13 mm/yr, -2.76 mm/yr and -4.77 mm/yr for the BF, PT, and TB areas. GPR surveys were conducted with a 300/800 MHz dual-frequency antenna at the three selected study areas. Anomalies (wall cracks, road fissures, cavities, drains, and pipes) detected using GPR profiles correlated well with the permanent scatterer points calculated using the InSAR technique.

TI  - Trend, Morbidity Profile and Immunization Status of Diphtheria Admitted Cases: A 5-Years Review from a Sentinel Centre in Kolkata
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite strengthening of the universal immunization program, diphtheria remains endemic in India. Diphtheria is under surveillance for vaccine-preventable diseases of the World Health Organization and also in India. The present record-based retrospective study was conducted on 241 confirmed diphtheria patients admitted in an infectious disease hospital of Kolkata over 5 years (2015-2019) with the objectives of assessing the admission trend, immunization status, and outcome of patients. Among the patients, majority (57.3%) were female; 50.6% were >= 15 years; 49.0% resided in rural areas. Five-year admission rate did not show any declining trend. Major number of cases occurred in 2016; another peak observed in 2019. Only 27.4% fully immunized rest either partiality immunized (44.4%) or nonimmunized (28.2%). Overall, 54% of the patients developed any complications, and case fatality was 9.5%. Gradual age shift toward adults reiterated the widespread use of adult inununization with Td vaccines. Early reporting to the hospital is necessary to reduce complications and case fatality.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes changes in the vegetation cover of the Henri Pittier National Park, Venezuela. The objective was the quantification of the cover variations of the vegetation units. The analysis period was eight years, using three images (2010, 2014 and 2018). The reference map was a Landsat-7 ETM+ image (2001) with field validation (2010). The 2014 and 2018 images correspond to the Landsat-8 satellite. The results obtained show that the upper cloud forest cover increased from 9010 ha (2010) to 6963 ha (2018). The low cloud forest ranged from 32613 ha (2010) to 28423 ha (2018). The area of the grasslands increased from 17274 ha (2010) to 25149 ha (2018). The Annual Rate of Change for the covers reaffirms that the forests lose surface and these areas are covered with grasslands. These changes put the availability of environmental services at risk.

TI  - GENERAL HENNING'S YEKATERINBURG: AN ATTEMPT AT READING THE "URBAN TEXT"
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The author of this article attempts a semiotic interpretation of the features of the architectural and planning system of early Yekaterinburg (1723-1734). The method is based on an improvisation on Michel de Certeau's ideas about the city as a complex text, which results from the simultaneous and inconsistent creativity of its founders and administrators on the one hand and ordinary people on the other. Another source for the author's improvisation is the ideas of some representatives of the French school of genetic criticism, more particularly, the concepts of avant-text and text. From these positions, the author considers the activity of V. I. Henning (Rus. transcription: Gennin), the founder and first head of Yekaterinburg and a general in Russian service. The main milestones of his career, the accumulation of experience as an engineer and administrator, and the formation of a worldview before his Ural period are evaluated as work on the avant-text, while Yekaterinburg becomes the actual text. The author proves that Yekaterinburg was created by Henning not just as a large mining and metallurgical enterprise. General Henning's Yekaterinburg appears as a manifesto city, a material text that embodies the aesthetics of the Baroque and the postulates of cameralism in its layout and execution. The city became a symbol of Petrine empire building on the border with Russia's Asian possessions.

AB  - During the past decades, the volume of big data available in remote sensing (RS) applications has grown significantly. In addition, a number of applications related to monitoring human activity are being developed based on this kind of data. This has considerably increased the demand for RS processing methods. In this sense, the scientific community is facing the challenge of how to maximize the potential of the data that are produced in a fast and efficient way. In particular, the provision of processing algorithms that can be developed in an easy way is a fundamental problem for the RS community, due to the large volume of data offered by different portals and agencies, and the need for algorithms developed on different platforms and using a variety of programming frameworks. To address these challenges, this article takes advantage of social media tools to bring images and algorithms closer to users. In particular, a new system based on the Telegram messaging application Bot (called @ThuleRSbot) has been developed to provide a wide variety of RS image processing methods to users under the same interface. The system has been developed using the Python language and the Telegram Bot application program interface (API). The most remarkable characteristics of the system are: first, a completely open architecture that facilitates the incorporation of new algorithms without effort; and second, an easy way to automatically gather satellite images from the Sentinel Hub platform.

AB  - Cervix cancer in many countries is declining and screening programmes and immunisation will reduce the incidence in the next few decades. This guideline attempts to cover management of invasive disease reflecting diagnosis and imaging including new imaging and sentinel lymph node biopsies. Smaller volume disease is usually managed surgically whereas advanced disease is treated with (chemo)radiation. It also includes discussion of fertility sparing procedures. Practices are changing frequently for all aspects of care usually in attempts to reduce complications and improve quality of life. The management of advanced disease is treated by chemotherapy and the use of newer agents is also discussed. Other sections discuss specialist situations such as cancer in pregnancy, rare cervical tumours, late effects and supportive measures and fertility preserving approaches.

AB  - Mesoscale marine phenomena represent important features to understand and include within predictive models, which provide valuable information for proper environmental policy making. For example the rearrangement of the organic substances, consequent to the dynamics of the water masses affected by the mentioned phenomena, meaningfully modifies the actual condition of local habitats. Indeed it may facilitate the onset of non resident living species at the expense of resident ones, eventually affecting related human activity, such as commercial fishery. Objective of this work is the detection and identification of mesoscale events, in terms of specific marine surface patterns that are observed throughout such events, e.g. water filaments, counter-currents, meanders due to upwelling wind actions stress. These phenomena can be studied and monitored through the analysis of Sea Surface Temperature images captured by satellite missions, such as Metop, and MODIS Terra/Aqua. A quantitative description of such events is proposed, based on dedicated algorithms that extract temporal and spatial features from the images, and exploit them to provide a signature discriminating different observed scenarios. Preliminary results of the application of the proposed approach to a dataset related to the southwestern region of the Iberian Peninsula are presented.

AB  - Global climate warming is rapidly reducing Arctic sea ice volume and extent. The associated perennial sea ice loss has economic and global security implications associated with Arctic Ocean navigability, since sea ice cover dictates whether an Arctic route is open to shipping. Thus, understanding changes in sea ice thickness, concentration and drift is essential for operation planning and routing. However, changes in sea ice cover on scales up to a few days and kilometers are challenging to detect and forecast; current sea ice models may not capture quickly-changing conditions on short timescales needed for navigation. Assimilating these predictive models requires frequent, high-resolution morphological information about the pack, which is operationally difficult. We suggest an approach to mitigate this challenge by using machine learning (ML) to interpret satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. In this study, we derive ML models for the analysis of SAR data to improve short-term local sea ice monitoring at high spatial resolutions, enabling more accurate analysis of Arctic navigability. We develop an algorithm/classifier that can analyze Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with the potential to inform operational sea ice forecasting models. We focus on detecting two sea ice features of interest to Arctic navigability: ridges and leads (fractures in the ice shelf). These can be considered local extremes in terms of ice thickness, a crucial parameter for navigation. We build models to detect these ice features using machine learning techniques. Both our ridge and lead detection models perform as well as, if not better than, state-of-the-art methods. These models demonstrate Sentinel-1's ability to capture sea ice conditions, suggesting the potential for Sentinel-1 global coverage imagery to inform sea ice forecasting models.

AB  - Predicting species' suitable habitats is critical to biodiversity conservation planning and implementation. Species habitat distribution is closely linked to environmental and bioclimatic variables which are widely used for estimating habitat suitability (HS) from species distribution models (SDMs). Integration of environmental parameters derived from satellite remote sensing, bioclimatic variables, and edaphic properties has created an advanced way to improve the SDM performance. The objective of this study is to assess the performance for predicting the potential HS of the arid plant species using Maximum Entropy (MaxENT) species distribution model based on an ecological niche machine-learning algorithm. Prosopis cineraria (Ghaf) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was selected for the model simulation. The Ghaf tree is a keystone species to prevent desertification and improve soil fertility in arid environments. We have selected 33 environmental parameters, including satellite remote sensing data (MODIS NDVI, LST, and PET), WorldClim bioclimate variables and static edaphic properties (topography, elevation, soil quality) along with 100 field observations. Collinearity within the bioclimatic variables was eliminated using Pearson correlation. The variables with zero percentage contribution were eliminated for the final model simulation. To evaluate the contribution of environmental parameters to the performance of MaxEnt, we used three scenarios: a) All key predictor variables, b) Only bioclimatic variables, and c) without remote sensing variables. With scenario a) model simulation has substantially improved the potential HS prediction with mean AUC value 0.98, indicating a better predictive accuracy in the integration of satellite remote sensing data. MaxENT results showed that elevation, precipitation of coldest quarter, NDVI, and precipitation of warmest quarte had a significant contribution to the potential HS of Ghaf trees in the UAE. Model results showed that the spatial proportions of the potential HS in the UAE consisted of high (2%), medium (3.7%) and low (94.3%) suitability classes.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 27th IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)

AB  - Memory capacity is a major bottleneck for training deep neural networks (DNN). Heterogeneous memory (HM) combining fast and slow memories provides a promising direction to increase memory capacity. However, HM imposes challenges on tensor migration and allocation for high performance DNN training. Prior work heavily relies on DNN domain knowledge, unnecessarily causes tensor migration due to page-level false sharing, and wastes fast memory space. We present Sentinel, a software runtime system that automatically optimizes tensor management on HM. Sentinel uses dynamic profiling, and coordinates operating system (OS) and runtime-level profiling to bridge the semantic gap between OS and applications, which enables tensor-level profiling. This profiling enables co-allocating tensors with similar lifetime and memory access frequency into the same pages. Such fine-grained profiling and tensor collocation avoids unnecessary data movement, improves tensor movement efficiency, and enables larger batch training because of saving in fast memory space. Sentinel reduces fast memory consumption by 80% while retaining comparable performance to fast memory-only system; Sentinel consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art solution on CPU by 37% and two state-of-the-art solutions on GPU by 2x and 21% respectively in training throughput.

AB  - This study proposes a deep learning model to extract ship size from SAR images. The model uses a single shot multibox detector (SSD)-based model to extract abstracted features from the input SAR image. Then, a deep neural-network (DNN)-based regression model is connected to the SSD-based model to estimate the accurate size of the ship. We employ a subset of the OpenSARShip to train and test the model. The OpenSARShip (http://opensar.sjtu.edu.cn/) is a data set dedicated to Sentinel-1 ship interpretation, providing 11, 346 SAR ship chips integrated with the automatic identification system (AIS) messages. Experiments show that our model is capable of extracting ship size from SAR images end-to-end. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) are under 0.9-pixel, and they are 8.32 m and 2.34 m for length and width, respectively. Compared with the traditional gradient boosting regression (GBR) model, our DL model reduces the MAE of length by 1.37 m and the MAE of width by 0.05m.

AB  - Hydrometeorological phenomena, including mass movements, are a frequent threat that can generate a great impact at different levels. In order to estimate the susceptibility to mass movements, this work contains a new proposal to estimate the susceptibility to mass movements using a supervised learning algorithm designed using AutoML (Automated machine learning). Pixel-level information from Sentinel-2 multispectral images was used to train the model, and an expert's susceptibility map was used as labels.

AB  - Satellite images are snapshots of the Earth surface. We propose to forecast them. We frame Earth surface forecasting as the task of predicting satellite imagery conditioned on future weather. EarthNet2021 is a large dataset suitable for training deep neural networks on the task. It contains Sentinel 2 satellite imagery at 20 m resolution, matching topography and mesoscale (1.28 km) meteorological variables packaged into 32000 samples. Additionally we frame EarthNet2021 as a challenge allowing for model intercomparison. Resulting forecasts will greatly improve (> x50) over the spatial resolution found in numerical models. This allows localized impacts from extreme weather to be predicted, thus supporting downstream applications such as crop yield prediction, forest health assessments or biodiversity monitoring.

TI  - Daily 8-Hour Maximum and Annual O3 Concentrations for the Contiguous United States, 1-km Grids, v1 (2000 - 2016)
T2  - NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center
M3  - Data study
AB  - The Daily 8-Hour Maximum and Annual O3 Concentrations for the Contiguous United States, 1-km Grids, v1 (2000 - 2016) data set contains estimates of ozone concentrations at a high resolution in space (1 km x 1 km grid cells) and time (daily) for the years 2000 to 2016. These predictions incorporated various predictor variables such as Ozone (O3) ground measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring data, land-use variables, meteorological variables, chemical transport models and remote sensing data, along with other data sources. After imputing missing data with machine learning algorithms, a geographically weighted ensemble model was applied that combined estimates from three types of machine learners (neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting). The annual predictions were computed by averaging the daily 8-hour maximum predictions in each year for each grid cell. The results demonstrate high overall model performance with a cross-validated R-squared value against daily observations of 0.90 and 0.86 for annual averages.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy using single-agent mapping tracer (blue dye) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a Brazilian cohort of breast cancer patients. Real world evidence
T2  - ACTA CIRURGICA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To reduce false-negative rates (FNR) in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of clinically positive (cN+) axilla in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The removal of three or more lymph nodes with dual-tracer mapping including a radioisotope was used. However, in the Brazilian Unified Health System, the radioisotope tracer is not feasible in some hospitals. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the detection rate of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients who converted from cN+ to ycNO after NAC using blue dye as a single-agent mapping tracer. Methods: During the period of March 2018 to September 2019, 34 patients who underwent NAC with cN+ who converted to ycNO were enrolled in the study. The SLNB was performed using blue dye as a single-agent mapping followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Results: The detection rate of sentinel lymph node was of 85.3%, being SLNB not possible for five patients (14.7%), due to fibrosis. The mean number of removed SLN was 2.5. Conclusions: The use of blue dye as a single-agent mapping tracer demonstrated an acceptable detection rate of 85.3%. Although the FNR was possible to be determined, the small sample size might overestimate this rate. The removal of three or more lymph nodes with single-agent mapping tracer might be indicated for breast cancer patients who converted to ycNO after NAC in the Brazilian health public services, in which radioisotope tracer is not suitable.

TI  - Hyperspectral Sharpening Approaches Using Satellite Multiplatform Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of hyperspectral (HS) data is growing over the years, thanks to the very high spectral resolution. However, HS data are still characterized by a spatial resolution that is too low for several applications, thus motivating the design of fusion techniques aimed to sharpen HS images with high spatial resolution data. To reach a significant resolution enhancement, high-resolution images should be acquired by different satellite platforms. In this article, we highlight the pros and cons of employing real multiplatform data, using the EO-1 satellite as an exemplary case. The spatial resolution of the HS data collected by the Hyperion sensor is improved by exploiting both the ALI panchromatic image collected from the same platform and acquisitions from the WorldView-3 and the QuickBird satellites. Furthermore, we tackle the problem of assessing the final quality of the fused product at the nominal resolution, which presents further difficulties in this general environment. Useful indications for the design of an effective sharpening method in this case are finally outlined.

TI  - Farming from space: model-data fusion approaches for simulating crop nitrogen and yield estimates
T2  - SPACE, SATELLITES, AND SUSTAINABILITY II
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Space, Satellites, and Sustainability II
CL  - Glasgow, SCOTLAND
AB  - Farmers are under increasing pressure to manage agricultural resources in a more sustainable and efficient manner. Information on crop nitrogen (N) status can be used to support variable rate fertiliser applications. Furthermore, yield forecasts can aid the logistical planning of harvest operations and ameliorate any negative economic impacts on food supply chains Complex crop models simulating crop N dynamics and yields often require extensive model inputs that are seldom available. By combining observations of leaf area index (LAI) with a process-based crop model, this research presents a novel and scalable analytical solution for generating robust daily estimate of wheat N and yield, which can be applied at the sub-field scale. The crop model, DALEC-Crop, is a carbon cycle model that simulates the key processes involved in crop growth and development in response to daily meteorological observations. The model was first calibrated for wheat leaf N and yields across field experiments covering N applications ranging from 0 to 200 kg N ha(-1) for two consecutive growing seasons. Leaf N was accurately retrieved by the model (NRMSE = 6%). Yield could also be reasonably estimated (NRMSE = 11%). Using these developments at the plot scale, the model yield estimates had a high agreement with observations (mean R-2 = 0.7 and NRMSE = 7%) when applied at the sub-field scale across field sites under the constraints of Sentinel-2 data. Although additional field sites and seasons are required for further testing, the modelling approach could be feasibly applied to estimate yields across large areas with only minimal inputs.

TI  - pysal/pysal: pysal 2.5.0
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - PySAL 2.5.0 represents 6 months of enhancements, bug-fixes, widening of test coverage, and improved documentation. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as there are numerous optimizations as well as new features (see below) that have been implemented. Overall, there were 543 commits that closed 190 issues, together with 33 pull requests since our last release on 2021-01-31. Package Highlights esda This version merges two large new sets of functionalities: map correspondence measures in esda.map_comparison shape statistics in esda.shape segregation Version 2.0 of the segregation package brings a new API, a massive code restructuring, and dozens of new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. For a complete overview of the new API, please see the documentation page at https://pysal.org/segregation/api. The new version does away with the distinction between spatial and aspatial segregation indices and instead partitions the functions based on single-group and multi-group measures. The spatial/aspatial distinction is echewed in version 2.0 because all aspatial indices can be generalized into spatial versions, following the logic of Reardon and O'Sullivan (see a description in this example notebook). Furthermore, "space" can be incorporated into the index calculation using either Euclidean distance or the shortest path along a travel network. With this logic, the package now offers multiscalar segregation profiles for 23 different segregation indices (a first in any software package). tobler Added pychnophylactic interpolation. spaghetti The highlights of this release include functionality to split network arcs by count, which compliments the previously available distance splitting, and a paper in the Journal of Open Source Software. Also, Python 3.6 is no longer supported. spopt This release includes another model to add to the suite: RandomRegions. RandomRegions, originally written by David C. Folch (@dfolch) and Serge Rey, builds regions based on an initial random seed while considering user-defined specifications such as: region count, cardinality, contiguity, and compactness (citation?). Also, we have improved the testing coverage for the models inlcuded in the initial release: AZP, Max-p-regions, Region-k-means, Skater, Spenc, and WardSpatial.

TI  - Mapping forest age and characterizing vegetation structure and species composition in tropical dry forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes generate a mosaic of forest patches with different ages of abandonment (i.e. succession) intermingled with other land uses. Mapping the successional age of vegetation is crucial to understand carbon accumulation patterns and the recovery of vegetation structure, diversity, and composition of forests over time. The overall objective of this research was to produce maps portraying secondary vegetation age classes and to assess how successional age classes can be related to vegetation structure, diversity and composition in two types of tropical dry forests (TDF) in the Yucatan Peninsula. We used a two-stage image classification process. First, SPOT-5 imagery were segmented and then classified using a Random Forests method. Second, the classified images were post-processed to rectify any classification errors. Additionally, we evaluated the association be-tween the different forest age classes and vegetation structure, species richness and composition using a separate Random Forests classification of field plot data. Post-processing improved the accuracy of the Random Forests classifications by 14.19% and 16.28% for the tropical semi-deciduous and semi-evergreen forests, to attain final accuracy values of 91% and 88.37%, respectively. Vegetation structure, richness and composition were all strongly associated with successional age, accounting for 77.7% and 84.7% of the total variation among forest age classes for the tropical semi-deciduous and semi-evergreen forests respectively. Therefore, the forest age maps obtained can be related to attributes of vegetation structure, diversity and composition that are useful for biodiversity conservation, forest management and climate change mitigation.

TI  - THE CONCEPT "LOVE" IN RUSSIAN AND PERSIAN CULTURES ON THE BASIS OF PROVERBS
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of our research is to identify the interethnic specificity of the concept of "love" in the Russian and Persian languages. The work reflects the interweaving of the nation's worldview and its embodiment in their languages and cultures. Learning a language without introducing it into the semantic layers of the people's subconscious will not give the required mental integration. In the process of teaching a language, one of the key requirements is the study of paremias and through them, at the same time, the culture of these peoples, in particular, from the position of teaching a language outside the linguistic and cultural environment. Divine wisdom, high human morality and morality have always been the inspirers of people who create proverbs and sayings. There is no dispute about love. It does not require a special language, but its manifestation in each environment is unique. The analysis of the paremias representing this concept is implemented within the framework of their interpretation, which allows you to get an idea of the structure of the concept under study. Interpretation allows the formation of a classification of cognitive features that make up the information content. Comparing examples from the dictionaries of the Russian and Persian languages, put forward the manifestation of the concept of love in human relations and the essence and character traits of love, such as omnipotence, passion, suffering, infinity, etc. in the worldview of two people. Due to the fact that in the Persian language most of the literature is poetry, the poems of great poets were also selected.

AB  - As one of the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, Directed Energy Deposition (DED) inherited common concerns from the AM concept, such as the layer discretization process, which brings about the staircase effect, and the complex thermal reheating cycles that occur due to the scanning strategies. In this regard, diversification in slicing strategies and the application of post-processing techniques arises as a feasible way to reduce defects and the usual poor surface finishing of DED parts. This study combines the non-planar slicing strategy as toolpath for laser polishing (LP) in DED parts, evaluating the influence of such post-processing for surface finishing, geometry and hardness of the Inconel 625 truncated pyramid built by DED. This geometry was built by using planar slicing and zigzag scanning strategy in BeAM M250 DED equipment. The non-planar coordinates of the LP were applied at an offset in the external profile of the pyramid with support of an open-source software Slic3R. The workpieces were built with laser power of 500 W delivered at the 800 mu m spot diameter with scanning rate at 2000 mm/min and powder flow of 7.5 g / min. Laser polishing was performed considering three levels of energy density (9.38, 11.25 and 14.06 J/mm(2)) and the number of iterations (once, 3 and 5 times). Both, deposition and LP, were performed with local Argon gas shielding. Among the results, LP has shown to be a feasible post-processing technique to L-DED parts, which can improve surface finishing and shape, maintaining hardness. The energy spent LP causes the remelting of satellite particles and shown to be not enough to rearrange the microstructure. The non-planar slicing applied, as toolpath to the LP, comprises a new possibility allowing DED parts to have better results towards surface finishing with a clean and quick method of post-processing. This has shown to be beneficial to the efficiency of the post-processing stage by leading to a greater assertiveness of the process, less post-processing time and no waste of material.

AB  - High-resolution satellite data opens new applications for personalised hyper-local insurance risk scores. In this paper, open-source satellite imagery and accident incident data are aggregated to model road network risk for the generation of a risk map to be used in insurance quotation. Two machine learning approaches are outlined - an unsupervised clustering of the images based on extracted features and a supervised labelled data approach. These are tried against the data; results illustrating the potential utility of this approach for estimating insurance risk are given. For the unsupervised approach, distinct risk levels were produced which reflected historic levels of accident for visually similar road sections. With supervised methods, we performed a binary classification to identify accident sites with a recall of 82% and precision of 80%.

TI  - Detecting Tree Species Effects on Forest Canopy Temperatures with Thermal Remote Sensing: The Role of Spatial Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy temperatures are important for understanding tree physiology, ecology, and their cooling potential, which provides a valuable ecosystem service, especially in urban environments. Linkages between tree species composition in forest stands and air temperatures remain challenging to quantify, as the establishment and maintenance of onsite sensor networks is time-consuming and costly. Remotely-sensed land surface temperature (LST) observations can potentially acquire spatially distributed crown temperature data more efficiently. We analyzed how tree species modify canopy air temperature at an urban floodplain forest (Leipzig, Germany) site equipped with a detailed onsite sensor network, and explored whether mono-temporal thermal remote sensing observations (August, 2016) at different spatial scales could be used to model air temperatures at the tree crown level. Based on the sensor-network data, we found interspecific differences in summer air temperature to vary temporally and spatially, with mean differences between coldest and warmest tree species of 1 degrees C, and reaching maxima of up to 4 degrees C for the upper and lower canopy region. The detectability of species-specific differences in canopy surface temperature was found to be similarly feasible when comparing high-resolution airborne LST data to the airborne LST data aggregated to 30 m pixel size. To realize a spatial resolution of 30 m with regularly acquired data, we found the downscaling of Landsat 8 thermal data to be a valid alternative to airborne data, although detected between-species differences in surface temperature were less expressed. For the modeling of canopy air temperatures, all LST data up to the 30 m level were similarly appropriate. We thus conclude that satellite-derived LST products could be recommended for operational use to detect and monitor tree species effects on temperature regulation at the crown scale.

TI  - An Object-based Approach for Vegetation and Non-vegetation Discrimination using WorldView-2 Image
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - The emergence of remote sensing images with high spatial resolution has increased the advancement of image-based information extraction methods. One of the rapidly developing approaches for mapping and analyzing high spatial resolution images is the object-based approach, also known as geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). This development makes it possible to quickly and accurately distinguish between vegetated and non-vegetated objects in vegetation study. This study aims to (1) create a ruleset to discriminate vegetated and non-vegetated objects from a high spatial resolution image, (2) apply the GEOBIA approach to map vegetated and non-vegetated objects, and (3) calculate the accuracy of the mapping results. The GEOBIA approach was applied to a WorldView-2 image (2 m pixel size and eight multispectral bands) of the Clungup Mangrove Conservation area, Malang, East Java, Indonesia. We assessed the ability of all of the WorldView-2 image bands for discriminating the targeted objects. The segmentation process in GEOBIA used a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the image classification used a rule-based classification technique. The green, red, and near-infrared bands can effectively distinguish the targeted objects based on the developed ruleset. The classification result shows that the vegetated and nonvegetated classes fall within their corresponding objects on the image. We implemented an area-based accuracy assessment that assesses both positional and thematic accuracy of the mapping result, based on the visual interpretation of the pansharpened WV-2 image (0.5 m pixel size) as a reference for the accuracy assessment. This process results in a 74,06% accuracy, meaning that the combination of GEOBIA and WorldView-2 image produces high accuracy of vegetated and non-vegetated objects map.

TI  - Exploiting the Sentinel-3 tandem phase dataset and azimuth oversampling to better characterize the sensitivity of SAR altimeter sea surface height to long ocean waves
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Being the very first SAR mode altimeter tandem phase, the Sentinel-3 A/B tandem phase has provided an unprecedented opportunity to better characterize the sensitivity of SAR altimetry retrievals to high-frequency processes, such as long ocean waves. In this paper, we show that for some sea-state conditions, that are still to be precisely characterized, long ocean waves are responsible for high-frequency (spatial and temporal) coherent Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) signals. It is found that the peak wavelength corresponds to the dominant swell wavelength. Furthermore, the short time lag between S3-A and S3-B acquisitions allows performing cross-spectral analyses that reveal phase shifts consistent with waves travelling according to the wave dispersion relation. It is also demonstrated that the classical 20 Hz sampling frequency is insufficient to properly sample most swell-induced SLA signals and that aliasing can generate errors over the entire frequency spectrum, including at long wavelengths. These results advocate for the use of azimuth oversampling (40 Hz or 80 Hz). Low-pass filtering should be applied prior to any down-sampling to 20 Hz, in order to prevent long-wavelength errors induced by spectral leakage. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Social Foundations of Positivism: The Case of Late-Nineteenth-Century Italy
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - What social conditions produce positivism? One position, common to both positivists and some of their major critics, suggests that positivism is an "ideology" or "worldview" of industrial capitalism. Positivism therefore resonates with the basic experience of capitalism for all social groups. Intellectuals draw on this experience in formulating positivist social science. A second position suggests that positivism is a strategy of distinction by which intellectuals attempt to accumulate symbolic capital against their rivals. This position suggests that positivism is a resource for establishing a social science that imitates the methodology of natural science. Our article argues for a third view focused on the internal structure of the intelligentsia as a social group. Positivism could emerge in both industrial capitalist and preindustrial contexts; however, the types of positivism differ in these two cases because the structure of the intelligentsia differs. In preindustrial contexts, such as nineteenth-century Italy, which is the focus of our analysis, positivists claim an ontological continuity between natural and social sciences. In industrial contexts, on the basis of which most theories of positivism rest, positivists claim a methodological similarity between natural and social sciences. We conclude our analysis by reflecting on the implications of our study for work on positivism and social ontology in the social sciences.

TI  - Solar position confounds the relationship between ecosystem function and vegetation indices derived from solar and photosynthetically active radiation fluxes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices derived from solar and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensors (i.e. radiation derived) have been under-utilized in inferring ecosystem function, despite measurement capability at hundreds of sites. This under-utilization may be attributed to reported mismatches among the seasonality of radiation- and satellite-derived vegetation indices and canopy photosynthesis; herein referred to as measurement biases. Here biases in radiation derived reflectance and vegetation indices were assessed using a decadal record of satellite and ground based spectroradiometer data, ecosystem phenology and CO2 fluxes, and radiation derived vegetation indices (i.e. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], the two band Enhanced Vegetation Index [EVI2]) from a high latitude tundra site (i.e. Imnaviat). At Imnaviat, we found poor correspondence between the three types of reflectance and vegetation indices, especially during the latter part of the growing season. Radiation derived vegetation indices resulted in incorrect estimates of phenological timing of up to a month and poor relationships with canopy photosynthesis (i.e. Gross Ecosystem Exchange (GEE)). These mismatches were attributed to solar position (i.e. solar zenith and azimuth angle) and a method, based on the diel visible and near-infrared albedo variation, was developed to improve the performance of the vegetation indices. The ability of radiation derived vegetation indices to infer GEE and phenological dates drastically improved once radiation derived vegetation indices were corrected for solar position associated biases at Imnaviat. Moreover, radiation derived vegetation indices became better aligned with MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite estimates after solar position associated biases were corrected at Imnaviat and at 25 Fluxnet sites (similar to 90 site years) across North America. Corrections developed here provide a way forward in understanding daily ecosystem function or filling large gaps in eddy covariance data at a significant number of Fluxnet sites.

AB  - A wide range of research activities exploit spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) for applications that contribute to maritime safety and security. An important requirement of SAR and AIS data fusion is accurate data association (or correlation), which is the process of linking SAR ship detections and AIS observations considered to be of a common origin. The data association is particularly difficult in dense shipping environments, where ships detected in SAR imagery can be wrongly associated with AIS observations. This often results in an erroneous and/or inaccurate maritime picture. Therefore, a classification-aided data association technique is proposed which uses a transfer learning method to classify ship types in SAR imagery. Specifically, a ship classification model is first trained on AIS data and then transferred to make predictions on SAR ship detections. These predictions are subsequently used in the data association which uses a rank-ordered assignment technique to provide a robust match between the data. Two case studies in the UK are used to evaluate the performance of the classification-aided data association technique based on the types of SAR product used for maritime surveillance: wide-area and large-scale data association in the English Channel and focused data association in the Solent. Results show a high level of correspondence between the data that is robust to dense shipping or high traffic, and the confidence in the data association is improved when using class (i.e., ship type) information.

T2  - LINGUAS & LETRAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an analysis of the infantjuvenile short story entitled Mae D'agua - Uma historia dos Cariris, published in 2008 by Tkayna from the indigenous ethnic group Kariri-Xoco Fulni-6 and Laura Bacellar. The work presents several aspects of the culture of this ethnic group, ranging from elements of their daily lives to their rites and symbolisms, based on mythology. The Cariris' way of being and living, depicted in the work, contributes to the preservation of cultural memory, as well as to the publication of aspects that characterize their identity, based on their worldview. In this sense, the work also contributes to the publication of this group's cultural wealth based on literature, which preserves stories that, according to tradition, are passed on orally. The analyzes carried out concern the understanding of the representations and the set of symbols shared by the group, as well as the representation of their identity.

T2  - 2021 21ST INTERNATIONAL RADAR SYMPOSIUM (IRS)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 21st International Radar Symposium (IRS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - This paper presents an algorithm developed in the context of an undergraduate degree of Informatics Engineering for the detection of oil slicks in images from a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Oil slicks represent a serious threat to the marine ecosystem in the coastal areas and SAR images have been increasingly used in the supervision of this environmental disaster, due to its numerous advantages when compared to images in the visible domain. The developed algorithm envisages simplicity and computational efficiency and is divided in four phases: land masking, statistical analysis of sea, detection of suspected oil slick locations, and final validation. The usage of amplitude SAR images, instead of Single Look Complex (SLC) ones, contributes to the overall low computational requirements. The obtained results are encouraging for real-world applications.

T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - In this work, the relationship between foliar properties and the vigour of the crop (NDVI, normalized difference vegetation index) were analysed, which directly affects the management of vegetation throughout the season. The objective was the use of data from foliar elements that explain and determine parameters related to the vineyard vegetation, to identify the variables that most influence the intra-field crop variability. The plot under study is located in Vedra (Galicia, Spain), the analysis has been carried out at 32 sample points, for the 2018 and 2019 seasons. The NDVI data were obtained from Sentinel-2 images. The results show that the variables potassium and nitrogen, are correlated with NDVI, (r=0.79 & r=0.74, respectively to K and N) and the comparison between the data of both seasons, determine homogeneous behaviour throughout the plot. The intra-field vigour has served to apply a vegetation management strategy which facilitates the work for winegrowers.

TI  - Is Panpsychism at Odds with Science?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Galileo's Error is a superlative work of public philosophy, particularly as a way of introducing modern academic panpsychism to a broader audience. In this commentary, I reflect on an issue that is prominent, though often with different background concerns, in both academic and popular discourse: what it means to be 'scientific' or 'unscientific'. Panpsychism is not itself a scientific hypothesis, but neither is it (as critics sometimes claim) in conflict with science. Indeed, Goff argues, and I agree, that panpsychism is an eminently scientific worldview, in the sense of a way of viewing reality that accords with and embraces what science reveals. But what exactly it means to 'accord with and embrace' science is disputed; this paper tries to untangle some of the threads.

TI  - FRENCH RESISTANCE TO <i>WELTANSCHAUUNG</i>
T2  - LOGOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The French have been reluctant to embrace the idea of Weltanschauung. In sharp contrast with the early introduction of the term in Great Britain (both in translation as "worldview" and in German) around the middle of the nineteenth century, there is no evidence that the French used it before 1930. Weltanschauung has often been described as impossible to translate (most notably by Sigmund Freud in his 1932 essay "A Philosophy of Life"). When Weltanschauung was (re)discovered in the 193os, it was already accompanied by a substantial critical tradition from Austria and Germany by such thinkers as Sigmund Freud, Max Weber, Edmund Husserl and Martin IIeidegger, and this framed its reception in France. A striking example is provided by Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose comments on the idea of Weltanschauung are directly derived or even quite literally borrowed from Husserl. This chronology also had important political consequences, as Weltanschauung appeared on the French intellectual scene just before I litter's takeover and so became inseparable from its Nazi uses and misuses. As a result, even those whose approach to culture came close to the idea of worldview (like the young Albert Camus trying to define a Mediterranean perception of the world) rejected the politically compromised German concept. Last but not least, the in-depth transformation of history as a discipline that took place under the auspices of the Annales school during the same pre-WWII period also contributed to the rejection of Weltanschauung, which could easily appear as a philosophical forerunner of the rising histoire des mentalites and thus dilute its originality and compromise its political integrity.

TI  - Hemagglutinin protein of Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV) activates the innate immune response via Toll-like receptor 2 signaling
T2  - VIRULENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The toll-like receptor (TLR) family comprises both cell-surface and intracellular receptors that recognize different types of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent development of adaptive immunity. TLR2 is a cell-surface receptor initially thought to act as a bacterial sentinel but also shown to recognize a number of viral glycoproteins. In this study, we sought to characterize the role of TLR2 in the activation of the immune response by peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), a morbillivirus of the Paramixoviridae family that causes an acute, highly contagious disease in goats and sheep. Using human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing human (h)TLR2 but lacking any other TLR, we found that PPRV induces IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner. That activation is only observed in cells expressing hTLR2 and is greatly reduced when the receptor is blocked by pretreatment with specific antibody. We identified hemagglutinin (H) as the viral protein responsible of TLR2 activation by performing the same assays with purified recombinant mammalian-expressed H protein. Exogenous addition of recombinant H protein to cell culture induces high levels of interleukin (IL)-8 only in TLR2-expressing cells. Moreover, H engagement on TLR2 in the monocytic cell line THP-1 activates extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Stimulation of primary ovine dendritic cells with either inactivated PPRV or purified recombinant H protein results in transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the secretion of the Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12. The role of these host immune mechanisms in the control of PPR is discussed.

TI  - Sharpening of Sentinel-2 Imagery for Updating Thematic Layer of Base Maps
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Currently, the Geospatial Information Agency of Indonesia has provided a relatively complete Base Maps RBI (Rupa Bumi Indonesia) on the map scale of 1/25,000 to 1/50,000. This Base maps data that can be downloaded for free via the https://tanahair.indonesia.go.id/. However, some of the RBI Maps were produced in 2001. Therefore, it is necessary to update the Maps. The existence of access to medium-resolution image data such as the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery can be a low-cost solution. However, the Sentinel-2 imagery should be enhanced for better visual interpretation. This research tries to sharpen Sentinel-2 imagery. The results can be used to update the existing themes in the RBI Map. This study takes the case of the Sleman district in the province of Yogyakarta area which is developing quite rapidly. The Sentinel-2 level 2A data from 2 epochs was used for sharpening. The process of sharpening is carried out with the concept of upscaling and superposition operator using two-epoch images. The procedure has succeeded in sharpening imagery for visible interpretation of selected band. After sharpening imagery, the thematic object's shape can be seen clearly so that visual interpretation is more reliable to use. Furthermore, band combination operators and the color composites formation are carried out to enhance the selected thematic objects more clearly. The process of updating the RBI map is done by visual interpretation. The road network theme data on the RBI map is used as a geometric and updated reference. So that the updating process is carried out in one block area that does not cross the road line. Sharpening of Sentinel-2 imagery has opened up opportunities to apply visual interpretation to update thematic objects on RBI maps at a 1/25,000 scale.

TI  - Mortality of light brown apple moth egg masses in coastal California: Impact of resident <i>Trichogramma</i> parasitism and predation
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Egg mortality of light brown apple moth (LBAM), Epiphyas postvittana (Walker), was studied during the early years of its discovery and establishment in California from 2008 to 11. Sentinel egg cards were used to quantify mortality by parasitoids and predators at an intensively monitored location in Santa Cruz to reveal seasonality, and at other sites in Santa Cruz and San Francisco to measure spatial variation and parasitoid species composition. In addition to egg mortality, egg mass use efficiency by Trichogramma parasitoids was also examined under field conditions. The egg parasitoids primarily consisted of three Trichogramma species, T. deion, T. fasciatum and T. platneri. Previously unknown to California, T. fasciatum was shown to displace the indigenous T. platneri over a two-year period as the predominant egg parasitoid attacking LBAM egg masses. Based on the number of parasitized eggs per sentinel egg card, it is argued that individual females of at least some Trichogramma species have the capacity to oviposit more than 50 eggs in the egg mass of a host, warranting further studies to document the egg mass use efficiency and oviposition traits of other trichogrammatids under field conditions. Although egg parasitism was limited to causing elevated mortality during the summer and fall only, egg predation occurred more consistently throughout the year and is likely to be of considerable significance in suppressing LBAM populations in California. Combined with the use of a Type II survivorship curve, the importance of using a temperature-dependent physiological time scale to quantify egg mortality is illustrated when sentinel hosts are exposed to natural enemies in the field for less than the entire duration of the 'window of susceptibility' to parasitism and predation.

CP  - International Siberian Conference on Control and Communications (SIBCON)

AB  - This paper discusses a heuristic algorithm that provides stabilization of beams of a satellite multiple beam hybrid reflector antenna via processing the antenna array signals received from a ground beacon. First, in accordance with the proposed algorithm, the actual profile of the reflector is retrieved as a surface on which the phase difference between the field of the conjugate excited antenna array and the field of a plane wave propagating in the direction of the beacon equals to zero. After that, taking into account the reconstructed profile, the weight vectors of the antenna array are adjusted to form the necessary set of beams. By modeling three types of reflector distortions, the accuracy of the weight vectors correction and the effectiveness of beams stabilization have been confirmed.

TI  - The Reflection of Dostoevsky's Underground Man in Faulkner's <i>Sartoris</i>
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to the comparative typological research related to the 'Underground Man', as featured in the works of F. Dostoevsky and W. Faulkner. Based on the study of the phenomenon of moral alienation - the "underground" embodied in the character of the storyteller in Dostoevsky's novella, Notes from Underground - we identify its reflection in Faulkner's novel, Sartoris. The relevance of this study is due to the importance of the "underground", which has not lost its significance in either Russia or the West. The character of the Underground Man, admittedly archetypal, has become part of the vocabulary of modern culture, and the novella Notes from Underground is rightly called the prologue to twentieth-century literature. The novelty of the present study is that, despite the existence of a number of works focused on the study of the "underground" in the literary world of Dostoevsky, and the wide scope for a comparative analysis of the works of Dostoevsky and Faulkner, the problem of the "underground" has not previously been considered from this perspective. This study draws on a number of methodologies alongside the comparative typological, including the doctrine of archetypes originated in late antique philosophy, the theory of archetypes first developed by C. G. Jung, and the archetypal approach found in literary criticism. As the results of the study show, in the archetypal character of the Underground Man, the model of "underground" consciousness is clearly expressed (Man-god consciousness, one's own inconsistencies with the ideal, cruel self-punishment and aesthetization of it, estrangement, and spiritual decay) and may be defined in a broad sense - at the stage of the formation of an "underground" worldview; and in a narrower sense - when complete moral alienation results in a state of "underground". Idealization of the past, depicted in Sartoris (the "heroism" of young Bayard, the symbolic "deafness" of old Bayard, the "serenity" of Narcissa, the infantilism and desire to hide from life in a house surrounded by cedars demonstrated by her brother Horace), is functionally similar to the feeling of "sublime and beautiful" by the Underground Man of Dostoevsky and reflects the Man-god consciousness leading the characters of the novel to moral estrangement ("underground" in the broad sense). In the character of young Bayard, the "underground" matrix is fully realized, which allows us to define him as the actual Underground Man ("underground" in the narrow sense).

AB  - In this paper we present a sun position sensor platform with a scalable approach for the 3D integration of the sensor optics. This would facilitate the sun position sensor miniaturization, reduces fabrication cost and mitigates the need for sensor calibration. The sun position sensor platform is implemented in a seven mask BICMOS technology with optical windows between the light masking layer and CMOS image sensor implemented by adhesively bonded glass windows. The CMOS sensor functionality is experimentally verified by modulation of a light spot using a laser. The proposed approach enables wafer-scale fabrication of the 3D optics that includes the wafer stepper accurate overlay alignment of the apertures. This mitigates the need for cumbersome alignment of the apertures at die or package level and facilitates further miniaturization, accuracy and sensor cost.

TI  - Characterizing Forest Dynamics with Landsat-Derived Phenology Curves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat is among the most popular satellites used for forest change assessments. Traditionally, Landsat data users relied on annual or biennial images to measure forest recovery after disturbance, a process that is difficult to monitor at broad scales. With the availability of free Landsat data, intra-annual change analyses are now possible. Phenology, the timing of cyclical vegetation events, can be estimated using indices derived from intra-annual remote sensing data and used to classify different vegetation types after a disturbance. We used a smoothed harmonic modelling approach to estimate NDVI and NBR phenology patterns in pre- and post-fire Landsat sample pixels for two forest groups in South Carolina, using nearby unburned samples as an approximate control group. These methods take advantage of all available images collected by Landsat 5, 7, and 8 for the study area. We found that within burned samples, there were differences in phenology for the two forest groups, while the unburned samples showed no forest group differences. Phenology patterns also differed based on fire severity. These methods take advantage of the freely available Landsat archive and can be used to characterize intra-annual fluctuations in vegetation following a variety of disturbances in the southeastern U.S. and other regions. Our approach builds on other harmonic approaches that use the Landsat archive to detect forest change, such as the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm, and provides a tool to describe post-disturbance forest change.

TI  - Disinformation in Poland: Thematic Classification Based on Content Analysis of Fake News From 2019
T2  - CYBERPSYCHOLOGY-JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RESEARCH ON CYBERSPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents a qualitative study of fake news on Polish-language internet media that seeks to arrive at their thematic classification in order to identify areas particularly vulnerable to disinformation in Poland. Fake news examples from 2019 were selected using popular Polish fact-checking sites (N = 192) and subjected to textual analysis and coding procedure to establish the thematic categories and specific topics most often encountered in this type of disinformation, with the following thematic categories identified in the process: political and economic; social; gossip/rumour; extreme; pseudo-scientific; worldview; historical; and commercial. The study culminates in a critical interpretation of results and discussion of the phenomenon in its Polish and international contexts. Among discussed conclusions is the dominance of content related to the government, Catholic Church, and LGBT issues in the Polish context, as well as the longevity of health-based fake news, especially anti-vaccination content, that points to the global impact of fake news and calls for action to prevent its spread.

TI  - Modernization of Chinese Philosophical Methodology: Zhang Dainian's Innovation and the Challenges of Neo-Materialism
T2  - ASIAN STUDIES-AZIJSKE STUDIJE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper aims to shed light on certain methodological challenges that Chinese intellectuals faced in the process of coming to terms with Marxist thought. Even at the beginning of these processes, i.e., in the first decades of the 20th century, Chinese theorists faced several difficulties regarding the issue of cross-cultural philosophical syntheses. Thus, in their endeavours to adapt Marxism to the specifically Chinese worldview, they sought suitable adaptations of traditional philosophical methodologies that would enable them to fruitfully integrate classical Chinese and modern Marxist discourses. Zhang Dainian (1909-2004) has played a particularly prominent role in this process. Therefore, this paper aims to shed light on his contribution to the establishment of new Chinese and cross-cultural philosophical methodologies. In terms of exploring general philosophical issues, Zhang established a unique philosophical system known as "neo-materialism" in which he attempted to integrate Marxist materialism with some basic approaches of traditional Chinese philosophy. The crucial features that defined this philosophical system were based on his innovative methodology, which is critically presented in this paper.

AB  - Lately, Chile has been struck with two significant events that have made its citizens rethink and adapt their worldview and activities in various dimensions. The recent social outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted almost any institution, and public higher education is no exception. Emergency remote teaching has arrived and professors have made all the possible efforts to deliver a quality education given the limitations. In this article, we portray teachers' experience belonging to the FCFM, one of the most prestigious Chilean engineering and science schools. We implemented two surveys, one on each semester of the year 2020, to understand their main difficulties, concerns, and appreciations. Frequencies and regression analyses were conducted. Results show that teachers' experience has improved through the year. The gained experience in the first semester has made them adapt their ways of teaching, design a better course and enhance their interaction with students through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous strategies.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF BIOPHISICAL PARAMETERS IN RICE CROPPING SYSTEM FROM SENTINEL-2 DATA AND HYBRID APPROACH: PERSPECTIVE FOR PRECISION AGRICULTURE APPLICATION
T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The availability of information able to assess crop nutritional status in space and time is a crucial issue to support sustainable agriculture in smart farming framework. Remote sensing techniques have become popular methods to support precision farming activities by producing spatial variability maps of crop conditions. In this framework, an experimental activity has been conducted to estimate Leaf Area index (LAI) and test potentiality of Canopy Nitrogen Content (CNC) retrieval, due to the importance of these parameters for assessing crop nutritional status. This study focuses on rice and retrievals have been conducted using a hybrid approach based on Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) simulations and Machine Learning Regression Algorithms (MLRA). A Look Up Table of rice spectra, with a cardinality of 2000 samples, was generated ranging crop parameters as input to the PROSPECT-PRO RTM. Simulations were resampled to 8 bands Sentinel 2-like configuration and were then used to train Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Neural Network (NN) MLR algorithms, also testing a sample selection procedure based on Active Learning (AL). Cross-validation results showed good performance for LAI retrieval using both the standard hybrid model (GPR: R2 similar to 0.78, NN: R2 similar to 0.72) and AL approach (GPR: R2 similar to 0.71, NN: R2 similar to 0.67). Preliminary tests conducted to estimate CNC revealed promising results for plant nutritional status assessment. The within-field spatial variation of estimated CNC from Sentinel-2 (S2) data in a precision farming experiment resulted coherent with the observed heterogeneity in the field and to corresponding prescription maps used to manage the fertilisation.

TI  - Assessment of NO<sub>2</sub> Pollution Level during the COVID-19 Lockdown in a Romanian City
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates changes in pollution associated with the lockdown period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Galati (45.43 degrees N, 28.03 degrees E), a Romanian city located in the southeast of Romania. The study is focused on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a trace gas which can be related to emissions from industrial activities, heating, and transportation. The investigation is based on in situ observations from local Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) and mobile remote sensing observations by Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. We also show results of the NO2 vertical column measured by TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), a space instrument onboard of satellite mission Sentinel-5P, to complement local ground-based measurements. For in situ observations, the lockdown interval (23 March 2020-15 May 2020) was separated from normal periods. The decrease in local NO2 concentration during lockdown, measured in situ, is rather small, of about 10-40% at the most, is observed only at some stations, and is better seen during workdays than during weekends. We conclude that the decrease in NO2 content over Galati city during lockdown is relatively small and may be attributed to the reduction in local traffic, a consequence of special measures and restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 lockdown by the Romanian authorities.

TI  - A single semi-analytical algorithm to retrieve chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration in oligo-to-hypereutrophic waters of a tropical reservoir cascade
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown the challenges in using a single model to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) in water bodies with widely differing characteristics. A single model based on remote sensing to map the Chl-a distribution across the entire Tiete River Cascade System (TRCS) serves as a cost and time-efficient alternative to the conventional monitoring by providing trophic status over space and time. The Tiete River contains one of the largest cascade reservoir systems in the world, which sustains important ecological and socio-economic activities in the SAo Paulo State, Brazil. Surplus nutrients in water draining its surrounding catchments have been the main cause of eutrophication in the reservoirs of the TRCS. To assess the trophic state of the reservoirs, Chl-a has been regularly monitored by sampling points. However, they are limited by operational costs and dependent on weather conditions. Moreover, the current sampling method only produces point-based measurements. In this paper, we calibrate remote sensing images based on the absorption coefficient to map the spatial distribution patterns of Chl-a levels in the reservoirs. Mapping is done by estimating the Chl-a concentration. The absorption coefficients were retrieved from OLI/Landsat images using the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA). The total absorption (at) in 482 nm and 655 nm retrieved by QAA presented NRMSE of 17% and 18.5%, respectively. Both at (482 and 655 nm) were used in the model calibration and presented a satisfactory result covering all data ranges, with R-2 of 0.646 and NRMSE of 15.3%. The proposed model in this study to retrieve Chl-a maps with relatively high accuracy can be incorporated into the operational monitoring system of the TRCS at a low cost that can provide timely information for reservoir managers to carry out necessary actions. This may include mitigating environmental impacts caused by sudden algae blooms.

TI  - Semantically Enriched Crop Type Classification and Linked Earth Observation Data to Support the Common Agricultural Policy Monitoring
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, massive amounts of satellite images are becoming available that can be enriched with semantic annotations for the creation of value-added earth observation products. One challenge is to extract knowledge from the raw satellite data in an automated way and to effectively manage the extracted information in a semantic way, to allow fast and accurate decisions of spatiotemporal nature in a real operational scenario. In this work, we present a framework that combines supervised learning for crop type classification on satellite imagery time-series with semantic web and linked data technologies to assist in the implementation of rule sets by the European common agricultural policy (CAP). The framework collects georeferenced data that are available online and satellite images from the Sentinel-2 mission. We analyze image time-series that cover the entire cultivation period and link each parcel with a specific crop. On top of that, we introduce a semantic layer to facilitate a knowledge-driven management of the available information, capitalizing on ontologies for knowledge representation and semantic rules, to identify possible farmers noncompliance according to the Greening 1 (crop diversification) and SMR 1 rule (protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates) rules of the CAP. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed integrated approach in three different scenarios for crop type monitoring and consistency checking for noncompliance to the CAP rules: the smart sampling of on-the-spot checks; the automatic detection of CAP's Greening 1 rule; and the automatic detection of susceptible parcels according to the CAP's SMR 1 rule.

TI  - Biomonitoring of Heavy Metals: The Unexplored Role of Marine Sessile Taxa
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Coastal areas are known to receive significant anthropogenic inputs, mainly deriving from metropolitan areas, industries, and activities related to tourism. Among these inputs, some trace elements are listed as priority pollutants in the European Water Framework Directive, due to their ability to bioaccumulate in organisms. Many studies have been conducted on heavy metals (HMs) accumulation and on their possible effects on different edible marine species. While the most studied sessile organisms are bivalves, in the current review, we focus our attention on other sessile taxa (sponges, cnidarians, bryozoans, polychaetes, cirripeds, and tunicates), proposed as bioindicators in coastal shallow waters. Although their potential as bioindicator tools has been repeatedly highlighted in the literature, these organisms are still poorly investigated and considered for monitoring. In this context, we analyze the available literature about this topic, in order to summarize the current knowledge and identify possible applications of these organisms in a bioremediation scenario.

TI  - A comprehensive high cost drugs dataset from the NHS in England - An OpenSAFELY-TPP Short Data Report.
T2  - Wellcome open research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no routine comprehensive hospital medicines data from the UK available to researchers. These records can be important for many analyses including the effect of certain medicines on the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. With the approval of NHS England, we set out to obtain data on one specific group of medicines, "high-cost drugs" (HCD) which are typically specialist medicines for the management of long-term conditions, prescribed by hospitals to patients. Additionally, we aimed to make these data available to all approved researchers in OpenSAFELY-TPP. This report is intended to support all studies carried out in OpenSAFELY-TPP, and those elsewhere, working with this dataset or similar data. Methods: Working with the North East Commissioning Support Unit and NHS Digital, we arranged for collation of a single national HCD dataset to help inform responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset was developed from payment submissions from hospitals to commissioners. Results: In the financial year (FY) 2018/19 there were 2.8 million submissions for 1.1 million unique patient IDs recorded in the HCD. The average number of submissions per patient over the year was 2.6. In FY 2019/20 there were 4.0 million submissions for 1.3 million unique patient IDs. The average number of submissions per patient over the year was 3.1. Of the 21 variables in the dataset, three are now available for analysis in OpenSafely-TPP: Financial year and month of drug being dispensed; drug name; and a description of the drug dispensed. Conclusions: We have described the process for sourcing a national HCD dataset, making these data available for COVID-19-related analysis through OpenSAFELY-TPP and provided information on the variables included in the dataset, data coverage and an initial descriptive analysis.

TI  - How Does Tourism Affect Urban Ecological Standards? A Geospatial Analysis of Wetland Transformations in the Coastal Resort Town of Digha, West Bengal, India
T2  - GEOSPATIAL TECHNOLOGY AND SMART CITIES: ICT, Geoscience Modeling, GIS and Remote Sensing
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - ' The growth of tourism often expedites the process of urbanization in terms of expanding built-up areas and other impervious surfaces at the cost of the original natural serenity. The coastal resort town of Digha, situated at the Medinipur coastal plain of West Bengal, India, had been developed after substantial land use conversions and loss of perennial interdunal wetlands. The effects of wetland transformations are more evident in terms of continuous ecosystem degeneration and reduction of subsistence-based livelihood provisions for the local populace. However, this trend of urban expansion was severely contested by the 'smart city' concept which the State Government had envisaged for the sustainable development of Digha Township in recent years. This new concept advocated for a balanced land use planning giving adequate attention to its green infrastructure and urban ecological standards towards developing the cities of the new century. An appropriate assessment of the present patterns of urbanization and consequent environmental transformations thus becomes the prerequisite of any such development endeavour. In this context, the present study aimed to quantify the cumulative stress of expanding buildups on the interdunal wetland ecosystems around the renowned coastal resort town of Digha of this region through a coupling of geospatial technologies with statistical analyses. For this purpose, Normalized Difference Built-up Index and Soil Moisture Index were derived from the multispectral Landsat images of the year 2000 and 2018, respectively, as indicative physical and bio-physical parameters. The linear maximum likelihood regression model was then applied on these derivatives to infer the spatio-temporal relationships between the expansion of buildups and changes in wetland characteristics of this area. Results indicated that the magnitude of wetland encroachment was more severe within the newly developed high-density built-up areas. Moreover, the interdunal wetlands were found to be shrinking more rapidly in 2018 compared to that of the 2000 scenario in direct correspondence with the enhanced growth of built-up zones. Remarkably, a few sites in the rural fringes were also experiencing aggravated loss of soil moisture contents chiefly due to the establishment of isolated resort compounds and gated housing complexes in spite of being quite far from the core urban zones. Incessantly changing tourist preferences towards secluded lifestyles and demand for serene landscapes as well as lacklustre implementation status of land development regulations were primarily attributed to this sporadic nature of land use conversions in this region. Based on the findings, a few realistically attainable management guidelines have been recommended towards developing a true 'smart city' in terms of both ecological composure and sustenance of tourism initiatives.

TI  - Morphological Convolutional Neural Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become quite popular for solving many different tasks in remote sensing data processing. The convolution is a linear operation, which extracts features from the input data. However, nonlinear operations are able to better characterize the internal relationships and hidden patterns within complex remote sensing data, such as hyperspectral images (HSIs). Morphological operations are powerful nonlinear transformations for feature extraction that preserve the essential characteristics of the image, such as borders, shape, and structural information. In this article, a new end-to-end morphological deep learning framework (called MorphConvHyperNet) is introduced. The proposed approach efficiently models nonlinear information during the training process of HSI classification. Specifically, our method includes spectral and spatial morphological blocks to extract relevant features from the HSI input data. These morphological blocks consist of two basic 2-D morphological operators (erosion and dilation) in the respective layers, followed by a weighted combination of the feature maps. Both layers can successfully encode the nonlinear information related to shape and size, playing an important role in classification performance. Our experimental results, obtained on five widely used HSIs, reveal that our newly proposed MorphConvHyperNet offers comparable (and even superior) performance when compared to traditional 2-D and 3-D CNNs for HSI classification.

TI  - Primary Religious Consciousness in the Development of Civilizations
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, there has been a growing tendency to explain the peculiarities and features of religious consciousness in its various aspects bymore openly or covertly suggesting their meaning and significance. This trend in its own way intersects with the accelerated "democratic" marginalization of religious consciousness in Western countries and the destruction of the religious bases and roots of civilizationl. The author associates the return to religious consciousness with geopolitical phenomena - the civilizational and imperial heritage is increasingly concentrated in the rivalry of world powers. This article discusses the primary significance of religious consciousness and of the sacral spiritual cosmogonic worldview that emerges in research on ancient civilizations as well as in ethnological and anthropological studies in Latin America and other regions of the world. Using the examples of the two ancient centers of civilization, Gobekli Tepe and Chavin de Huantar, the ideas of ontological cosmogonic perspectivism, which are becoming increasingly entrenched in ethnological research, are unfolded and discussed. In the aspect of "return" to the religious consciousness and the sacred plane of the world structure, the question of the challenges and perspectives of the development of Western civilization is considered.

AB  - The world is going through a time of extraordinarily rapid change, marked by growing uncertainty in all domains of life, growing military conflicts in various regions, and the spread of various anthropocenic challenges. The over-alignment of globalization is observed, with the emergence of various heterogeneous tendencies, promoted by military and economic rivals of major geopolitical powers, expanding trade wars, and changes in relations between states caused by a pandemic. In this confusion of change, a wave of civilizational research is emerging that responds in its own way to the processes of globalizational heterogeneity and geopolitical shifts. The role of civilizational identity and civilizational imagination is becoming increasingly important. The article explores various aspects of the concept of civilization and civilizational imagination and argues that in the current geopolitics and relations between states, the importance of the concept of civilization and civilizational imagination is becoming more and more entrenched in a multicenter and multipolar worldview.

TI  - Feng Shui Cosmology and Philosophy in Native Americans' Worldview
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - In studying the characteristics of cultures, literature and philosophies of different civilisations, scholars inevitably wish to search for similar and different features inherent in particular societies. When this desire is completely justified, then certain questions remain that require additional reflection. For instance, studying the cosmological and natural-philosophical ideas inherent in Ancient China and among Native Americans, scholars face the difficult task of logically substantiating the possibility of studying these two diametrically opposed cultures together. This article is based on a general overview of cosmological and philosophical views in Ancient China and among Native Americans. The authors reveal an important principle that significantly distinguishes "non-Western" cultures and manifests itself in ethnocentrism and harmonization of the relationship between humans and nature (Feng shui). The article gives a logical basis for research and attempts to answer the question of whether Feng shui practice is a science or a religion. To this end, the legacy of Yang Yunsong, one of the founders of the teachings of Feng shui, a Chinese sage of the Tang era from Guangdong province, was studied. The authors suggest that Yang Yunsong's cosmology, geomancy, and Feng shui practice have much in common with the worldview of indigenous peoples around the world, particularly the Native Americans.

TI  - Mapping past landscapes using landsat data: Upper Parana River Basin in 1985
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, the science of remote sensing of the Earth's surface has produced an enormous amount of data. In parallel, with the increase in computational capacity, several classification methods have been applied to the satellite retrievals. This timely combination allows recovering more accurate knowledge about the land cover maps of past times. Therefore, the main goal of this work was to develop a land cover product for the year 1985 in the Upper Parana River Basin (UPRB-1985), one of the largest and most economically important river basins in the world. The land cover map was developed using a supervised classifier - SVM (Support Vector Machine) applied to data from Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) sensor. The classification process was carried out based on 52 scenes collected during 1985 and a total of 17,040 training samples across the basin. Pixel and Object-based methods were used to classify Landsat scenes. The generated mapping accuracy was assessed using statistical criteria adopted in the literature - Global Accuracy and Kappa Index. The McNemar's test result showed no significant differences (at the 5% level) between the Pixel-based and Object-based classifications, even with the Object-based classification accuracy was slightly higher (Global Accuracy of 79.8%). However, some relationship between the relief and the classification approach was observed. In sub-basins with high slopes, the mean overall accuracy values of the Pixel-based classification approach were 13.1% higher than the Object-based approach. By mapping past land cover, this work is strategic information to understand ongoing processes, as well as to assess changes in land cover that have occurred over time and evaluate to what extent they explain the variability in the hydrology of the region.

TI  - Testing Evapotranspiration Estimates Based on MODIS Satellite Data in the Assessment of the Groundwater Recharge of Karst Aquifers in Southern Italy
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In many Italian regions, and particularly in southern Italy, karst aquifers are the main sources of drinking water and play a crucial role in the socio-economic development of the territory. Hence, estimating the groundwater recharge of these aquifers is a fundamental task for the proper management of water resources, while also considering the impacts of climate changes. In the southern Apennines, the assessment of hydrological parameters that is needed for the estimation of groundwater recharge is a challenging issue, especially for the spatial and temporal inhomogeneity of networks of rain and air temperature stations, as well as the variable geomorphological features and land use across mountainous karst areas. In such a framework, the integration of terrestrial and remotely sensed data is a promising approach to limit these uncertainties. In this research, estimations of actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge using remotely sensed data gathered by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite in the period 2000-2014 are shown for karst aquifers of the southern Apennines. To assess the uncertainties affecting conventional methods based on empirical formulas, the values estimated by the MODIS dataset were compared with those calculated by Coutagne, Turc, and Thornthwaite classical empirical formulas, which were based on the recordings of meteorological stations. The annual rainfall time series of 266 rain gauges and 150 air temperature stations, recorded using meteorological networks managed by public agencies in the period 2000-2014, were considered for reconstructing the regional distributed models of actual evapotranspiration (AET) and groundwater recharge. Considering the MODIS AET, the mean annual groundwater recharge for karst aquifers was estimated to be about 448 mm center dot year(-1). In contrast, using the Turc, Coutagne, and Thornthwaite methods, it was estimated as being 494, 533, and 437 mm center dot year(-1), respectively. The obtained results open a new methodological perspective for the assessment of the groundwater recharge of karst aquifers at the regional and mean annual scales, allowing for limiting uncertainties and taking into account a spatial resolution greater than that of the existing meteorological networks. Among the most relevant results obtained via the comparison of classical approaches used for estimating evapotranspiration is the good matching of the actual evapotranspiration estimated using MODIS data with the potential evapotranspiration estimated using the Thornthwaite formula. This result was considered linked to the availability of soil moisture for the evapotranspiration demand due to the relevant precipitation in the area, the general occurrence of soils covering karst aquifers, and the dense vegetation.

AB  - Deformation monitoring is a common practice in most of dams to ensure their structural health and safety status. Systematic monitoring is frequently carried out by means of geotechnical sensors and geodetic techniques that, although very precise an accurate, can be time-consuming and economically costly. Remote sensing techniques are proved to be very effective in assessing deformation. Changes in the structure, shell or associated infrastructures of dams, including adjacent slopes, can be efficiently recorded by using satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Inteferometry (InSAR) techniques, in particular, Muti-Temporal InSAR time-series analyses. This is a mature technology nowadays but not very common as a routine procedure for dam monitoring. Today, thanks to the availability of spaceborne satellites with high spatial resolution SAR images and short revisit times, this technology is a powerful cost-effective way to monitor millimeter-level displacements of the dam structure and its surroundings. What is more, the potential of the technique is increased since the Copernicus C-band SAR Sentinel-1 satellites are in orbit, due to the high revisit time of 6 days and the free data availability. ReMoDams is a Spanish research project devoted to provide the deformation monitoring of several embankments dams using advances time-series InSAR techniques. One of these dams is The Arenoso dam, located in the province of Cordova (southern Spain). This dam has been monitored using Sentinel-1 SAR data since the beginning of the mission in 2014. In this paper, we show the processing of 382 SLC SAR images both in ascending and descending tracks until March 2019. The results indicate that the main displacement of the dam in this period is in the vertical direction with a rate in the order of -1 cm/year in the central part of the dam body.

TI  - The Use of Deep Machine Learning for the Automated Selection of Remote Sensing Data for the Determination of Areas of Arable Land Degradation Processes Distribution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil degradation processes are widespread on agricultural land. Ground-based methods for detecting degradation require a lot of labor and time. Remote methods based on the analysis of vegetation indices can significantly reduce the volume of ground surveys. Currently, machine learning methods are increasingly being used to analyze remote sensing data. In this paper, the task is set to apply deep machine learning methods and methods of vegetation indices calculation to automate the detection of areas of soil degradation development on arable land. In the course of the work, a method was developed for determining the location of degraded areas of soil cover on arable fields. The method is based on the use of multi-temporal remote sensing data. The selection of suitable remote sensing data scenes is based on deep machine learning. Deep machine learning was based on an analysis of 1028 scenes of Landsats 4, 5, 7 and 8 on 530 agricultural fields. Landsat data from 1984 to 2019 was analyzed. Dataset was created manually for each pair of "Landsat scene"/"agricultural field number"(for each agricultural field, the suitability of each Landsat scene was assessed). Areas of soil degradation were calculated based on the frequency of occurrence of low NDVI values over 35 years. Low NDVI values were calculated separately for each suitable fragment of the satellite image within the boundaries of each agricultural field. NDVI values of one-third of the field area and lower than the other two-thirds were considered low. During testing, the method gave 12.5% of type I errors (false positive) and 3.8% of type II errors (false negative). Independent verification of the method was carried out on six agricultural fields on an area of 713.3 hectares. Humus content and thickness of the humus horizon were determined in 42 ground-based points. In arable land degradation areas identified by the proposed method, the probability of detecting soil degradation by field methods was 87.5%. The probability of detecting soil degradation by ground-based methods outside the predicted regions was 3.8%. The results indicate that deep machine learning is feasible for remote sensing data selection based on a binary dataset. This eliminates the need for intermediate filtering systems in the selection of satellite imagery (determination of clouds, shadows from clouds, open soil surface, etc.). Direct selection of Landsat scenes suitable for calculations has been made. It allows automating the process of constructing soil degradation maps.

TI  - A novel method for comparing passenger car fleets and identifying high-chance gross emitting vehicles using kerbside remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification and comparison of NOX emission from in-situ car fleets, and identification of the highest emitters is an ongoing challenge. This challenge will become more important as new and increasingly complex emissions removal systems penetrate the market. We combine real-world data with new-to-the-field statistical methods to describe fleet-scale emissions behaviours and identify candidate gross-emitter vehicles.19,605 passenger cars were observed using a Remote Sensing Device across Aberdeen in 2015. Of these, 736 were Euro 6 Passenger Cars. The distribution of observed pollutant per unit of fuel burnt ratios for most fuel type and Euro standards followed an asymmetrical shape best characterised by the Gumbel distribution. The Gumbel distribution approach was not able to fully replicate the distribution of measurements of petrol or Euro 6 diesel cars due to the presence of a subset of high-emitting outliers, ranging from the 13th percentile for Euro 3 petrol to the 2nd percentile for Euro 6 petrol, with Euro 6 diesel having a 5th percentile outlier value. No outlier fraction was observed for pre-Euro 6 diesels.The off-model fractions resembled Gumbel distributed data and in some cases could be modelled as a separate distribution with the fleet behaving as a superposition of them. It is shown that VSP was not directly linked to this behaviour and it is hypothesised that it is caused by the emissions control systems operating sub-optimally. The reasons for sub-optimal operation are beyond the scope of this paper but may be linked to air-fuel mixture sensors, cold-start running and deterioration of the catalytic converter. Larger data-sets with more Euro 6 passenger cars are required to fully test this. Application of this methodology to larger data sets from more widely deployed remote sensing devices will allow observers to identify potentially problematic vehicles for further investigation into their emission control systems.

TI  - Evaluation of the Worldwide Wave Energy Distribution Based on ERA5 Data and Altimeter Measurements
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing necessity in reducing CO2 emissions and implementing clean energy technologies, and over the years the marine environment has shown a huge potential in terms of renewable energy. From this perspective, extracting marine renewable energy represents one of the most important technological challenges of the 21st century. In this context, the objective of the present work is to provide a new and comprehensive understanding concerning the global wave energy resources based on the most recent results coming from two different databases, ERA5 and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative for Sea State. In this study, an analysis was first made based only on the ERA5 data and concerns the 30-year period of 1989-2018. The mean wave power, defined as the energy flux per unit of wave-crest length, was evaluated at this step. Besides the spatial distribution of this parameter, its seasonal, inter, and mean annual variability was also assessed on a global scale. As a second step, the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area was analyzed for a 27-year period (1992-2018) with both ERA5 and the satellite data from the European Space Agency being considered. The comparison indicates a relatively good concordance between the results provided by the two databases in terms of mean wave energy density, although the satellite data indicate slightly higher energy values.

AB  - The era of modern (Art Nouveau) was a significant period in the development of human civilization. It marked profound changes in all spheres of society - in politics, economics, social relations. culture. and art. Philosophy was a key source of global transformations - from the transcendental ideas of the representatives of German classical philosophy to the too contradictory Friedrich Nietzsche and the author of "intuitive reality" Henri Louis Bergson. The research aims to detect the relationship between the philosophy of the XIX-th and early XX-th centuries and the economic theory of organization. The study used logical and historical methods, scientific abstraction, analogies, comparative and systems approaches. The article identifies the relationship between philosophy and the economic theory of organization defines common features that reflect the worldview created by the philosophy of modernity. Simultaneously, within the framework of the key neoclassical paradigm, there were multidirectional vectors of research in the economic theory of modernity's organization using different methodologies and tools.

AB  - Introduction. In the study the authors consider the ways of understanding and overcoming the extreme conditions of the Great Patriotic The task is to define the forms and ways of "overcoming" the war conditions and its traumatizing consequences developed by Russians and to identify their connection with traditional types of worldview and folk ritual practices. Methods and materials. The analysis of folk stories recorded among different generations and rural Russian areas as well as memories about the wartime and the period after the Great Patriotic War compose the base of the article. According to the main task the authors use the method widely used in the Russian Ethnography which is called the "inside the tradition" view, or analysis from the position of its bearers. Analysis. The natural alternation of periods of prosperity and crises explains the inevitability of war, but according to popular beliefs, the impoverishment of the sacred sphere of life is the main factor of a tragedy. On the contrary, human turning to God and his / her repentance determine the possibility of overcoming a tragedy. The concept of "a rule" (and its violation) as well as the concept of "a destiny" (a shared fate) which must be restored and redistributed under the crisis according to popular beliefs play an important role in the mechanism of developing ways to "overcome" the war among the Russians during the wartime. Wartime ritual practices including baking and cutting bread, redistributing it to the front line, organizing joint meals, etc. confirm the statement. The process of the revival of religious (Orthodox) practices, and the formation of a collective memory of the war and the fallen heroes was inspired from below, from the masses. This initiative included folk forms of veneration and remembrance of the dead, the creation of sacred places associated with the war and the memory about it. Women, who became the main keepers of the tradition, who took upon themselves the functions of harmonizing the socio-psychological situation in rural areas during the difficult war and post-war years, were especially active in these processes. Results. The authors confirm the particular role of traditional types of worldview influencing the modern collective memory as well as social practices during both extreme conditions and everyday life. Ordinary people preferred to turn to centuries-old spiritual traditions of overcoming war traumas and to use the experience of preserving collective memory of them formed in the pre-revolutionary time within the peasant and Cossack communities.

AB  - Warfield believes that Calvinism could be used in the three usages. First, it means Calvin’s own theological position, indicating various theological, ecclesial, political issues. The second option is the system of doctrine taught by Calvin and the Augustinianism associated with the whole body of the Reformers, in distinction from the Lutheran Churches. The third use of the term Calvinism designates the most broad way in which Calvinism is involved to Christian Worldview in terms of the entire body of conceptions including theological, ethical, philosophical, social, political, and educational perspectives.While Warfield prefers the second usage of the term, he does not neglect the first and third ones. Warfield chooses the second usage of calvinism, and provides the focal point of the calvinistic view, by exploring the life and works of Calvin, considering the Christian theism, and differentiating it from Lutheranism and Arminianism.Warfield’s perspective of calvinism as the Reformed heritage implies four significant points of view. First, calvinism as the system of doctrine taught by the Reformed churches does not indicates the certain doctrine such as predestination, but rather signifies religion which encourages the Christian life in relation to God. Second, it terminates a misconception that calvinism is the dry and outmoded philosophy. Third, calvinsim for Worfield is not narrow but includes comprehensive perspective which shows a close relationship between other Protestant groups. Finally, he provides a fundamental framework the Christian theism in Calvin’s theology, helping today’s Reformed theologions who need an alternative to the modern context which is pervaded with atheism.

AB  - The term‘Organic' not only is a common feature of German Idealism whose representatives are Schelling and Hegel, but is also commonplace between the history of religious school and the Dutch Ethical theologians. Since this terminology has been used among the academic areas, such as philosophy, the school of religion, and theology, it is not surprising that several lines of scholarship have identified them as the son of German Idealism. However, more recent scholars argued that Bavinck's and Kuyper's organic thoughts are influenced not by German Idealism but by their own Reformed predecessors, such as Calvin and the Reformed orthodox theologians. The present essay examines Kuyper's and Bavinck's organic worldview, comparing each other, and demonstrates that their organic worldview is not similar to Hegelian Idealism as such. Rather, the more typical approach to the language of 'organic' was advocacy of the scriptural revelation, providing the Christian worldview which is able to explain the whole system of the human life.

AB  - This paper presents a technique to improve the accuracy of navigation of a satellite navigation system in the urban environment by effectively detecting and removing multipath signals in real time using 3D map information. To improve the satellite navigation accuracy, we designed a system that can implement an effective real-time ray-tracing calculation with 3D high-speed computation engine. In this process, objective multipath satellites can be identified and separated by collecting the actual satellite data around a complex urban environment and around the partial shadow areas during the satellite navigation. The Unity3D Engine ensures a real-time and efficient computing performance in large sized complex map environments and multiple access situations. By adapting the functionality of Unity3D, the GPU computation for satellite visibility is efficiently implemented in a complex map environment, resulting into the implementation of a real-time ray tracing function, even in a mobile platform. Consequently, the computation time for detecting a multipath signal with one set of satellite data is shortened. In addition, the root mean square error in estimating the horizontal position using the GPS L1 pseudorange least square navigation solution, which eliminates multipath signals, is reduced.

AB  - Background: Mammography screening has become widely spread and provided a marked increase in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosis. In DCIS, the ductal epithelium proliferates without invasion through the basal cell membrane. However, histologic underestimation can happen in some cases.Objective: To analyze the rate of histologic underestimation (histopathologic results upgraded to invasive carcinoma after surgery) and the rate of positive results of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients diagnosed with DCIS in a Brazilian public hospital.Methods: We reviewed medical records of all consecutive patients admitted between 2009 and 2013 whose initial diagnosis was DCIS through core needle biopsy. DCIS cases with a high risk of invasion underwent SLNB. We excluded cases with invasion or micro-invasion components in the first biopsy.Results: A total of 86 women were included, most with microcalcifications as the primary radiological lesion (73.2%), and underwent preoperative biopsy, with an invasive component in 21 (24.4%) in the final pathology report. Most had invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST): 52.3% (n = 11) and microinvasive tumors (7 cases, 33.3%). The main factors associated with histologic underestimation were nodular lesion (61.9%, p<0.001) and an ultra-sonography-guided biopsy (71.4%, p=0.0005). The positivity rate of SLNB was 4.3%. All these patients underwent mastectomy, and the initial histologic pattern was solid DCIS.Conclusion: The "histologic underestimation" rate among patients with DCIS was not low, and less than 5% of patients who underwent SLNB had axillary positivity. This result suggests that patients who have DCIS and a high risk of invasion and undergoing mastectomy should have SLNB. As to the patients who will undergo lumpectomy, SLNB could be omitted and could be performed if patients have upgraded to invasive breast cancer.

TI  - Relationship between academic performance and the indigenous status of Chilean students in standardized tests
T2  - EDUCAR
M3  - Article
AB  - In two regions of Chile approximately one third of the population is indigenous. In the schools of these regions, students of indigenous backgrounds experience learning difficulties because their language, worldview and episteme are not held in consideration. This article aims to empirically demonstrate whether there is a relationship between the percentage of indigenous students enrolled in an educational institution and the average performance of schools on national standardized tests. To this end, a quantitative ex post facto method with a non-experimental cross-sectional and correlational design was used. The results show that there is a negative correlation between the results in standardized mathematics and language tests and the percentage of indigenous students in educational institutions; the ethnic factor is a predictor that explains a small part of the results in standardized tests; and educational institutions with a low percentage of indigenous students have significantly higher results in standardized tests than those with a high percentage of indigenous students. In conclusion, schools with a high concentration of indigenous students achieve poorer academic results than those with fewer indigenous students in the two macro areas of Chile that have a large indigenous population.

AB  - As far as demand of electricity increasing, power generation from conventional and non-conventional sources also increasing. When numbers of power unit increases, the interconnection of these units also get complex and factor of overcurrent and reactive poweralso increases. For which renewable energy sources are playing a vital role to full fill electricity demand. The wind energy draws attention because of its low cost. The annual percentage increase in the wind farm is very high and now India is the fifth in the world with an installed capacity of about 21262 MW [1]. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), together with the distribution companies of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, has granted a wind capacity of 7.6 Gw in the last 15 months and intends to grant an extra 10 Gw in the year FY 2019 FY 2020[2]. It is found that when a non linear load is connected with the wind connected Double Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) system then there is a large amount of harmonics present in the generated electricity[3]. The proposed work shows the comparison of generated harmonics in electrical energy by wind connected DFIG system using hybrid active filter during linear and non-linear load. This work has a simulation of Grid Side Control (GSC) and Rotor Side Control (RSC) with hybrid active filter to reduce the harmonics in case of linear and non linear load. The result of this work showing that the value of harmonics reduced up to 4.96% from 29.66% when non linear load is connected with the system. It also shows that the value of harmonic is 0.14% when non linear load is not connected to the system. Many researches are going on for developing filters which can suppress the level of harmonics more than the Hybrid active power filter. The model for the proposed work is developed in MATLAB R2018a version. The model is drawn in simulink part of the MATLABSoftware.

TI  - Invasive breast cancer in ectopic axillary breast tissue - case report
T2  - ONCOLOGY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women in Poland. Rare, unusual forms of breast cancer remain a diagnostic problem. The incidence of ectopic breast glandular tissue in the general population varies between 0.4 and 6%. The same abnormalities and diseases as in the anatomical mammary gland may develop in this tissue. Breast cancer may develop as well.We present the case of a 36-year-old woman, who went to the doctor because of a nodule in the right armpit presented for 2 years. The patient was referred to a surgeon with suspicion of an epidermal cyst. The lesion was surgically removed and in the histopathological examination, the diagnose was: invasive breast cancer in ectopic glandular tissue. After imaging diagnostics, discussion of a multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic team, the patient was offered a surgical procedure - widening of the excision margins to obtain oncological completeness and axillary lymphadenectomy. After the surgery, due to the results of the histopathological examination, complementary systemic treatment (chemo- and hormone therapy) and radiotherapy were used.Doctors often do not consider the possibility of primary breast cancer occurring elsewhere than in the breast. Breast imaging does not always make it possible to diagnose the disease, and doctors performing and interpreting these tests often do not include primary armpit cancer in the differential diagnosis. This can cause a delay in diagnosis and worsen the prognosis.

TI  - Remote sensing metrics to assess exposure to residential greenness in epidemiological studies: A population case study from the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction/aims: Application of remote sensing-based metrics of exposure to vegetation in epidemiological studies of residential greenness is typically limited to several standard products. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most widely used, but its precision varies with vegetation density and soil color/ moisture. In areas with heterogeneous vegetation cover, the Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) corrects for soil brightness. Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU), measures the relative contribution of different land covers, and estimates percent of each over a unit area. We compared the precision of NDVI, SAVI and LSU for quantifying residential greenness in areas with high spatial heterogeneity in vegetation cover.Methods: NDVI, SAVI, and LSU in a 300 m radius surrounding homes of 3,188 cardiac patients living in Israel (Eastern Mediterranean) were derived from Landsat 30 m spatial resolution imagery. Metrics were compared to assess shifts in exposure quartiles and differences in vegetation detection as a function of overall greenness, climatic zones, and population density, using NDVI as the reference method.Results: For the entire population, the dispersion (SD) of the vegetation values detected was 60% higher when greenness was measured using LSU compared to NDVI: mean (SD) NDVI: 0.17 (0.05), LSU (%): 0.23 (0.08), SAVI: 0.12 (0.03). Importantly, with an increase in population density, the sensitivity of LSU, compared to NDVI, doubled: There was a 95% difference between the LSU and NDVI interquartile range in the highest population density quartile vs 47% in the lowest quartile. Compared to NDVI, exposures estimated by LSU resulted in 21% of patients changing exposure quartiles. In urban areas, the shift in exposure quartile depended on land cover characteristics. An upward shift occurred in dense urban areas, while no shift occurred in high and low vegetated urban areas.Conclusions: LSU was shown to outperform the commonly used NDVI in terms of accuracy and variability, especially in dense urban areas. Therefore, LSU potentially improves exposure assessment precision, implying reduced exposure misclassification.

CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - One of the major challenges in monitoring and managing food security is to provide reliable, consistent and scalable crop yield projections. For years, the trade-off between high spatial and temporal resolution coverage has limited remotely-sensed applications such as crop yield estimation at the field and sub-field scales. This study aimed to improve in-season yield estimation by coupling crop modelling and fused satellite images with a focus on wheat in Australia. The newly developed approach managed to estimate field-scale yield with RMSE of 674 kg/ha, without using any ground-calibration data, making it broadly applicable across regions. This method was found to be effective not only to produce field-scale yield estimations, but also to generate yield maps at 3 m resolution nearly three months before crop harvest.

AB  - In this essay the term "worldview" is understood, according to German tradition, both as a Weltbild, or world picture,' and Lebensanschauung, or outlook on life'. The article describes the analogies between generic worldview and linguistic worldview, taking into account their two properties, namely formal conservatism, and selectivity. Subsequently, genres whose worldviews expand beyond the level of linguistic expressibility are discussed on the example of the idyll and litany, i.e. poetic conventions which inspired their own painting and musical traditions. The article concludes with considerations on the sonnet as a convention that, nowadays, is regarded as emblematic for the lack of ideological commitment. However, as the author of the paper argues, in the initial period, the sonnet might have also been equipped with its own generic worldview.

AB  - Geothermal energy as renewable, reliable, and environmentally friendly is one of the most important energy resources. Based on government regulation about the National Energy Policy, the use of geothermal energy must reach 23% by 2025. This regulation is in line with the goal of the 7th of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In order to achieve the government's targets, a preliminary assessment on a wide scale by minimizing time consumption is necessary. Remote sensing technology utilizing radar and optic sensors promises as an alternative solution for preliminary surveys. The occurrence of geothermal system could be characterized by surface features associated with thermal system near the surface. Geothermal features originated from sub surface hydrothermal fluids to surface through fractures or pores in the rock formations. The chemical composition of the fluid composed by hot and acidic constituent affects the surrounding environment such as host rocks and vegetation. In this study, surface roughness and geobotanical analyses were used as indicator of geothermal features occurrence. The ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2 images were selected to calculate surface roughness and geobotanical anomalies including NDVI, GNDVI, SAVI, and RDVI, respectively. Combining ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2 images, we could characterize the occurrence of geothermal features by surface roughness more than 17.2 cm and the vegetation index less than 0.2. Accuracy of obtained occurrence map has been calculated about 71.43% with a predicting error rate of 28.57%. The likely prediction zones agreed to the up flow and discharge zones of geothermal system in selected study area.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature is a key indicator of a changing climate. A trivial change in temperature can result in significant changes in weather patterns with severe repercussions on ecology and socio-economic conditions of an area. This study aims to assess the changing trends in maximum and minimum temperatures in five climatic zones of Pakistan, and compare ground-based with satellite data from AIRS over these climatic zones of Pakistan. Mann Kendall test has been used to signify the temperature trends in all zones and seasons while Sen's slope value has been used to measure the magnitude of the trends for the time period 1978 to 2016. Ground observations have been compared with AIRS satellite observations for ascending and descending air temperatures by employing correlation and mean bias error. The results show that AIRS product (AIRSX3STM) underestimates T-max and T-min in all zones of Pakistan with the underestimation being most prominent in zone A. The trend analysis for maximum and minimum temperatures shows an increase in temperatures for all climate zones. Overall, Pakistan's maximum temperature increased by 0.026 degrees C/year with the maximum increase of 0.05 degrees C/year during pre-monsoon, and the minimum temperature increased by 0.027 degrees C/year.

TI  - Change Detection in Hyperdimensional Images Using Untrained Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep transfer-learning-based change detection methods are dependent on the availability of sensor-specific pretrained feature extractors. Such feature extractors are not always available due to lack of training data, especially for hyperspectral sensors and other hyperdimensional images. Moreover models trained on easily available multispectral (RGB/RGB-NIR) images cannot be reused on such hyperdimensional images due to their irregular number of bands. While hyperdimensional images show large number of spectral bands, they generally show much less spatial complexity, thus reducing the requirement of large receptive fields of convolution filters. Recent works in the computer vision have shown that even untrained deep models can yield remarkable result in some tasks like super-resolution and surface reconstruction. This motivates us to make a bold proposition that untrained lightweight deep model, initialized with some weight initialization strategy, can be used to extract useful semantic features from bi-temporal hyperdimensional images. Based on this proposition, we design a novel change detection framework for hyperdimensional images by extracting bitemporal features using an untrained model and further comparing the extracted features using deep change vector analysis to distinguish changed pixels from the unchanged ones. We further use the deep change hypervectors to cluster the changed pixels into different semantic groups. We conduct experiments on four change detection datasets: three hyperspectral datasets and a hyperdimensional polarimetric synthetic aperture radar dataset. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for change detection in hyperdimensional remote sensing data.

TI  - Explaining the Factors Shaping Two Different Beliefs about Cancer in Iran Based on Causal Layer Analysis "CLA"
T2  - ENTOMOLOGY AND APPLIED SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - 20 million people currently have cancer worldwide, and by 2020 this number will exceed 30 million. Chronic illnesses including cancer make challenges and threats such as destruction of body, soul, insecurity, loneliness, and hopelessness leading many patients to lose their hope for their disease. On the contrary, some people defend themselves against internal and external stress by learning, organizing, and adapting to health, happiness, and meaningful life. They can overcome their stress due to cancer, and also will have full hope of a cured follow-up and regain their health. This article aimed to explain the factors behind the formation of such different beliefs that people with/without cancer have in their lives. The method of causal layered analysis (CLA) is considered a critique of the dominant beliefs and at the same time contradictory about cancer in Iran. For this purpose, existing scientific texts, documents, journals, articles, and literary sources that were available on the factors underlying the formation of different beliefs about cancer were studied and complemented the constituents of the lithium layers to metaphors. Cancer as a disease and as an endpoint of life are two dominant beliefs that constitute the most superficial layer in society. There are different layers underlying these two beliefs. Changes in traumatic beliefs that lead to harm to the patient and reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of health services to the extent that they lead to developmental beliefs require special attention to their constituents in various substrates. It has ideological and even metaphors of community.

AB  - Agricultural water management is key for a sustainable agricultural productivity. Accurate soil moisture measurements are essential in irrigation management, hydrological modelling, ground water recharge, flood, and drought forecasting. There are many different techniques for estimating soil moisture at different scales, from point to landscape scales. In this paper, we used a modified version of change detection approach for near surface soil moisture modelling coupled with a Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) installed at a field site 100 km outside Vienna, Austria. The model allows a conversion of Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarization into soil moisture. The model is calibrated with 2019 CRNS data and validated with data from 2020 to 2021. The results showed the good performance of the model with a high correlation for the calibration (R-2 = 0.81) and predicted the soil moisture with an absolute error of 0.2%. This study is a major step in the monitoring of soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution by combining remote sensing and the CRNS based nuclear technology.

AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing technology and high-resolution satellite imagery offer great possibilities for understanding the earth's surfaces. However, satellite image classification is a challenging problem due to the high variability inherent in satellite data. For this purpose, two learning approaches are proposed and compared for classifying a large-scale dataset including different types of land-use and land-cover surfaces (Eurosat). Traditional (shallow) machine learning models and deep learning models are built by using a set of features extracted from the satellite images for both approaches and using the RGB images for deep models. The best F1-score obtained by the shallow approach was 0.87, while for the deep approach it was 0.91. No significant difference was found in these results; however, significant improvements can be made by exploring the deep approach in greater depth.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Wildfires of high severity can have profound implications on natural and human environment affecting the quality of life; the health of living beings; and the prosperity of any society. Consequently, specific strategies, tactics and techniques should always be adopted for the alleviation of this critical phenomenon. Hence, the aim of the paper is the review of the most common geoinformatics-based techniques contributing to an integrated fire analysis through four pillars. The first one is related with the fire exposure on the ground, primarily analyzing the fire susceptibility in terms of fire risk and burn probability maps; The second one examines the fire effects on the most critical ecological and anthropogenic resources and infrastructures. The third pillar combines two effective geospatial tools supporting the wildfire prevention and suppression, such as the visibility analysis for early detection of fire hotspots and the network analysis for strategic and operational planning of fire events. Last, the Earth-Observation module, through the spatiotemporal monitoring and prediction of land use changes, permits the planners to evaluate the underlying pressures (fires, urbanization) against forests developing the appropriate planning guidelines. In the meantime, new perspectives emerge. Novel machine learning algorithms and remote sensing data techniques are expected to improve the fire risk/probability credibility enhancing the more precise identification of fire effects to any resource. The integration of specific geographic criteria (e.g. topography, accessibility) and programming techniques (e.g. maximizing the visible area) to visibility analysis would empower the immediate fire detection. New technologies such as the adoption of drones would be a cost-effective tool for quick retrieval of vital geo-data. Network analysis could propose financially and environmentally efficient location schemes of fire agencies and resources.

TI  - Modis Derived Vegetation and Aridity Indices Account for Spatial Variation in Desertification Risk Index in Dry Environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It was estimated annually that several thousands of hectares (ha) of land has been lost to desertification and the negative impacts are manifested on the environment and general livelihood of people; reduced capacity to provide for the basic needs such as food and water. Although this is true of many countries in Sub Sahara Africa, yet the spatial pattern of the level of desertification and the areas at risk has not been sufficiently quantified and mapped. This study is aimed at determining and mapping the spatial extent of desertification risk index in the 9 frontline states of Northern Nigeria and to identify areas and population that are at risk given the current condition to enhance mitigation and adaptation strategy plan. We used both aridity and vegetation indices in combination with elevation and urban/settlement population data to determine and mapped the risk of desertification in the nine frontline states. To obtain aridity index we used De Martonne aridity index (lar-DM) equation; this was calculated from the raster layers of mean annual temperature (MAT) and total annual precipitation (TAP) using map algebra. To monitor vegetation conditions we used eMODIS NDVI 10-day maximum-value composite MVC NDVI images at 250m spatial resolution. We created desertification risk index map from spatial overlay of NDVI/vegetation cover, elevation, population and aridity index. The study shows that aridity in the study area increases northward in curvilinear pattern as 75 % (430,650 km(2)) of the region falls into three aridity categories: arid, semi-arid and dry sub humid while the remaining 25% (33,000 km(2)) found in southern Kebbi, Zamfara, Katsina and Bauchi falls under sub humid. Aridity index as proximate of the desertification was however found to be inadequate as the combination of vegetation index produced desertification risk index (DRI) map which has helped to identify "hot spot" these are places where risks to desertification are higher than their surrounding areas. Suggestions such as sound land management, energy substitution strategy are made to combat the menace of desertification with special attention placed on these highly vulnerable "hot spot" areas.

AB  - Cameras on remote sensing satellites must be calibrated in a timely manner to ensure the quality of the images. This calibration process is done before launch and during on-orbit operation. There are several types of on-orbit calibration, some of them require a calibration area that has to be based on several characteristics. This research was conducted to analyze the feasibility of calibration sites in three areas in Indonesia. Those areas are Jaddih Hill, Kupang Cement Mine, and Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. An objective method to determine the calibration areas was by observing the image's area from the multispectral camera of the LAPAN-A3 satellite (LISA), the multispectral camera of the LANDSAT-8 satellite (OLI), and Google Earth. Furthermore, it was conducted measuring reflectance and analyzing the uniformity of the area by Coefficient of Variation (CV) calculation. The results show that the Jaddih Hill and Kupang Cement Mine according to the requirements as a calibration area at a range of wavelength from 400 - 900 nm. Meanwhile, Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park is not recommended on those wavelenght.

TI  - Evaluation of different methods of estimating ET for the performance assessment of irrigation schemes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the assessment of irrigation schemes, the accuracy of performance indicators related to the water balance could be improved by estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETc) using remote sensing techniques. The two main remote sensing approaches to estimating ETc are the surface energy balance and the FAO56-based approach, that uses the ability of vegetation indices (VI) to trace the crop coefficient. Both approaches were evaluated comparatively at the Rio Dulce irrigation scheme in Argentina (where the predominant crops are cotton, alfalfa, and maize) using products from the Landsat 7 and 8 sensors provided by the EEFlux application. The first analysis used field-specific, VI-derived basal crop coefficients obtained for 1743 fields using series of 9-29 satellite images along the 2014-15 irrigation campaign. The second analysis used 30 fields (grown with cotton and maize) where the actual irrigation schedules in the 2014-15 irrigation campaign were known. A root zone soil water balance was computed in these fields using the FAO56 dual approach with field-specific, VI-derived basal crop coefficients. The ETc obtained from the water balance was compared with the ETc estimated using a single crop coefficient approach that uses field-specific VI and takes into account soil evaporation (herein called synthetic approach), and with the ETc obtained with the METRIC surface energy balance model as facilitated by the EEFlux application. The third analysis was a simulation analysis of errors in the estimation of the ETc due to the interpolation to daily values of single crop coefficients and basal crop coefficients determined at hypothetical satellite overpass intervals of longer than one day. The VI-derived basal crop coefficient curves obtained for the 1743 fields of the first analysis were below the locally adopted standard (not field-specific) basal crop coefficient. Crop evapotranspiration in the 8005 ha covered by this analysis was about 20 % higher when applying standard non-field specific curves than when applying VI-derived curves. This difference pointed to the importance of using field-specific estimations of ETc. In the analysis carried out on the 30 selected fields, the ETc estimated using the VI-based approach agreed well with the ETc obtained from the water balance except under water deficit conditions. The crop coefficients obtained for these fields using the METRIC model correlated with those obtained by applying the VI-based method, although the former tended to be higher than the latter in the lower value range. The analysis of interpolation errors showed that when satellite overpass frequency is greater than one week and water deficit is mild or inexistent, the interpolation of crop coefficients (for instance, of those derived from an energy balance) gives errors of ETc estimations that are greater than those resulting from the VI based approach. Under water deficit conditions, the VI-based approach systematically overestimates evapotranspiration.

AB  - This work describes an approach for building a dataset of fire reference perimeters over sub-Saharan Africa (latitude range 25 degrees N-35 degrees S) from Sentinel-2 (S2) time series based on a sampling scheme designed on the characteristics of the S2 tiling system. A stratified random sampling scheme is adopted to select 50 validation sites distributed over the African continent and across Olson biomes (Olson et al. 2001) and fire intensity strata. S2 time series are extracted over each validation site after a preliminary analysis of data availability; S2 consecutive pairs are classified with a Random Forest (RF) algorithm for building a dataset of fire reference perimeters.

T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important issues in forest management is preservation and development of biodiversity. This study aims at estimating richness, evenness and species diversity of woody plants in Arasbaran Protected Area (East Azerbaijan Province, Iran) using Landsat 8 OLI satellite images based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) models. This study was performed in an elevation range of 1,000 - 1,850 m. A total of 130 samples were selected based on physiographic factors. In each sampling plot, number and type of dominant tree species in the canopy were recorded. Statistical modeling was carried out by calibrating MLR and CART models. The R-squared values of MLR models were in the range of 0.10 - 0.24 for predicting richness, evenness and Shannon and Simpson's species diversity indices based on greenness as the only predictor variable (other variables were excluded from MLR models). The R-squared values of CART models were equal to 0.21, 0.42, 0.41 and 0.42, respectively. Validation of the results indicated that the CART model had a relatively better performance compared to MLR model. Overall, both methods could not estimate species richness and diversity very precisely based on Landsat 8 OLI Satellite data in the region suggesting the necessity to use high-resolution satellite data for the best evaluation of forests diversity indices in mountainous forests.

AB  - Current AutoML systems have been benchmarked with traditional natural image datasets. Differences between satellite images and natural images (e.g., bit-wise resolution, the number, and type of spectral bands) and lack of labeled satellite images for training models, pose open questions about the applicability of current AutoML systems on satellite data. In this paper, we demonstrate how AutoML can be leveraged for classification tasks on satellite data. Specifically, we deploy the Auto-Keras system for image classification tasks and create two new variants, IMG-AK and RS-AK, for satellite image classification that respectively incorporate transfer learning using models pre-trained with (i) natural images (using ImageNet) and (ii) remote sensing datasets. For evaluation, we compared the performance of these variants against manually designed architectures on a benchmark set of 7 satellite datasets. Our results show that in 71% of the cases the AutoML systems outperformed the best previously proposed model, highlighting the usefulness of a customized satellite data search space in AutoML systems. Our RS-AK variant performed better than IMG-AK for small datasets with a limited amount of training data. Furthermore, it found the best automated model for the datasets composed of near-infrared, green, and red bands.

T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fragmentation of natural areas alters the natural landscape, removing native vegetation and creating an anthropic matrix. In order to better understand the consequences of grazing in areas of campo rupestre and forest, the present study aimed to analyze changes in the vegetation of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, in the Southern Espinhaco, between 1979 and 2015. The vegetation of the study area was identified as arboreal (forest), or herbaceous or shrubby (campo rupestre) by visual classification of a mosaic of aerial photographs from 1979 and the supervised classification of land use from a Landsat 8 image from 2015. Differences in vegetation were analyzed using a transition matrix based on the "Markov model", which indicated conversions of vegetation classes due to the misuse of land, mainly as pasture. The results indicate the conversion of arboreal vegetation area into areas of exotic herbaceous vegetation, and stability in the area of shrubby vegetation.

AB  - Availability of a good record of paddy rice growth condition is important for obtaining sustainable paddy rice production in agricultural countries like Indonesia. A multi-temporal of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of dual-polarization Sentinel- 1 data collected from January 2020 to January 2021 are good enough to show the variation occurs in two or more regions in Lampung Province based on starting their cultivation time in the paddy field. This study provides the recommendation for detecting paddy rice phenology from two different approaches. Backscatter values (s0) generated from VV, VH, VV/VH, and VV-VH and dual-polarization radar vegetation index (DpRVI) that has arranged to show the paddy rice growth and phenology pattern are compared with the observation directly from the field at a different time of cultivation period. Both patterns matching with the acquisition time of the direct observation has represented the similar pattern created by radar backscatter and dpRVI with an accuracy of about 85%. The characteristic of phenology and paddy rice growth pattern in the many regions in Lampung province is possible to detect using backscatter values and DpRVI.

The research was conducted in Arjuno-Welirang volcanic complex, East Java, using Landsat 8 OLI imagery at 30 m spatial resolution. The image was corrected at two levels, i.e., atmospheric correction to at-surface reflectance using FLAASH method, and topographic correction using SCS-C method. The topographic correction referred to ALOS PALSAR DSM data, which was resampled at 30 m pixel size. The vegetation indices used includes NDVI, SAVI, ARVI, EVI and MSARVI. Fieldwork for measuring vegetation density was carried out by vertical bottom-up photography of the canopy on each sample, supported by observations of vegetation density using high-spatial resolution Google Earth imagery. The results showed that --in comparison with the atmospheric correction-- the topographic correction was able to increase the correlation coefficients between the spectral information and the measured vegetation density in the field, especially for SAVI, EVI and MSARVI transformations. On the other hand, the NDVI and ARVI showed slight decreases. Based on the vegetation density maps generated using regression equations, the SAVI, EVI and MSARVI showed slight increases from atmospheric to topographic corrections, while the NDVI and ARVI showed declines. The rugged terrain condition affected the accuracies of the models due to the difficulty of vegetation density measurement in the field and even distribution of the samples.

AB  - In the context of climate change, the European budget for marine data collection is up to (sic)1.4 billion p.a., both for satellite data and for in-situ observations. In the latter case, the resort to vessel-based data-gathering remains associated to elevated costs. Meanwhile, burgeoning technology made it possible to create complexes of distributed, autonomous, real-time sensor systems called "observatories" which allow to obtain a huge amount of data covering large area at a reasonable cost. However, research and decision- making policies at transnational level require those data to be reliable and comparable in order to be used for any user-group requirements purposes. The instruments which produce these data are required to measure within known specifications, at any time despite the harsh conditions in which they operate, so that the measurement results will be metrologically sound.Supporting the development of the operational oceanography in Europe, a metrology community dedicated to oceanography has been collaborating from the very early days in order to sustain and promote the quality of measurements made in marine environments.However, up to now, this quality insurance relies on ten or so metrology laboratories all over Europe, and the number of metrology laboratory creations is scarce despite an important increase of metrology needs.Responding to the need, 10 years ago, in the framework of EU projects (JERICO, FixO3), several metrology laboratories from oceanographic institutes (HCMR, OGS, IFREMER, SYKE) initiated discussions on possible ways to structure the community, enhancing collaboration, promoting integration and adopting best practices. Parallel to this, national metrology institutes (LNE, PTB, INRIM, IPQ, YMPARISTO, ...) started to address the oceanographic metrology topic through dedicated metrology calls (EURAMET). This dispersion of effort was rapidly identified as the main cause of lack of progress in the thematic and laboratories decided to engage in a sustained effort for collaboration.This paper illustrates how metrology is a key player in the current environmental and political context, why it is so important to agree quickly about solutions to build a European sustainable structure and what are the different collaborative opportunities afforded by Europe.

TI  - The Added-Value of Remotely-Sensed Soil Moisture Data for Agricultural Drought Detection in Argentina
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In countries where the economy relies mostly on agricultural-livestock activities, such as Argentina, droughts cause significant economic losses. Currently, the most-used drought indices by the Argentinian National Meteorological and Hydrological Services are based on field precipitation data, such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). In this article, we explored the performance of the satellite-based soil moisture agricultural drought index (SMADI) for agricultural drought detection in Argentina during 2010-2015, and compared it with the one from the standardized soil moisture anomalies (SSMA), SPI and SPEI (at one-month and three-month temporal scales), using the Agricultural Ministry's drought emergency database as a benchmark. The performances were analyzed in terms of the suitability of each index to be included in an early warning system for agricultural droughts, including true positive rate (TPR), and both false positive and false negative rates. In our experiments, SMADI showed the best overall performance, with the highest TPR and F1-score, and the second best false positive rate (FPR), positive predictive value, and overall accuracy. SMADI also showed the largest difference between TPR and FPR. SSMA showed the lowest FPR, but also the lowest TPR, making it not useful for an alert system. Furthermore, field precipitation-based indices, yet simple and widely used, showed not to be suitable indicators for detection of agricultural drought for Argentina, neither in the one-month nor in the three-month scale.

TI  - Spatial-Resolution Independent Object Detection Framework for Aerial Imagery
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth surveillance through aerial images allows more accurate identification and characterization of objects present on the surface from space and airborne platforms. The progression of deep learning and computer vision methods and the availability of heterogeneous multispectral remote sensing data make the field more fertile for research. With the evolution of optical sensors, aerial images are becoming more precise and larger, which leads to a new kind of problem for object detection algorithms. This paper proposes the "Sliding Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN)," which is an extension of the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) object detection framework to make it independent of the image?s spatial resolution and size. The sliding box strategy is used in the proposed model to segment the image while detecting. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art Faster RCNN model while processing images with significantly different spatial resolution values. The SRCNN is also capable of detecting objects in images of any size.

T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - Prediction of potato yield before harvest is important for making agronomic and marketing decisions but rarely done with the use of remote sensing (RS). The potential of ground-, satellite-based and UAV-carried sensors for monitoring plant growth over time was tested over a 11.1 ha potato field, located in central Poland. Independently from the method used for monitoring of plant growth, the highest correlation of the vegetation indices (VIs) with yield was obtained at the end of flowering to fruit development at 67-78 days after planting (DAP). Late monitoring of plant growth at about 100 DAP, despite the increase of coefficient of variation of VIs, showed very weak relationship with yield. The degree of senescence of the potato plants expressed by VI variability did not reflect tuber yield at this growth stage. Magnesium content, soil compaction at the layers of 0-10 and 11-20 cm and soil bulk density at 15 cm showed significant, negative correlation with yield.

TI  - Syphilis in young Brazilian military recruits in 2016: sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical aspects
T2  - CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective was to characterize sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical aspects in young Brazilian military recruits according to prevalence of syphilis. This was a descriptive study based on a nationwide population-based survey in 2016 with a probabilistic sample of military recruits 17 to 22 years of age. A confidential self-applied questionnaire was used. Blood samples were drawn from participants for treponemal and non-treponemal syphilis tests. Descriptive statistical techniques were used to estimate syphilis prevalence rates and distribution of frequencies between the target variables, considering 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), after weighting the data. Of the total of 37,282 participants, 73.7% were sexually initiated. Prevalence rates for lifetime and confirmed syphilis were 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively. The following population variables showed higher prevalence of syphilis: lack of Internet access at home; initiation of sexual activity before 14 years of age; men who have sex with men; more than five sexual partners; having received presents, drugs, or other incentives in exchange for sex; and prior history of symptoms of sexually transmissible infections. An increase was observed in syphilis in Brazilian military recruits when compared to previous surveys. This increase emphasizes the importance of this sentinel population for performing active surveillance in order to support healthcare strategies for youth, including in the school system.

AB  - Trees provide social, economic and aesthetic benefits to human beings but often they present structural defects,physiological disorders and/or pathological processes that pose a danger to property and people. In this work we applied Precision Arboriculture approach at La Mandria regional park (Piedmont). UAV digital photogrammetry was used to retrieve tree parameters in a jointly use to multispectral satellite remote sensing (Copernicus Sen-tinel-2) to monitor the canopy health of trees. The adoption of biomechanical models has made it possible to assess the mechanical stability of the trunks and create a decision support system that create intervention priorities zones with the aim of reducing and optimizing ground tree inspections.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD)

AB  - Recently several models have been developed to reduce the annotation effort which is required to perform semantic segmentation. Instead of learning from pixel-level annotations, these models learn from cheaper annotations, e.g. image-level labels, scribbles or bounding boxes. However, most of these models cannot easily be adapted to new annotations e.g. new classes since it requires retraining the model. In this paper, we propose a similarity measure between pixels based on a mutual information objective to determine whether these pixels belong to the same class. The mutual information objective is learned in a fully unsupervised manner while the annotations (e.g. points or scribbles) are only used during test time. For a given image, the unlabeled pixels are classified by computing their nearest-neighbors in terms of mutual information from the set of labeled pixels. Experimental results are reported on the Potsdam dataset and Sentinel-2 data is used to provide a real world use case where a large amount of unlabeled satellite images is available but only a few pixels can be labeled. On the Potsdam dataset, our model achieves 70.22% mIoU and 87.17% accuracy outperforming the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods.

TI  - Proteomic analysis and biochemical alterations in marine mussel gills after exposure to the organophosphate flame retardant TDCPP
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are (re-)emergent environmental pollutants increasingly being used because of the restriction of other flame retardants. The chlorinated OPFR, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) is among those of highest environmental concern, but its potential effects in the marine environment have rarely been investigated. We exposed a widely used sentinel marine mussel species, Mytilus galloprovincialis, to 10 mu g L-1 of TDCPP during 28 days and studied: (i) the kinetics of bioaccumulation and elimination of the compound, (ii) the effect on two molecular biomarkers, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, and (iii) proteomic alterations in the gills, following an isobaric labeling quantitative shotgun proteomic approach, at two exposure times (7 and 28 days). Uptake and elimination of TDCPP by mussels were very fast, and the bioconcentration factor of this compound in mussels was 147 L kg(ww)(-1), confirming that this compound is not very bioaccumulative, as predicted by its chemical properties. GST activity was not affected by TDCPP exposure, but AChE activity was inhibited by TDCPP at both 7 and 28 days of exposure. Proteomic analysis revealed subtle effects of TDCPP in mussel gills, since few proteins (less than 2 % of the analysed proteome) were significantly affected by TDCPP, and effect sizes were low. The most relevant effects detected were the up-regulation of epimerase family protein SDR39U1, an enzyme that could be involved in detoxification processes, at both exposure times, and the down-regulation of receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase N2-like (PTPRN2) after 7 days of exposure, which is involved in neurotransmitter secretion and might be related to the neurotoxicity described for this compound. Exposure time rather than TDCPP exposure was the most important driver of protein abundance changes, with 33 % of the proteome being affected by this factor, suggesting that stress caused by laboratory conditions could be an important confounding factor that needs to be controlled in similar ecotoxicology studies. Proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD019720.

AB  - Recently, as the spatial resolution of satellite and aerial images has improved, various studies using remotely sensed data with high spatial resolution have been conducted. In particular, since the building extraction is essential for creating digital thematic maps, high accuracy of building extraction result is required. In this manuscript, building extraction models were generated using SegNet, U-Net, FC-DenseNet, and HRNetV2, which are representative semantic segmentation models in deep learning techniques, and then the evaluation of building extraction results was performed. Training dataset for building extraction were generated by using aerial orthophotos including various buildings, and evaluation was conducted in three areas. First, the model performance was evaluated through the region adjacent to the training dataset. In addition, the applicability of the model was evaluated through the region different from the training dataset. As a result, the f1-score of HRNetV2 represented the best values in terms of model performance and applicability. Through this study, the possibility of creating and modifying the building layer in the digital map was confirmed.

TI  - Improved Land Cover Classification of VHR Optical Remote Sensing Imagery Based Upon Detail Injection Procedure
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imaging platforms have resulted in a requirement for developing refined land cover classification maps for various applications. Therefore, aiming at exploring the accurate boundary and complex interior texture retrieval in VHR optical remote sensing images, a novel detail injection network (DI-Net) is proposed in this article, which is composed of three aspects. First, the decoupling refinement module embedded with a multiscale representation is designed to improve the feature extraction capabilities that precede the encoding-to-decoding process. Second, we pay attention to the hard examples of boundary and complex interior texture in land cover classification and design two detail injection attention modules to solve the feature inactivation phenomenon in gradually convolutional encoding-to-decoding process. Third, a specific stage grading loss is proposed to adaptively regulate the structural-level weights of the encoding and decoding stages, which facilitates the details retrieval and produce refined land cover classification results. Finally, various datasets [<italic>incl.</italic> International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) and Gaofen Image Dataset (GID)] are employed to demonstrate that the proposed DI-Net achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods. DI-Net provides more accurate boundaries and more consistent interior textures, and it achieves 86.86x0025; <italic>PA</italic> and 68.37x0025; <italic>mIoU</italic> on ISPRS dataset as well as 77.04x0025; <italic>PA</italic> and 64.38x0025; <italic>mIoU</italic> on GID dataset, respectively.

AB  - This study aims to clarify the origin and characteristics of digital thinking, a new thinking structure of modern people, targeting numbers and technology images in Flusser's philosophy. Numerical thoughts (particle thoughts) are thoughts that decompose something into discontinuous elements and then gather these elements into a single mass. The numerical thoughts that were born in the modern era gradually move away from numbers and encode themselves into technical images. The technical image is an expression of numerical thoughts. Numerical thoughts, new imagination, and photographic view that characterize the new worldview in the post-industrial era converge into digital thoughts. Digital thinking was influenced by a variety of modern sciences, including quantum theory and neurophysiology. In digital thinking, this world is the result of the computation of particles not only in the material world, but also in the human mind and thought itself, which are the mental worlds. Since everything in the world is a group of particles, the existing distinction between reality and image, reality and fiction disappears. Everything is digital, and everything reaches a world of emptiness, nothing, and illusion. One way to overcome the empty and absurd world is to create a new technical image by recollecting the decomposed particles to human imagination.

TI  - CAN HIGH-RESOLUTION SATELLITE MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERY BE USED TO PHENOTYPE CANOPY TRAITS AND YIELD POTENTIAL IN FIELD CONDITIONS?
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent availability of high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery has widened its applications in agriculture. Plant breeding and genetics programs are currently adopting unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based imagery data as a complement to ground data collection. With breeding trials across multiple geographic locations, UAV imaging is not always convenient. Hence, we anticipate that, similar to UAV imaging, phenotyping of individual test plots from high-resolution satellite imagery may also provide value to plant genetics and breeding programs. In this study, high spatial resolution satellite imagery (similar to 38 to 48 cm pixel(-1)) was compared to imagery acquired using a UAV for its ability to phenotype maize grown in two-row and six-row breeding plots. Statistics (mean, median, sum) of color (red, green, blue), near-infrared, and vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were extracted from imagery from both sources (UAV and satellite) for comparison at three time points. In general, a strong correlation between satellite and UAV imagery extracted NDVI, GNDVI, and SAVI features (especially with mean and median statistics, p < 0.001) was observed at different time points. The correlation of both UAV and satellite image features with yield potential was maximum (p < 0.001) at the third time point (milk/dough growth stages). For example, Pearson's correlation coefficients between mean NDVI, GNDVI, and SAVI features with yield potential were 0.52, 0.54, and 0.51 for data derived from UAV imagery, and 0.34, 0.41, and 0.40 for data derived from satellite imagery, respectively. Machine learning algorithms, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression, were evaluated for yield prediction using vegetation index features that were significantly correlated with observed yield. The relationship between satellite imagery with crop performance can be a function of plot size in addition to crop variability. Nevertheless, with the ongoing improvement of satellite technologies, there is a possibility for the integration of satellite data into breeding programs, thus improving phenotyping efficiencies.

AB  - Fires represents one of the main causes of environmental degradation and have an important negative impact on the landscape. Fires, in fact, strongly influenced ecological processes and compromise the ecosystems. Measurements of the post-fire damage levels over burned areas are important to quantify fire's impact on landscapes. Remote sensing and geo-statistical approaches are useful tools for the monitoring and analysis of burned areas on a regional scale, because provides reliable and rapid diagnosis of burned areas. Spatial autocorrelation statistics, such as Moran's I and Getis-Ord Local Gi index, were also used to measure and analyze dependency degree among spectral features of burned areas. This approach improves characterization of a burnt area and improves the estimate of the severity of the fire. This paper provides an application of fire severity studies describing post-fire spectral responses of fire affected vegetation to obtain a burned area map. The aim of this work is to implement a procedure, using ESA Sentinel 2 data and spatial autocorrelation statistics in a GIS open-source environment, a graphical model that analyzes the change detection of the potential burned area, as case of study Northern part of Apulia Region (Italy) was used. The burned area was delineated using the spectral indices calculated using Sentinel two images in the period July-August 2020 and using also the land use map of the area.

CP  - 21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)
CL  - Cagliari, ITALY
AB  - European Commission in 2009 assessed that in the period 20152030 about 11% of agricultural land in the EU are under high potential risk of abandonment due to factors, which has strong and known environmental and socio-economic consequences. The diverse impacts of abandonment need to be addressed via a broader set of policy instruments to alleviate the negative effects or even - reverse the trends in the early stages of the process. The clear identification of abandoned agricultural land is fundamental for a correct mapping for the future management and monitoring of the territories. In this context, this study proposes an innovative method for the detection and mapping of abandoned arable land through the use of remote sensing techniques and geo-statistical analysis. The combined use of Sentinel 2 images and the Landsat constellation, the use of NDVI index and change detection analysis made it possible to identify the change in agricultural use and/or abandonment of land in the eastern part of the Basilicata region in the period 1990-2020. (Italy). All process has been developed integrating Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), using open-source software.

TI  - Levels and trend of HIV prevalence among pregnant women in Tamil Nadu: Analysis of data from HIV sentinel surveillance (2003-2019)
T2  - CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) among pregnant women is a key indicator to estimate the HIV prevalence in the general population, as nearly 85% of HIV transmission in India is linked to the heterosexual route. Tracking the levels and trends of the HIV prevalence at state, regional, and district levels help to prioritize and facilitate a tailor-made intervention. Here, we analyze the region and district-wise levels and trends of HIV prevalence among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics (ANC) from 2003 to 2019 in Tamil Nadu.Methods: Eleven rounds of HSS data collected from pregnant women in Tamil Nadu, from 2003 to 2019 were analysed. Consistent sites were grouped into four geographical regions (North, Central, West and South), a total of 67 sites including 33 urban 31 rural, and 3 private sites. Chi-square trend test used to find linear trends and spatial analysis used to understand the geographical distribution of HIV prevalence over the years.Results: In total, 2,77,444 blood samples were collected during HSS from 2003 to 2019. In 2019, the state HIV prevalence was 0.18 (95% CI: 0.13-0.23); region-wise prevalence was 0.21, 0.07, 0.32 and 0.12 in North, Central, West and South respectively. HIV prevalence in Tamil Nadu had significantly declined since 2003, which however, was not significant in all districts; with inter-district fluctuations.Conclusion: HIV interventions have to be strengthened in the districts with inconsistent trends, specifically the West region. This requires a more detailed analysis of region-specific contextual factors associated with the transmission risk.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF LAND USE AND LAND COVER DYNAMICS USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS IN THE UPPER TAMIRAPARANI WATERSHED OF TAMIL NADU, INDIA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysing the land use and land cover change along with its cause and consequence on the livelihood of people as well as on the environment is important for sustainable development and management of natural resources. The present study focuses on analysis of land use and land cover dynamics using Landsat images with 30 m spatial resolution for upper Tamiraparani watershed located in Tamil Nadu state in India. ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS Imagine 14 have been used for the image processing to produce five land use and land cover classes in the watershed. The results after classification indicates that over the past 17 years, expansion of urban built-up and agricultural land have increased at a rate of 195.2 ha/year and 37.1 ha/year respectively and contrary to this the share of forest land, barren land and water bodies shrunk with the rate of 118.2 ha/year, 96.6 ha/year and 17.6 ha/year respectively. It is understood that the urban built-up has intensively expanded at the expense of other land use and land cover without significant conservation measure. In particular, integrated approach with community participation is required in the watershed development for management of natural resources and sustainable development.

AB  - Forest fires cost the world an estimated value of 200 Billion dollars annually in damages. Furthermore, the main concerns are not only monetary as the vanishment of the carbon-dioxide soaking forests further exacerbates climate change. This paper presents a predictor system based on deep convolutional neural network to predict the risk level of wildfire from satellite data. The proposed Neural Network has an encoder-decoder architecture that allows to provide emergency operators with a pixel-wise fire risk prediction of a given area, allowing precise preventive interventions. The dataset utilised for the training has been generated from publicly available sources as a set of raster images, including several of the most significant satellite products. The paper also proposes a customised loss function for the training of the network and several statistical metrics to establish its performances and validate the reliability of the system. A proof of concept demonstration is discussed for two different case studies: the island of Sicily and an area in California.

CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Mangroves store significant carbon content that, when managed properly, will contribute to combating the climate crisis. Despite having the largest mangrove forest, Indonesia's mangrove annual damage rate turns out to be the highest globally, one of the most significant factors is extensive plastic waste exposure, exacerbated by mangroves' deforestation for conversion into agricultural land. Many efforts initiated by the government and other stakeholders have been targeting mangrove rehabilitation and plastic waste abatement. Labor-intensive and time-consuming ground checking have been the main source of information to determine priority areas for mangrove rehabilitation so far. This study aims to introduce a more effective and efficient identification of priority areas for rehabilitation. The study utilizes vulnerability index by optimizing remote sensing satellite data modeling. The study covers all mangroves in Indonesia, and for the purpose of this study, four mangrove vulnerability classes are formed to help categorize the severity of the damage. The classes are formed through integration, scoring, and classifying plant health, water turbidity, land temperature, plant carbon sequestration capability, and plastic waste distribution in Indonesian coastal area data. The modeling demonstrates its ability to distinguish the classes through machine learning. This study identifies that 65.74% of Indonesia's coastal mangroves are highly exposed to plastic waste. Bali and Surabaya are two of the most severely damaged areas. This study, along with further analysis of socio-cultural, economic, and development priorities, will enable decision-makers to prioritize and mobilize necessary resources to rehabilitate the mangroves guided by a suitable mangrove management regime for each class.

TI  - Estimating quality of life dimensions from urban spatial pattern metrics
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial structure of urban areas plays a major role in the daily life of dwellers. The current policy framework to ensure the quality of life of inhabitants leaving no one behind, leads decision-makers to seek better-informed choices for the sustainable planning of urban areas. Thus, a better understanding between the spatial structure of cities and their socio-economic level is of crucial relevance. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to quantify this two-way relationship. Therefore, we measured spatial patterns of 31 cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We rely on spatial pattern metrics derived from a Local Climate Zone classification obtained by fusing remote sensing and open GIS data with a machine learning approach. Based upon the data, we quantified the relationship between spatial pattern metrics and socio-economic variables related to 'education', 'health', 'living conditions', 'labor', and 'transport' by means of multiple linear regression models, explaining the variability of the socio-economic variables from 43% up to 82%. Additionally, we grouped cities according to their level of 'quality of life' using the socio-economic variables, and found that the spatial pattern of low-dense builtup types was different among socio-economic groups. The proposed methodology described in this paper is transferable to other datasets, levels, and regions. This is of great potential, due to the growing availability of open statistical and satellite data and derived products. Moreover, we discuss the limitations and needed considerations when conducting such studies.

AB  - Worldwide pest, cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hubner; CBW) larvae is responsible for serious crop damage, including to maize. Sentinel-2 multispectral data and vegetation indices with different resolution grids were investigated to estimate its damage rate. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted between spectral bands, indices and damage rates over time. Correlations varied considerably (vertical bar r vertical bar=0.0-0.87) depending on spectral-band, index and spatial resolution. A 30x30 m grid was the most appropriate resolution. High correlations of CBW damage with enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) were found.

TI  - Terra MODIS sees solar eclipses: Analysis of reflective solar band response at multiple radiance levels

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Algorithms, Technologies, and Applications for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Imaging XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The MODIS imaging spectroradiometer instruments on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites have 20 reflective solar bands (RSB) covering a wavelength range from 400 to 2200 nm. Radiance is calculated from processing raw signals with background, temperature, and electronic contamination corrected. Measured gain is calibrated with a fully Sunlit solar diffuser (SD) at a stable radiance level, considering a slowly changing SD reflectance degradation. These measurements provide time-dependent gain adjustment factors, and the calibration assumes a linear response for each band and detector. Hence, an analysis of the dependence on different radiance levels is warranted. The MODIS design has no mechanism for varying radiance levels, except for an attenuator screen. However, it has been in static configuration for Terra since mid-2003. An external source of radiance attenuation can be utilized during solar eclipse events, while maintaining high stability and accuracy of solar calibration standards. Due to its long mission lifetime, Terra has seen several Sun-Moon near-conjunction events when it coincides with the orbit path where the SD is directly illuminated. As of August 2020, we have identified 7 viable partial solar eclipses in the Terra mission data. We will discuss several results of our study, including comparison of measured SD signal to predicted radiance reduction based on a solar disk radiance model; nominal and outlier behavior as a function of bands, detectors, and mirror-sides; and comparison with other data sets. Our main conclusion from this study is that there is no notable correlation of detector-dependent trend with radiance level for most RSB bands.

T2  - TRAUMA VIOLENCE & ABUSE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective:To examine the evidence base for patterns of oro-facial injuries in physical abuse cases of children and adolescents aged 0-17 years.Data sources:Systematic searches of Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Central and grey literature, dating from the oldest entry to August 2017.Review methods:Search criteria included English language peer reviewed articles and theses on physical abuse cases affecting the age group of 0-17 years. Exclusion criteria were: Case reports and <10 case series; studies involving bite mark injuries elsewhere on the body, sexual, ritualistic or emotional abuse and neglect, exposure to domestic violence; reviews; book chapters and conference proceedings. The following data was extracted: quality and design of study, oro-facial manifestations, new/old injuries, fatalities, coexistent injuries, co-morbidities and radiologic investigations. Each study was subjected to two independent reviews and a third, if reviewers disagreed.Results:The authors identified 51 articles, 26 of which satisfied the inclusion criteria. The oro-facial signs were superficial injuries of face, ears, neck, lips and oral mucosa, burns, torn fraenii and fractured teeth and jaws. A minority of studies stood out due to their well-developed design; expert opinion inclusion; new/old/occult injury investigations and facial bruising/ intraoral injuries as sentinel markers. Overall, the review demonstrated weak study quality and representativeness as well as lacunae in uniform reporting.Conclusions:The available literature does not endorse any pathognomonic signature patterns of child physical abuse to the exposed oro-facial region.

TI  - Trees outside forest in Italian agroforestry landscapes: detection and mapping using sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an automated method for distinguishing trees (T) from no-trees (NT) by means of optical data. We make use of an optical approach based on a statistical threshold to detect T areas on visible and near infrared bands. An object-based image classification allows to detect three kinds of tree out of forest (TOF) structures: forest patches (FP), isolated trees (IT), tree hedgerows (THR), distinguished from forest (F). Ground truth validation allows estimating the accuracy of classification. Four optical bands and six spectral indices are compared detecting images' T areas: B2, B3, B4 and B8 bands, Negative Luminance (NL), Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI), Green NDVI (GNDVI), Blue NDVI (BNDVI), Panchromatic NDVI (PNDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). NL shows a relatively better capability for TOF detection and classification, with overall accuracy (OA) exceeding 92% and p-value = 10(-5). Experiments were conducted on optical data acquired by Sentinel-2 in 2016 over the Alfina highland, central Italy. The tree characteristics were extracted exploiting GNU Octave Image Package. Our results show that this new approach could be extended to the detection and mapping of TOF within large areas of agroforestry landscape.

TI  - CAN MEADOWS MOWING BE DETECTED BY REMOTE SENSING? A POSSIBLE ANSWER BASED ON SENTINEL-2 IMAGE TIME SERIES IN THE CAP FRAMEWORK

AB  - Grassland management is essential for ecosystems and sustainable agriculture. EU support farmers through its Common Agricultural Policy requiring a proper management of meadows/pastures. The institutional agencies in charge of delivering contributions ask for more efficient control tools, making verifications faster and convenient. In this work, a prototype service is proposed, based on Sentinel-2, data to support paying agencies during their controls with the specific goal of detecting, mapping and quantifying the number of grass cuts along its growing season. This work was solicited by the Piemonte Regional Agency for Payments in Agriculture (ARPEA); the procedure was tested in the province of Vercelli (Piemonte - NW Italy) and relies on Copernicus Sentinel-2 data. The procedure was tested for the 2019 growing season, aiming at detecting and counting mowings of meadows. Temporal dynamics of reference mowed and not-mowed fields (represented by the local NDVI temporal profile) were compared. A significant decrease of the NDVI value was observed, possibly associated to mowing operations. The analysis was based on the adoption of the Fast Fourier Transform applied to the local NDVI profile. This made possible to detect managed grass fields and give an estimated count of numbers and timing of mowings. A map was generated showing the spatial distribution of managed grass fields featured by the correspondent number of mowings. A validation was performed with reference to available ground data from ARPEA. Results demonstrate that Sentinel-2 data can effectively support controls made by paying agencies in the framework of the EU to optimize allocation of available subsidies.

TI  - A Possible Role of Copernicus Sentinel-2 Data to Support Common Agricultural Policy Controls in Agriculture
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmers that intend to access Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) contributions must submit an application to the territorially competent Paying Agencies (PA). Agencies are called to verify consistency of CAP contributions requirements through ground campaigns. Recently, EU regulation (N. 746/2018) proposed an alternative methodology to control CAP applications based on Earth Observation data. Accordingly, this work was aimed at designing and implementing a prototype of service based on Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) data for the classification of soybean, corn, wheat, rice, and meadow crops. The approach relies on the classification of S2 NDVI time-series (TS) by "user-friendly" supervised classification algorithms: Minimum Distance (MD) and Random Forest (RF). The study area was located in the Vercelli province (NW Italy), which represents a strategic agricultural area in the Piemonte region. Crop classes separability proved to be a key factor during the classification process. Confusion matrices were generated with respect to ground checks (GCs); they showed a high Overall Accuracy (>80%) for both MD and RF approaches. With respect to MD and RF, a new raster layer was generated (hereinafter called Controls Map layer), mapping four levels of classification occurrences, useful for administrative procedures required by PA. The Control Map layer highlighted that only the eight percent of CAP 2019 applications appeared to be critical in terms of consistency between farmers' declarations and classification results. Only for these ones, a GC was warmly suggested, while the 12% must be desirable and the 80% was not required. This information alone suggested that the proposed methodology is able to optimize GCs, making possible to focus ground checks on a limited number of fields, thus determining an economic saving for PA and/or a more effective strategy of controls.

TI  - MAIA S2 Versus Sentinel 2: Spectral Issues and Their Effects in the Precision Farming Context
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT VII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)
CL  - Cagliari, ITALY
AB  - Precision agriculture involves the integration of new technologies including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS) and Remote Sensing (RS) platforms and sensors to allow farmers to maximize the cost-benefit ratio, rather than using the traditional whole-field approach. MAIA S2 is a recent multispectral aerial sensor in strong expansion in the agricultural sector. In this work, MAIA S2 spectral properties were compared with the correspondent Sentinel-2 ones, focusing on possible effects that differences could induce onto agriculture related deductions. The reference dataset was acquired by aerial survey and radiometric and geometric pre-processing achieved to generate the correspondent at-the-ground reflectance multispectral orthomosaic by ordinary workflow as suggested by sensor suppliers. A comparison was achieved at single band level to test spectral consistency of the two data. It showed a low correlation in the red-edge and infrared bands (r < 0.5); oppositely, a higher correlation was found for the visible bands (r > 0.8). To test the effects of found discrepancies between the two data, the correspondent prescription maps were generated using the same clustering criterion. They were then compared to test consistency of deductions.

TI  - A GIS based analysis of essential habitat for six commonly caught species in coastal creeks of Sindh, Pakistan
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate natural resources of some Indus creeks using geospatial technologies. The first phase of the study was a detailed monthly water quality and fish stock survey for one year along with associated environmental observations, which was analysed via Landsat 8 imagery for 2014. In the second phase of the study, appropriate indicators were selected in weighted overlay on ArcGIS platform to perform creek productivity analysis. For this purpose, 13 creeks of Indus delta were selected for detailed analysis. These creeks were chosen using GIS techniques based on accessibility, depth and size. Results obtained from a total number of 65,085 fish catch from 252 identified fisheries important species in which 134 species were estuarine, 107 species marine and 11 species belonged to freshwater. Out of these, six species of Penaeus indicus, Pennahia anea, Stolephorus indicus, Escualosa thoracata, Charybdis sp. and Acanthopagrus arabicus were selected for spatial distribution analysis. It is observed that creeks of west of Jhang River known as Issaro, Waddi Khuddi, Patiani, Mal, Dabbo, Chann, Richhal had higher fish abundance and species richness than those of eastern creeks. The important fisheries species showed strong correlation with mangroves, salinity and temperatures. This study indicated that all parameters were strongly dependent on anthropogenic interventions at the study area and these activities seriously affected fish catch and growth of species mainly because of recent environmental changes. It has been revealed from the creek productivity analysis that the study area is still highly productive and intact as an ecological unit.

AB  - Agriculture has historically been affected by hydrometeorological events. Floods and droughts evidence the vulnerability of farmers and the food production system. We aim to conceptualize a crop risk framework for floods occurring before the onset of the growing season and affecting harvest. We use the NDVI from Sentinel-2 imagery to represent the indirect effects of floods on corn planting. We analyze corn's spatiotemporal variability and associate its phenological development using NDVI to characterize its attributions to floods before the growing season, and develop a framework for hazards, exposure, and vulnerability to flooding. Floods occurred during the crop's pregrowing season evidence a three-week delay in the peak of NDVI during the vegetative and silking phenological stages in 2019, compared to an average year. Crop yields were correlated with the NDVI in 2018 and 2019. Risk estimates were higher in counties where rivers and poor drained soils are present (1%-11%).

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)

AB  - This paper proposes an effective usage of the model-based decomposition by considering the behavior of the Degree of Polarization (DoP) to improve the accuracy of observation using quad-polarimetric SAR data for flooded residential area. The nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition (NNED) is used as the decomposition method. For the volume scattering model in the decomposition, we utilize the Yamaguchi volume scattering model, in which three kinds of distributions are used in relation to physical distribution of the vegetation target under observation. Along with the decomposition, we also examine the variation of the DoP before and after a flood event. By considering the time variations of both the double bounce scattering and the DoP, damage situation of the flood around residential area can be estimated. We show some experimental results of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data including flooded residential area before and after a flood, to confirm the validity of the proposed usage of the decomposition and the DoP.

TI  - Critical Temperature of Axially Loaded Steel Members with Wide-Flange Shapes Exposed to Fire
T2  - ENGINEERING JOURNAL-AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF STEEL CONSTRUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents closed-form equations that were developed to evaluate critical temperatures of structural steel compression and tension members exposed to fire. The deterministic approach involved a parametric study using finite element simulations in order to identify influencing factors-for example, mechanical properties of steel, member slenderness, and axial load ratios. Statistical models were employed to develop closed-form equations representing the best fit of numerical results. A comparison with experimental column test data indicates that the proposed equation for compression members provides a conservative lower bound (16% lower on average) relative to the test data at load ratios greater than 0.3. A sensitivity study was also performed to further explore uncertainty in predicted critical temperatures due to variability of axial load ratios. For both compression and tension members, the ambient-temperature yield stress of steel, Fy, has a great impact on determination of axial load ratios, subsequently influencing the overall accuracy of the critical temperature estimated by the proposed equations. The applicability of the proposed equations is limited to wide-flange steel members that are simply supported, concentrically loaded, and exposed to uniform heating.

AB  - The work is devoted to the comparison of the night airglow intensity of atomic oxygen in the mesopause region, obtained by satellite and ground-based methods. Satellite data used in this work were obtained using a SABER limb radiometer operating on the TIMED platform, ground monitoring data were obtained using a Fabry-Perot KEO Scientific "Arinae" interferometer, adapted for aeronomic research The profile of the natural green glow intensity of the upper atmosphere is calculated on the basis of the profile of the atomic oxygen concentration. The chemical composition and air temperature data, at mesopause region, obtained by the SABER are used to calculate the profiles. The nighttime emission intensity of 557.7 nm, obtained in this way from satellite data, is in good agreement with the results of ground based observations.

TI  - Spatio-temporal extension of the INRA 2018 goat model: 1. application to group feeding
T2  - INRA PRODUCTIONS ANIMALES
M3  - Article
AB  - This publication presents a proposal for an approach aimed at sustaining the feed management of groups of dairy goats based on the individual goat model proposed by INRA (INRA, 2018). The approach developed consists of relying on group management indicators, in particular on the choice of the target animal which is the only one fed to its potential. This choice makes it possible (1) to predict the production potentials of each animal as a function of the actual average productions of the group and the quality of the forage offered (2) to predict the responses of the group of goats in terms of intake of concentrates and forages as well as in terms of milk production and nutritional balance. In addition to the target animal, the average goat, representative of the whole group, and the low producing goat used as sentinel for risky rations are systematically taken into account. The proposed procedures are applicable to different farming contexts. In particular, they can be implemented to establish a ration a priori for a given group or to analyze a ration observed in the field.

T2  - ILHA DO DESTERRO-A JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LITERATURES IN ENGLISH AND CULTURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In The Word for World is Forest (1972), Ursula K. Le Guin imagines a dystopian future where humans (Terrans) are faced with the task of plundering other planets for the resource they have caused the earth to be depleted of: wood. On planet Athshe, Terrans find dense forests and a peaceful population of humans, and are quick to reproduce practices founded in the dualistic logic that sets humans (culture) against nature. These practices and depictions of the earth resonate with the dilemmas of the Anthropocene, the "age of humans; where loss in biodiversity, climate change, massive deforestation, among other things are sounding an alarm that many associate with the end of the world as we know it. Athsheans, as I demonstrate in this paper, put up a resistance to Terran practices that are grounded not in violence (although they unwillingly apply it) but in holding fast to a worldview that is nondualist and dream-based that can serve to inform us in resisting the logic that has led us to the Anthropocene in the first place.

TI  - Behavioral changes adopted to constrain COVID-19 in Japan: What are the implications for seasonal influenza prevention and control?
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Respiratory disease deaths associated with seasonal influenza are estimated to be 290,000 to 650,000 per year globally. In Japan, seasonal influenza affects more than 10 million people per year, and especially children, the elderly, and patients with underlying medical conditions, and seasonal influenza can cause severe illness. As SARSCoV- 2 continues to spread, the combined risk of concurrent influenza epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic are a concern. When the status of influenza virus infections during the 2020-2021 flu season was compared to the 2011 to 2020 flu seasons, data indicated the absence of seasonal influenza outbreaks in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of flu patients was roughly estimated to be 14,000 nationwide from September 2020 to March 2021, which marks the first sharp decrease since national influenza surveillance started in 1987 in conjunction with National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID). Moreover, approximately 500 sentinel sites (designated medical facilities) nationwide reported only 112 patients with severe influenza who required hospitalization. Since prevention and control measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic have become the "new normal", one can reasonably assume that the absence of a seasonal influenza outbreak is related to prevention and control measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Basic infection prevention measures were thoroughly implemented, such as wearing masks, handwashing, and avoiding confined spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings. More importantly, the behavioral changes adopted to constrain COVID-19 during three declared states of emergency reduced population density and contact with people, including closing schools, asking restaurants to reduce their business hours, teleworking, curbing the flow of people during vacation week, etc. These behavioral changes will serve as a valuable reference to reduce the spread of seasonal influenza in the future.

TI  - Lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods in Puerto Rico have more diverse mosquito communities and higher <i>Aedes aegypti</i> abundance
T2  - Journal of Urban Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito community dynamics in urban areas are influenced by an array of both social and ecological factors. Human socioeconomic factors (SEF) can be related to mosquito abundance and diversity as urban mosquito development sites are modified by varying human activity, e.g., level of abandoned structures or amount of accumulated trash. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships among mosquito diversity, populations of Aedes aegypti, and SEF in a tropical urban setting. Mosquitoes were collected using BG Sentinel 2 traps and CDC light traps during three periods between late 2018 and early 2019 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and were identified to species. SEFs (i.e. median household income, population density, college-level educational attainment, unemployment, health insurance coverage, percentage of households below the poverty line, amount of trash and level of abandoned homes) were measured using foot surveys and U.S. Census data. We found 19 species with the two most abundant species being Culex quinquefasciatus (n = 10 641, 87.6%) and Ae. aegypti (n = 1558, 12.8%). We found a positive association between Ae. aegypti abundance and mosquito diversity, which were both negatively related to SES and ecological factors. Specifically, lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods had both more Ae. aegypti and more diverse communities, due to more favorable development habitat, indicating that control efforts should be focused in these areas.

TI  - Wide-Area Land Cover Mapping With Sentinel-1 Imagery Using Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation Models
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) mapping is essential for monitoring the environment and understanding the effects of human activities on it. Recent studies demonstrated successful applications of specific deep learning models to small-scale LC mapping tasks (e.g., wetland mapping). However, it is not readily clear which of the existing state-of-the-art models for natural images are the best candidates to be taken for the particular remote sensing task and data. In this article, we answer that question for mapping the fundamental LC classes using the satellite imaging radar data. We took ESA Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images acquired during the whole summer season of 2018 in Finland, which are representative of the land cover in the country. CORINE LC map was used as a reference, and the models were trained to distinguish between the five major CORINE-based classes. We selected seven among the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models so that they cover a diverse set of approaches: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, PSPNet, BiSeNet, SegNet, FC-DenseNet, and FRRN-B, and further fine-tuned them. Upon evaluation and benchmarking, all the models demonstrated solid performance with overall accuracy between 87.9% and 93.1%, with good to a very good agreement (Kappa statistic between 0.75 and 0.86). The two best models were fully convolutional DenseNets (FC-DenseNet) and SegNet (encoder-decoder-skip), with the latter having a much shorter inference time. Overall, our results indicate that the semantic segmentation models are suitable for efficient wide-area mapping using satellite SAR imagery and provide baseline accuracy against which the newly proposed models should be evaluated.

T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Within the H2020 project PrimeWater, EOMAP is generating operational satellite-based water quality datasets for four different case studies in Europe, Australia and the USA. The applied physics-based retrieval algorithm Modular Inversion and Processing system (MIP) accounts and corrects for a variety of environmental impacts, such as atmospheric conditions, adjacent land cover, water surface and composition of water constituents as well as considering varying observation geometries and sensor properties. It delivers main water quality parameters like turbidity, chlorophyll-a concentrations, secchi disk depth, water temperature and a harmful algae bloom indicator which is sensitive to cyanobacteria. With automated routines for satellite archive access, the fully operational water quality product processing chain as well as the automated delivery mechanisms, the datasets are ingested directly into the online accessible PrimeWater platform and are further used for assimilation with modelled data. Based on Copernicus missions of Sentinel-2A/B combined with additional data from Landsat 8, spatial resolutions down to 10m pixel size allow monitoring of very small water bodies and ponds up to larger reservoirs, such as the Western Water Treatment Plant near Melbourne in Australia, Lake Harsha in USA, Lake Hume in Australia and Lake Mulargia and Flumendosa reservoir in Italy. For these use cases, all available records from 2015 onwards have been processed, with processor-internal quality control mechanisms screening automatically for e.g. cloud shadows or high influences of aerosol, resulting in pixelwise masking of unreliable data. Next to operational monitoring of water quality, the generated time series indicate clear spatial dynamics and seasonal trends.

T2  - CUADERNOS DE LITERATURA
M3  - Article
AB  - The cause of Barbara de Echegaray exemplifies the bond between the female body, sexuality and the accusation of having intimate relationships with the devil. Although the process took place at the end of the 18th century, when the new philosophical currents of Enlightenment were already entering the Colony, the text reflects little more than the version of the Catholic worldview already standardized in the previous century and a half. In this essay, we analyze the clash between female self-expression and the precepts that were preached in sermons an that were also taught in the confessional. In these discourses the symbolism of the devil was considered antagonistic to any spiritual process. Focusing on the figure of Barbara de Echegaray, with reference to other colonial castes in the New Spain, we examine both, the sexual gender nexus as well as socio-religious norms, in order to reveal how free will is articulated when confronted with hegemonic ecclesiastical ideology.

T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women in France. Its management has evolved considerably in recent years with a focus on reducing iatrogenic toxicity.The radiotherapy indications are validated in multidisciplinary consultation meetings; however, questions remain outstanding, particularly regarding hypofractionated radiotherapy, partial breast irradiation, and irradiation of the internal mammary chain and axillary lymph node area.Materials and methods: An online survey was sent to 47 heads of radiotherapy departments in France.The survey consisted of 22 questions concerning indications for irradiation of the supraclavicular, internal mammary and axillary lymph node areas; irradiation techniques and modalities; prescribed doses; and fractionation.Results: Twenty-four out of 47 centers responded (response rate of 51%). This survey demonstrated a wide variation in the prescribed dose regimen, monoisocentric radiotherapy, and indications of irradiation of the lymph node areas.Conclusion: This survey provides insight into the current radiotherapy practice for breast cancer in France. It shows the need to standardize practices.

For the speed-dependent Voigt and Rautian profiles (SDV, SDR) and the HartmannTran profile the difference w(iz(-)) - w(iz(+)) of two complex error functions (essentially Voigt functions) has to be evaluated where the function arguments z(+/-) are given by the sum and difference of two square roots. These two terms describing z(+/-) can be huge and the default implementation of the difference can lead to large cancellation errors. First we demonstrate that these problems can be avoided by a simple reformulation of z(-). Furthermore we show that a single rational approximation of the complex error function valid in the whole complex plane (e.g. by Humaek, 1979 or Weideman, 1994) enables computation of the SDV and SDR with four significant digits or better. Our benchmarks indicate that the SDV and SDR functions are about a factor 2.2 slower compared to the Voigt function, but for evaluation of molecular cross sections this time lag does not significantly prolong the overall program execution because speed-dependent parameters are available only for a fraction of strong lines.

AB  - Constructed languages, also known as conlangs, are languages that have been purposefully created for either real-world or fictional speakers. Within this article, I provide a summary of the language creation process and how the community of conlangers, people who make languages, come to know each other's work, as well as how language creation assignments are being adopted within university classrooms. I also explore the role of the language creator in bringing a community of speakers into existence through the invention of a language. I discuss whether speakers of a constructed language are part of a community of practice or a speech community and the implications for this distinction within anthropology. I also describe conscripts, or constructed orthographies, as well as the relationship between endangered languages and constructed languages, how invented worlds can create real-world shifts in worldview, and suggestions for new directions in research linking anthropology and constructed languages.

AB  - The article analyzes social reasons (particularly, polarization and radicalization in the society) for the degradation of modern Russian language; it also sets forth different forms of verbal aggression (obscenities, invective) as the language phenomena that bear the information about the life of the society. Radicalization of the children's speech in the native language environment is considered as one feature of the linguistic situation in contemporary Russia; the article also considers linguistic safety of a person, society and state, points out that linguistic threat comes from logo sphere that surrounds Russian-speakers today and covers a great part of social space that incorporates false constructs, simulacra, reverse frames, political myths. Phenomenon of the discordance between Russia and the West is shown as a dialogue between civilizations that failed, being based on unequal political structures and social mechanisms of the two types. Also, the article analyzes one of the components of this phenomenon, i.e., phenomenology of contemporary Russian protest as compared to the Western one.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the misconceptions detectable in Force Concept Inventory responses by analysing student selection of distractor items. We discuss the appearance of distinct, coherent, clusters of distractor items which appear in this data. Certain distractor items are structurally central in these groupings and sub-groups within these clusters may be interlinked by "connector" items. Our analysis suggests that these clusters represents a coherent, robust. non-Newtonian worldview. We further suggest that this worldview could be destabilised by correcting a small number of conceptual mistakes.

TI  - Infrared Emission from rocks in the Thermal Infrared (TIR) window
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data provide ground surface temperatures based on the intensity of the thermal infrared (TIR) emission. TIR anomalies that appear to be related to impending earthquake activity were first reported more than 25 years ago. They can reach 10-15 K. To account for such temperature anomalies, it has been widely assumed that, prior to major earthquakes, warm gases or radon are emanating from the ground around the future epicenter. Here a radically different explanation is presented based on the growing evidence that rocks in the Earth's crust contain peroxy defects in their constituent mineral grains. Peroxy defects consist of pairs of tightly coupled O- such as in O3Si-OO-SiO3. Upon application of stress the electrically inactive peroxy defects can break up, releasing highly mobile electronic charge carriers: defect electrons in the O-2-sublattice, called positive holes, symbolized by h(center dot). The h(center dot) are the electronic wave function associated with O- in a matrix of O2-. They have the remarkable ability to flow out of the stressed rock volume, spreading fast and far. At the Earth's surface the h(center dot) become trapped, preferentially at topographic highs. As they recombine, returning to the peroxy state, IR photons of specific energies are emitted in the Thermal Infrared (TIR) window. In laboratory and field experiments rocks were subjected to stress either by loading one end of a rectangular chunk of a black quartz-bearing diorite via a hydraulic press or by stressing granite boulders from the inside out via expanding BUSTAR cement in boreholes. The TIR emission was recording during the build-up of stress up to failure of the rocks. Principal components analysis and a novel application of fluctuation spectroscopy identified several previously unknown phenomena, in particular a series of TIR emission bands that are consistent with the radiative de-excitation of vibrationally "hot" states of peroxy bonds forming at the rock surface and to pink noise suggestive of electron/hole trapping like in semiconductors.

TI  - A High-Performance Multispectral Adaptation GAN for Harmonizing Dense Time Series of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of data acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 earth observation missions produces dense time series (TSs) of multispectral images that are essential for monitoring the dynamics of land-cover and land-use classes across the earth's surface with high temporal resolution. However, the optical sensors of the two missions have different spectral and spatial properties, thus they require a harmonization processing step before they can be exploited in remote sensing applications. In this work, we propose a workflow-based on a deep learning approach to harmonize these two products developed and deployed on an high-performance computing environment. In particular, we use a multispectral generative adversarial network with a U-Net generator and a PatchGan discriminator to integrate existing Landsat-8 TSs with data sensed by the Sentinel-2 mission. We show a qualitative and quantitative comparison with an existing physical method [National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS)] and analyze original and generated data in different experimental setups with the support of spectral distortion metrics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a crop type mapping task is addressed using the harmonized dense TS of images, which achieved an overall accuracy of 87.83% compared to 81.66% of the state-of-the-art method.

T2  - REVISTA ON LINE DE POLITICA E GESTAO EDUCACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The problems of the functioning of sports vocabulary in the semiotic space of political and everyday discourse in France are considered in the study. The characteristics of the components of the discourse picture of the world of the French linguoculture are described, the key element of which is the linguistic personality of the politician and the generalized native speaker. The analysis of factual data is based on a linguistic semiotic approach to their interpretation, as a rule, within the framework of a discourse statement, as well as at the level of the nominative fund of the national language. Sports terminology is considered at the level of general linguistic and ethnocultural dominants of the national discourse. The allocation of the national-cultural component of the lexeme of a sports theme allows studying sportonyms from the point of view of finding information about French linguistic culture, discourse, and linguistic thinking in their usus.

TI  - Imaging Spectroscopy for Conservation Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - As humans continue to alter Earth systems, conservationists look to remote sensing to monitor, inventory, and understand ecosystems and ecosystem processes at large spatial scales. Multispectral remote sensing data are commonly integrated into conservation decision-making frameworks, yet imaging spectroscopy, or hyperspectral remote sensing, is underutilized in conservation. The high spectral resolution of imaging spectrometers captures the chemistry of Earth surfaces, whereas multispectral satellites indirectly represent such surfaces through band ratios. Here, we present case studies wherein imaging spectroscopy was used to inform and improve conservation decision-making and discuss potential future applications. These case studies include a broad array of conservation areas, including forest, dryland, and marine ecosystems, as well as urban applications and methane monitoring. Imaging spectroscopy technology is rapidly developing, especially with regard to satellite-based spectrometers. Improving on and expanding existing applications of imaging spectroscopy to conservation, developing imaging spectroscopy data products for use by other researchers and decision-makers, and pioneering novel uses of imaging spectroscopy will greatly expand the toolset for conservation decision-makers.

TI  - Deep Learning for Land Cover Change Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and its change are crucial for many environmental applications. This study focuses on the land cover classification and change detection with multitemporal and multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite data. To address the challenging land cover change detection task, we rely on two different deep learning architectures and selected pre-processing steps. For example, we define an excluded class and deal with temporal water shoreline changes in the pre-processing. We employ a fully convolutional neural network (FCN), and we combine the FCN with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The FCN can only handle monotemporal input data, while the FCN combined with LSTM can use sequential information (multitemporal). Besides, we provided fixed and variable sequences as training sequences for the combined FCN and LSTM approach. The former refers to using six defined satellite images, while the latter consists of image sequences from an extended training pool of ten images. Further, we propose measures for the robustness concerning the selection of Sentinel-2 image data as evaluation metrics. We can distinguish between actual land cover changes and misclassifications of the deep learning approaches with these metrics. According to the provided metrics, both multitemporal LSTM approaches outperform the monotemporal FCN approach, about 3 to 5 percentage points (p.p.). The LSTM approach trained on the variable sequences detects 3 p.p. more land cover changes than the LSTM approach trained on the fixed sequences. Besides, applying our selected pre-processing improves the water classification and avoids reducing the dataset effectively by 17.6%. The presented LSTM approaches can be modified to provide applicability for a variable number of image sequences since we published the code of the deep learning models. The Sentinel-2 data and the ground truth are also freely available.

TI  - Measuring Economic Activity From Space: A Case Study Using Flying Airplanes and COVID-19
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work introduces a novel solution to measure economic activity through remote sensing for a wide range of spatial areas. We hypothesize that disturbances in human behavior caused by major life-changing events leave signatures in satellite imagery that allows devising relevant image-based indicators to estimate their impact and support decision-makers. We present a case study for the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, which imposed severe mobility restrictions and caused worldwide disruptions, using flying airplane detection around the 30 busiest airports in Europe to quantify and analyze the lockdown's effects and postlockdown recovery. Our solution won the rapid action coronavirus earth observation (RACE) upscaling challenge, sponsored by the European Space Agency and the European Commission, and now is integrated into the RACE dashboard. This platform combines satellite data and artificial intelligence to promote a progressive and safe reopening of essential activities.

TI  - System of Mythonyms in Poetry of Ivan Bunin
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to one of the problems of literary onomastics - an inventory of onomastic units of literary texts as an integral part of the vocabulary of the language of a particular writer. The relevance of the chosen topic is due to the poorly studied issue of the mythonymicon of poetry and prose by I. A. Bunin. The novelty of the work is associated with the description of the mythological names of Bunin the poet as an integral system. The classification of mythonyms is based on five principles: the source from which the name was used (there were three such sources: etiological, anthropogonic, heroic, cult and other types of myths; religious and philosophical literature; multi-genre works of Slavic folklore); the nominated image of a fantastic object (eleven semantic groups are recorded: mythoanthroponyms, theonyms, demononyms, mythotonyms, mythohydronyms, mythoornithonyms, etc.); etymology (otonymic, otapellative and special contextual mythological names are marked); structural type (simple or one-word mythonyms, complex, represented by a bilexeme, and compound mythonyms, two-word and three-word ones are fixed); the presence of connotations in semantics (names with negative and positive connotative backgrounds were found). The author comes to the conclusion that mythonyms in I.A.Bunin's poetry become those stable linguistic signs that carry a huge amount of historical and cultural information and have a rich associative potential, accumulating the specifics of the writer's worldview, they contribute to the modeling of the text space.

AB  - The purpose of the research is to analyze Symon Petliura's journalistic heritage of 1902 - 19017, to explore his views concerning the national issue, in particular, to identify the key factors in the Ukrainians'national revival, who were in Petliura's field of view during his socio-political worldview formation. The Methodology of the Research is based on the principles of historicism, objectivity, comprehensiveness and integrity, systematicity, as well as the use of numerous methods analysis and synthesis, historical comparative, historical typological, problem chronological. The scientific novelty consists in S. Petliura's views comprehensive coverage concerning the role of education, science, culture, journalism, book publishing in the Ukrainians national development process, determining S. Petliura's worldview religious component of the Ukrainian Movement at the beginning of the XXth century, S. Petliura's social democratic and national components' worldview paradigm correlation at the stage of his personality formation. The Conclusions. S. Petliura's creative heritage demonstrates the multi-vector nature of his public interests even before the Ukrainian national revolution breakout in 1917 - 1921. At the same time, the national issues dominated on the pages of S. Petliura's early publications. According to the activist, the Ukrainian school of science, literature, theater, journalism, and book publishing should have promoted the Ukrainians national self-identification development, awareness of the need to achieve the Ukrainian autonomy among the Ukrainians broad circles, and the workers and peasants class struggle. According to S. Petliura, the humanitarian component of the social process had to be socially determined, meet the Ukrainian people needs concerning the national revival and the socialist ideals establishment. S. Petliura considered the Ukrainian people's further national development through the prism of social-democratic postulates. S. Petliura's worldview of that period was also characterized by a religious component, which was not characteristic of the Ukrainian socialists at the beginning of the XXth century.

TI  - Lessons learned for surveillance strategies for trachoma elimination as a public health problem, from the evaluation of approaches utilised by Guinea worm and onchocerciasis programmes: A literature review
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - IntroductionA number of neglected tropical diseases are targeted for elimination or eradication. An effective surveillance system is critical to determine if these goals have been achieved and maintained. Trachoma has two related but morphologically different presentations that are monitored for elimination, the active infectious form of trachoma and trachomatous trichiasis (TT), the progression of the disease. There are a number of lessons learnt from the Guinea worm surveillance system that are particularly compatible for TT surveillance and the onchocerciasis surveillance system which can provide insights for surveillance of the infectious form of trachoma.Methods/Principal findingsA literature search of peer-reviewed published papers and grey literature was conducted using PUBMED and Google Scholar for articles relating to dracunculiasis or Guinea worm, onchocerciasis and trachoma, along with surveillance or elimination or eradication. The abstracts of relevant papers were read and inclusion was determined based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The credibility and bias of relevant papers were also critically assessed using published criteria. A total of 41 papers were identified that were eligible for inclusion into the review.The Guinea worm programme is designed around a surveillance-containment strategy and combines both active and passive surveillance approaches, with a focus on village-based surveillance and reporting. Although rumour reporting and a monetary incentive for the identification of confirmed Guinea worm cases have been reported as successful for identifying previously unknown transmission there is little unbiased evidence to support this conclusion. More rigorous evidence through a randomised controlled trial, influenced by motivational factors identified through formative research, would be necessary in order to consider applicability for TT case finding in an elimination setting. The onchocerciasis surveillance strategy focuses on active surveillance through sentinel surveillance of villages and breeding sites. It relies on an entomological component, monitoring infectivity rates of black flies and an epidemiological component, tracking exposure to infection in humans. Challenges have included the introduction of relatively complex diagnostics that are not readily available in onchocerciasis endemic countries and target thresholds, which are practically unattainable with current diagnostic tests. Although there is utility in monitoring for infection and serological markers in trachoma surveillance, it is important that adequate considerations are made to ensure evidence-based and achievable guidelines for their utility are put in place.Conclusions/SignificanceThe experiences of both the Guinea worm and onchocerciasis surveillance strategies have very useful lessons for trachoma surveillance, pre- and post-validation. The use of a monetary reward for identification of TT cases and further exploration into the use of infection and serological indicators particularly in a post-validation setting to assist in identifying recrudescence would be of particular relevance. The next step would be a real-world evaluation of their relative applicability for trachoma surveillance.

TI  - Predicting Changes in Spatiotemporal Groundwater Storage Through the Integration of Multi-Satellite Data and Deep Learning Models
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring and accurate spatiotemporal groundwater storage change predictions can help support sustainable development and efficient groundwater resources management. In this study, remote sensing-based data were used to develop two deep learning predictive models, long short term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network-LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models. The input variables were terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) recorded by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and the GRACE-Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission, precipitation measured by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, average temperature and soil moisture obtained from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) acquired from the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites. A comparison of groundwater storage change predictions by the two deep learning predictive models with in situ measurements of the National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGMN) in South Korea showed that the CNN-LSTM model was more accurate [root mean square error (RMSE) = 44.92 mm/month, correlation coefficient (r) = 0.70, index of agreement (IOA) = 0.81] than the LSTM model [RMSE = 47.44 mm/month, r = 0.62, and IOA = 0.77]. Furthermore, a comparison of the performance of the two models for three specific regions showed that the CNN-LSTM model captured spatiotemporal variations in groundwater storage better. Additionally, a comparison of cumulative change trends in groundwater storage with the NDVI, MNDWI, and TWSA data showed that changes in land cover and total water storage affect groundwater storage. These comparison results demonstrate that the use of parameters recorded by multiple satellites as training data for deep learning models can play an important role in the model's performance.

TI  - Syphilis Notification Systems in Korea over the Last 20 Years
T2  - Urogenital Tract Infection
M3  - research-article
AB  - Purpose: The syphilis notification system has been revised three times in Korea during the last 20 years. Accordingly, we evaluated the performance of the three systems by analyzing data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).Materials and Methods: We analyzed trends of stage 1, 2, and congenital syphilis cases reported in the KDCA from 2001 to 2010 in the 1st sentinel (S1), from 2011 to 2019 in the 1st universal (U1), and 2020 in the 2nd sentinel (S2) notification system.Results: A total of 21,820 syphilis cases were reported, 9,177 cases in S1, 12,321 in U1, and 322 in S2, respectively. The reported cases can be presented in the form of four expanding waves across the time period. Although the most commonly reported age group with infection was 20-29 years in all three reporting systems, the pattern of infections was different; the number of older patients was relatively high in the S1 group while the number of syphilis cases declined sharply in the older than 20-29 old age group in the U1 and S2 systems. Also, there was a sex-based difference in the three groups; the data from S1 were female-dominant but the data in U1 and S2 were male-dominant.Conclusions: Our results showed that the universal notification system (U1) is superior in both the quantity and quality of data to the previous sentinel system (S1). The results from the new system, S2, are similar to those from U1.

AB  - This paper is aiming to consider theoretical discussions on indigenous knowledge and examine its implications in overcoming the ecological and environmental crisis in the Anthropocene epoch. The Anthropocene is one of key words, which characterize the twenty-first century. It is a period that human behavior is the main factor of geological and environmental changes. Its catastrophic phenomena is urging critical reflections on the ecological and ontological crisis, and further practical action for pulling through it. The conceptual definitions of indigenous knowledge are diverse. This is because both each community’s conditions of existence and academic traditions are different. Hence, scholars in various disciplines give meanings to indigenous knowledge in their own perspectives. It is clear that the differences between indigenous knowledge and western knowledge are cannot be denied. However, it is also true that these two knowledge shares similarities, as well as they are needed to be integrated.Nowadays, the root of the social and environmental crisis is the anthropocentric worldview, which separates human society and nature. The economic system based epistemologically upon the dichotomy of society and nature cannot but loose its soundness. Capitalism grounded on exploitation and plunder is not sustainable any longer because of such a reason. If we leave the current ecological crisis, mankind’s survival itself will continue to be threatened, as well as human society may confront with catastrophe in a near future, which no one can be capable of carrying out. As can be seen from the case studies of some local areas in Africa, indigenous knowledge can be regarded as ancient wisdom or ancient future. Such a fact awakens us once more that past, present and future, as well as all things in the world are interconnected. Now, we should break the frame of thinking, which judge thoughtlessly and distinguish society and nature or humans and non-humans (things), and escape from anthropocentric worldview, which regards nature as the object of control. We have to perceive once more that humans are both part of nature and tenants living in nature. The collective efforts for solving fundamentally contradiction inherent in the capitalist mode of production should be also invested justly.

AB  - (Purpose) Although the budget is the output of policy makers regarding policy preferences and priorities, a clear classification method for IT and information protection budgets is still insufficient in Korea. In addition, systematic research on IT and information protection budgets of central government departments is non-existent. In this study, the trend of the IT budget size and ratio of all central government ministries and agencies during FY 2018-2021 (4 years) is analyzed.(Design/methodology/approach) This study investigates the trends of IT and information protection budgets during the four year period across departments and agencies of Korean central governments. It also conducts two sample t-test to see if there is any significant different between departments and agencies with the IT budge ratio.(Findings) The results of this study show that during the analysis period (FY 2018-2021), the overall central government's IT budget shows an increasing trend, but the ratio of the IT budget to the central government's total budget remains at 1%. In the case of departments, the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Ministry of the Public Administration and Safety, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed the largest IT budget in that order.(Research implications or Originality) This study indicates that the Korean government should allocate more budgetary resources on IT and information protection function in order to maintain leading edge in the era of IT. This is one of the first study which systematically analyzes IT budget in Korea.

AB  - This study used Landsat 8 satellite imagery to identify land surface temperature (LST) and to create a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for Daegu City for analysis of different land cover types. LST for Daegu showed distinctive patterns depending on the NDVI and land cover had negative correlations with LST and NDVI. In addition, urban and industrial areas accounted for the top 20% of LSTs while forests and waters accounted for the bottom 20%. Forest areas had a high NDVI value of 0.447, average NDVI values were highest for deciduous and lowest for coniferous forests. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the role of vegetative cover in the thermal environment in urban areas which has deteriorated due to climate change. This information will help validate urban planning policies that protect green spaces.

TI  - Pixel and Object-Based Machine Learning Classification Schemes for Lithological Mapping Enhancement of Semi-Arid Regions Using Sentinel-2A Imagery: A Case Study of the Southern Moroccan Meseta
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping lithological units of an area using remote sensing data can be broadly grouped into pixel-based (PBIA), sub-pixel based (SPBIA) and object-based (GEOBIA) image analysis approaches. Since it is not only the datasets adequacy but also the correct classification selection that infiuences the lithological mapping. This research is intended to analyze and evaluate the efficiency of these three approaches for lithological mapping in semi-arid areas, by using Sentinel-2A data and many algorithms for image enhancement and spectral analysis, in particular two specialized Band Ratio (BR) and the Independent component analysis (ICA), for that reason the Paleozoic Massif of Skhour Rehamna, situated in the western Moroccan Meseta was chosen. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) that is theoretically more efficient machine learning algorithm (MLA) in geological mapping is used in PBIA and GEOBIA approaches. The evaluation and comparison of the performance of these different methods showed that SVMGEOBIA approach gives the highest overall classification accuracy (OA approximate to 93%) and kappa coefficient (K) of 0, 89, while SPBIA classification showed OA of approximately 89% and kappa coefficient of 0, 84, whereas the lithological maps resulted from SVM-PBIA method exhibit salt and pepper noise, with a lower OA of 87% and kappa coefficient of 0, 80 comparing them with the other classification approaches. From the results of this comparative study, we can conclude that the SVM-GEOBIA classification approach is the most suitable technique for lithological mapping in semi-arid regions, where outcrops are often inaccessible, which complicates classic cartographic work.

AB  - Theoretical and empirical research which was provided a study of influence of psychological and pedagogical characteristics of students as a separate socio-age group on their activity in self-education. Theoretical analysis of potential opportunities for activating students self-education due to age and social aspects of their lives are carried out. Empirical study of goals and motives, life plans, awareness of personal and professional "self-concept" of humanities students showed high interest in self-education in the vast majority of students against the background of partial formation of motivation for personal and professional self-development and generally low awareness of their own characteristics. The positive influences on the self-education of students of humanities faculties of the following psychological and pedagogical factors are revealed: conscious life creation; activity in self-development; ability of self-actualization, self-organization and self-regulation of own development; formation of a humanistic worldview. To enhance the self-education of students with purposeful use of this factors can affect the overall quality of future professional trainings.

TI  - Digital Nomos and the new world order: towards a theological critique of Silicon Valley
T2  - TAPUYA: LATIN AMERICAN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the dominant narratives that form the ideological substrate of global processes, we can identify powerful deterministic and substantivist mythologies about technology. The most influential of these is the worldview of Silicon Valley, as a producer and exporter of a political theology that holds that the impending civilizational crisis will find a technical solution. This worldview has colonized the daily life of the world, providing a new spatial ordering for our present temporality. Various critical currents have placed the substantivist-deterministic narrative in the context of an intellectual history linked to political theology, a conceptual framework that illuminates several functions of this narrative - chief among these, the function of legitimation. Therefore, the sociology of concepts proposed by Carl Schmitt allows us to identify the contradictions present within these contemporary narratives. Political theology, seen as the study of the structures and sources of political legitimacy, helps us elucidate the power that the Siliconian worldview exerts. Among other aspects, the framework of political theology highlights the fundamental invisibility of these mythologies, which is proportional to their power of domination, and sets the basis for a new digital nomos of the earth.

TI  - Ecological State Assessment of Urban Green Spaces Based on Remote Sensing Data. The Case of Aktobe City, Kazakhstan
T2  - JOURNAL OF SETTLEMENTS AND SPATIAL PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid pace of urban development triggers complex problems mostly related to urban environment pollution, and shortcomings of city's improvement. The modern city is characterized by the highest man-made pressure on the natural environment, the main problems being overcrowding, lack of open-access green areas, as well as the decrease of vegetation areas, fact that does not create comfortable living conditions for urban residents. At present, remote sensing methods are some of the priority tools used in vegetation state assessment, particularly, the calculation of vegetation index (NDVI). But often, obtaining the necessary information is limited only to the analysis of satellite data, without geobotanical field surveys, which considerably increase the reliability of the detected results. In addition, the definition of dependencies when using an integrated approach of different man-affected surfaces with a different type of overgrowth within the city remains insufficiently studied. The purpose of this study is to assess the ecological condition of the green area (parks and squares) in Aktobe city. A comprehensive processing of satellite images including the calculation of NDVI index, mapping of green areas and data statistical analysis, was carried out. We learned that the average value of NDVI for green spaces in Aktobe ranges from 0,11 mu m to 0,47 mu m, which allows for the categorization of planted areas by levels of photosynthetic activity, from "unsatisfactory" to "good", yet, with 59% of them in an unsatisfactory condition. This means that the city is underdeveloped in terms of modern landscape and infrastructure. The obtained results make it possible to assess the current situation, determine the dynamics of urban green spaces and optimize spatial planning measures for green space management.

TI  - Semantic Universals of the "Worldview" of Future Counseling Psychologists
T2  - PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The experience gained and recorded in the "worldview" of the interaction of the future psychologist-consultant with the world is "packed" into special structures - semantic universals. Semantic universals have a linguistic expression and open up as meaning. The "worldview" as a stable dynamic system performs an incentive and indicative function and acts as internal activity plan of the future psychologist-consultant. The given property of the "worldview" in reconstruction arouses research interest to modeling methods of its meaningful description as a system of meanings and the main coordinates of semantic experience. Aim. Reveal the specifics of modeling semantic universals as a set of meanings of the "worldview" of future psychologists-consultants. Research procedure. The description of the "meter" was chosen as the type of semantic modeling. It was implemented by the methods of definition of concepts and evaluation grid. The obtained results were processed by the method of hierarchical cluster analysis.Results. The system of semantic universals is obtained, which consists of 12 concepts. As a scheme for their description, measurements of the basic categories "image" were used. The dendrogram designated two generalized clusters of semantic universals: "resource and intention" and "dynamics", which can be considered as the semantic basis of the "worldview" of future psychologists-consultants.Conclusion. The main coordinate points of the "worldview" of future psychologists-consultants are formulated during the establishment of inter-conceptual relations of the system of semantic universals as a text. The lack of measurements of "substantiality" and "event" in the semantic universals of the "worldview" under study revealed the scarcity of their subjective way of classifying events as a response of the world to certain actions and lack of actualization of oneself and one's existence. The indicated position requires the compilation of algorithms and modeling conditions for the development of the systemic existential component of the "worldview" of future psychologists-consultants.

M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover are the result of complex interactions between humans and their environment. This study examines land use and land cover changes in the Lower Neretva Region between 1990 and 2020. Political and economic changes in the early 1990s resulted in changes in the landscape, both directly and indirectly. Multispectral image processing was used to create thematic maps of land use and land cover for 1990, 2005, and 2020. Satellite images from Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 were the main source of data. Land use and land cover structure was assessed using a hybrid approach, combining unsupervised and manual (visual) classification methods. An assessment of classification accuracy was carried out using a confusion matrix and kappa coefficient. According to the results of the study, the percentage of built-up areas increased by almost 33%. Agricultural land and forests and grasslands also increased, while the proportion of swamps and sparse vegetation areas decreased.

AB  - An 2021-flood occurred in South Kalimantan Province caused severe moral and material losses, the destruction of nature, and weakened the wheel of the economy. Rapid identification of affected flood inundation areas spatially is essential for monitoring and assisting in the preparation of emergency responses. Spatial analysis of flood areas utilizes SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images because its wavelength is able to penetrate well through clouds or hazy atmosphere. This study utilizes Sentinel-1A level GRD (Ground Range Detect) - IW (Interferometric Wide Swath Mode) images with VV and VII polarization. We used Remote Sensing Change Detection (RDCD) method and then implemented a flood threshold. Flood event verification is obtained from the crowdsourcing report of flood events through social media.Results shows that 11 districts of South Kalimantan were affected by flooding, namely Balangan Regency (3,498 ha), Banjar (47,548 ha), Barito Kuala (37,530 ha), Hulu Sungai Selatan (9,939 ha), Hulu Sungai Tengah (9,789 ha), Hulu Sungai Utara (13,002.24 ha), Tabalong (4,876 ha), Tanah Laut (25,931 ha), Tapin (15,597 ha), Banjarbaru (2,812 ha) and Banjarmasin (6,570 ha).

AB  - The vegetation area decrease in Tangerang City is in line with economic and population growth, impacting urban air temperature increase called urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon. Detected, UHI is closely related to land-use change. This research aims to reveal the Tangerang City air temperature trend in 2013 - 2020 and its relationship with UHI. A set of Landsat 8 is used to extract the land use and Land Surface Temperature (LST) information as a base to analyze the impact of land-use change on LST. The research shows that a high density of built-up areas has a strong correlation to UHI.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection Based on Multiscale Multidimensional Residual CNN for Optical Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill (OS), as one of the main pollutions in the ocean, is a serious threat to the marine environment. Thus, timely and accurate OS detection (OSD) is necessary for ocean management. In this regard, remote sensing (RS) plays a key role due to multiple advantages over large and remote ocean environments. In this study, a new OSD framework based on a deep learning algorithm was developed for optical RS imagery. The proposed method was based on a multiscale multidimensional residual kernel convolution neural network. The proposed method investigated the deep features by the two-dimensional multiscale residual blocks and, then, utilized them at one-dimensional multiscale residual blocks. In this study, Landsat-5 satellite imagery acquired over the Gulf of Mexico was applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The overall accuracy of the proposed method was more than 95%, and the miss detection and false alarm rates were less than 5%, indicating its high potential for OSD. Moreover, it was observed that the proposed method had better performance compared to other OSD algorithms that were investigated in this study.

TI  - Wildfire Damage Assessment over Australia Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and MODIS Land Cover Product within the Google Earth Engine Cloud Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are major natural disasters negatively affecting human safety, natural ecosystems, and wildlife. Timely and accurate estimation of wildfire burn areas is particularly important for post-fire management and decision making. In this regard, Remote Sensing (RS) images are great resources due to their wide coverage, high spatial and temporal resolution, and low cost. In this study, Australian areas affected by wildfire were estimated using Sentinel-2 imagery and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. To this end, a framework based on change analysis was implemented in two main phases: (1) producing the binary map of burned areas (i.e., burned vs. unburned); (2) estimating burned areas of different Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) types. The first phase was implemented in five main steps: (i) preprocessing, (ii) spectral and spatial feature extraction for pre-fire and post-fire analyses; (iii) prediction of burned areas based on a change detection by differencing the pre-fire and post-fire datasets; (iv) feature selection; and (v) binary mapping of burned areas based on the selected features by the classifiers. The second phase was defining the types of LULC classes over the burned areas using the global MODIS land cover product (MCD12Q1). Based on the test datasets, the proposed framework showed high potential in detecting burned areas with an overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (KC) of 91.02% and 0.82, respectively. It was also observed that the greatest burned area among different LULC classes was related to evergreen needle leaf forests with burning rate of over 25 (%). Finally, the results of this study were in good agreement with the Landsat burned products.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the philosophical understanding of faith in the post-secular world in the context of the phenomenon of interfaith pilgrimage: from the humanism of the Renaissance and Enlightenment (Goethe) to the religion of the laity and religious consumerism in the philosophy of postmodernism. Goethe's model of individual religiosity in the face of challenges to traditional faiths (migration crisis) and the spread of post-secular, poor theology on a global scale as the world-view of a liberal democratic society (exotic churches, evangelics, charismatics, etc.), and also the process of psychologization, even the mythologization of traditional religions, the movement towards a "religion without grace" can be the sought-after alternative, which is a balance between tradition and innovation; and the religious and philosophical worldview of Goethe, conceptually meaningful, is the new horizon of philosophizing after the post-philosophy.

TI  - Understanding temporary reduction in atmospheric pollution and its impacts on coastal aquatic system during COVID-19 lockdown: a case study of South Asia
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The strict lockdown measures not only contributed to curbing the spread of COVID-19 infection, but also improved the environmental conditions worldwide. The main goal of the current study was to investigate the co-benefits of COVID-19 lockdown on the atmosphere and aquatic ecological system under restricted anthropogenic activities in South Asia. The remote sensing data (a) NO2 emissions from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), (b) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and (c) chlorophyll (Chl-a) and turbidity data from MODIS-Aqua Level-3 during Jan-Oct (2020) were analyzed to assess the changes in air and water pollution compared to the last five years (2015-2019). The interactions between the air and water pollution were also investigated using overland runoff and precipitation in 2019 and 2020 at a monthly scale to investigate the anomalous events, which could affect the N loading to coastal regions. The results revealed a considerable drop in the air and water pollution (30-40% reduction in NO2 emissions, 45% in AOD, 50% decline in coastal Chl-a concentration, and 29% decline in turbidity) over South Asia. The rate of reduction in NO2 emissions was found the highest for Lahore (32%), New Delhi (31%), Ahmadabad (29%), Karachi (26%), Hyderabad (24%), and Chennai (17%) during the strict lockdown period from Apr-Jun, 2020. A positive correlation between AOD and NO2 emissions (0.23-0.50) implies that a decrease in AOD is attributed to a reduction in NO2. It was observed that during strict lockdown, the turbidity has decreased by 29%, 11%, 16%, and 17% along the coastal regions of Karachi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and Dhaka, respectively, while a 5-6% increase in turbidity was seen over the Madras during the same period. The findings stress the importance of reduced N emissions due to halted fossil fuel consumption and their relationships with the reduced air and water pollution. It is concluded that the atmospheric and hydrospheric environment can be improved by implementing smart restrictions on fossil fuel consumption with a minimum effect on socioeconomics in the region. Smart constraints on fossil fuel usage are recommended to control air and water pollution even after the social and economic activities resume business-as-usual scenario.

T2  - EQA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ranking 5th at global Climate Vulnerability Index, Pakistan is facing massive decline in the forest cover. Therefore, carbon stock of Pai Forest has been in-vestigated which is converted from a riverine-to-irrigated forest. This study in-corporates the direct and indirect carbon stock inventory development in 2018 and 2020, respectively, using geospatial assessments for which field-based carbon stock of nine tree species (232 individuals) is calculated in 2018 using allometric models which is then statistically correlated with the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) using Landsat-8 satellites. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation In-dex (EVI) were calculated for 2018 and 2020 from 8 quadrats of the forest (each of 800m x 800m) and a regression model was developed using SPSS. Using this model, the indirect estimation of carbon stock was conducted to find out carbon stock of the forest in 2020. Dalbergia sissoo demonstrates the highest potential for carbon sequestration. The results revealed that both NDVI and EVI carbon stock are also declined during in the forest. This carbon stock inventory of Pai Forest will be useful for policymakers to adopt geospatial monitoring assessments while planning sustainable forest management strate-gies to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action.

AB  - The article is devoted to the description of the concept MUSIC in a Russian linguistic worldview. The target of the paper is to analyze Russian lexicographic sources and try to depict the structure of the complex universal concept MUSIC according to the modern postulates of cognitive linguistics. And understand how Russians treats music as a phenomenon. The structure of the concept consists of cognitive elements which is usually verbalized in words. It is spoken in details about sensual image (music is beauty, passion, euphoria), informative content (music is an art in general, a piece of art, the sound of a piece of art and a harmonic sound in general), interpretative content (music is beautiful, music is a message, we need to study it, music educates and entertains us, the names of the musicians becomes the part of our culture, the idioms content the word with musical semantics describe professional sphere of the musicians and social sphere of common people etc.) of the concept. A brief description of musical metaphoric is also given (the music of life, the music of words etc.). The paper concludes with a consideration that MUSIC is a complex and poly aspect phenomenon. The huge number of representatives indicates the important of the concept in Russian worldview.

TI  - Modeling host-feeding preference and molecular systematics of mosquitoes in different ecological niches in Canada
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Several mosquito-borne viruses (mobovirus) cause infections in Canada. Ecological data on mosquito species and host range in Canada remains elusive. The main aim of the current study is to determine the host range and molecular systematics of mosquito species in Canada. Mosquitoes were collected using BG-Sentinel traps and aspirators at 10 trapping sites in Canada during 2018 and 2019. Mosquitoes collected were identified via morphology and molecular techniques. Mosquito sequences were aligned by MUSCLE algorithm and evolutionary systematics were drawn using MEGA and SDT software. Moreover, the source of blood meals was identified using a DNA barcoding technique. A total of 5,708 female mosquitoes over 34 different taxa were collected. DNA barcodes and evolutionary tree analysis confirmed the identification of mosquito species in Canada. Of the total collected samples, 201 specimens were blood-fed female mosquitoes in 20 different taxa. Four mosquito species represented about half (51.47%) of all collected blood-fed specimens: Aede cinereus (39 specimens, 19.11%), Aedes triseriatus (23, 11.27%), Culex pipiens (22, 10.78%), and Anopheles punctipennis (21, 10.29%). The most common blood meal sources were humans (49 mosquito specimens, 24% of all blood-fed mosquito specimen), pigs (44, 21.5%), American red squirrels (28, 13.7%), white-tailed deers (28, 13.7%), and American crows (16, 7.8%). Here, we present the first analysis of the host-feeding preference of different mosquito species in Canada via molecular techniques. Our results on mosquito distribution and behavior will aid in the development of effective mitigation and control strategies to prevent or reduce human/animal health issues in regards to moboviruses.

During the years of Paul's Government an extreme form of centralization has been established in the activities of the State apparatus. With the arrival of Emperor Alexander I, there was, in our opinion, a symbolic removal of the distance between the supreme power and its military support, which, in fact, removed obstacles to the spontaneous inclusion of the military in political activity in the next fluctuations of this monarch's line.

AB  - In the recent past, Pakistan's economy has suffered due to a shortage of electric power. To shorten the production and demand gap, coal reserves in the Thar region of Pakistan are being utilized. During the process of mining, a huge quantity of saline water is being pumped from the mining site to a natural depression called Gorano Dam. This study examines the impact of saline water on land cover in the area. Two scenarios including pre-disposal conditions (February 2017) and existing conditions (February 2020) were compared. Sentinel-II images with a spatial resolution of 10 m were classified using the maximum likelihood supervised classification method. This study also determines the spatial and temporal variation of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the Gorano Dam. Water quality samples were collected to measure TDS. Landsat 8 OLI images were used to develop a linear regression equation between Band 5 reflectance and TDS measurements. Using the regression model, spatiotemporal maps of TDS were developed. The results revealed that the area covered by water in February 2020 was 1,233,100 m(2). After the creation of the dam, the area covered by barren land has decreased from 4,592,100 to 4,134,900 m(2) (9.96% decrease), and the area covered by vegetation has decreased from 3,682,400 to 1,906,500 m(2) (48.23% decrease). The coefficient of determination (R-2) for the multiple regression equation was 0.846. The study will help to understand the impacts of Gorano Dam on the land cover of the area and temporal change in TDS of the dam.

TI  - Wind speed retrieval from the Gaofen-3 synthetic aperture radar for VV- and HH-polarization using a re-tuned algorithm
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a re-tuned algorithm based on the geophysical model function (GMF) C-SARMOD2 is proposed to retrieve wind speed from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery collected by the Chinese C-band Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR. More than 10,000 Vertical-Vertical (VV) and Horizontal-Horizontal (HH) polarization GF-3 images acquired in quad-polarization stripmap (QPS) and wave (WV) modes have been collected during the last three years, in which wind patterns are observed over open seas with incidence angles ranging from 18 degrees to 52 degrees. These images, collocated with wind vectors from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) reanalysis at 0.125 degrees resolution, are used to re-tune the C-SARMOD2 algorithm to specialize it for the GF-3 SAR (CSARMOD-GF). In particular, the CSARMOD-GF performs differently from the C-SARMOD2 at low-to-moderate incidence angles smaller than about 34 degrees. Comparisons with wind speed data from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), Chinese Haiyang-2B (HY-2B) and buoys from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the retrieved wind speed is approximately 1.8 m/s. Additionally, the CSARMOD-GF algorithm outperforms three state-of-the-art methods - C-SARMOD, C-SARMOD2, and CMOD7 - that, when applied to GF-3 SAR imagery, generating a RMSE of approximately 2.0-2.4 m/s.

TI  - Monitoring and Predicting Desert Locust Plague Severity in Asia-Africa Using Multisource Remote Sensing Time-Series Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of large-scale desert locust plague in 2020 has attracted wide attention in the world and caused serious damage to food security and livelihood of African and Asian people. Remote sensing techniques can provide indirect feedback on locust plagues, facilitating quick, and real-time monitoring of the occurrence and development of locusts, which is of great significance for ensuring national and regional food security and stability. The hidden Markov model (HMM) is a classic machine learning model that has been widely applied in the fields of time-series data mining. In this study, we aim to predict the severity of locust plague in croplands using the time-series dynamic change features extracted from remote sensing data via HMM. In addition, we assess the damages on the croplands using change detection methods by comparing the crop spectrum before and after the locust plague from two-phase (Feburary 23 and March 7, 2020) hyperspectral images covering substudy area (northern Narok, Kenya). Evaluated by the ground truth data, the OA of predicted results of the plague severity in April, May, June, and July are 0.78, 0.71, 0.74, and 0.72, respectively. The land cover classification OA of the substudy area of the two-phase images are 97.45 and 96.14. Our study demonstrates the validity of the HMM-based method using the remote sensing time-series data to predict locust plague and evaluate its damage. The results of the cropland change detection suggest that the damage of locusts can be quantitatively evaluated using hyperspectral images.

TI  - Theoretical Analysis of Hospitals' Response to a Per Diem Prospective Payment System
T2  - SEOUL JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Japan has one of the longest average length of stay in hospital (ALOS) among developed countries. To curb the high ALOS, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has launched a payment system reform where instead of the pre-reform fee-for-service system (FFS) a new per-diem prospective payment system (DPC/PDPS) has been gradually adopted. We develop a theoretical framework to model hospitals' incentives under different payment systems and to study the impact of the reform on the ALOS. We show that hospitals with a longer (shorter) pre-reform ALOS shorten (lengthen) their post-reform ALOS. Furthermore, hospitals with longer prereform ALOS have stronger incentives to use planned readmission to decrease the post-reform length of stay associated with a single admission. The theoretical predictions of our model match empirical evidence from the literature.

Seasonal and inter-annual changes in ice coverage were studied over the period 1979-2019, since the uniform series of the satellite data were available for this period. The change of a relatively stable type of ice regime to a regime with a high level of inter-annual variability, which occurred in 2004-2006, was established. A significant negative trend in the change in ice coverage, characteristic of the waters surrounding both archipelagos, was revealed. Correlation and spectral analyses were used to estimate possible periods of cyclic fluctuations in ice coverage (taking into account the limited duration of the observation series), which amounted about 5-6 years. An efforts were made to establish possible relationships between the ice coverage fluctuations and the main atmospheric and oceanic indices. Essentially, no statistical connection with the main atmospheric indices (Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillations) was found, but the feedback with the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation index had been established. The maximum correlation coefficients for Spitsbergen are observed in the winter season, while in the area of Franz-Joseph Land this takes place in summer, which may be attributed to the final velocity of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation signal.

TI  - Estrogenicity of agricultural runoff: A rainfall simulation study of worst-case scenarios using fresh layer and roaster litter, and farrowing swine manure
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientists have correlated land application of animal wastes as fertilizer with the feminization of fish. Two questions were asked. 1) Under a worst case scenario when animal waste (layer and roaster litter, or farrowing swine slurry) is applied and tilled in 24 h prior to a surface-runoff producing rainfall, will estrogenic equivalents exceed the Lowest Observable Effect Concentration (LOEC) for fish (10 ng/L)? 2) Can calcium concentrations in runoff, measured using a rapid meter-based method, be used as a sentinel of elevated estrogenic activity? In a 3-yr study wastes were surface-applied and incorporated and 24 h later, 1.5 by 3m plots were subjected to simulated rainfall and again 1 wk. and 3 wk. later. Nutrients in runoff were also measured, and in year 1 total coliforms and E. coli. were assessed. Except for an initial preliminary test run, runoff from all plots and years never exceeded 10 ng/L E2Eq equivalent. Calcium concentrations in runoff were not related to estrogenicity, negating its use as a sentinel marker. Specific estrogens in animal waste and runoff were identified by mass spectrometry with concentrations in runoff dependant on manure source and timing of rainfall. As expected, total coliform and E. coli concentrations in runoff were increased by the application of layer litter. Concentrations of nutrients in runoff would not be expected to result in surface water concentrations higher than guidelines for protection of aquatic species. Animal wastes applied in quantities appropriate for crop nutrient requirements, tilled into the soil surface, in observance of regulations avoiding application within 24 h of a predicted rain event, should not result in estrogen levels of environmental concern.

TI  - YOLOrs: Object Detection in Multimodal Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep-learning object detection methods that are designed for computer vision applications tend to underperform when applied to remote sensing data. This is because contrary to computer vision, in remote sensing, training data are harder to collect and targets can be very small, occupying only a few pixels in the entire image, and exhibit arbitrary perspective transformations. Detection performance can improve by fusing data from multiple remote sensing modalities, including red, green, blue, infrared, hyperspectral, multispectral, synthetic aperture radar, and light detection and ranging, to name a few. In this article, we propose YOLOrs: a new convolutional neural network, specifically designed for real-time object detection in multimodal remote sensing imagery. YOLOrs can detect objects at multiple scales, with smaller receptive fields to account for small targets, as well as predict target orientations. In addition, YOLOrs introduces a novel mid-level fusion architecture that renders it applicable to multimodal aerial imagery. Our experimental studies compare YOLOrs with contemporary alternatives and corroborate its merits.

TI  - Land cover classification: a comparative analysis of clustering techniques using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated land use land cover (LULC) classification may provide an authentic database of information to the policy makers in various fields like agro-climatic zone planning, waste land inventory projects, vegetation cover analysis, etc. It has a tremendous potential to contribute towards effective policy formulation. This article considers various unsupervised machine learning techniques: K-means, FCM, SOM, meanshift, GMM and HMM for land cover (LC) classification of Sentinel-2 data in the context of Assam, India. These models showed good performance in distinguishing vegetation cover area from the rest of the regions. K-means and FCM showed better performance in comparison to all the considered models. Meanshift correctly classified the continuous stretch of vegetation in study area 2. However, it misclassified between the vegetation and fallow land in study area 1. Similarly, in identifying built-up areas for study area 2 SOM covered the maximum but misclassified severely with other classes in study area 1.

TI  - BEYOND THE EPIC. <i>RICHARD II</i> AND THE NATURE OF THE TRAGIC IN SHAKESPEARE
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The major disagreement on the nature of the epic is rooted in the opposition of two concepts - either the epic draws on the myth, or its optics is regulated by history. In Leonid Pinsky's opinion the way leading from the epic past towards the individual and inward self was the way of Shakespeare's heroes both in his tragedies and history plays. Richard II (1595, opening the second tetralogy) follows one of the two archetypes suggested by Hugh Grady in his article "Shakespeare's links to Machiavelli and Montaigne." Richard is not essentially a machiavellian type, though occasionally called a weak, "deficient" tyrant by critics and a "landlord" (not a king) by John Gaunt in the play. Creating this character Shakespeare makes the first step towards Hamlet. The climax is reached in the scene of his dethronement, much more known for its political topicality than being scrutinized for the discovery a dethroned king is to make. Who is he now? A nonentity, or a new being? The mirror he asks to bring lies, he thinks, when he recognizes his own unchanged face in it. Several scenes in the play (the Queen and Bushy, Richard and his jailor) demonstrate how the lyrical experience, Shakespeare must have acquired in the two plague years (1592-1594), had changed his dramatic technique. In Richard II he gave a start to a new metaphysical tradition.

AB  - The question of the lexicographic description of new words that appeared in the Russian in the period from 2000 to 2020. the thematic groups "Unity" and "Enmity" is considered. A prospectus of an explanatory dictionary of neologisms is presented. namely: the principles of selecting nominations for registration. the structure of a dictionary entry, the rules for describing a lexical unit. It is noted that linguistic facts are registered, in the meanings of which the seines of unity and enmity are contained in the denotative part of the meaning. and words. the semantics of which is determined by the evaluative attitude of the speakers. are not recorded. The inclusion of new linguistic units in the dictionaiy is substantiated due to their absence in other lexicographic sources or a description in a smaller volume than is planned in the source being created. It is pointed out that the leading principles of registering new words in the dictionary being created are the activity of their use, the integrity of the description and the attitude towards the reflection of the linguistic worldview. Using the example of neologisms of different parts of speech. the structure of a dictionary entry is described, which includes. in addition to the heading word and meaning, grammatical and stylistic characteristics, information about the origin and valence, illustrative material demonstrating variants of use in speech. equivalent lexical units, antonyms and derivatives.

TI  - MAX WEBER'S DIALECTICAL RATIONALISM AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIAL SCIENCES
T2  - POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes Weber's epistemology of social sciences (including its political characteristics), which is fragmented in form but strives for synthesis in content. It is based on the "negative" concepts of antimetaphysics and antipositivism on the one side, and on the "positive" concepts of subjectivity and dialectical rationalism on the other. Weber substantiates non-metaphysical, secular, rational principles, relying on a dialectical explanation of rationality. Dialectical rationalism (the concept being first introduced relative to Weber) is based on the statement that rationality is the original source of culture and that it generates itself by the interaction of its two internal modes: "substantive" (sets subjective goals) and "formal" (which is operational, "mathematical" rationality, based on objective logic). In his study of religious history, Weber points to the moment when religious goals once became unreachable, which strengthened the formal rationality and made it finally independent in the modern era. According to Weber's logic, rationality is based on rational goal-setting and the denial of a personal God. This approach separated secularism from a materialistic worldview and, contrary to the positivism approach, legalized religion and all other "subjective" worldviews in modern society. All subjective worldviews have become social subsystems, thus protecting them from discoursive persecution but depriving them of political subjectivity. Social sciences have become a mediator between man and culture. Weber, however, failed to give a definitive definition of the source of rationality and religion, which allows us to assume that there is an implicit theological context in his approach. His combination of a dialectical, anti-metaphysical approach with a theological context creates a theology of nihilism, which lacks the ability to formulate both cultural and political programs for the future; this leads to Weber's "pessimism". One of the possible ways out of this situation is the proceeding and expansion of the Weberian program of a theological understanding of the social epistemology.

AB  - State of the art methodologies for land degradations assessment accepted by United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization and other official organizations that work on food security problems are based on the use of satellite data. In this case, the basis for the land degradation maps are vegetation indices, calculated using combinations of multispectral channels of satellite images. Evaluation of the land degradation state and trends is grounded on the analysis of land productivity maps changes over time (land productivity trend), land cover changes and carbon stocks changes.The most common methodology for the land degradation assessment is used for the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15.3.1 "Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area" calculation. This study considers the improvement for the calculation of land productivity / degradation based on the use of means of net primary productivity (NPP). For the NPP calculation we used open databases of satellite products of MODIS with spatial resolution 500 m and Landsat-8 with 30 m spatial resolution in the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. The satellite data for 2015 to 2019 years were used to build land productivity map and determine the areas of land degradation, productive and sustainable land for the territory of Ukraine. The use of NPP improve the land productivity assessment by consideration of agroclimatic conditions. The results were compared with product of Trends.Earth (official QGIS built-in plugin) which calculate land degradation maps by the UN methodology. The total areas of productive, degraded and sustainable land were calculated for the territory of Ukraine for 2015-2019 period.

In particular, this study validated the land cover map for the territory of Ukraine for 2020 and conducted a comparative analysis of orthophoto data with open Sentinel-2 satellite data, as well as validated some wetland locations from the classification map for Ukraine. Comparative analysis showed that orthophotoplane data have a correlation from 0.3 to 0.7 depending on the drone survey parameters with the Sentinel-2 satellite, and large wetlands on data with 10-meter spatial resolution are identified with an overall accuracy of 90%, but for more accurate details of wetlands contours correct will be the use of orthophotos data.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity is an important indicator of riverine conditions, especially in a fragile environment such as the Tibetan Plateau. Remote sensing, with the advantages of large-scale observations, has been widely applied to monitor turbidity change in lakes and rivers; however, few studies have focused on turbidity change of rivers on the Tibetan Plateau. We investigated the pattern of turbidity change in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, southern Tibetan Plateau, based on multispectral satellite imagery and in situ measurements. We developed empirical models from in situ measured water leaving reflectance and turbidity, and applied the best performed s-curve models on satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Landsat 5 to derive turbidity change in 2007-2017. Our results revealed an overall decreasing spatial trend from the upper to lower streams. Seasonal variations were observed with high turbidity from July to September and low turbidity from October to May. Annual turbidity showed a temporally slightly declining trend from 2007 to 2017. The pattern of turbidity change is affected by the confluence of tributaries and the changes in precipitation and vegetation along the river. These findings provide important insights into the responses of riverine turbidity to climate and environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - PolInSAR Complex Coherence Nonlocal Estimation Using Shape-Adaptive Patches Matching and Trace-Moment-Based NLRB Estimator
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional nonlocal estimations have been demonstrated to be effective and widely used in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PolInSAR) data. However, there still exist some problems about two key steps: 1) in the homogeneous pixels selection step, the regular square (RS) patches matching strategy shows the limited performance in textured area and 2) in the central pixel value estimation from the selected pixels, the well-known Lee estimator, which only uses the intensity statistic, tends to be unstable. To overcome these restrictions, we put forward two robust strategies and then propose an improved PolInSAR complex coherence nonlocal estimation: 1) the shape-adaptive (SA) patch is utilized for flexibly matching the similar pixels in a large search window, which is constructed by combining the likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the region growing (RG) algorithm and 2) the trace-moment-based nonlocal reduced bias (TMB-NLRB) estimator is employed, which considers the interchannel correlations and evaluates more accurately the homogeneity level between the selected pixels. The denoising effect of both strategies is quantitatively analyzed on the simulated data set, and the proposed algorithm is compared with classical estimation algorithms on a TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X PolInSAR data set. These experimental results show that the proposed method provides better performance in speckle reduction, detail preservation, and complex coherence estimation.

TI  - Generating Comparable and Fine-Scale Time Series of Summer Land Surface Temperature for Thermal Environment Monitoring
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images have been widely used for urban heat island (UHI) monitoring in recent studies, among which the summer UHI has attracted more attention. However, the studies based on high spatial resolution images have to use single-day land surface temperature (LST) to analyze the summer UHI, due to the low temporal resolution, which is not representative of the summer and leads to incomparability in the time series. The studies based on low spatial resolution images can generate a time series of representative LSTs for summer (e.g., summer mean LSTs), due to the high temporal resolution, but these LSTs lack sufficient spatial details for a refined analysis. To fill these gaps, we propose to integrate the respective advantages of the above approaches to generate a comparable and fine-scale LST time series with a high spatiotemporal resolution. By normalizing the LSTs between the different satellite images via robust fitting with Huber's M-estimator and moment matching, the comparability is ensured. Furthermore, the high-spatial resolution and high-temporal resolution are combined via the spatiotemporal fusion. Overall, we propose a procedure to produce a comparable time series of annual and fine-scale summer mean LSTs, which can serve as a basis for elaborate analysis of the thermal environment.

TI  - A Gaussian Kernel-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion Model for Agricultural Remote Sensing Monitoring
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the primary data for agricultural remote sensing monitoring. Due to the tradeoff between a single sensor's spatial and temporal resolutions and the impacts of cloud coverage, the time series NDVI data cannot serve well for precision agriculture. In this study, a Gaussian kernel-based spatiotemporal fusion model (GKSFM) was developed to fuse high-resolution NDVI (Landsat) and low-resolution NDVI (MODIS) to produce a daily NDVI product at a 30-m spatial resolution. Considering that the NDVI curve of crop in each growing season can be characterized by Gaussian function, GKSFM used the Gaussian kernel to fit the nonlinear relationship between the high-resolution NDVI and the low-resolution NDVI, to obtain a more reasonable temporal increment. The experimental results show that GKSFM outperformed the comparative models in different proportions of cropland/noncropland and different crop phenology. In addition, GKSFM was also applied for crop mapping of Mishan County by fusing the NDVI images during the crop growing season. This study demonstrates that the accuracy of the proposed method can be improved in the midseason of crops.

AB  - An accurate model for predicting sugarcane yield will benefit many aspects of managing growth and harvest of sugarcane crops. In this study, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery were used in combination with climate, soil and elevation data to predict field-level sugarcane yield across the multiple sugar mill areas in the Wet Tropics of Australia at different time steps over four consecutive growing seasons (2016-2019). A total of approximate to 1400 field-level measurements were used to train predictive machine learning models of cane yield (t/ha), commercial cane sugar (CCS, %), sugar yield (t/ha), crop varieties and ratoon numbers. We compared the predictive performance of models based on both satellite imagery only and a fusion of satellite imagery with climate, soil and topographical information. Randomized search on hyperparameters was the method used to optimize and identify the most accurate decision tree-based machine model. Overall, gradient boosting was the most accurate method for predicting sugarcane attributes. The analysis resulted in cane yield, CCS and sugar yield predicted at the field level with R-2 of up to 0.51 (RMSE = 16 t/ha), 0.63 (RMSE = 1 %) and 0.62 (RMSE = 2 t/ha) as soon as four months before the harvest season. It was also found that sugarcane varieties could be mapped with an accuracy of up to 73.4 %, while the differentiation of planted and ratoon crops exhibited the lowest accuracy of 45.4 %. Using a novel SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to explain the output of our machine learning models we found that Sentinel-2 derived spectral indices were the most important in predicting cane yield as well as differentiating sugarcane varieties and ratoon numbers. In contrast, climate and elevation derived predictors were the most important in predicting CCS and sugar yield. At the whole sugar mill area level, spatially averaged field-level results predicted mill area cane yield, CCS and sugar yield with R-2 of 0.75 (RMSE = 4.6 t/ha), 0.80 (RMSE = 0.6 %) and 0.77 (RMSE = 1 t/ha). Early season prediction of sugarcane yields at both fieldand mill-area level could be valuable for informing fertilizer application, harvest scheduling and marketing decisions.

AB  - RarePlanes is a unique open-source machine learning dataset that incorporates both real and synthetically generated satellite imagery. The RarePlanes dataset specifically focuses on the value of synthetic data to aid computer vision algorithms in their ability to automatically detect aircraft and their attributes in satellite imagery. Although other synthetic/real combination datasets exist, RarePlanes is the largest openly-available very-high resolution dataset built to test the value of synthetic data from an overhead perspective. Previous research has shown that synthetic data can reduce the amount of real training data needed and potentially improve performance for many tasks in the computer vision domain. The real portion of the dataset consists of 253 Maxar World View-3 satellite scenes spanning 112 locations and 2, 142 km(2) with 14, 700 hand-annotated aircraft. The accompanying synthetic dataset is generated via ALReverie's simulation platform and features 50, 000 synthetic satellite images simulating a total area of 9331.2 km 2 with similar to 630, 000 aircraft annotations. Both the real and synthetically generated aircraft feature 10 fine grain attributes including: aircraft length, wingspan, wing-shape, wing-position, wingspan class, propulsion, number of engines, number of vertical-stabilizers, presence of canards, and aircraft role. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the real and synthetic datasets and compare performances. By doing so, we show the value of synthetic data for the task of detecting and classifying aircraft from an overhead perspective.

TI  - Contribution of Polarimetry and Multi-Incidence to Soil Moisture Estimation Over Agricultural Fields Based on Time Series of <i>L</i>-Band SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The alpha approximation method is known to be effective and simple for soil moisture retrieval from time series of synthetic aperture radar data. However, its accuracy is usually degraded by the scattering from vegetation, and it entails working with an underdetermined linear system when solving the unknown surface parameters. In this work, we study how the availability of fully polarimetric data and a diversity in incidence angles can help this method for soil moisture estimation. Results are obtained using data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 campaign acquired by an air-borne <italic>L</italic>-band radar system. The assessment of the performance is based on <italic>in situ</italic> measurements over agricultural fields corresponding to five different crop types: bean, soybean, canola, corn, and wheat. The validation shows that, compared with the original method, the retrieval accuracy can be improved when the polarimetric decomposition is included in the approach. The combination of polarimetric decomposition and multi-incidence observations of enriched data provides the best performance, with a decrease in the final root-mean-square error between 0.4x0025; and 5x0025; with respect to single-pol and single-incidence data. Compared with HH, the results obtained for VV data present a higher accuracy for the overall crop types. The most noticeable improvement is achieved for corn, soybean and wheat, demonstrating the contribution of this extension of the original approach.

TI  - An Improved Method for InSAR Atmospheric Phase Correction in Mountainous Areas
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (TS-InSAR) has been a powerful tool for monitoring land surface deformation over the last two decades. Atmospheric effects cause large-scale delays in InSAR observations, which is one of the difficulties facing deformation calculations from differential InSAR and time-series InSAR. Currently, the atmospheric delay is derived mainly from auxiliary data from sources such as the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometry (MODIS), but GNSS data are limited by the sparse distribution of observation stations. MODIS data may also not temporally match SAR image acquisition, which leads to low accuracy in atmospheric phase correction. This article presents a decomposition method to remove the atmospheric delay. We consider the atmospheric phase to be caused by the combined changes in spatial position and elevation. Therefore, quadtree segmentation is applied to divide the topographic units, and we improve the drift function of universal kriging by adding an elevation component. We then interpolate the whole atmospheric phase space from reliable sampling points estimated by the coherence coefficient. Using Sentinel-1 data, we test the proposed method in discriminating and monitoring a mining subsidence area in Shanxi Province and compare the results with the results from interferometric point target analysis and the network-based variance-covariance estimation method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to existing methods for the detection of deformation inverted from TS-InSAR.

TI  - Step-by-Step Validation of Antarctic ASI AMSR-E Sea-Ice Concentrations by MODIS and an Aerial Image
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of <italic>in situ</italic> data has always posed challenges to remote-sensing-data product validation. Herein, the products of sea-ice concentration (SIC) data derived using the arctic radiation and turbulence interaction study (ARTIST) sea ice (ASI) algorithm were evaluated by comparing them with SICs from a high-resolution sea-ice aerial image obtained during the 27th China Antarctic expedition in January 2011. Results suggest that data obtained from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth-observing system (AMSR-E) underestimate SICs by 19. We performed step-by-step comparisons among the aerial image, moderate-resolution-imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and AMSR-E SIC. These types of comparisons have not been made in previous validation studies. First, SICs acquired from MODIS-Terra imagery were acquired using a tie-point method and corrected by SICs derived from the aerial photography. Second, SICs of MODIS-Aqua images were trained based on the consistency of SIC results between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over the selected region on the same day. Finally, the MODIS-Aqua SICs were employed to validate synchronous AMSR-E swath SIC products. The results show that the AMSR-E products underestimate SICs by 8.5 in the marginal ice zone in comparison with MODIS SICs. According to our further analysis between sea-ice types and AMSR-E biases, the higher the proportion of first-year ice, the smaller the AMSR-E SIC bias. In other words, results suggest that the higher the thin ice proportion, the more the AMSR-E underestimates the SIC.

TI  - Intelligent Perception of Coseismic Landslide Migration Areas Along Sichuan-Tibet Railway
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geological conditions along Sichuan-Tibet Railway are complex, and frequently-occurred landslides have brought severe challenges to the railway construction. Therefore, a complete and accurate landslide perception can provide references for railway route selection and landslide risk governance. In this study, we utilized change vector analysis, principal component analysis, and independent component analysis (ICA) for change detection images generation, and then adopted the multithreshold method to produce the training sample templates for landslides and nonlandslides, respectively. The Markov random field (MRF) algorithm was further used to extract the optimal landslide objects. In particular, we tested the performance of the proposed approach using the Sentinel-2 datasets in a rapid perception of the coseismic landslides for the Nyingchi event that occurred on 18 November 2017 and affected the railway construction. We further calculated completeness, correctness, accuracy, F1-score, and Kappa coefficient, for a quantitative evaluation of landslide perception results. We found that the ICA-based change detection in MRF can extract landslides more completely and accurately. This study set up with the aim to assess the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method in mapping landslide migration areas under complex geological conditions along the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which offers a comprehensively intelligent approach to supporting the hazard mitigation for a safe railway construction and operation.

TI  - Investigation on River Thermal Regime under Dam Influence by Integrating Remote Sensing and Water Temperature Model
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - River water temperature (RWT), a primary parameter for hydrological and ecological processes, is influenced by both climate change and anthropogenic intervention. Studies on such influences have been severely restricted due to the scarcity of river temperature data. This paper proposed a three-stage method to obtain long-term daily water temperature for rivers and river-type reservoirs by integrating remote sensing technique and river water temperature modelling. The proposed three-stage method was applied to the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and validated against in situ measured RWTs in the two study sites, Cuntan and Huanglingmiao. The result showed improvements in the method: the quadrate window selection and RWT correction jointly reduce RMSE from 1.8 to 0.9 degrees C in Cuntan and from 2.1 to 1.2 degrees C in Huanglingmiao. As a whole, the estimated daily RWT has a consistent RMSE of 1.1-1.9 degrees C. Meanwhile, by analysing the Landsat-derived daily RWT, we demonstrated that the TGR had a significant impact on the outflow's thermal regime. At the downstream reach of TGR, an apparent increase in RWT in the cold season and interannual thermal regime delay compared to inflow were found with the increasing water level after the dam construction. All the results and analyses indicate that the proposed three-stage method could be applied to obtain long time series of daily RWT and provide a promising approach to qualitatively analyse RWT variation in the poorly gauged catchment for river water quality monitoring and management.

T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous and unbroken time-series photometry data of Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provide a good opportunity to study the continuous variations in the light curve of binary stars. This paper reports the discoveries of the correlation between the two maxima on the light curve of KIC 06852488 and the correlation between the O'Connell effect and the O - C curve. The Max I and Max II vary with a same cycle length of similar to 2000 days and a 180 degrees phase difference, and the variation of the Max II coincides with the O - C curve of the primary light minima. After analyzing the Kepler and TESS light curves, it is detected that this binary is a semi-detached system with a mass ratio of 0.4622(0.0036). The secondary component is filling its critical Roche lobe, while the primary component is only filling 12.25(0.10)% of the lobe volume that contributes more than 85% luminosity of the total system. The variation of the O'Connell effect could be explained by an evolving hot spot on the primary component and an evolving cool spot on the secondary component. It is found that their positions are symmetrical with the inner Lagrange L1 point. After subtracting the binary brightness changes, six optical flares are detected that come from the cool secondary. We calculated the energy of flares and found that all of the flares are superflares. Both the flares and an evolving dark spot on the lobe-filling secondary component make the system a very interesting source to investigate the effects of binary interaction on the magnetic activities.

TI  - Object-Level Semantic Segmentation on the High-Resolution Gaofen-3 FUSAR-Map Dataset
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification with SAR images mainly focuses on the utilization of fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images. The conventional task of PolSAR classification is single-pixel-based region-level classification using polarimetric target decomposition. In recent years, a large number of high-resolution SAR images have become available, most of which are single-polarization. This article explores the potential of object-level semantic segmentation of high-resolution single-pol SAR images, in particular tailored for the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) sensor. First, a well-annotated GF-3 segmentation dataset "FUSAR-Map" is presented for SAR semantic segmentation. It is based on four data sources: GF-3 single-pol SAR images, Google Earth optical remote sensing images, Google Earth digital maps, and building footprint vector data. It consists of 610 high-resolution GF-3 single-pol SAR images with the size of 1024 x 1024. Second, an encoder-decoder network based on transfer learning is employed to implement semantic segmentation of GF-3 SAR images. For the FUSAR-Map dataset, an optical image pretrained deep convolution neural network (DCNN) is fine-tuned with the SAR training dataset. Experiments on the FUSAR-Map dataset demonstrate the feasibility of object-level semantic segmentation with high-resolution GF-3 single-pol SAR images. Also, our algorithm obtains fourth place about the PolSAR image semantic segmentation on the "2020 Gaofen Challenge on Automated High-Resolution Earth Observation Image Interpretation." The new dataset and the encoder-decoder network are intended as the benchmark data and baseline algorithm for further development of semantic segmentation with high-resolution SAR images. The FUSAR-Map and our algorithm are available at github.com/fudanxu/FUSAR-Map/.

TI  - Geohazards Analysis of the Litang-Batang Section of Sichuan-Tibet Railway Using SAR Interferometry
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sichuan-Tibet Railway (STR), as the second railway connecting the Tibet Autonomous Region with the rest of China, is recognized as a historical challenging project. There are widely distributed geohazards (e.g., landslides, sand-sliding slopes, collapses, ice avalanches, and debris flows) along the STR due to the significantly undulating terrains, unfavorable geological conditions, and intense tectonic movements. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the potential threats for the construction and regular operation of the STR. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a well-known tool for wide area geohazards detection with high precision. In this study, we employed small baseline subset analysis method to retrieve the ground displacement of the Litang-Batang section of the STR with C-band Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired from December 2015 to October 2019. The identified geohazards in this section are landslides, sand-sliding slopes, and seasonal frozen soils. High risk of geohazards is identified in the Maoyaba-Batang section through a hotspot and cluster analysis method. The head area of the ancient earthquake triggered Luanshibao landslide is identified active with displacement rate of -15 mm/yr, which might bring threat to the Sichuan-Tibet highway. Seasonal displacement due to freeze-thawing cycles of the seasonal frozen soils is detected in the alluvial area of the Litang River with maximum amplitude of 20 mm. Seasonal accelerations correlated with concentrated rainfall are identified on active slopes. Our study proved InSAR is an effective tool in detecting and monitoring mountainous unstable slopes.

T2  - REVISTA CHAPINGO SERIE CIENCIAS FORESTALES Y DEL AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Tropical hurricanes modify composition and structure of ecosystems.Objective: To analyze the impact of tropical hurricanes on the recovery and resilience of vegetation cover.Materials and methods: The resilience of the lower basin and estuary of San Jose del Cabo was evaluated by studying the impact of 11 tropical hurricanes (2013-2017) on the vegetation cover. Landsat images were analyzed for each event and two SPOT-6 images for the Hurricane Lidia. The areas of gain, stability, loss and recovery of vegetation types were estimated based on the analysis of changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).Results and discussion: Average stability of vegetation cover was 90 %; however, in the case of hurricane Odile (2014) and Lidia (2017), stability decreased considerably, with a loss of 35.4 and 20.5 %, respectively, being the perennial herbaceous vegetation the most affected. One year after Odile and Lidia, recovery was 8.4 % and 25.4 %, respectively; the most recovered vegetation type was reed-tree. The analysis of SPOT-6 images allowed the detailed observation of Lidia's effect on palm grove. The main cause of its loss was runoff from the stream, which favored the growth of invasive species (Arundo donax L. and Tamarix sp.); furthermore, it was estimated that 1.4 ha were deforested, and an area of 20 ha affected by fire in 2017.Conclusion: Vegetation is resilient to tropical hurricanes; however, events that provide more than 50 % of annual precipitation decrease the capacity of vegetation to recover.

TI  - A Case of Multiple Liver Metastases after Surgery in Elderly HER2-Positive Breast Cancer in Which Anastrozole plus Trastuzumab Was Ineffective but T-DM1 Was Effective
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemotherapy is often difficult to treat human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic recurrent breast cancer in the elderly, and no standard treatment has been established at this point. We experienced a case in which trastuzumab (Tmab) + anastrozole (ANA) was ineffective (progressive disease; PD) in elderly HER2-positive breast cancer with postoperative multiple liver metastases, but T-DM1 was significantly effective (complete response; CR), and treatment could be continued safely. An 82-year-old woman was referred to our department with a right breast mass. A close examination revealed right breast cancer cT1bN0M0 cStage I, and total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. The postoperative pathological result was pT1bN0M0 pStage I (luminal HER2 type). The patient was elderly and had no adjuvant treatment after the operation. Approximately 2 years after the operation, multiple liver metastases were observed, and treatment with ANA and Tmab was started. Four months later, MRI showed that the number of multiple liver metastases increased. The patient was diagnosed with PD, and the anti-HER2 drug was changed from trastuzumab to trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). The dose was reduced due to vomiting (grade 3). Two months later, MRI showed that the multiple liver metastases shrank and became obscure after 5 months. After that, T-DM1 was continued, and the disease did not worsen. In elderly people with difficulty in administering chemotherapy, T-DM1 may have a safe and sufficient therapeutic effect by adjusting the dose and managing side effects appropriately.

TI  - Observations of Emissions and the Influence of Meteorological Conditions during Wildfires: A Case Study in the USA, Brazil, and Australia during the 2018/19 Period
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires can have rapid and long-term effects on air quality, human health, climate change, and the environment. Smoke from large wildfires can travel long distances and have a harmful effect on human health, the environment, and climate in other areas. More recently, in 2018-2019 there have been many large fires. This study focused on the wildfires that occurred in the United States of America (USA), Brazil, and Australia using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) and a TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Specifically, we analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution of black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) and the vertical distribution of smoke. Based on the results, the highest detection of smoke (similar to 14 km) was observed in Brazil; meanwhile, Australia showed the largest BC column burden of similar to 1.5 mg/m(2). The meteorological conditions were similar for all sites during the fires. Moderate temperatures (between 32 and 42 degrees C) and relative humidity (30-50%) were observed, which resulted in drier conditions favorable for the burning of fires. However, the number of active fires was different for each site, with Brazil having 13 times more active fires than the USA and five times more than the number of active fires in Australia. However, the high number of active fires did not translate to higher atmospheric constituent emissions. Overall, this work provides a better understanding of wildfire behavior and the role of meteorological conditions in emissions at various sites.

TI  - Assessment of a web-based irrigation decision support application without the use of field sensors
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - Growers invest a significant amount of time and effort as part of their irrigation decision making in order to apply the optimal amount of water to their crops. Most of these efforts are dedicated to collecting the relevant data for this task (e.g. weather, growth protocols, field sensors, etc.). In this study, a web-based irrigation decision support application that provides a site-specific, daily irrigation recommendation based on remote sensing data, without field sensors or hardware, was evaluated using field experiments. The experiments were conducted in several growing seasons in Israel in almonds, cotton and groundnuts. Results show that the application was able to achieve similar yields and irrigation use efficiency compared to locally advanced practices.

AB  - The family ownership mostly composed of the largest shareholder and the related party has been considered as a homogeneous entity sharing the same goal and interest; neglecting the important of heterogeneity within family ownership. In this paper, drawing on two different views on the related party transactions―the conflict- of-interest view and the efficient-transaction view, we examine the role of the related party with respect to internationalization and performance. Probing 527 family SMEs in Korea for FY 2016-2019, we examine the impact of the related party between the standalone and the family business groups affiliated. By investigating the internationalization of different organizational types in family SMEs, we determine and identify the effect of the related party. Our results suggest the effect of family ownership on internationalization and performance is different for various levels of the related party’s ownership both in affiliated and independent SMEs. In the group affiliated, we find that the firm performance becomes worse as the degree of internationalization increases presumably due to the discrepancy of internationalization propensity between the largest shareholder and the related party. In this paper, we provide empirical evidences that heterogeneity of family ownership results in the conflicts of interests, which, in turn, affects the firm performance of family firms.

AB  - Oats (Avena sativa L.) represent a good forage crop for cultivation in regions with short growing periods and/or cool weather, such as the mountainous areas of southern Korea. In this study, using the Korean elite summer oat varieties ‘High speed’ and ‘Dark horse’, we aimed to determine the optimal time to plant and harvest forage oats seeded in spring and summer in a mountainous area. Seeds were planted three times from late February and early August at 9- or 10-days intervals, respectively, and plants were harvested three times from late May to October at 10-day intervals. The experiment was carried out in an upland field (Jangsu-gun Jeonbuk) in 2015 and 2016. We investigated the changes in forage yield (FY) and quality [crude protein (CP) and total digestible nutrient (TDN) contents] based on the time of planting and harvest. Neither the forage quality nor yield of either spring and summer oats was significantly influenced by the time of planting. The CP of spring oats harvested three times at 10-day intervals from late May was 12.0%, 8.2%, and 6.5%, thereby indicating a reduction with a delay in the time of harvest. In summer oats, CP ranged from 8.4% to 8.7%, although unlike CP in spring oats, was not significantly influenced by the time of harvest. For both forage types, harvest time had no significant effect on TDN. The FY of spring oats harvested in late May and early and mid-June was 10.2, 18.7, and 19.5 ton ha-1, respectively, with that of oats harvested on the latter two dates being significantly increased by 83% and 91%, respectively, compared with that in late May. Similarly, the FY of spring oats harvested in late October and early and mid-November was 7.1, 12.5, and 12.1 ton ha-1, respectively, with that of oats harvested on the latter two dates being significantly increased by 75% and 71%, respectively, compared with that in late October. Taking into consideration forage yield and quality (not less than 8% CP), it would be profitable to plant spring oats in the mountainous areas of southern Korea until March 15 and harvest around June 10, whereas summer oats could be beneficially planted until August 25 and harvested from early November.

TI  - 네팔 문화변화에 따른 선교적 대응

T2  - 복음과 선교
M3  - research-article
AB  - Cultures constantly change. Cultural change happens in forms and meaning, and sometimes a new generation of culture appears.Gospel is delivered through the culture, and in order to do so, it is vital to study culture from a mission perspective, and missional responses should be made according to the changing culture. A proper understanding of changing cultures of a particular generation improves the effectiveness of the mission. At the same time, Gospel also contributes to the cultural transformation. However Christian missions in Nepal are not realizing that the Nepali culture has changed since Christianity was introduced first. They have not realized the importance of Nepali culture through which the Gospel should be delivered. Nepal Christianity rejects the culture completely considering it to be part of Hinduism.Therefore, the cultural study is rarely done in Nepal's Christianity, and mission responses are not reflecting the changing cultures.Due to various digital media and globalization, Nepali culture is changing rapidly. Economic hardship in Nepal has forced many people to leave their country to work abroad, returning home these people bring a new worldview to Nepal. The increase of income-earning contributes to the changes in people’s worldview to materialism, as a result family structure and position and roles of women in the family and society also change. Ever since Christianity reached Nepal, the caste system, marriage culture including child marriage have shown signs of changes.For this reason, this article argues that Nepal Christianity needs to understand and analyze changing culture in Nepal and reorient its mission accordingly. Firstly, it analyzes the culture change and its significance to the Nepali tradition culture and deliverance of the Gospel in Nepal.Secondly, this article attempts to provide a specific missional strategy fitting to the changing new-generation culture. Finally, this article argues that Nepali Christians and church should realize their identity as a culture transformer and carry out the works well. The assumption is that this way Nepal Christianity transforms Nepal culture into Christian culture resulting in church growth.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Optical imaging modalities with properties of real-time, non-invasive, in vivo, and high resolution for image-guided surgery have been widely studied. In this review, we introduce two optical imaging systems, that could be the core of image-guided surgery and introduce the system configuration, implementation, and operation methods. First, we introduce the optical coherence tomography (OCT) system implemented by our research group. This system is implemented based on a sweptsource, and the system has an axial resolution of 11 μm and a lateral resolution of 22 μm. Second, we introduce a fluorescence imaging system. The fluorescence imaging system was implemented based on the absorption and fluorescence wavelength of indocyanine green (ICG), with a light-emitting diode (LED) light source. To confirm the performance of the two imaging systems, human malignant melanoma cells were injected into BALB/c nude mice to create a xenograft model and using this, OCT images of cancer and pathological slide images were compared. In addition, in a mouse model, an intravenous injection of indocyanine green was used with a fluorescence imaging system to detect real-time images moving along blood vessels and to detect sentinel lymph nodes, which could be very important for cancer staging. Finally, polarization-sensitive OCT to find the boundaries of cancer in real-time and real-time image-guided surgery using a developed contrast agent and fluorescence imaging system were introduced.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine the factors influencing the degree of harm caused by fall incidents in hospitals. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study used secondary data from the “Korean Patient Safety Incident Report 2019” and was based on the International Classification for Patient Safety conceptual framework. We analyzed a total of 4,176 fall incidents between January 1 and December 31, 2019, in Korea. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the factors that influence the degree of harm from these incidents. Results: Among the fall incidents, 443 (10.6%) were sentinel events, 2,514 (60.2%) were adverse events, and 1,219 (29.2%) were near misses. The factors associated with sentinel events were old age (â‰¥60 years), gender, patient diagnosis, medical department, early detection after falls, long-term care hospital, and reporters. Adverse events were significantly associated with diagnosis, medical department, nurses’ night shift time, large bed size, location (i.e., operating room, recovery room, and intensive care unit), and reporters. Conclusion: Both patient and incident characteristics are significantly associated with the degree of harm in hospitals. Therefore, multiple factors should be considered to establish healthcare policies and thus prevent fall risks and minimize damage following falls in hospitals.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF BURNT AREAS IN FEDERAL PROTECTED AREAS IN THE SOUTH-EAST OF EUROPEAN RUSSIA
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is aimed to detect burnt sites in Protected Areas (PAs) in the arid zone of Russia: Astrakhansky State Nature Reserve, Bogdinsko-Baskunchaksky State Nature Reserve, Chernye Zemli State Nature Reserve, Melketinsky Sanctuary, Sarpinsky Sanctuary, Kharbinsky Sanctuary, and Stepnoy Sanctuary. The study covers the period of 2001-2019. Regular landscape wildfires are a significant factor of the vegetation cover dynamics. Therefore they should be considered during performing the landscape and environmental research. This study is based on visual expert interpretation of colour-synthesised spectrozonal satellite data of Landsat and Sentinel 2 using shortwave and near infrared bands as well as the analysis of informational products for detecting active wildfire foci and burnt sites. This allowed us to reveal that summer and autumn wildfire events prevail in the Bogdinsko- Baskunchaksky State Nature Reserve, Chernye Zemli State Nature Reserve, Mekletinsky Sanctuary, Sarpinsky Sanctuary, Kharbinsky Sanctuary, and Stepnoy Sanctuary. In the intrazonal landscapes of the River Volga delta of the Astrakhansky State Nature Reserve, over 80% of wildfires occur in March and April. A total of 10 169 wildfire events have been identified over the entire research period in the studied PAs and in the 12-km surroundings. In the Chernye Zemli State Nature Reserve, there were no sites left untouched by a wildfire. In 2006 and 2015, the area of burnt sites in the Chernye Zemli State Nature Reserve exceeded 1100 km(2). Across all of the studied PAs, the largest total burned-out sites were registered in 2002 and 2006, when more than 2500 km(2) were burnt, as well as in 2007, 2011 and 2015, with burnt areas over 1500 km(2). In the Astrakhansky State Nature Reserve, an annual average of 17 wildfire events were registered. In addition, the Astrakhansky State Nature Reserve was characterised by the maximum frequency of wildfire events: up to 18-19 wildfire events at the same sites within an area of about 4 km(2). Astrakhansky State Nature Reserve, Chernye Zemli State Nature Reserve and Stepnoy Sanctuary were characterised by a decrease in wildfire rate with distancing from the boundaries of these PAs. In all steppe PAs, a decrease in wildfire incidence was observed in 2011-2019 as compared to 2000-2010, including by 2.7 times in the Bogdinsko-Baskunchaksky State Nature Reserve and by 30% in the Chernye Zemli State Nature Reserve. Only the Astrakhansky State Nature Reserve demonstrated the absence of considerable changes in the number and area of wildfires during the study period. Mineralised strips along the borders of the Bogdinsko-Baskunchaksky State Nature Reserve up to 20 m wide restrain the advance of wildfire into this PA. So, the area of the Bogdinsko-Baskunchaksky State Nature Reserve is three times less flammable than the area of the Baskunchak Natural Park, which does not have mineralised strips and surrounds the Bogdinsko-Baskunchaksky State Nature Reserve. Along the borders of the Chernye Zemli State Nature Reserve, the width of mineralised strips does not exceed 4-5 m, which is not sufficient to prevent the advance of wildfires. So, up to 90% of wildfires from a 5-km radius and all wildfires from the buffer zone of the Chernye Zemli State Nature Reserve penetrate into the core zone of this PA. The map data obtained as a result of this study can be used to research pyrogenic changes in ecosystems as well as to determine the most flammable areas for optimi sation of preventive measures.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the number of patients with early-stage breast cancer who could benefit from the omission of axillary surgery following the application of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial criteria.Methods A retrospective cohort study conducted in the Hospital da Mulher da Universidade Estadual de Campinas. The study population included 384 women diagnosed with early-stage invasive breast cancer, clinically negative axilla, treated with breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy, from January 2005 to December 2010. The ACOSOG Z0011 trial criteria were applied to this population and a statistical analysis was performed to make a comparison between populations.Results A total of 384 patients underwent breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Of the total number of patients, 86 women underwent axillary lymph node dissection for metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SNLs). One patient underwent axillary node dissection due to a suspicious SLN intraoperatively, thus, she was excluded fromthe study. Among these patients, 82/86 (95.3%) had one to two involved sentinel lymph nodes and met the criteria for the ACOSOG Z0011 trial with the omission of axillary lymph node dissection. Among the 82 eligible women, there were only 13 cases (15.9%) of lymphovascular invasion and 62 cases (75.6%) of tumors measuring up to 2 cm in diameter (T1).Conclusion The ACOSOG Z0011 trial criteria can be applied to a select group of SLN-ositive patients, reducing the costs and morbidities of breast cancer surgery.

AB  - Aim: The present study is an attempt to analyze the land use pattern of Kolleru Lake in and around by using the techniques of remote sensing and GIS to detect the temporal changes of the Kolleru Lake.Methodology: The 1938 and 1967 years topographic sheets and Landsat-5 TM of 1997 and Resoucesat-2 LISS 4 of 2017 satellite images were used and analyzed by the latest version of Arc GIS 10.4 and ERDAS IMAGINE 2016 (Version 16.00). Unsupervised and supervised classification was done for 1997 and 2017 images, respectively.Results: It was estimated from the topographic map of 1938 that the total lake boundary area was 230.15 km(2). Digital image processing of 2017 satellite data revealed that the lake area of 76.9 km(2) (32.45%) only remained degraded, extensively colonized by macrophytes. The land use/land cover maps of 1997 and 2017 revealed that lake area was significantly occupied by aquaculture which amounted to 84 km(2) (36.53%) and 56 km(2) (24.35%), respectively, and no aquaculture activity was reported from 1938 and 1967 toposheets.Interpretation: The geospatial analysis data gives accurate and reliable information and associated factors. The spatio-temporal analysis data provide a significant foundation for monitoring activities in other lake systems, and are applicable to monitoring wetland use patterns in other sites of international importance.

TI  - Cascade Object Detection and Remote Sensing Object Detection Method Based on Trainable Activation Function
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object detection is an important process in surveillance system to locate objects and it is considered as major application in computer vision. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based models have been developed by many researchers for object detection to achieve higher performance. However, existing models have some limitations such as overfitting problem and lower efficiency in small object detection. Object detection in remote sensing hasthe limitations of low efficiency in detecting small object and the existing methods have poor localization. Cascade Object Detection methods have been applied to increase the learning process of the detection model. In this research, the Additive Activation Function (AAF) is applied in a Faster Region based CNN (RCNN) for object detection. The proposed AAF-Faster RCNN method has the advantage of better convergence and clear bounding variance. The Fourier Series and Linear Combination of activation function are used to update the loss function. The Microsoft (MS) COCO datasets and Pascal VOC 2007/2012 are used to evaluate the performance of the AAF-Faster RCNN model. The proposed AAF-Faster RCNN is also analyzed for small object detection in the benchmark dataset. The analysis shows that the proposed AAF-Faster RCNN model has higher efficiency than state-of-art Pay Attention to Them (PAT) model in object detection. To evaluate the performance of AAF-Faster RCNN method of object detection in remote sensing, the NWPU VHR-10 remote sensing data set is used to test the proposed method. The AAF-Faster RCNN model has mean Average Precision (mAP) of 83.1% and existing PAT-SSD512 method has the 81.7%mAP in Pascal VOC 2007 dataset.

AB  - The changes caused by the spread of Covid-19 not only affected the economic and social spheres, but also had a significant impact on the religious component of the life of Russian society. While information on the impact of the pandemic on traditional confessions is regularly covered in the media and in reports of the authorities, the data on the state of the nativist segment of the religious space of the Russian Federation remain outside the informative field and, therefore, outside the academic field. It should be noted that, despite the young age of the neo-pagan movement as one of the brightest directions of new religious movements (Russian Rodnoveric originates in the late 1970s, whereas the similar Polish movement started as early as at the beginning of the 19th century) and the relatively small number of the permanent group, i.e. the community of adepts (according to the community leaders, in the Russian Federation the number of representatives of Slavic paganism ranges from one hundred and twenty to three hundred and twenty thousand people, whereas in the Republic of Poland the number of "Rodzimovets" makes up about two thousand followers), nativism is actively developing and is in the stage of permanent proliferation. The representatives of the constructed ethno-oriented pre-Abrahamic worldview are fully obliged to the fixed passionarity to the figure of the ideologist of the association and the movement as a whole. It is the leaders - a priest, an elder, a shaman, a sorcerer - who act as the only accumulators of ideas and practices, as conductors of nativism. The article draws on the Internet interviewing of representatives of the 21st century nativism phenomenon (Russia, Poland) and examines the complex of reactions of the studied community to the consequences of the emergence and spread of the virus. Leaders and rank-and-file representatives of Slavic Rodnoverie, Neo-Tradition (non-traditional paganism), shamanism, Lithuanian paganism, Asatru (German-Scandinavian tradition), Shuy Way (left hand path), Iron Din (Ossetian traditional faith) took part in the survey. Despite the lack of a unified point of view when characterising the effect of the virus on nativism, the analysis of the material obtained revealed three main types of responses of nativists to the spread of the pandemic. These include mythology-based, conspirological and sanitation theories.

T2  - COSMOS AND HISTORY-THE JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate change is one of the most contentious issues discussed in the public arena today. Environmental activists argue that the climate change is not an act of nature or God but is a result of human actions. Environmental critics do not see the degradation of the environment as merely a result of wrongheaded or misguided policies. Their critique goes much deeper. For many environmental activists, this degradation reflects a fundamental flaw that is deeply rooted in our culture. They identify this flaw as anthropocentrism, or a worldview that assigns to humans and human values the primary place in the cosmic order. Their proposed solution is to reject this worldview and adopt a new egalitarian vision in which humans and the rest of nature will have equal value.This article agrees with the view that anthropocentrism presents a real problem for our civilization. However, it takes a much broader approach to this problem that goes beyond the critique of environmentalists. First, it sees that the source of anthropocentrism lies much deeper than the environmentalists think. The source is the pattern in human thinking that emerged when early humans began to walk the face of earth. Early humans did not see the important role of the process of creation in the way they perceived, interpreted, and represented reality. The article explains the importance of the process of creation in the way we think. The article sees the source of anthropocentrism in the failure to recognize the importance of the process of creation and in the way this failure affects our thinking. It has resulted in a view of reality that is limited, exclusionary, and ultimately subjective. This failure has left humans no choice but to view reality through the prism of mental constructs that they create, which is the main source of anthropocentrism. Also, environmentalists see the problem of anthropocentrism primarily in its relationship to the environment. The article emphasizes that anthropocentrism is a broad phenomenon that affects many areas of our life.Finally, the article examines major solutions that address the problem of anthropocentrism and offers their critique. It sees their principal common shortcoming in their exclusionary approach and outlines a new and inclusive approach.

T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two key sites representing virgin and pasture biotopes were studied. Their soil parameters were identified, brief descriptions of the vegetation were given, and the spectral-reflective characteristics of the vegetation cover (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) were calculated based on Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery. The seasonal dynamics of the structure of soil nematode communities in chestnut solonetzic soils affected by grazing pressure was examined. A number of characteristic features manifested in the species diversity of the nematode fauna, changes in their total abundance, and the predominance of certain trophic groups and genera have been identified. In total, 133 taxa were registered on the key sites; 58 species have been identified. It is established that the specific features of the soil nematode communities in various seasons of the year are manifested by the predominance of certain trophic groups and genera, as well as their total abundance on the key sites. Overall, the nematode fauna is quite diverse: the Shannon index varies throughout the year within the same range of values. The Bongers maturity index (MI) for the nematode fauna indicates that their habitat conditions are stable.

TI  - TO THE ORIGINS OF RUSSIAN SOCIAL WORLDVIEW: THE THEME OF "GRACE"
T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the antithesis of Law and Grace, presented in the work "The Word about Law and Grace" by presbyter Hilarion, later Metropolitan of Kiev (mid. 11th century). The historical and sociological interest in this work is justified by its undoubted importance for revealing the mental origins of the Russian social worldview and, in the long term, the ideological and value prerequisites of the national sociological discourse. The consequences of the value choice set by the dilemma of the Law/Grace for the formation of the national civil-law culture are noted. It is proposed to consider Slavophilism and The Russian ethical-sociological subjective school through the prism of this dilemma. The development of this dilemma in differentiating the concepts of law and truth, truth and truth, "truth-truth" and "truth-justice" (N.K. Mikhailovsky) is shown. It is suggested that the ideological and worldview complex in which Grace dominates the Law, determined the specific feature of Russian sociological thought during its formation - the priority of moral sense and ethics over objective law conformity (N.G. Mikhailovsky, P.L. Lavrov).

TI  - The Sharing Economy and Social Capital: The Fictional Expectations of Sociality in a Time Bank
T2  - MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article looks at time banking - a system of exchange in which people trade services with one another using time instead of money as currency. Time banking is framed . from a social work perspective as a social innovation that contributes to poverty alleviation and increasing inclusion. However, most such organizations fail to institutionalize as care providers and fail within the first three years. In this paper, I discuss a rare success story a time bank in Nizhny Novgorod, the fourth largest city in Russia-which has been functioning for over 15 years and positioned itself as a non-charitable organization.I engage with sharing economy studies a growing but ambiguous field to explain the success of the time bank in Nizhny Novgorod. Research in the sharing economy has mostly concentrated on two extreme cases: business-to-customer operations or grassroots communities practicing radical alternatives to market exchange. The case studies have been united by an assumption that sharing economy organizations would generate social capital. However, there has been limited evidence to support this claim. In this article, I aim to test this hypothesis and explore whether the informal networks, norms of reciprocity and trust that are fostered among members of the Nizhny Novgorod time bank are the factors that explain the sustainability of this association.The study is informed by 22 in-depth interviews with the gatekeepers and members of this community. In the interviews, I paid attention to the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants and the structure of their social capital; the characteristics of the mode of exchange practiced in the community (the volume, direction, and range of services, the relatedness to professional activities and other spheres of life); their value set and worldview (egalitarianism, altruism, justice); and indicators of generalized trust.Results revealed that lime bankers do not tend to create strong and sustainable relationships outside of the framework of the exchange. I put forward the following explanatoty hypothesis: the calculativeness of time bankers, the market-driven valuations of 'egalitarian 'service exchange and a unilateral attitude to the exchange are in conflict with a longing for Gemeinschaft-a community with strong bonding interdependence based on the norms of mutuality. This association failed to provide the conditions for generalized trust to emerge. The attempt to simultaneously create a tightly bonded community, but still answer the needs of the digital age resulted in a pastiche of a sharing economy platform.Beyond the case at hand, this study theorizes the rhetoric and reality of the sharing economy by summarizing the grounds for the expectations of generating social capital and explains why certain expectations could not be met.

AB  - Reconstruction of aerosol microphysical properties sometimes is like an art. With the lack of complete information about EM wave scattering on particles, we have to use some approximations. This is especially important in lidar sounding of the atmosphere.Aerosol scattering properties depends on complex refractive index of scattering medium, incident wavelengths, aerosol size distribution, scattering angle. On practice we only have backscattering signal at some wavelengths at backscattering. In this paper, we consider a new approach to processing active remote sensing data, which allows us to estimate the concentration of particles, as well as to estimate the most likely values of the complex refractive index. This approach is based on the further development of the Umov effect.

T2  - 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE TROPICAL LAND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Conference on Sustainable Tropical Land Management (ICSTLM)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The long drought experienced in Indonesia in the past was identified as one of the main factors in the failure of rice production. The application of rice crop insurance was introduced since 2015 to help rice farmers who suffered from farm damage. The claim was increased year by year, with the highest in 2018-2019 (12,253 ha). The main problem associated with the insurance claim is the delay of inspection of the drought-affected land. Meanwhile, various satellite data can provide relevant information more quickly for those affected areas. The purpose of this study is to examine the potential use of satellite data to detect drought to support the rice crop insurance program. Daily and monthly rainfall data derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) and Multifunctional Transport Satellites (MTSAT) were analyzed to identify meteorological drought. Agricultural drought is studied through the character of several indices from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Preliminary results showed that up to 89.45% of the analysis comformed with field conditions. Satellite data has its potential to be utilized in the identification of claims on agricultural insurance which requires information on land damage due to drought.

TI  - The so-called paradox of fiction and transcendental ontology
T2  - FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - While the phenomenon of our feeling of empathy for literary characters has escorted the history of imaginative writing from the very beginning, its ontological foundations have been investigated only from 1970s. The question is about different theories of "the paradox of fiction" which was introduced by Colin Redford. The basic idea behind the paradox is that empathy for the nonexistent characters of fiction and their interrelations as real is paradoxical and so demands explanation. Having presented the main doctrines related to the subject matter, the author of the article comes to the conclusion that there is no such thing as a paradox in this case. What there is is a single-level reductionist naturalistic worldview which comes into collision with both the phenomenology of the relevant feeling of empathy and the definitions of existence offered by the history of European philosophy as well as their reliable counterparts outside it. According to these definitions, to exist is to be perceptible and have causality, the latter "index" being emphasized in the article to the result that the activity of literary characters provides them with a higher ontological status compared to some other classes of mental objects. All this justifies the author in advancing the conception of heterogeneity of existence and his attempts to use quantifiers in relation to it.

"What is philosophy" - outline of a lecture or report in three ver sions [up to 1922]. Draft autograph in ink and pencil). Three versions of the abstract of the report have survived (on the backs, in cursive writing by Shpet, the debate on the report is also written). The version presented here the third - is written in black ink (fol. 13- 17). It contains three layers of editing: adding and correcting with a simple pencil (in the margins), lilac pencil (correcting pagination), red (adding in the margins), and underlining in red and blue pencil (this way of underlining is peculiar to Shpet, who thus marked all his oral presentations; these stresses are not reproduced due to their multiplic ity). The text is given in the last edition with the introduction of corrections made by Shpet's hand using different pencils. Abbreviations and individual signs from Shpet's cursive writing are disclosed without special instructions. All notes belong to the publisher. Italicized words and phrases underlined by Shpet in black italic and in bold - underlined in black twice. The reconstructed text will be presented in the book "Institute of Scientific Philosophy. Beginning" (Moscow: ROSSPEN, in press).

TI  - Using GatorEye UAV-Borne LiDAR to Quantify the Spatial and Temporal Effects of a Prescribed Fire on Understory Height and Biomass in a Pine Savanna
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the pine savannas of the southeastern United States, prescribed fire is commonly used to manipulate understory structure and composition. Understory characteristics have traditionally been monitored with field sampling; however, remote sensing could provide rapid, spatially explicit monitoring of understory dynamics. We contrasted pre- vs. post-fire understory characteristics collected with fixed area plots with estimates from high-density LiDAR point clouds collected using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne GatorEye system. Measuring within 1 x 1 m field plots (n = 20), we found average understory height ranged from 0.17-1.26 m and biomass from 0.26-4.86 Mg C ha(-1) before the fire (May 2018), and five months after the fire (November 2018), height ranged from 0.11-1.09 m and biomass from 0.04-3.03 Mg C ha(-1). Understory heights estimated with LiDAR were significantly correlated with plot height measurements (R-2 = 0.576, p <= 0.001). Understory biomass was correlated with in situ heights (R-2 = 0.579, p <= 0.001) and LiDAR heights (R-2 = 0.507, p <= 0.001). The biomass estimates made with either height measurement did not differ for the measurement plots (p = 0.263). However, for the larger research area, the understory biomass estimated with the LiDAR indicated a smaller difference after the burn (similar to 12.7% biomass reduction) than observed with in situ measurements (similar to 16% biomass reduction). The two approaches likely differed because the research area's spatial variability was not captured by the in-situ measurements (0.2% of the research area measured) versus the wall-to-wall coverage provided by LiDAR. The additional benefit of having spatially explicit measurements with LiDAR, and its ease of use, make it a promising tool for land managers wanting greater spatial and temporal resolution in tracking understory biomass and its response to prescribed fire.

AB  - Problem of city planning today is very actual and it's solving require use of state-of-the-art remote sensing technologies for the achievement of the sustainable urban environment. In this paper we propose the new approach for smart city greening strategy planning optimization with use of satellite data based on the best practices of remote sensing technologies usage. This approach take into account Remote sensing indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Land Surface Temperature, Building Density, Tree Density, land cover/use and it's trends. Based on this indicators it is possible to classify urban atlas's (cities digital plane with CORINE-based classification) polygons on 4 classes: zones with highest priorities for planning changes and this changes can be made using greening strategy, zones with highest priorities for planning changes and this changes can not be made using greening strategy, zones with second priorities for planning changes, zones with sustainable indicators. This approach demonstrated on the Irpin city analysis.

AB  - Ukraine's big problem is the disappearance of forest cover. According to the international forest monitoring project Global Forest Watch, Ukraine lost 1.08Mha of forests from 2000 to 2020. Such sad statistics are possible only due to the lack of monitoring tools for the forest industry in Ukraine. Such a tool can be created by combining Remote Sensing and Deep Learning approaches. To implement such approach for the automatic use, we combine Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar images of the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite missions on which object-detection is performed using a U-Net-based neural network trained with use of the semi-supervised learning technique. This approach is being tested and shows its effectiveness in Kyiv region and going to be implemented in the same way for the Lviv, Odessa and Zakarpatya oblasts.

AB  - The article deals with the linguistic representation of the notion of "migrant children" in the naive consciousness of native Russian speakers. The notion under study correlates with the worldview as an integral image of the world in a person's mind. As the worldview is a multilevel phenomenon, there are different levels of generalization and representation of knowledge. Usually, the linguistic worldview is investigated precisely in relation to the specific ethnocultural features of a particular people and correlates with large ethnocultural groups. Based on the associates obtained as a result of a free association experiment, a field model of the concept of "migrant children" is developed.

TI  - A review of advances in the retrieval of aerosol properties by remote sensing multi-angle technology
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Using satellite observation data to retrieve atmospheric pollution parameters has become a common technique in the field of remote sensing. Compared with the traditional single-angle and only intensity detection signal loads, multi-angle with/or polarized remote sensing observation instruments provide new ideas for detecting aerosol parameters. Nowadays, multi-angle detection technology and the development of advanced detection loads have become one of the main directions in the field of remote sensing. From the perspective of aerosol characterization from remote sensing measurements, this paper first summarized the information of typical instruments among the development of airborne, space-borne and ground-based detections in various countries. Second, taking the Multi-Angle Imaging SpectraRadiometer (MISR) aboard on Terra, Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectance for Atmospheric Sciences Coupled with Observations from a LiDAR (PARASOL)/POLDER and Directional Polarized Camera aboard on Gaofen-5 (GF-5/DPC) respectively as representatives of the multi-angle only intensity signal (MAOI, hereafter) and multi-angle polarized signal (MAPS, hereafter), using AERONET/CE-318 as the repre-sentative of ground-based remote sensing observations, respectively introduced the current research status of their aerosol characteristics in recent years from three perspectives of data set accuracy evaluation, inversion algorithm improvement and product application. To be specific, 1) the improvements based on MAOI are mainly reflected in the optimization of the aerosol model, and the difficulty lies in how to express the surface contribution by using the empirical orthogonal function. The narrow swath and coarse temporal resolution of MISR determine the rarely popular as MODIS. A higher resolution at 4.4kmx4.4 km provide data support for investigating the evolution trends of regional aerosol properties at the regional scale. 2) In addition to establish more approximate aerosol models and acute surface reflectance functions by MAPS, the method of optimal estimation and multi-variate statistical optimal data have been developed to retrieve fine AOD, particle distribution, polarized phase function and etc. Finally, based on the above investigation, it is found that, 1) the planned payloads not only add polarization signal, but also take the importance of multi-spectral into consideration, particularly in near-infrared and short-wave infrared channels, which makes more contributions to improve the retrieval information for coarse particles. 2) The Lookup table-based inversion methods require to refine more appropriate aerosol types and precise surface reflectance relationship, but for the rich information content of hyperspectral load, the inversion efficiency of this method needs to be improved. 3) In addition, the complement of MAOI and MAPS and the fusion of inversion algorithms is also a way to improve the overall inversion accuracy of aerosol characteristics. 4) While improving load performance and enhancing matching inversion algorithms, it is also necessary to vigorously develop calibration techniques for polarized loads, and stable and high-precision calibration coefficients provide the basis for the development of secondary products and the application of tertiary products. 5) domestic MAPS instrument as well as polarization lidar need to be put on the agenda.

TI  - High spatial resolution WRF-Chem model over Asia: Physics and chemistry evaluation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The representation of air quality and meteorology over Asia remains challenging for chemical transport models as a result of the complex interactions between the East Asian monsoons and the large uncertainty (in space and time) of the high anthropogenic emissions levels over the region. High spatial resolution models allow resolving small-scale features induced by the complex topography of this region. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) was used to simulate the spatial and seasonal variability of main physical and chemical variables over Asia for the year 2015 at 8-km horizontal resolution to enable resolving small-scale features induced by the region complex topography. The simulated atmospheric composition was evaluated against satellite retrievals (MOPITT, IASI + GOME2, MODIS and OMI) in addition to ground-based observations in China for the year 2015, while the meteorological variables were evaluated by several observational-based datasets (ERA5, CRU, MODIS, MTE). Results showed low to moderate seasonal biases for major meteorological variables, i.e. air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, latent heat, sensible heat and snow cover fraction. Overall, WRF-Chem reproduced well the spatial and seasonal variability of lowermost tropospheric ozone content, total column carbon monoxide and aerosol optical depth, while large discrepancies were found for tropospheric nitrogen dioxide content, mainly during the warm season. In consistency with previous studies, the different biases between model-simulated and satellite-retrieved values can be mainly attributed to i) the large uncertainties in anthropogenic and natural nitrogen oxides emission estimates, as well as dust and sea salt emissions in the case of aerosol optical depth, and ii) some coarse parameterizations used to reproduce main small-scale features (e.g. meteorology, chemical processes, dry deposition to vegetation). Compared to ground-based observations, the WRF-Chem model reproduced well the mean annual cycle of surface nitrogen dioxide, ozone and fine particles concentrations in all seasons across China. Our results suggest that WRF-Chem provides reliable spatio-temporal patterns for most of the meteorological and chemical variables, adding thus confidence to its applicability in the context of air pollution risk assessment to human and ecosystems health.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of vegetation cover changes around surface water based on NDVI: a case study in Korama basin, Southern Zinder, Niger
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the modern era, vegetation dynamics is an important aspect of climate change studies. The present study examined spatiotemporal changes of (NDVI) normalized difference vegetation index in the Korama basin (Southern Zinder of Niger) from 2000 to 2018, and their correlation with climatic factors was predicted. To analyze the change of vegetation cover, geographical information system, MODIS_NDVI, remote sensing, and climate variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) datasets were used. Further, the correlation was performed for different years of vegetation types during the growing season (June-October). Our results show an increasing trend in average maximum annual NDVI across the Korama River Basin in the years 2000 and 2018. Conversely, significantly increasing trends in most of the areas were reported. Moreover, in downstream the vegetation cover is increased in Matameye and Magaria, but with a smaller increase in the upstream rate in Mirriah. Furthermore, a decrease in the surface water was observed in the Tessaoua, Matameye, and Magaria sections of the study region in 2000 and 2018, while a rise in water surface area was observed in Matameye and Magaria in the years 2006 and 2012. During rainy and dry seasons, NDVI correlated differently with temperature and precipitation with strong seasonal variations, while the mean vegetation period of NDVI does not show any significant change. In addition, moderate increase was observed in years 2000 and 2012 (r: 0.22; P: 0.50; R-2: 0.05; r: 0.31; P: 0.34, R-2: 0.10, respectively), and weak decrease in 2006 and 2018 (r: 0.61; P: 0.04; R-2: 0.37; r: 0.58; P: 0.06, R-2:0.33, respectively). The analysis indicates that climatic parameters such as precipitation and temperature are the main limiting factors affecting the vegetation growth. Indeed, the trends calculated by the correlation analysis showed that as climate factors increased (July, August, and September), the NDVI value increased at a rate of 0.16, reflecting the best growth in vegetation and rise in water bodies, although significantly decreased during years. This study would be highly useful in choice-making for sustainable water resource management in the Korama watershed in Southern Zinder, Niger.

T2  - PAMIEC I SPRAWIEDLIWOSC
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the process of disintegration of the PAX Association after the events of October 1956. In response to criticism of the activities of the association's leader, Boleslaw Piasecki, the opposition formed the "Secession" Its core was made up of several distinct milieus working together, including: part of the editorial team of Kierunki (e.g. Anna Morawska, Stefan Kurowski, and Jacek Wejroch); Slowo Powszechne (Ligia Illakowicz, Ewa Fiala, Lech Bartoszyriski, and Zygmunt Krasucki); the so-called "parliamentary fraction" (Konstanty Lubienski and Jan Frankowski), representatives of the association's branches (including Lublin and Szczecin); independent journalists (e.g. Jan Meysztowicz, Jerzy Mikke, and Aleksander Bochenski); and a group of "young poets" associated with the Wroclawski Tygodnik Katolikow (e.g. Jerzy Krzyszton, Wladyslaw Terlecki, Jacek Lukasiewicz, and Stanislaw Grochowiak). After an unsuccessful attempt to take over power in PAX in September 1956, they established the Provisional Coordinating Committee of Catholic Activists at the National Committee of the National Front. In March 1957, the so-called "sesese" formed the Christian Social Association. It also obtained concessions from the communist authorities and received permission to publish its own weekly (Za i Przeciw) and to lease the Ars Christian company. The ideological profile of the group was ambiguous, as it consisted of two currents: the Catholics and the revisionists (leftists). As a result of internal personnel and ideological disputes, a split took place in the fall of 1957. Its leading representatives (including Micewski, Horodynski, Kgtrzynski, and Lubienski) left the "Secession." Frankowski's supporters formed the Christian Social Association. In terms of the program, he focused mainly on the promotion of ecumenism, interfaith dialogue, and the teaching of the Second Vatican Council. Despite its declared Catholic worldview, the Christian Social Association did not enjoy special recognition in the Church, either by the Episcopate or other groups of lay Catholics. They were treated as a servile group of lay Catholics who were totally dependent on the authorities and lacked ideological clarity.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic forced many countries to adopt lockdown measures, temporarily closing factories, diminish maritime traffic and reducing the mobility of people in the cities. Analysis from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board Europe's Sentinel-5P, 3A/B respectively, for the first wave of the COVID-19, have shown a substantial improvement in air and water quality. More specifically, since COVID-19 lockdown until the end April, Lisbon and Porto were at their lowest PM10 levels of about 20% and a drop of 33% in 2 years, while Madrid had a significant drop since lockdown with vales significantly below 2018 levels but still close to 2019 levels. In terms of NO2 levels, Lisbon had an historical minimum of the last 2 years, dropping more than 40% during most of April 2020. Finally, Madrid had 2-year lowest level of more than 30% since lockdown. Concerning the water quality in the Portuguese coastal waters, it was verified an increase in water transparency since confinement started until May, accordingly to the Total Suspended Matter (TSM) indicator. From February to March, March to April and April to May there was a reduction in TSM levels of 17%, 37% and 53% respectively.

AB  - Park Eun-sik was a modern thinker who made an ideological transition from Neo-Confucianism to Yangmyunghak(陽明學) in the face of the modern upheaval. "Mr. Wang Yang-myeong's Practical Practice" abbreviates Park Eun-sik's understanding in Wang Yang-myeong. The ideological shift to Yangmyonghak is a critical reflection on the role of Confucianism in the face of modern upheaval. Park Eun-sik had an insight into the ideological features of Yangmyunghak in the modern context, and further pursued an independent life without being buried in a European-centered worldview. At the center was Jin-ah. Jin-ah is a true human being who realized the place of healing as a modern subject different from reason. The two-pointed modern subjects faced the Western reason for enlightenment, and looked at modern times from a different point of view from reason. In the face of modern upheaval and crisis of destruction, Jin-ah sought not only the problems facing Korea but also a human life.The biggest feature of modern times is the development of science and technology. Park Eun-sik recognized the utility of Western modern university literature and science and technology. However, he argued that moral reflection on scientific knowledge, which has been reduced to a means of imperial rule and exploitation, is necessary. Park Eun-sik's moral reflection on the paper and his request for scientists to find the source of the paper are a big feature of Yangmyunghak's thought.

CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Jakarta is the government and economic capital of Indonesia with a consistently increasing population, resulting in high demand for infrastructure development, which has several socio-economic benefits. However, the environmental issues related to an increasing population and built-up area have come to the public's attention in recent years. This research analyses the effects of land use and land cover changes (LULCC) on land surface temperature (LST), the development of urban heat island ( UHI), and weather conditions from 2000-2019. Focusing the analysis on remote sensing data, satellite images at two time points (2000 and 2019) were used to investigate the LULCC and its impact on UHI development that were associated with meteorological data from ground-based stations. The normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) were used to describe the spatial distribution evolution of LULCC along with the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) that illustrates the potential impacts of UHI on the quality of life in the urban area. Supervised classification was employed to describe LULCC together with the accuracy of the classification result. UHI areas were extended to the southern and eastern part of Jakarta during the time with an increment of 13%, followed by increasing urban heat island index over a selected urban and rural area. Meanwhile, the decreased number of waters, vegetation, and agriculture area was observed during 2000-2019, followed by the increased number of residence and industry areas. The overall results indicate LULCC plays a critical role in defining the change of LST and meteorological conditions.

TI  - 924 VATSONGA PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS OF CHILDREN'S RIGHTS
T2  - SOCIAL WORK-MAATSKAPLIKE WERK
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is based on the findings of a qualitative study that explored the Vatsonga people's perceptions of children's rights to protection. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 community-based participants and 11child protection social workers who were familiar with the Vatsonga people's cultural heritage. Key informant and snowball sampling techniques were employed to select the community based participants and availability sampling for selecting the social work participants. The study established that the Vatsonga people recognise the provision, protection and participation rights of children. Child participation is perceived as comprised of childhood responsibilities, not the right to be heard perse. The paper argues that some of the purported violations of child rights in Africa emanate from the universal application of a Eurocentric worldview of children's rights. We conclude that to understand child rights in Africa, African people should be allowed to contribute to the construction of an indigenised and contextualised perspective on child rights.

T2  - ACTA SILVAE ET LIGNI
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat islands (HI) are a common anthropogenic phenomenon and are defined as artificial surfaces (urban areas) that have a higher average temperature than their surroundings (rural areas). The aim of this work was to determine the influence of land use on the spatial distribution and intensity (HIi) of HI in Slovenia. The MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Corine Land Cover (CLC) databases were used to perform the analysis. Within the identified HI, two HI levels were determined based on temperature difference. The results revealed a statistically significant negative correlation between HIi and both forest cover and forest fragmentation (forest edge density and ratio of mean forest patch size to HI size). Artificial surface was positively correlated with HIi. The results contribute to the understanding of the spatial distribution of HI and HIi and provide information for spatial planning and policy-making to reduce the negative impact of HI.

AB  - In the Brazilian semiarid, where the caatinga biome is inserted, precipitation is a limiting factor for its socioeconomic and environmental development, This study evaluated the correlation between the level of vegetation cover and the local rainfall variables, considering the climatology of 2005 and 2015, using images from the TM and OLI sensors of the Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellites, respectively. The year 2005 presented higher NDVI values compared to 2015, with maximum values of 0.71 and 0.78 in the dry and wet periods, respectively. In 2015, the maximum values are 0.64 and 0.61, for the dry and wet periods, respectively. The highest values were observed in the rainy period of 2005, in the weather stations of Matureia, Salgadinho and Areia de Baraunas. In the dry period, the low variability of NDVI values is noted, with the highest readings observed in the Matureia, Salgadinho and Teixeira platforms. The platforms that showed the greatest reductions in NDVI values from 2005 to 2015, in the rainy season, were Matureia, Santa Teresinha and Salgadinho, with reductions of 41.9%, 38.2% and 32.7%, respectively. The most significant correlations were established for the dry periods. The smallest correlations were found in the rainy season. The increase in rainfall levels in the region did not imply a progressive increase in NDVI values.

AB  - In this work, we study the small-scale structure of a polarization jet in the subauroral region during the April 20, 2018 geomagnetic storm. We report measurement results of plasma parameters inside the polarization jet with a maximum sampling rate of up to 1 kHz, obtained with Langmuir probes installed on the NorSat-1 microsatellite. The study establishes the presence of temperature and electron density inhomogeneities inside the polarization jet with spatial dimensions of tens to hundreds of meters. The previously known features of the polarization jet evolution have been confirmed. We have also found that the distribution of the electron temperature inside the jet forms two separate peaks as the geomagnetic activity develops during the storm.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier velocity is one of the significant parameter for the assessment of the glacier dynamics, which directly signifies the response of the glacier health with the respect to climate change. The present work focuses on analysing the spatio-temporal characteristics of the surface velocity in the Dhauliganga basin for seven glaciers. The cross-correlation method was applied on the panchromatic scenes of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) sensors to estimate the velocity. The mean velocity of the seven glaciers along the central flow line ranges from 59.57 to 5.34 m/year while the average of mean velocity ranges from 30.82 to 11.04 m/year during 1993-2018. Whereas, across the flow line, mean velocity ranges from 63.58 to 4.74 m/year. The lowest velocity was observed in the T1-T2 locations near the snout, where the velocity highly dominated by mass loss and debris cover; the error in velocity estimation ranges from +/- 3.67 to +/- 4.57 m/year. Decreasing trend of surface velocity was observed for all the glaciers. The present work demonstrates the application of cross-correlation technique to monitor the dynamics of a group of glaciers on a basin scale having similar climatic setting. The velocity profiles of various glaciers can be used as input to methods estimating ice thickness and volume and to prioritize the glaciers in view of glacier-dynamics linked events such as surges and retreat induced to rise to pro-glacial lakes and glacier melt contribution to the river flows.

Other satellite-based L-/C-band SAR observations can be used within the SMAP active-passive algorithm. In this article, we evaluated the capability of ingesting ISRO's Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1) C-band SAR observations in the SMAP active-passive algorithm to obtain soil moisture at 1, 3, and 9 km over the agricultural region dominant by paddy that experiences seasonal flooding. We also improved the SMAP mission active-passive algorithm with a dynamic surface water bodies (ponding conditions) masking approach using the native RISAT-1 observations. The article shows that the use of surface water masks helps in mitigating the negative impact of surface water bodies in the active-passive disaggregation process. The SMAP-RISAT soil moisture retrievals at 1 and 3 km resolutions are found to have high unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) greater than 0.06 m(3)/m(3) during very wet and high vegetative conditions. However, at low and moderate soil moisture states, the ubRMSE is below 0.06 m(3)/m(3). Comparison of soil moisture retrievals at 9 km resolution with upscaled ground-based soil moisture measurements shows ubRMSE less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3). This article is a precursor for estimating soil moisture for the upcoming RISAT-1A dataset over India. The findings will further help in the implementation of a microwave active-passive algorithm to retrieve soil moisture for future satellite missions involving radiometer-SAR instruments, and challenging geophysical conditions (i.e., dynamic surface water bodies).

TI  - Automated crop type mapping using time-weighted dynamic time warping-A basis to derive inputs for enhanced food and Nutritional Security
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of crop types is one of the most challenging tasks to derive inputs for enhanced food and nutritional se-curity, especially in complex and diversified landscapes like tropical Asia with small landholdings. The current study tested an innovative approach like Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) in a machine learning environ-ment with time-series Sentinel data to map the various crop types. Using a logistic function, we examined the time se-ries variations among the classes and assigned a time weightage through a steepness (alpha) and penalty (beta) parameter. The parallel data processing was applied to a large data cube (band dimension: 66*6) containing the composite images for two years (2018 and 2019). Using a low penalty for time-warping less than 50 days (beta) and high cost for extended time warps helped achieve 86% overall accuracy and 0.82 kappa accuracy. Cropland found the dominant land use (similar to 82% of total area) in 2018, with the paddy fallow occupied 43.37%, followed by cotton-fallow (22.31%) and paddy-pulses (16.86%). The change area statistics from 2018 to 2019 indicate a reduction in paddy-fallow area by 238.20 ha, while the area under paddy-pulses and cotton-fallow increased by 122.50 ha 166.40 ha, respectively. The area under double cropping paddy-pulses highlights the availability of irrigation facilities in the southern part of the study area, while the northern part was dominated by single crop paddy-fallow. The study provides scopes to utilize the crop type and crop fallow maps for multi-cropping with appropriate land and water management through the government policy prescriptions.

T2  - INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent technological enhancements in the field of information technology and statistical techniques allowed the sophisticated and reliable analysis based on machine learning methods. A number of machine learning data analytical tools may be exploited for the classification and regression problems. These tools and techniques can be effectively used for the highly data-intensive operations such as agricultural and meteorological applications, bioinformatics and stock market analysis based on the daily prices of the market. Machine learning ensemble methods such as Decision Tree (C5.0), Classification and Regression (CART), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Random Forest (RF) has been investigated in the proposed work. The proposed work demonstrates that temporal variations in the spectral data and computational efficiency of machine learning methods may be effectively used for the discrimination of types of sugarcane. The discrimination has been considered as a binary classification problem to segregate ratoon from plantation sugarcane. Variable importance selection based on Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease in Gini (MDG) have been used to create the appropriate dataset for the classification. The performance of the binary classification model based on RF is the best in all the possible combination of input images. Feature selection based on MDA and MDG measures of RF is also important for the dimensionality reduction. It has been observed that RF model performed best with 97% accuracy, whereas the performance of GBM method is the lowest. Binary classification based on the remotely sensed data can be effectively handled using random forest method.

TI  - European Ideals and National Identity in Georgian Emigrant Literature of the XX Century
T2  - BALKANISTIC FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The political processes of the 20th century became a kind of test for Georgian writers, the passing of which was largely manifested by the writers' physical presence-absence, the denial of their own beliefs. Immigrant literature has become a form of free expression of dissident thoughts. The authors were forced to move to another language space for their spiritual and physical survival in order to at least somehow get closer to the national culture. However, new contradictions arose at the same time. Writers lived in a foreign country, in a society of a different mentality and worldview, for which the topic that was close to the Georgian way of life could possibly be completely alien and uninteresting. The works of Georgian emigrant authors could be incompatible or less compatible with foreign literary discourse.The goal of writers and poets of the early 20th century was to remove the shackles of imperialism from Georgia and to become closer to Europe. The Soviet authorities launched a cruel and immoral campaign against the writer, caused by the ideology of that time. One of the outstanding representatives of this particular era was Grigol Robakidze.The present paper deals with the research and analysis of the movement that began at the beginning of the 20 century and was aimed at bringing Georgia closer to Europe; it also discusses the reasons that served the public to appeal to European ideals and how the struggle went on to establish their cultural values. Grigol Robakidze's German-language work is essentially a part of Georgian literature.The writer was delighted with the poetic greatness of the Georgian language and its capabilities. Robakidze's works clearly show his selfless love for the motherland. He was in love with the Georgian language, the Georgian land, the Georgian character and, in general, with everything Georgian. It is easy to imagine that the stay in emigration even more strengthened the writer's patriotic feelings. The creative path of the emigrant writer was in expressing his own and national identity, on the one hand, and in adapting to the literary environment, the part of which the author should have become himself on the other hand. Thus, he did not move away from his native roots and found his place in a foreign literary discourse.

TI  - Long-term spatiotemporal evolution of land subsidence in Konya metropolitan area (Turkey) based on multisensor SAR data
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We have studied the spatiotemporal evolution of surface deformation in Konya city and its vicinity using advanced multitemporal synthetic aperture radar techniques with SAR data acquired by Envisat, ALOS-1, and Sentinel-1 A/B satellites between 2004 and 2020. Velocity maps and time series show that the city has been subsiding with varying rates in space and time since 2004. The pattern of deformation shows two main lobes of subsidence centered in the western and eastern sides of the city with a nondeforming north-south trending narrow zone in between. Subsidence rate increases from a few cm/yr to 11 cm/yr between 2014 and 2019. As of 2019, subsidence has slowed down dramatically, giving rise to uplift in some places. Spatiotemporal variation of subsidence and its strong correlation with change in water table level confirm the inferences that subsidence in the metropolitan area of Konya is due to over drafting of the ground water for urban needs. The decrease in subsidence rate over the last two years appears to be due to the city's residents supplying their water from recently built dams instead of aquifers beneath the city. Initial excessive groundwater extraction in agricultural areas caused similar to 4 m drops every year in the water table level, which, in turn, gave rise to 8 cm subsidence every year. Modeling of the subsidence shows 7.7 x 10(6) m(3)/yr volume loss due to compaction of the aquifer in the Konya metropolitan area and its vicinity between 2014 and 2018.

AB  - Suspended Solids (SS) generated in rivers are mainly introduced from non-point pollutants or appear naturally in the water body, and are an important water quality factor that may cause long-term water pollution by being deposited. However, the conventional method of measuring the concentration of suspended solids is labor-intensive, and it is difficult to obtain a vast amount of data via point measurement. Therefore, in this study, a model for measuring the concentration of suspended solids based on remote sensing in the Nakdong River was developed using Sentinel-2 data that provides high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images. The proposed model considers the spectral bands and band ratios of various wavelength bands using a machine learning model, Support Vector Regression (SVR), to overcome the limitation of the existing remote sensing-based regression equations. The optimal combination of variables was derived using the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and weight coefficients for each variable of SVR. The results show that the 705nm band belonging to the red-edge wavelength band was estimated as the most important spectral band, and the proposed SVR model produced the most accurate measurement compared with the previous regression equations. By using the RFE, the SVR model developed in this study reduces the variable dependence compared to the existing regression equations based on the single spectral band or band ratio and provides more accurate prediction of spatial distribution of suspended solids concentration.

TI  - "Russians", Jews, Israelis? The Adaptation of Russian-Speaking Immigrants in Israel through the Eyes of Their Children
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The social and cultural integration of immigrants from the former Soviet Union to Israel over the last thirty years has received wide attention. To become a part of Israeli society, these immigrants concurrently tried to preserve and use the Russian language, their cultural identity and worldview, while experiencing conflicts with the Israeli establishment, which demands a complete change to Israeli identity. This study was carried out between 2016 and 2019 and examines aspects influencing the integration of newcomers: immigration motives, age at immigration, knowledge and usage of Hebrew, professional training, satisfaction with living standards and work conditions, inclusion in Israeli society and culture, social contacts and lifestyle changes concerning traditions, etc. The peculiarity of the study is that it involves immigrants' children (20-30 years old), and not the immigrants themselves. This second generation's viewpoint enabled the author to evaluate the success of the integration of former Soviet Union immigrants based on the view of young people who have grown up in and been shaped by Israeli reality. The study confirms that social and cultural bonding in Israel secures the success of adaptation and integration in a new society and plays an important role in identity formation among first-generation immigrants. Additional factors that increase the level of adaptation are satisfaction with working conditions and property ownership, indicating the family's material stability. Further analysis of the results, however, supports that actively using and preserving the languages and cultures from both the countries of departure and destination in the process of adaptation is the optimal model of cultural integration for immigrants.

AB  - Precision agriculture uses new technologies to improve crop yields and increase profitability for farmers while reducing the inputs required to grow crops, such as land, water, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. Environmental microclimate data (e.g., air and soil temperature or moisture) are needed as inputs to precision agriculture applications so that adequate decisions and agrotechnical measures can be applied in the fields. Most of the existing precision agriculture solutions for environmental and crop monitoring use locally deployed sensors as the main data source. Since the deployment and maintenance of physical sensors in the fields potentially involves significant costs and human effort, open-access data sources may be an effective complement to environmental data from deployed sensors, but the question remains whether open-access data sources are comparable to locally deployed sensors in terms of accuracy. This paper analyzes the correlation between open environmental data sources provided by the Copernicus ERA5-Land and Agri4Cast data sets, and data collected by locally deployed sensors to determine the extent to which open data sources can be used in precision agriculture.

TI  - Bio-Optical Characteristics of the Black Sea Coastal Waters near Sevastopol: Assessment of the <i>MODIS</i> and <i>VIIRS</i> Products Accuracy
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the work is to evaluate accuracy of the satellite products for the coastal waters near Sevastopol, generated by the standard algorithms based on the MODIS and VIIRS (installed at the artificial Earth satellites Aqua and Terra, and at Suomi NPP, respectively) data.Methods and Results. In situ sampling was carried out at the station (44 degrees 37'26" N and 33 degrees 26'05" E) located at a distance of two miles from the Sevastopol Bay. The chlorophyll a concentration was measured by the spectrophotometric method. The spectral light absorption coefficients by optically active components were measured in accordance with the current NASA protocol. The spectroradiometers MODIS and VIIRS Level-2 data with spatial resolution 1 km in nadir around the in situ station (44 degrees 37'26" +/- 0 degrees 00'32" N and 33 degrees 26'05" +/- 0 degrees 00'54" E) were used. The satellite products were processed by the SeaDAS 7.5.3 software developed in NASA. The research showed that the standard NASA algorithms being applied to the MODIS and VIIRS data, yielded incorrect values of the optically active components' content in the Black Sea coastal waters near Sevastopol as compared to the data of in situ measurements in the same region: the satellite-derived "chlorophyll a concentration" was on average 1.6 times lower in spring, and 1.4 times higher in summer; the contribution of phytoplankton to total light absorption at 443 nm was underestimated in 8.7 times; the light absorption by colored detrital matter was overestimated in 2.2 times.Conclusions. The NASA standard algorithms are inapplicable to calculating bio-optical indices in the coastal waters of the Black Sea near Sevastopol since they provide incorrect values of the satellite products (Ca-s, a(ph-s)(443) and a(CDM-s)(443)). Operative ecological monitoring based on satellite data requires development of a regional algorithm taking into account the seawater optical features in the region and in the coastal zone, in particular.

T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the role of Latinisms in the literary and journalistic texts of F. M. Dostoevsky. By virtue of his education, the writer was well-acquainted with Latin literature, which undoubtedly affected his poetics. Multilingualism becomes one of the polyphonic tools of the latter: combination of languages performs a characterological function, enriching the characters' speech portrait and expanding the linguocultural context of their worldview. Latin quotations are either provided by Dostoevsky as independent sentences, or integrated into the text and adjusted to the Russian syntax and grammar. Truncated or modified aphorisms integrated in the characters' words are an attempt to substantiate their beliefs through an appeal to cultural constants. Most often, a change of this sort takes on a parodic character and turns into an alteration of meanings and a denial of spiritual values. Expressions from the Catholic culture occupy a special place in Dostoevsky's poetics. On the one hand, Latin Catholic names complement the figurative embodiment of the Christian faith. On the other hand, while being the object of irony, ridicule or criticism, for Dostoevsky church Latin formulas illustrate an important topic in Roman Catholic Christianity: using the example of the so-called "Roman question," the writer develops the idea of the life and death of religion in Europe.

TI  - Traditional Motives in the Aesthetic Views of the 20th Century Japanese Philosophers Kuki Shuzo, Karaki Junzo, Kato Shinro
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the views of three Japanese philosophers of the 20th century with their example we are convinced the relevance of the traditional worldview in contemporary Japan. Since the Meiji period, Western philosophy and aesthetic theories have constantly influenced the views of Japanese thinkers, but up to this day, traditionalism plays an important role in Japanese thought. This also applies to the emphasis on corporality, human incarnation - the Buddhist position on "the unity of flesh and mind" (shin-jin - itchinyo) and the uncertainty fluidity of all forms of existence of things (mujo), relations, the ephemerality of life itself. This is also true for acceptance of Nothingness (mu) as a metacategory of philosophy which Nishida Kitaro put at the foundation of his system, explaining the historical world and the position in it of a person through the identity of absolute contradictions resolved in the field (basho) of Nothingness. This philosophical position, Buddhist-Taoist in essence, is especially vividly present in the works of Japanese thinkers who study the traditional culture of their homeland and try to give a modern interpretation to its categories.

TI  - Re-reading Noir AMERICAN WOMEN'S COLD-WAR CRIME FICTION AND <i>THE RESISTING READER</i>
T2  - RECEPTION-TEXTS READERS AUDIENCES HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers Judith Fetterley's The Resisting Reader in relation to the author's current research on Cold-War American women's crime fiction. The dominant critical framework about this fiction from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s is noir, a masculinist genre about male loners / outsiders that often embraces a cynical or nihilistic worldview. Many of these books objectify women and feature a spider woman or femme fatale, who is punished for her pursuit of self-interest and use of her sexuality to attain power. The lesser-known female crime writers of the period were-in many ways-resisting readers of this tradition. Their re-readings and rewritings often privileged community and connection over isolation and offered more complicated female characters. The author uses the case of Charlotte Armstrong's A Dram of Poison (1956) to make this case.

TI  - Does the Presence of Cytokeratin Positive Individual Tumor Cells (N<sub>0(I+)</sub>) in Sentinel Lymph Nodes Affect Clinical Outcomes in Breast Cancer Patients Treated with Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation
T2  - BREAST CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To report a primary objective clinical outcome of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence following accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with N0(i+) (single tumor cells or clusters <2mm) in sentinel lymph nodes. The secondary objective was to observe any incidence of ipsilateral breast failure.Patients and Methods: Between March 2004 and April 2016, a total of 747 patients were enrolled in one of two APBI (Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation) breast protocols (Phase II NCT01185145 and Phase III NCT01185132). Nineteen patients with N0(i+) disease were treated between February 2005 and December 2015. Patient eligibility included a primary invasive or DCIS tumor size <3 cm, N0(i+) disease, and margin width of >2 mm. All enrolled patients presented in this report had sentinel lymph node examinations. Clinical outcomes of ipsilateral breast, axillary and combined regional (breast or axillary) recurrences were analyzed.Results: Median follow-up for all patients was 5 years (1-8 years). No patient experienced either ipsilateral breast or axillary recurrence.Conclusion: There has been scarce information/reporting of the treatment of patients with cytokeratin positive individual tumor cells N0(i+) with APBI. The authors have presented data which suggest that the successful outcomes of these patients might warrant further study.

TI  - Factors limiting the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - GINEKOLOGIA POLSKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Sentinel lymph node detection (SLND) has not yet displaced lymphadenectomy, but it is a desired supplementary technique in cervical cancer surgery.The aim of our study was to identify the sources of SLND failure while performing the procedure by injecting blue dye (BD) into the cervix in cases of early-stage cervical cancer (ECC).Material and methods: We analyzed 27 consecutive ECC patients (FIGO IA2-IB1) who underwent hysterectomy with SLND and systematic lymphadenectomy between October 2011 and June 2014. The main inclusion criterion was at least unilateral SLND by BD. Predictors of either unilateral or bilateral staining were identified using multinomial logit models and a decision tree.Results:Overall, bilateral staining was achieved in nine patients (33%). Among the factors analyzed, BMI > 23.5 kg/m(2) was the only factor negatively affecting the quality of SLND using BD (p < 0.02) in the univariable multinomial logit model. All patients with BMI < 23.5 kg/m(2) and depth of invasion >= 15 mm had unilateral mapping.Conclusions: Both obese and overweight patients are unlikely to achieve optimal SLN staining with BD alone. Although some possible reasons are discussed, we believe that further studies are needed to clarify the specific limitations of other dyes currently in use.

TI  - Soil moisture-based index for agricultural drought assessment: SMADI application in Pernambuco State-Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian state of Pernambuco has approximately 88% of its territory located in the semiarid region, suffering from the irregularities of precipitation and the phenomenon of droughts, which increases the need for constant monitoring of climatic events. This study consisted of estimating meteorological and agricultural drought for the study area with soil moisture data from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite and MODIS products, covering the period from 2010 to 2017 and considering three climatic regions in Pernambuco: Mata, Agreste and SertAo. This research was divided into two main phases: the first was to obtain drought indices calculated from the remote sensing information, with emphasis on producing the Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI) that uses the soil moisture data in its calculation; the second phase was to correlate the response of the severity of SMADI and other indices with the results of productivity and harvested area for corn and sorghum crops, as obtained from official databases. The results found in the first phase of the study using the SMADI index obtained for the agricultural areas of the state showed long consecutive periods of drought, lasting longer than one year. The hydrological year from 2012 to 2013 presented the longest duration of the event for the Mata and SertAo regions, while for the Agreste the longest period was from 2016 to 2017. The correlations of corn production with the severity of the SMADI values were more significant than sorghum because corn is more sensitive to water stress. The study also concluded that the severity detected by SMADI correlated more significantly with sorghum culture than any of the other indices; that is, SMADI was more sensitive to identify water stress in this crop than the other indices used. The results demonstrated that SMADI can provide early warnings of drought impacts on rainfed agricultural systems and may serve to indicate the adoption of more resistant crops to water stress conditions.

TI  - Truth as an Axiological Dominant (V. M. Shukshin in a Retrospective of Russian Literature)
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of "truth" in Russian literature is historically associated with justice, righteousness, verity and fairness. In the second half of the 19th century, this concept was actualized in the works of F. M. Dostoevsky, L. N. Tolstoy, and A. P. Chekhov. In Dostoevsky's " ideological novel," the emphasis is on the hero's finding "truth-verity," "to live according to the truth" means to live with Christ. Besides the "truth of God," the "truth of the people" is also of great importance in Dostoevsky's axiology. It is the people who carry the ideal of Christ in their hearts. The writer also discusses the truth of everyday life in his work: in politics, in the relationships among people in society. Leo Tolstoy created a whole gallery of characters who live "according to the truth." First and foremost, the works of A. P. Chekhov reveal the truth of life; the writer is interested in the character's existential choice. God's truth and the people's truth, as a rule, are revealed to him in the self-awareness of a character "of the people." In 20th century Russian literature, the concept of "truth" plays an important role in the work of V. M. Shukshin and other rustic writers. Shukshin suggests distinguishing between truthfulness and truth, the truth of character and the truth of action. The truth of life involves the problem of the meaning of life. According to Shukshin, "people know the truth," and this is not rational knowledge, but a way of life. The truth becomes the basis of national existence. Shukshin's Pravda was provocative in relation to the aesthetics of socialist realism with its main principle of partisanship. The writer relied on Russian axiology, rather than on party attitudes. The concept of " truth," which is associated with the Christian worldview and Christian values, is the foundation of Russian culture and determines the main vectors of its development.

TI  - YOUNG POLAND'S LEON SCHILLER
T2  - PAMIETNIK LITERACKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper analyses the connections between Leon Schiller's theatrical thought and Young Poland. The most eminent stage manager of the first half of the 20th c. shaped his aesthetic worldview in the intellectual ambience of the Great Theatre Reform (influenced by, e.g., Edward Gordon Craig), while his metatheatre project grew on the grounds of Young Poland's philosophy, theory and aesthetics of theatre. Schiller's leading idea was a vision of a new, autonomous theatre that breaks with the aesthetics of the 19th c. middle-class illusory stage theatre and also with naturalism. The artist that Schiller lavishly praised was Stanislaw Wyspianski, in the practice of whose he discerned a form of monumental theatre. An outline concept of the theatre was presented by Schiller in papers published toward the decline of Young Poland. After a period of fascination with the leftist formula of committed theatre, the artist returned in the times of war to the metaphysical experiences that manifested in the concept of theatre perceived as sacrum.

TI  - On Philosophical Practice
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Philosophical practice is gradually becoming a recognized branch of philosophical disciplines. In many countries associations of philosophical practitioners are created, and the number of clients using such services increases. If we take advantage of the statement of the pioneer of philosophical practice, Gerd B. Achenbach, a philosophical practicioner is a specialist in a non-speciality: his visitor is understood not as an example of any theoretical construct, but as absolutely unique human being. A feature of philosophical practice, in contrast to academic philosophy, is that it should be guided by the problems that are relevant according to the state of the client. The philosophical practice is based on the ontological principles of existential philosophy which allow for the deepest impact in the structure of the person. On the other side, this practice requires the usage of philosophical categories, through which the client realizes his worldview problems.

T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - A simple model for converting known field-average yields to within-field yield maps of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was developed using data collected by a nine-band drone sensor over nine field trials in Sweden in 2019-2020. The model was deployed on Sentinel-2 satellite data, and tested on eight commercial fields. The results were compared against combine harvester yield data and the model was then implemented in a decision support system for precision agriculture. Thus, the pathway from field trial to end-user was shortened by scaling drone models using satellite data. Even if the generated surrogate yield maps can be regarded as more generalised than those that can be obtained from combine harvesters, such maps may be of interest since no special equipment or complex data handling are required.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to analyze the practical and symbolic significance of milk food in the culture of the nomads of Inner Asia. The chronological framework of the work covers the late 19th - mid of 20th centuries. The research is based on historical, ethnographic and folklore materials. Comparative-historical and comparative-typological analysis of the worldview, economic practices, ritual sphere of nomads associated with the food complex, made it possible to identify a general worldview layer that formed the idea of the practical and sacred significance of dairy food, its functions of socio-normative regulation of society. The high importance of milk in the food complex and its white color predetermined the sacredness of milk and substantiated a wide range of its ritual use. The study of the daily practices of obtaining, processing, storing and consuming dairy food among the nomads of Inner Asia on a long chronological cut and in a wide territorial framework shows that dairy food has always had the status of "ritual", and not only in situations of a sacred order. The sacred status of white food as a symbol of abundance determined the system of special restrictions and prohibitions accompanying the receipt of milk, its processing and storage. Milk food is the closest to the concept of "food norm" is most closely related, embodied in various forms. Unlike other main food of nomads - meat, milk food was intended to unite society, making the rich and the poor, insiders and outsiders equal. It was revealed that in the Buryat culture, one of the types of dairy food, the fermented milk product of kurunga (Buryat. kurenge), is one of the key markers of social community - the clan along with the ancestral fire, tamga, with which ideas about the power of the clan and its well-being are associated.

M3  - Article
AB  - Among the common diseases described among the peoples of Siberia, there are various types of mental conditions, which since the 19th century have been termed "hysterical-demonic", such as epilepsy, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, depression, or suicidal tendencies.. The most famous and widespread case was the Menerik (einiryachestvo), which mainly affected women. Of particular interest are traditional views on the causes of mental disorder. The article brings together information on various forms of such disorders and their causes as understood by people of traditional culture and by researchers. Also covered is the etymology of the terms used.Those suffering from the Menerik were seen as a means of communication of deities and spirits with people, including the spirits of their ancestors. Various mental conditions were often considered punishment by supernatural forces or a sign that the person had been chosen as a shaman. The highly realistic imagery of the other worlds blurred the boundaries between vision and reality, creating the illusion of accessibility. Shamans and people suffering from a mental condition for a long time could heal the sick. Relief of psycho-emotional stress was possible through shamanic practices, healing dance, objects associated with peace and motionlessness.

TI  - Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI Spectral Reflectance Comparison in Tropical Environments - A Preliminary Research for Data Fusion
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - The multi-sensor approach has been widely implemented for earth monitoring in many applications to enable regular space-based information. Spectral comparison between sensors is an essential preliminary step before conducting a data fusion for such applications. Comparison of medium spatial resolution data, e. g., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were mostly conducted in subtropical regions, nevertheless, limited in equatorial tropical environments. This study utilised the same day of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data to investigate the spectral changes over relatively unchanged environment conditions during 3-10 minutes of differences acquisitions time of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. The study area was the Citarum River Basin area in Indonesia with monsoonal climate type and various landcover, e.g., Lake, agricultural area, rain forest, and settlement areas. Surface reflectance of visible, Near Infrared, Shortwave Infrared and spectral indices, i.e., Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) generated from a valid pair of pixels, which free from cloud, cloud-shadow, saturated, dark area and cirrus of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images, were compared. Ordinary Least Square and t-test for mean difference analysis were accomplished to perform the relationship and the spectral changes of surface reflectance and spectral indices of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. The results showed a significant difference in mean values of surface reflectance and spectral indices of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 with a higher value of R-2 in the dry season (July) than in the rainy season (January). SWIR performed the highest relationships among the other spectra with R-2 of 0.68 in the wet season and R-2 of 0.8 in the dry season. However, spectral indices comparison is likely performed well over the dry and wet seasons. A single band of surface reflectance provided a lower relationship (R-2 < 0.8) than from spectral indices (R-2 > 0.8). NDWI provided best relationships on water pixels while EVI and NDVI well performed on soil and vegetation pixels, respectively. We found a lower relationships of surface reflectance between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in tropical environments than were reported in subtropical regions. The highest relationship of this spectral comparison was found on water pixels, then decreased on soil pixels and lastly on vegetation pixels. Higher variability of tropical atmospheric conditions and mixed pixels issue may influence this lower relationship, particularly during the rainy season. An improvement of cloud masking product in tropical environment can be investigated further to provide a better relationship of this comparison for further research.

Literature review on teaching visual culture in art education is presented, and posthuman, cultural research, multimodality within digital literacy education were discussed. Visual culture art education in the era of digital transformation is an epistemology and can be viewed as a semiotic practice. In addition, the multimodality of digital visual culture in the context of critical pedagogy on metaverse and educational approaches were suggested. Next, the researcher discussed a new alternative space combining virtual and reality as a metaverse for the network society and artistic practice. As a teaching and learning for visual culture and digital literacy education, the researcher explained three ways for pedagogy. First, artistic learning was oriented, and second, voluntary learning through participatory culture and a transdisciplinary approach were discussed in the curriculum. The discussion of ‘viewing’ with digital technology goes beyond the traditional category, and suggests a hybrid subject in a virtual world where layers of digital spaces and identity. In the end, the study of visual culture in art education should focus on a humanistic worldview centered on affects so that it can pursue empathy using technology and the reconceptualization of a humanized world.

AB  - We conducted a 4 × 4 diallel cross-mating test using 934 chickens from four grandparent stock lines to develop a new synthetic breed of Korean native chicken. The mean values, combining ability, and reciprocal effects on survival rate, body weight, and hen-day egg production were analyzed. In phenotypes, most chickens have yellowish-brown, reddish-brown and mixed color feathers. The average survival rate was 86.8±12.3%, with the highest in YH combination. Specific combining ability (SCA) had a greater effect on survival rate than general combining ability (GCA), and the SCA of HY combination was the highest. The 16 cross-combinations were distinctly divided into three weight groups according to their genetic characteristics. At 12 weeks of age, GCA showed a greater effect on weight than SCA, and the SCA of FH combination was the highest. The age at first egg laying was 157 days, and the crosses reached sexual maturity faster than the pure lines. The egg production rate was highest in SY at 79.5±2.1%. The GCA and SCA for hen-day egg production were similar, and the SCA was highest in the HS and FY combinations. The reciprocal effect showed that the offspring’s egg production rate was high when S and Y were maternal parents in almost all combinations. In conclusion, FH and HF combinations, which have excellent growth performance, are the most desirable paternal parent stock strains, and FY, FS, HY, and SY combinations, which have excellent laying performance with moderate weight, are the preferred maternal strains.

TI  - "In Search of the Russian Soul": about the features of Russian nationalism in the first half of the 19th century
T2  - DIALOG SO VREMENEM-DIALOGUE WITH TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is focused on the emergence of modern nationalism in the first half of the 19th century and patriotism as form of its' manifestation under influence of the French revolution of the end of the 18th century. While in the West the political nationalism emerged that sought independence of peoples and civil rights, in Russia cultural nationalism appeared in an assimilative model of national system, which in fact was present in all ideological movements including the Decembrists. Civil patriotism was alien to most Russian authors; even liberal thinkers regarded it as innate feeling. The question about specific features of Russian national consciousness in comparison with Westerners became the main point of patriotic worldview. At the same time degree of alienation between Russia and the West was understood in different ways, from mild confrontation to absolute rejection of Western values and foundations. Is there really a complex of being "incomplete European" in Russian consciousness? The wars against Napoleonic France, especially that of 1812, constituted a starting point in emergence of patriotic worldview, in contrast to elite of the previous epoch. By the beginning of 1830s' two models of Russian patriotism came into being, the state model represented in theory of official narodnost, and liberal model expressed in the views of Slavophiles and Westernizers. The problems that constituted the core of Russian patriotism had been formulated at that time.

AB  - The article analyzes the process of rethinking the inherited content of human experience, established views on philosophy and religion as ideological phenomena, which are inherent in creating and transmitting the integrity of the picture of the world. Such integrity is accomplished under the conditions of preservation of each work and the pursuit of philosophical thought. It is established that the secularization and eclecticism of religious consciousness against the background of globalization processes determine the transformation of the modern religious paradigm. On the one hand, this is expressed in the need for religion to acquire adaptability to crisis phenomena and in need for special flexibility in conditions of instability and adequate perception of external variability of socio-cultural, natural and technical systems. On the other hand, in its renewed religion, it seeks to appeal to stable guidelines, ideals, and the strengthening of the influence of fundamentalism due to the belief in the need for certain traditional religious and cultural foundations. These efforts aim to preserve cultural and religious identity and facilitate survival in a world that is not structured by single expediency, ambiguous, spiritually and socially nonlinear.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the compatibility of the vegetation index between the two satellites and the applicability of agricultural monitoring by comparing and v erifying NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) based on Sentinel-2 and T erra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Terra MODIS NDVI utilized 16-day MOD13Q1 data with 250 m spatial resolution, and Sentinel-2 NDVI utilized 10-day Level-2A BOA (Bottom Of Atmosphere) data with 10 m spatial resolution. To compare both NDVI, Sentinel-2 NDVIs were reproduced at 16-day intervals using the MVC (Maximum Value Composite) technique. As a result of time series NDVIs based on two satellites for 2019 and compare by land cover, the average R2 (Coefficient of determination) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the entire land cover were 0.86 and 0.11, which indicates that Sentinel-2 NDVI and MODIS NDVI had a high correlation. MODIS NDVI is overestimated than Sentinel-2 NDVI for all land cover due to coarse spatial resolution. The high-resolution Sentinel-2 NDVI was found to reflect the characteristics of each land cover better than the MODIS NDVI because it has a higher discrimination ability for subdivided land cover and land cover with a small area range.

TI  - Post-transplant relapse of therapy-related MDS as gastric myeloid sarcoma: Case report and review of literature
T2  - LEUKEMIA RESEARCH REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction:Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are hematologic neoplasms characterized by morphologic dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. The only potentially curative therapy is stem cell transplant. However, relapse remains a major challenge and is seen in about 25-40% of cases. Myeloid sarcoma presenting as relapse post allogeneic transplant for myeloid neoplasms is rare. We report the sentinel case of a patient with MDS who relapsed as gastric myeloid sarcoma 1 1/2 years after allogeneic stem cell transplant. Case Presentation:Sixty-nine-year-old male who was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) in 2006 and transitional cell bladder carcinoma in 2008. In 2011, he developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasm t(7;22) and no excess blasts. He was treated with Vidaza followed by a MUD hematopoietic stem cell transplant on 8/24/2012. In 2013 the patient developed anorexia and gastric biopsies showed severe gastritis. Repeat gastric biopsy on 02/05/2014 showed an extensive mononuclear infiltrate which could easily be confused with lymphocytes but staining showed myeloid sarcoma. Marrow was negative. The patient remained refractory to therapy and expired 08/10/2016. Conclusion:In summary, we report the first case of GI relapse of MDS as a myeloid sarcoma post-transplant. We seek to alert our audience of this potentially serious diagnostic pitfall, particularly one that can be relatively easily resolved on the basis of immunohistochemical profiling.

TI  - Validation of Four Coarse-Resolution Leaf Area Index Products Over Croplands in China Using Field Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy assessment of the global leaf area index (LAI) products is an indispensable step before applications. Four popular LAI products, namely MCD15A2H, GLASS, GEOV2, and GLOBMAP, were assessed over croplands in China using field measurements. All of these four products were validated with upscaled reference LAI maps. The validation results revealed uncertainties in these products for crops with RMSE ranging from 0.49 to 1.37 over the validation sites in Beijing, in Zhoukou and Jiaozuo counties in Henan province, Youyi farm in Heilongjiang province, and in Longkang farm in Anhui province. GEOV2 gave the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 0.49, relative bias = -7.2%) compared to MCD15A2H (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.91, and relative bias = -24.4%), GLASS (R-2 = 0.80, RMSE = 0.73, and relative bias = -23.3%), and GLOBMAP (R-2 = 0.25, RMSE = 1.37, and relative bias = -55.4%). The LAI products overestimated over the croplands with dark soil-backgrounds in Youyi farm while they underestimated over other validation sites. The seasonal variation of these products was assessed with continuous in situ measurements at Daman Station, Gansu province. All of these four products showed good temporal consistency at Daman Station, while GEOV2 showed the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.41, relative bias = -10.3%). The influence of scaling effect on the products' accuracy was also investigated, and the scaling differences of these LAI products contributes overestimation at coarse-resolution for croplands with dark soil-backgrounds, while underestimation at coarse-resolution in other validation sties.

TI  - Very Rapid Forest Cover Change in Sichuan Province, China: 40 Years of Change Using Images From Declassified Spy Satellites and Landsat
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests have significant impacts on the global carbon cycle, hydrological processes, and biodiversity. Driven by socioeconomic developments, forests experienced drastic changes since the mid-20th century in China. Although declassified spy satellite and other Earth observation satellite data offer remote sensing technologies for mapping these long-term changes, challenges remain unsolved for applications of large volumes of historical data. This study uses long-term satellite observations, including declassified satellite data in the 1960s and Landsat products since the 1970s to monitor the decadal changes. A semi-automated method was developed for the rapid registration of declassified images with reference to Landsat data. The method was applied to quantify the forest cover (FC) in Sichuan Province (excluding Chongqing), China. Combined with a Landsat-based FC change product, it revealed that the FC in Sichuan declined rapidly by 38% from the 1960s to 2005. The FC was estimated to be 45.19 +/- 1.62% in the 1960s and 38.98 +/- 2.06% in 1975, but it rapidly decreased to 28.91 +/- 2.07% in 1990 and 27.87 +/- 2.14% by 2005. Supplemented with the official statistics, the FC in Sichuan was reported to increase to 38.03% by 2018. Although differences between the remote sensing-based estimates and the statistics were observed, they highlight the challenges in reconstructing historical land use changes for carbon and other studies. The drastic loss of forests before 1990 and the stabilizing afterward reflects the changes in forest policies, which transitioned from serving timber products to forest conservations.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 40th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In military applications, it has great research value to mine reliable military information from remote sensing image data. Since the precision and recall rate of the CNN (convolutional neural networks) in the object detection process is low, and cannot meet the requirements of military combat indicators. An improved CNN for the anti-missile object detection algorithm based on improved attention mechanism is studied. First, DehazeNet algorithm was used to improve the recognition of the target while is obscured by the fog in the antimissile remote sensing data set, and the data set was re-clustered through the K-means algorithm; then based on the idea of ECANet attention mechanism to improve and reorganize its pooling layer, and an improved attention module I-ECANet (Impproved ECANet). Improved the last residual layer of each group of convolution and residual layers in the YOLOv3 network to the I-ECANet attention module, training network before and after improvement; finally, use the test set to test and analyze the anti-missile remote sensing image. The results shown that the precision, recall, and average detection precision of the algorithm have been greatly improved, with the precision rate reaching 97.6%, an increase of 6.8%, and recall rate reached 95.7%, an increase of 3.8%, Average detection precision reached 95.1%, an increase of 4.4%, and detection speed reached 33.87 images per second. It shows that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper has wide application value.

TI  - Topographically derived subpixel-based change detection for monitoring changes over rugged terrain Himalayas using AWiFS data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous and accurate monitoring of earth surface changes over rugged terrain Himalayas is important to manage natural resources and mitigate natural hazards. Conventional techniques generally focus on per-pixel based processing and overlook the sub-pixel variations occurring especially in case of low or moderate resolution remotely sensed data. However, the existing subpixel-based change detection (SCD) models are less effective to detect the mixed pixel information at its complexity level especially over rugged terrain regions. To overcome such issues, a topographically controlled SCD model has been proposed which is an improved version of widely used per-pixel based change vector analysis (CVA) and hence, named as a subpixel-based change vector analysis (SCVA). This study has been conducted over a part of the Western Himalayas using the advanced wide-field sensor (AWiFS) and Landsat-8 datasets. To check the effectiveness of the proposed SCVA, the cross-validation of the results has been done with the existing neural network-based SCD (NN-SCD) and per-pixel based models such as fuzzy-based CVA (FCVA) and post-classification comparison (PCC). The results have shown that SCVA offered robust performance (85.6%-86.4%) as compared to NN-SCD (81.6%-82.4%), PCC (79.2%-80.4%), and FCVA (81.2%-83.6%). We concluded that SCVA helps in reducing the detection of spurious pixels and improve the efficacy of generating change maps. This study is beneficial for the accurate monitoring of glacier retreat and snow cover variability over rugged terrain regions using moderate resolution remotely sensed datasets.

AB  - One of the serious problem of korean education is a meritocratic individualism. In korean society, individualism have developed in divers aspects. Above all  meritocratic individualism have very strongly influenced education. This individualism could be a kind of worldview. It dominates life style and values in  education. This kind of individualism has spreaded in korean society and also in christian milieu. It stress the educational achievement, privatize the result of achievement, and evaluate the human value by one’s achievement. It brings about the infinite competition of eduction. It is difficult for the failure to have the chance to make up for one’s leeway. Under the awareness of the problem, we covered this individualism in the base of The Bible. Jubilee mind could give the important implications. The four natures of jubilee were presented : sabbath, cummunity sharing, liberation, recovery. Jubilee mind comprehends very practical ways of life. It is meaningful for christian education. The christian educational implications of jubilee mind are to expand public concept of education by sharing mind, to make free from human value by achievement, to change the attitude to the failures, to give them the chance of recovery, and finally to educate not for survival but for human dignity.

TI  - Islamophobia and John’s Theology of Embrace
TI  - 이슬람포비아: 요한복음에 나타난 포용의 신학
T2  - Muslim-Christian Encounter
M3  - research-article
AB  - Islamophobia is one of the fastest-growing hate crimes both in the East and the West. It is not uncommon nowadays to witness Muslims being unfairly accused of threatening world peace, and for that reason, even normal Muslims have been mistreated and even systematically discriminated in their workplaces and daily life. What makes Islamophobia even more disturbing is that this hate crime is not simply a social issue anymore but some Christian groups or individuals are often actively involved in spreading fake news about Muslims and end up contributing to the social construction of Muslims as public enemies. This paper argues that Islamophobia is not only caused by the lack of social or political understanding of who Muslims are, but is heavily motivated by a distorted eschatology or the lack of a sound biblical worldview. Furthermore, it also emphasizes that imitating the examples of Jesus is critically essential in order to overcome Islamophobia. This paper will focus on the words and deeds of Jesus as found in the story of the Samaritan woman in John’s Gospel and examine how Jesus’s examples of embrace affect our understanding of anthropology, eschatology, and community and thus show us a way forward in loving Muslims as our neighbors.

TI  - Spatial distribution of surface chlorophyll a and micro-phytoplankton density and diversity around two islands and at two banks of the Mascarene region
T2  - Western Indian Ocean Journal of Marine Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study validated the use of AquaMODIS sea surface chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations and investigated the spatial variation in density and diversity of micro-phytoplankton around two islands and two fishing banks of the Mascarene region. The study included areas around Mauritius (MRU) and Rodrigues (ROD) Islands, at Nazareth (NZ) Bank, and in the Joint Management Area (JMA) between the Republic of Mauritius and the Republic of Seychelles, more specifically at the Saya de Malha (SM) Bank. The AquaMODIS data were based on 67 match-up data points of in-situ against satellite Chla concentrations. The micro-phytoplankton community structure was investigated by determining the density variation and using the Shannon Wiener (H') and Evenness (E-var) diversity indices. The satellite and in-situ Chla data were significantly and positively correlated when pooled for the four sites studied (R-2 = 0.441; r = 0.642, P < 0.01), and when analysed separately for islands (R-2 = 0.480; r = 0.694), and banks (R-2 = 0.233; r = 0.483). However, the Chla satellite values tended to be lower than the in-situ Chla data. The highest densities of micro-phytoplankton were observed in the eastern and northern regions for MRU and ROD, respectively. The most dominant genera of micro-phytoplankton were Coscinodiscus, Navicula, Chaetoceros and Ceratium. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index values for diatoms were all above 2.5 with waters around the islands having higher diversity compared to the banks. Overall, the different micro-phytoplankton around the islands, except for the group of cyanobacteria at ROD Island, were more evenly distributed (E-var > 0.6) compared to the banks. This study indicated that AquaMODIS Chla satellite data is valid and may be potentially used as a proxy for in-situ Chla concentration on the Mascarene Plateau. The results of this study also provide detailed insight into the spatial variation in micro-phytoplankton density and diversity on the Mascarene Plateau in the Western Indian Ocean. Further long-term studies are warranted to thoroughly understand the temporal (including seasonal and inter-annual) variations in Chla and micro-phytoplankton distribution for adequate and appropriate management of these ocean territories.

TI  - "O castigo que regenera" Portuguese Abolitionism in Julio Dinis's <i>Uma familia inglesa</i>
T2  - LUSO-BRAZILIAN REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines Mho Dinis's 1867 novel, Uma familia inglesa: Cenas da vida do Porto as a commentary on imperial relations between Portugal and its imposing British ally in the nineteenth century, specifically as a response to England's increasing pressures for the abolition of the Portuguese slave trade. A close reading of the text reveals a commentary in line with mid-century Regenerationist discourses urging for Portugal's adoption of the basic tenets of British colonialism, including the active suppression of the slave trade, as a means of salvaging Portugal's international reputation and achieving a place among the economically modern and socially progressive imperial nations. More broadly, Uma familia inglesa's appeals for abolition reflect the imperial worldview of the nineteenth-century Portuguese metropolis by which colonial exploitation and its victims were erased from imperial discourses that focused instead on national sovereignty, international prestige, and economic regeneration.

TI  - Identified main fire hotspots and seasons in Cote d'Ivoire (West Africa) using MODIS fire data
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning has become more frequent and widespread worldwide, with a significant proportion occurring in tropical Africa. Fire dynamics have been generally studied at global or regional scales. At local scale, however, fire impacts can be severe or catastrophic, suggesting local analyses are warranted. This study aimed to characterise the spatio-temporal variations of vegetation fires and identify the main fire hotspots in Cote d'Ivoire, a country of West Africa, one of the world's burn centres. Using MODIS-derived fire data over a 10-year period (2007-2016), the number of fire days, active fires and fire density were assessed across the entire country. In the southern part dominated by forests, fire activity was low. Three main fire hotspots were identified between 2 degrees 30'-8 degrees 30'W and 7 degrees 00'-10 degrees 30'N in the North-West, North-East and Central areas all dominated by savannas. In these areas, Bafing, Bounkani and Hambol regions recorded the highest fire activity where fire density was 0.4 +/- 0.02, 0.28 +/- 0.02 and 0.18 +/- 0.01 fires/km(2)/year, respectively. At national scale, the annual fire period stretched from October to April with 91% of fires occurring between December and February, with a peak in January. Over the decade, there was a decreasing trend of fire activity. Fire density also was negatively correlated with rainfall >1000 mm for the synchronic analysis, whereas fire density was positively correlated with rainfall in the previous years. Results suggest that the positive relationship between the previous year's rainfall and fire activity could operate on a cycle from 1 to 4 years.Significance:Three fire hotspots were found primarily in savanna vegetation, which burns more regularly than forest-dominated vegetation.The fire season occurs over 7 months, the majority of active fires (91%) occurring in just 3 months (December-January-February) with a peak in January (39%).Fire activity has declined over the past decade with a return time of above-average fires from 1 to 4 years.Fire density is positively correlated to the amount of rainfall in preceding years, whereas fire density and rainfall of the same year were negatively correlated in the region of rainfall >1000 mm.

TI  - THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW VERSUS THE LETTER OF THE LAW: THE NATURE OF CORRELATION
T2  - PRAVOPRIMENENIE-LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of the research is the categories "the spirit of the law" and "the letter of the law" in their regulatory sense.The purpose of the research is to confirm or disprove hypothesis that the concept of "the spirit of the law" fundamentally impacts the methodology of legal research, legal consciousness and the mechanism of legal regulation.The methodology for researching the spirit of the law presupposes an adequate selection of means of knowledge. It is impossible to study the spirit of the law with the tools of materialism or economic determinism. The spiritual-moral, axiological, metaphysical, systemic methods and the method of synthesis are preferred for the study of the spirit of the law. The legal system of society ceases to meet the elementary requirements of the formation of a person's legal consciousness, his improvement and spiritual health when the spirit of the law is denied. It is generally impossible to understand how law functions and achieves a regulatory effect using the dogmatic, positivist approach to law as a dominant method of cognition.The main results, scope of application. The problem of the operation of the spirit of the law is one of the ignored problems of legal practice. If the legal act is at odds with the spirit of the law, the law enforcer faces a difficult choice: either morality or law. This dilemma is fraught with serious conflicts both in the mental, psychological sphere of the law enforcement officer himself, and between all participants in the legal process. Every person has an internal imbalance if he makes decisions and performs actions that are contrary to his conscience. Jurisprudence, which adequately perceives the subordination between the spirit of the law and the letter of the law, warns against the temptation to consider law as a sphere independent of spiritual absolutes. The current law is not exactly what is set out in the texts of regulatory acts. Distinguishing between the spirit of the law and the letter of the law, therefore, requires special types of interpretation of texts (broad, restrictive), as well as analogies of legislation and analogies of law.Conclusions. Ultimately, the research perspective we have chosen allows us to understand not only the real anthropological meaning of law, but also to adequately assess the meaning of all legal phenomena associated with spiritual and moral discourse. We must always remember that our main concern is people when we are engaged in state development, contributing to the self-organization of society. This orientation is teleological and not deterministic; creative and not naturalistic; value and not formalist it determines the nature of the Russian legal system. The spirit of the law is the absolute beginning of the law, the criterion of truth, goodness and beauty in the legal sphere. The spirit of the law represents divine energy and subordinates to it the originality of national legal consciousness.The spirit of the law is present in all legal phenomena and processes and is embodied in meaning-generating and meaningful revelations, the religiosity of a person, his mind, legal worldview, principles, conscience, legal intuition and other forms of direct communication with God. The spirit of the law is objectified in such phenomena that do not at all require formal legal consolidation in the letter of the law.The regulation of the law has limited capabilities because of virtue of its rational and state nature. While the regulation of the spirit of the law is much richer in content and value of social energy, since the higher authorities of the spirit take part in the formation of real legal decisions. There are a number of relations that are not regulated by means of the letter of the law, but at the same time are regulated by the spirit of the law and have legal expression and dimension. Thus, the letter of the law is only one of the aspects of the implementation of the spirit of the law.

AB  - Vegetation phenology refers to changes in seasonal patterns of vegetation cycles, such as flowering and leaf fall, influenced by annual and seasonal fluctuations of biotic and abiotic drivers. Information about phenology is crucial for unravelling the underlying biological processes across vegetation communities in space and time. It is also important for ecosystem and resources management, conservation, restoration, policy and decision-making on local, national, and global scales. Numerous approaches to register Land Surface Phenology (LSP) appeared since Earth Observation from space became possible a few decades ago. This paper attempts to capture current progress and new capacities that arose with the advent of the free data policy, the Sentinel-era, new multispectral satellite sensors, cloud computing, and machine learning in LSP for natural and semi-natural environments. Spaceborne sensors' capacity to capture LSP, data fusion, and synergies are discussed. Information about retrieval methods through open-source tools and global LSP products and phenology networks are presented.

CP  - 23rd IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (IEEE MMSP)
CL  - Tampere, FINLAND
AB  - Autonomous vehicles are able to sense their environment and operate without human involvement. In particular, they have to be able to locate themselves. In order to achieve this task, geolocalisation files such as RINEX files are used. Due to the large amount of data, these files are very large and there is a big challenge in reducing their size for real-time navigation. However, this problem has not really been explored for RINEX files. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to losslessly compress RINEX files based on quadratic polynomial interpolation for autonomous vehicles navigation. Indeed, due to the orbits of the satellites around the earth, satellite signals can be modeled by parabolic curves. After interpolation of this model, prediction errors are computed as the differences between each original value of the satellite signal and its associated predicted value. Finally, these prediction errors are compressed using entropy coding. Experimental results show that our proposed method allows us to outperform the compression rate obtained by a previous state-of-the-art approach.

TI  - THE RELEVANCE OF RESHETNIKOV'S CREATIVE ACTIVITY: THE AUTHOR'S STYLE IN MODERN URAL LITERATURE
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article substantiates the thesis about the relevance of the works of F. M. Reshetnikov, a Ural mid-19th century writer, for the 20th century literature, as well as for modern creative writing. Reshetnikov's works caused fierce polemics among the critics of his time. His method was defined as "popular realism" (by N. Shelgunov) and "ultra-realism" (by P. Kropotkin) but the writer was criticized for describing everyday life, for turning attention to non-Russian ethnic minorities, for monotonous writing, etc. The modern literary critic B. M. Gasparov brings Reshetnikov into the context of pre-modernist literature and compares him to A. Platonov. The article argues that Reshetnikov anticipated many trends in modern literature, especially those created in the Ural-Siberian region. His works contain and artistically combine examples of documentary essayism and mythopoetics, naturalism and (as-yet-to-be-created) modernism and reveal certain existentialism of the worldview, exposing artistic consciousness of the author himself. This article compares Reshetnikov's texts with R. Senchin's novel "The Eltyshevs" (2008): they are linked by depressive and apathetic narration about a decaying village; their characters are placed on the verge of life and death, sometimes beyond the edge of survival. The study reveals common features between Reshetnikov's poetics and that of playwrights from the "Kolyada school", including N. Kolyada himself, Ya. Pulinovich, and others. The article also compares the methods of compositional (montage) poetics in Reshetnikov's novel "Where Is It Better?" and in an early play by Ya. Pulinovich "Behind the Line" (2008). A certain continuity with Reshetnikov can be observed in the works of A. Salnikov: there is a genre-thematic connection between Reshetnikov's novel "One's Own Bread" and Salnikov's "Indirectly" (2018), there are similarities in the writing and in the style of these works, in the author's reliance on epic solidness of the depicted world which "atones" for excessive descriptions of everyday life and characters' routine. Thus Reshetnikov's realistic writing, while being close to naturalism and exposing absurdity and phantasmagoric nature of reality, suddenly finds demand in the modern world.

TI  - The harmful properties of the material world: symbolic understanding of being
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: at present, the problem of symbolic aspects of the man-made world in traditional folk culture attracts more and more attention in Russian science. The article considers the ways of construction of the meanings of the world of things in traditional culture, one of which is the endowment of certain objects with harmful properties. On the basis of the attracted materials, a hierarchy of the acquisition of destructive functions by a thing is built.Objective: to identify and structure the mechanisms of endowing things with harmful properties from the point of view of the idea of "symbolic forms".Research materials: folklore data, oral reports of informants, published ethnographic materials.Results and novelty of the research: the article is the first experience of comprehension of the thing world by the Ob Ugrian and Samoyedic people from the point of view of construction (spontaneous or conscious) by a person given functions, in particular, harmful ones. The main ways of semantization of the man-made environment of a person are revealed, such as: violation of prohibitions, disregard of etiquette norms, loss of a thing as a break of the mental connection, deliberate endowment of a thing with harmful properties, etc. All this makes it possible to reconstruct a holistic idea about the existence of things in the traditional culture of northern ethnic groups. The author of the article, relying on the philosophical ideas of "symbolic forms" by E. Cassirer, opens up the prospect of a comprehensive disclosure of the worldview aspects of the traditional culture of the Khanty, Mansi and Nenets people. The provisions of the work can be used in the creation of complex studies on rhealogy on the materials of the Finno-Ugric and Samoyed peoples, special courses on the semiotics of certain local groups of indigenous peoples of the North, as well as in teaching social and humanitarian disciplines.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to Map Natural Forest and Acacia Plantation and Stand Ages in North-Central Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many remote sensing studies do not distinguish between natural and planted forests. We combine C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (Sentinel-1, S-1) and optical satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, S-2) and examine Random Forest (RF) classification of acacia plantations and natural forest in North-Central Vietnam. We demonstrate an ability to distinguish plantation from natural forest, with overall classification accuracies of 87% for S-1, and 92.5% and 92.3% for S-2 and for S-1 and S-2 combined respectively. We found that the ratio of the Short-Wave Infrared Band to the Red Band proved most effective in distinguishing acacia from natural forest. We used RF on S-2 imagery to classify acacia plantations into 6 age classes with an overall accuracy of 70%, with young plantation consistently separated from older. However, accuracy was lower at distinguishing between the older age classes. For both distinguishing plantation and natural forest, and determining plantation age, a combination of radar and optical imagery did nothing to improve classification accuracy.

AB  - The main goal of the study is to determine the main pedagogical aspects of the ethnocultural characteristics of the individual in the literature. There is a need for a cross-cutting humanization of education, strengthening the personal dimension in pedagogical science and practice. Orientation towards a person (a child, a youth, a student, a well-trained specialist) should become the main goal and content of the education system of the 21st century. The person must be put in the first place. To this end, education should contribute to a person's awareness of his own roots, his place in the world, the assimilation by each individual of the ethnoculture of the community as a way of his being, so that in the future he will be able to enter into a dialogue with other cultures, move freely in their space according to the principle "from knowledge and respect for one's own culture begins to respect other cultures, the desire to study the signs, symbols, codes of another community, to understand their stereotypes of behavior, the peculiarities of the world perception and worldview -the basis of tolerance and unity. " The study was carried out using the following theoretical methods: systems analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, comparison, classification, generalization and systematization, idealization and abstraction. As a result, the main pedagogical aspects of ethnocultural personality traits in literature were identified.

AB  - Geotechnical site characterization of energetic beach and nearshore environments is generally challenging due to harsh environmental conditions. In addition, few methods and sensors have been developed, tested, and/or validated for these conditions. Advances in remote sensing provide new pathways for data collection without physical presence of surveyors and with greater spatial coverage in a shorter period of time. This article presents initial lessons learned from testing satellite-sensed data, rapid physical testing tools, and buried pressure sensors for geotechnical characterization of intertidal environments pre-, during, and postextreme events for applications such as rapid assessment of erosion hotspots and emergency response.

M3  - Article
AB  - Seismic exploration often demands forest clearing, thus making it important to assess the number of trees that must be cut down as the fieldwork proceeds.We suggest that remote sensing of the Earth's surface with unmanned aircraft vehicles can be considered as a new approach to solving this problem. To test its validity and potential utility, we installed a laser scanning system and a high-resolution camera on the unmanned aircraft vehicle. The data obtained were used to derive the digital terrain and elevation models of the area under study.The resulting models were processed with the help of a neural network developed as part of this work. They proved to be useful in identifying trees and their classes within the forest sites subjected to clearing. Additionally, a special algorithm was proposed and applied to assess the felling outturn for each tree class taken separately.

M3  - Article
AB  - After a decade of successful TanDEM-X mission operations, the degradation of the satellite's battery capacity due to ageing has defined a new challenge for DLRs mission operations team. In response, a novel machine learning strategy has been gradually deployed in the Mission Planning System in order to optimize the battery utilization. The objective of this strategy is twofold: 1) protecting the operational state of the battery while 2) maximizing the executed SAR acquisitions under newly introduced planning restrictions. The limits, resulting in the battery utilization optimization, have been communicated to the customers in a user-friendly way in order to assist their future planning, minimizing the number of not-executed requests due to the new energy and power constraints imposed by the joint TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X Mission Planning System. In this article, we 1) detail the quantitative approach to model the satellites' battery behavior in comparison to the previously used physical models, 2) outline the process of the new machine learning model as implemented in the Mission Planning System, 3) present the operational results of the model in comparison to satellite telemetry, and 4) discuss the evolution of the machine learning model toward higher accuracy telemetry estimations.

TI  - A Low-Powered and Highly Selective Trap for Male <i>Aedes</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Surveillance: The Male <i>Aedes</i> Sound Trap
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, Diptera: Culicidae) expands its global distribution and vectors a range of debilitating arboviruses there is an increased need for enhanced mosquito surveillance. Consequently, we developed a Male Aedes Sound Trap (MAST) that requires minimal power and is highly species-specific. Two different versions of the MAST were developed, one that uses synthetic pyrethroid to kill captured mosquitoes (MAST Spray) and another which has an internal divider to create a killing chamber in which a sticky panel can be placed to capture mosquitoes (MAST Sticky). We compared weekly capture rates of male Ae. aegypti and bycatch from the two MAST versions to those from BG-Sentinel (BGS) traps and Sound-producing BG-Gravid Aedes Traps (SGATs) throughout Cairns, northern Australia. Weekly mean male Ae. aegypti catches did not significantly differ between trap types. However, the rate of positive weekly detections of male Ae. aegypti was lower for the MAST Sticky than the other three trap types. The MASTs sampled significantly fewer mosquitoes other than male Ae. aegypti, than either the BGS trap or the SGAT. Also, the MASTs and SGATs all caught significantly less non-Culicidae bycatch than the BGS traps. Consequently, we have developed a versatile male Ae. aegypti trap which is potentially of great benefit to Ae. aegypti surveillance programs.

TI  - Application of synthetic aperture radar interferometry to monitor surface deformations of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) e A case study of the motorways crossing areas of mining operations in the upper Silesian coal basin, Poland
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE MINING
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground hard coal mining causes surface deformations. When the mining operations are conducted beneath linear objects, such as motorways, there is a risk of deformations of the axis of the road and its horizontal and vertical alignment (additional bends and vertical curvatures, longitudinal inclinations, deformations of cross-sections). In the areas subjected to mining operations, mining plants conduct geodetic monitoring. Due to their labour intensity and costs, geodetic measurements are usually made only a few times a year. The article discusses the possibility of applying Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to monitor the subsidence of the vertical alignment of motorways caused by mining operations and its advantages and disadvantages compared to the currently used methods of geodetic measurements. The tests were conducted in two sections of motorways within the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (Poland) in the areas of intensive hard coal mining operations. Radar imaging of the surface made by the European Space Agency's (ESA) satellite Sentinel-1 equipped with the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) was used.

TI  - How populism and conservative media fuel conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 and what it means for COVID-19 behaviors
T2  - RESEARCH & POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research examining attitudes and behaviors of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic has largely focused on partisanship as a lens through which many Americans see the coronavirus. Given the importance of partisan affiliation and the degree of partisan polarization in the American society, that is certainly an important driver of public opinion, and a necessary one to understand. But an overlooked set of predispositions might also shape COVID beliefs and attitudes: populism. It is a worldview that pits average citizens against "the elites" and, importantly in the context of a pandemic, it includes anti-intellectual attitudes such as distrust of experts (including scientists). We find that populism is correlated with conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19, above and beyond partisanship. Furthermore, we find that conservative media consumption tends to be a stronger predictor of conspiracy belief among those high in populism than among those low in populism. We also show that these beliefs have consequences: those who believe the conspiracy theories about COVID-19 are less likely to adapt behaviors recommended by public health officials.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - ASTERIA (Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research in Astrophysics) was a CubeSat space telescope that operated in low-Earth orbit, having been deployed from the International Space Station in 2017. A key enabling feature of the ASTERIA mission is the low level of pointing error that has been demonstrated under ASTERIA's fine pointing control mode. Prior to launch, the ASTERIA mission performed analysis and simulations to estimate the in-flight pointing performance. This analysis used reaction wheel models provided by JPL's Small Satellite Dynamics Testbed (SSDT), which had performed Kistler table testing to characterize the jitter caused by the reaction wheels of the Blue Canyon Technologies XACT attitude control unit within ASTERIA. These models were subsequently incorporated into the SSDT simulation. The main source of jitter on ASTERIA is the set of rotating reaction wheels that are used for maintaining fine pointing during observations. Therefore, to benefit all SmallSat missions devoted to photometric or spectroscopic astrophysics applications, an on-orbit flight data acquisition and jitter testing campaign was performed in an attempt to validate the SSDT's simulation models. This paper describes the process used to validate several simulation models and attempt to characterize the ASTERIA jitter by analyzing the size of the resulting spot size for the target stars as a function of wheel speed, having commanded four wheel speeds for each of three stars of known brightness. After summarizing the on-orbit observation and jitter level measurement process, this paper compares the results obtained from the flight operational environment to the corresponding set of simulation jitter levels. Though the flight data obtained during this experiment was not sufficient to validate the simulation's jitter model, other models have been validated with flight data, including the magnetic field, orbit propagation, sun position, and long-duration orbit decay models, which may be used by all other projects that use the SSDT's simulation to increase system capability knowledge.

T2  - ETNOANTROPOLOSKI PROBLEMI-ISSUES IN ETHNOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - When the internet appeared, both scientists and non-scientists discussed whether it was liberating the media and whether it was going to be transformed into a safe zone for the expression of free opinion. The answer to this question might be found within the cognitive anthropology concept of taxonomies. The etic taxonomy classification of religions (both in the online and/or offline worlds) has existed for a very long time. Still, the question of emic taxonomy remains. In other words, do cyber believers themselves perceive the internet as a place where they can express religious ideas that they could not do in their offline religious communities and connect with people who share the same/similar worldview? The goal of this paper is to answer the question of whether the scientific taxonomy and folk taxonomy (one of the religious cyber influencers chosen as a sample) converge or whether they differ and, in case they differ, whether the internet gives them the opportunity for free expression and making communities. Roy Wallis has been chosen as an example of scientific taxonomy, since his main criterion for classification is precisely the relationship of religious groups towards society (in this case, the mainstream discourse of both Serbian society and the Serbian Orthodox Church).

AB  - On the basis of archival sources brought into scientific circulation for the first time, extracted from the fund of the Russian Stale Archive of Contemporary History, the issue of public perception of the social and material conditions of life in the 1950-1980s is highlighted in the article. The problem of establishing new social archetypes, the formation of which becomes possible in the context of the approval of the newly acquired value foundations of economic behavior. the acceptability of informal economic practices, as well as activities aimed at strengthening material wealth is raised. The circumstances of the metamorphosis in the ideological attitudes and stereotypes or thinking of representatives of the party nomenklatura, production managers, top managers, workers and rural workers are commented on. Attention is paid to the issue of traditions of communality, collectivism. Soviet labor ideology. The author describes the reaction or the authorities to changes in the world order, which are expressed in the transformation of ideological constructs and paternalistic mentality-forming constants of the consciousness of the Russian people. The author comes to the conclusion that during the 1950-1980s, changes in everyday social ideas and traditions. mentality. thinking testified to the growing social division. which ultimately became the basis attic crisis of the 1990s.

TI  - Assessment of Winter Wheat Plant Development during the Seeding and Tillering Stages According to the Earth Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The importance of controlling the organogenesis stages is that it provides the opportunity to create favorable conditions during the development of certain elements of the yield structure by caring crops and influence the grain quality. The objective of the work is to define a connection between the Earth remote sensing data and the state of winter wheat plants in the initial period of their growth and development.Materials and Methods. The object of the study was the winter wheat plantings. The wheat varieties "Odisseya", "Olympus", "Niva Stavropolya", "Victoria 11", "Nastya" and "Firuza 40" were sown by plot in the experimental field. The industrial crops of winter wheat were studied to assess the state of the plants in the tillering stage in 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 agricultural years. The Earth remote sensing data were obtained using the "VEGA" service of FBSI "Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences".Results. The obtained function of the dependence of NDVI of winter wheat crops on the height and development stage of plants is a polynomial of the third degree and is characterized by high accuracy (R-corr = 0.98). The analysis of the NDVI, RED and NIR data of fields on dates close to the dates of collecting plant samples showed a considerable degree of relationship between the vegetation index NDVI and height of winter wheat plants. In 2013, the correlation coefficient was 0.60, in 2014 - 0.66, in 2016 - 0.80, and in 2013-2016 on average about 0.85.Discussion and Conclusion. The studies have shown that the Earth remote sensing data can be used to assess the state and degree of the development of winter wheat crops during the seeding and tillering stages, including in the production conditions. To improve the accuracy of the assessment, it is better to use the spectral brightness values in the infrared region of the spectrum.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS HEALTH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Racism toward Indigenous Peoples continues to permeate the health care system, a reality the authors know all too well in their shared and yet unique personal and professional experiences. Although acknowledging and speaking up against racial injustice is daunting, and is often met with disregard or inaction, the authors contend that this is a necessary undertaking to redress the ongoing harms of colonialism. Correspondingly, those who do speak up must not have their voices silenced. Instead, the perspectives that Indigenous Peoples have regarding their own experiences of racism must be heeded seriously and produce real and tangible solutions. In narrating their own encounters confronting and challenging racism, the authors juxtapose activism and resistance with the preservation of Indigenous Knowledge as a catalyst for propelling the necessary changes forward within health care to end racism. To truly have an impact, all efforts taken to address racism must occur alongside advancing equity of care and human rights for and by Indigenous Peoples at individual, community, and systemic levels. Changes are not needed after more evidence. The time to act is now.

AB  - Despite extensive efforts, it is still very challenging to correctly detect clouds automatically from RGB images. In this paper, an automated and effective cloud detection method is proposed based on a semi-supervised generative adversarial networks that was originally designed for anomaly detection in combination with structural similarity. By only training the networks on cloudless RGB images, the generator network is able to learn the distribution of normal input images and is able to generate realistic and contextually similar images. If an image with clouds is introduced, the network will fail to recreate a realistic and contextually similar image. Using this information combined with the structural similarity index, we are able to automatically and effectively segment anomalies, which in this case are clouds. The proposed method compares favourably to other commonly used cloud detection methods on RGB images.

TI  - Kernel low-rank representation with elastic net for China coastal wetland land cover classification using GF-5 hyperspectral imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland contains various ground objects with high spectral similarity. How to accurately distinguish complex classes has become a challenge in wetland land cover classification. In this paper, low-rank representation with elastic net (ENLRR) and the kernel version of ENLRR (KENLRR) are proposed for coastal wetland land cover classification by using Gaofen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral data of China. The main idea of ENLRR is to combine elastic net with low-rank representation, which replaces rank function with the combination of nuclear norm and Frobenius norm when constraining the coefficient matrix. The KENLRR method considers nonlinear characteristics of hyperspectral data, where a neighborhood filter (NF) kernel function is adopted to map the original data space into a higher dimensional feature space for better classification. In the experiments, three typical coastal wetlands in China: Yellow River Delta, Jiangsu Dafeng Natural Reserve, and Yangtze River Delta (Nantong) are adopted, and the proposed methods and seven comparison methods are used to conduct wetland land cover classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ENLRR and KENLRR are effective in accurately distinguishing wetland ground objects and reliably mapping their distribution. More specifically, the KENLRR method can provide the best performance, and the OAs are 96.63%, 96.76% and 87.67% for the three wetlands, respectively. The land cover distributions and spatial patterns of the three wetlands are studied as well. Yellow River Delta is a typical estuarine wetland with abundant landscapes, Dafeng Nature Reserve is a coastal wetland with the block regular feature distribution in spatial, and Yangtze River Delta (Nantong) mainly includes river and flood plain, whose ecological environment is deeply affected by human activities.

TI  - Intercalibration of FY-3D MWTS Against S-NPP ATMS Based on Microwave Radiative Transfer Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and stable in-orbit radiometric calibration of a satellite instrument is fundamental to Earth geophysical parameter estimation. This article addresses the intercalibration of the microwave temperature sounder (MWTS) on the Chinese second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, Fengyun 3D (FY-3D), against the advanced technology microwave sounder (ATMS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite. First, ocean and land microwave radiative transfer models (RTM) are constructed by combining the sea and land surface emissivity models and atmospheric absorption model, as well as the intercalibration equations. Then, the MWTS and ATMS observations are resampled into a 1 degrees x 1 degrees regular grid space, and the matching brightness temperatures (TBs) under clear-sky/near clear-sky conditions are collected. Next, the TBs at top-of-atmosphere are simulated using the RTM and the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) data. After that, the double differences between FY-3D MWTS and S-NPP ATMS and the theoretical observations in FY-3D MWTS channels are calculated. Finally, the radiometric calibration coefficients of FY-3D MWTS are successfully derived from the observations of S-NPP ATMS by linear fits on the matching TBs. In contrast to the ATMS measurements, FY-3D MWTS observations are generally overestimated, and the in-orbit radiometric calibration errors (mean +/- standard deviation at the mean) are 1.83 +/- 1.45, 0.45 +/- 0.94, 1.87 +/- 0.60, -0.20 +/- 0.36, -0.02 +/- 0.37, 0.19 +/- 0.24, 1.69 +/- 0.28, 2.25 +/- 0.29, 1.97 +/- 0.33, 1.74 +/- 0.42, 2.84 +/- 0.42, 0.07 +/- 0.65, and 0.32 +/- 1.18 K in FY-3D MWTS channels 1-13, respectively. The results with Hewison's semi-empirical land surface emissivity (LSE) model and the results with LSEs derived from the coincident ATMS observations at 50.3 GHz are consistent. Moreover, the intercalibration results obtained by the RTM in this work also agree well with the results obtained by the community radiative transfer model.

AB  - Deep Learning has achieved great successes in various complex tasks such as image classification, detection and natural language processing. This work describes the process of designing and implementing seven deep learning approaches to perform regressions on mosquito populations from a specific region, given co-variables such as humidity, uv-index and precipitation intensity. The implemented approaches were: Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM), an hybrid deep learning model, and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) combined with a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) which instead of using normal RGB images, uses satellite images of twelve channels from Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission. The experiments were executed on the Washington Mosquito Dataset, augmented with weather information. For this dataset, an MLP proved to achieve the best results.

CP  - IEEE World AI IoT Congress (AIIoT)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Sea surface is rough when the weather condition at sea is rough due to strong wind, waves, swell and storms. Under the rough sea condition, the propagation of radar energy and the subsequent radar coverage is strongly influenced by various atmospheric effects, such as, strong wind, wave height, weather condition, oceanic currents and rainstorms. The identification of ship wakes in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image under the rough sea condition is viewed as a highly complex task for the real time monitoring and surveillance applications. It becomes a quite big challenge due to coherent radiation of backscattering signals and the multiplicative speckle noise found in SAR images. The objective of this work is to develop an optimized Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based on Synergistic Fibroblast Optimization (SFO) algorithm for filtering speckle noise in SAR image which are captured under rough sea condition. An improved filtering technique is tested with the real time SAR images acquired from European Space Agency (ESA) sentinel scientific data hub and its efficacy is further validated by employing Discrete Radon Transform (DRT) method to detect ship wakes (linear signature) in SAR image under rough sea surface. The performance of SFO based wavelet transform is evaluated and compared with conventional DWT families, namely, daubechies, coiflet, symlet, discrete meyer, biorthogonal and reverse biorthogonal to conduct the better investigation of this study. Investigation of results illustrates the effectiveness of optimized method, in terms of, noise suppression and its implication on radon transform method to localize the identification of ship wakes in SAR imagery.

AB  - Floods are major problems, and their coexistence poses a potent threat, which cannot be eradicated but has to be managed. Extreme affects untold numbers of people, taxing economies, disrupting food production, creating unrest, and prompting migrations. There is much more that can be done to understand the effects of floods, particularly to help protect the poorest and most vulnerable. This research was carried out in the affected area of Bhimdatta municipality and aimed to find out the flood event of 2013 and present the scenario done for flood disaster management. The primary data were collected by direct observation and key informant survey. Landsat images were downloaded from USGS websites, and secondary information was collected through previous research and articles. The data were analyzed by using ArcGIS. It was found that the flood had created a negligible impact on the forest, high impact on the river itself, and average impact on land. 0.13% of forests, 17.38% of land, and 82.48% of river bodies were affected by the flood of 2013. Different governmental and nongovernmental organizations played an effective role for flood disaster management.

AB  - The Kodil Sub-Watershed is one of the areas that has a high potential for flooding in Bogowonto Watershed. Flood disasters can cause significant losses to society, both in terms of physical, social and economic. This causes are need for information on the estimated peak discharge in The Kodil Sub-Watershed. Peak discharge estimation uses the rational method and The Cook Method to measure runoff coefficient or C value. Runoff coefficient using The Cook Method uses physical parameters, i.e land use, slope, drainage density, and infiltration. These parameters are extracted using remote sensing technology and Geographic Information System (GIS). Remote sensing data used for extraction of physical land parameters of Sentinel 2A Imagery and DEM ALOS PALSAR imagery. The results of the processing of peak discharge by the method obtained an estimate of the peak discharge of the Kodil Sub-Watershed of 209,659 m(3)/second and an average peak discharge of 135,024 m(3)/second.

AB  - Flood hazard is a natural, and predominant disaster experienced due to climate change and the reimbursement of flood damage would be very expensive. The Lower Kelani River Basin is predominant as a highly populated region and hub of commercial activities. This region is vulnerable and frequently affected by flooding. Therefore, flood modelling is essential in developing flood management alternatives. It is the predominant countermeasure for developing flood early warning systems and mapping flood hazards to mitigate and prevent flood damages. The accuracy of the flood modelling depends on topographic data. This study evaluates the effect of different Digital Elevation Model products with an equal resolution on Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation hydrological model using 3-arc resolution SRTM, ASTER, HydroSHEDS, and ALOS PALSAR Digital Elevation Models. The simulation of discharge, flood inundations, and water depths for the flood event in 2016 was carried out for the Lower Kelani River Basin using the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation model with each Digital Elevation Model. Under the different DEM products with the 3-arc resolution, the RRI model using SRTM and ALOS PALSAR performed well for both flood inundation and water level simulation in the Lower Kelani River Basin for the extreme flood event in 2016.

AB  - Purpose. The work is aimed at studying the effects of light absorption in the Black Sea waters with due regard for the variations of its individual components, and how they are manifested in the NASA archival results of calculating the chlorophyll a concentration obtained by processing satellite data using the universal operational method.Methods and Results. The NASA archival data of the MODIS and SeaWiFS satellite instruments, and the values of the light absorption components (determined by the method of Generalized ocean color inversion model for retrieving marine inherent optical properties (GIOP)) related to yellow substance and phytoplankton were analyzed. In order to avoid possible manifestations of various distortions in the results of determining the remote sensing reflectance of the sea and in the products resulted from application of the GIOP method, only the specially selected and sufficiently reliable test data from two areas located near the Crimea Southern Coast and south of the Danube estuary were used.Conclusions. In the considered examples with low content of chlorophyll a in the seawater, the yellow substance plays a predominant role in light absorption in the spectrum blue part, whereas if the chlorophyll a content is high, the phytoplankton contribution is dominant. The revealed relationship between the light absorption components related to yellow substance and phytoplankton significantly differs from that implicitly preset as a basis of the universal method (applied in NASA for the satellite data operational processing) for determining the chlorophyll a concentration. This, in its turn, is manifested in the fact that the data on the chlorophyll a concentration in the Black Sea stored in the NASA archive may be overestimated in case the chlorophyll a concentration is low, and underestimated - in case it is high.

AB  - In an area with the risk of natural disasters, sustainable monitoring of ground deformation is important. Space-borne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has been a key technology for global surface deformation monitoring. Japanese L-band SAR, ALOS/PALSAR acquired a huge amount of interferometric data during 2006-2011. To help to reveal the spatially detailed ground deformation on a continental scale, we have been producing interferograms using the full archive of the PALSAR data. So far, we have processed 450,000 interferograms in some primary regions of interest (i.e., the whole area of Japan, active fault regions of Southeast Asia and the Middle East). The derived interferograms can be used for the time series analysis to investigate the velocity or time series of the deformation with high accuracy. We are planning to make the products freely accessible through a website in the future.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) in sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping of clinically N0 early oral cancer, and to conduct a comparative study of this MRL with CT lymphography (CTL).Methods: CTL and MRL were performed for SLN mapping before surgery for 20 patients with clinically N0 early oral cancer. The detection rate, number, and location of SLNs in CTL and MRL were evaluated. Furthermore, optimal scanning/imaging timing in MRL was examined.Results: SLNs were detected by CTL in 18 (90%) patients, and the total and mean number of SLN were 35 and 1.8, respectively. All SLNs could be detected 2 min and 3.5-5 min after contrast medium injection. In all patients, SLNs were detected by MRL at 10 min after SPIO injection, and the total and mean number of SLN was 53 and 2.7, respectively. MRL at 30 min after the injection showed additional 18 secondary lymph nodes.Conclusion: MRL with SPIO is safe and useful imaging for the detection of SLNs in clinically N0 early oral cancer, and the optimal imaging timing is 10 min after SPIO injection.

AB  - Surface deformation is a phenomenon that can occur both naturally and by human intervention. Remote sensing known can be used to obtain information regarding surface deformation. Various methods have been developed, such as DInSAR, TS-NSAR, SBAS, and PSBAS. The PSBAS method is on the geohazard exploration platform issued by Terradue. This research aims to determine whether the PSBAS method can see the condition of surface deformation after the hammer earthquake in Central Sulawesi in 2018 using a data range from 2019-2021. Research results show that several points after the hammer earthquake experienced subsidence and uplift. The highest subsidence is -3.893 cm, and the highest uplift is 3.935 cm. The accuracy check results show that areas experiencing subsidence correlate with urban areas related to groundwater extraction. In contrast, uplift areas correlate with the uplift location being at the collision zone of the Palu-koro fault facing the Makassar fault. The result proves that PSBAS in Geohazard Exploration Platform cloud computing-based could get information about surface deformation.

T2  - SOIL SCIENCE ANNUAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is an up-to-date worldwide issue. This problem is especially urgent in the territories of arid and semi-arid regions. The aim of this work was to analyze the relationships between the level of soil salinity and the key spectral indices obtained on the base of Sentinel-2A satellite data. The study has been conducted on an area of 5127 ha in the Trans-Ural steppe zone (Republic of Bashkortostan, Russia). Vegetation index NDVI and 15 salinity indices have been used to analyze the relationships. Salinity index III (G x R)/B using quadratic statistical relation showed the best correlation values with a salinity level (R = 0.89, R-2 = 0.79). In general, it was found that the highest correlation values are observed with indices based on the three channels of visible range: Salinity index 2 root(G x R) (R = 0.82, R-2 = 0.67), Salinity index 4 root(G(2) + R-2) (R = 0.82, R-2 = 0.67), Salinity index VII (G + R)/2 (R = 0.82, R-2 = 0.67). The vegetation index NDVI showed the absence of a correlation with the values (R = -0.10, R-2 = 0.01), due to weak development or dry state of vegetation. The areas of saline soils using Salinity index III were calculated. The methods elaborated could be useful for mapping and accounting of saline soils based on satellite data under environmental conditions similar to this study.

AB  - The validation process of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and ground-based rainfall data was carried out during the period 2014 to 2017 at South Sumatra. Data validation was carried out by comparing 4 (four) weather parameters such as total precipitation, relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed, obtained from Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) with ECMWF data at the same coordinate locations.Rainfall data from an AWS at Palembang Station is in accordance with ECMWF rainfall data, where if there is no rainfall on AWS then there will be no rainfall in ECMWF, and vice versa. The highest correlation value of average rainfall at Banyu Asin is 0.1509. The lowest correlation value of 0.0721 is at the Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI). Based on the correlation value, the average rainfall has a higher correlation than the total rainfall from ECMWF. For the relative humidity, the correlation results of the Palembang Station are 0.51 and OKI Station has a value of 0.49. The temperature from 2014 - 2017 shows the same composition and pattern of events but there are several events of ECMWF data that have a greater value than the Automatic Weather Station (AWS) data. The correlation is 0.494, this is quite large, and it is possible that the correlation value is due to the data in 2015 which was slightly overestimated. The validation of wind speed data has different patterns and values between surface and ECMWF data and the correlation results are 0.233.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that due to climate change, the number of wildfires across the globe have been increasing and continue to grow even more. The recent massive wildfires, which hit Australia during the 2019-2020 summer season, raised questions to what extent the risk of wildfires can be linked to various climate, environmental, topographical, and social factors and how to predict fire occurrences to take preventive measures. Hence, the main objective of this study was to develop an automatized and cloud-based workflow for generating a training dataset of fire events at a continental level using freely available remote sensing data with a reasonable computational expense for injecting into machine learning models. As a result, a data-driven model was set up in Google Earth Engine platform, which is publicly accessible and open for further adjustments. The training dataset was applied to different machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Classification and Regression Tree. The findings show that Random Forest outperformed other algorithms and hence it was used further to explore the driving factors using variable importance analysis. The study indicates the probability of fire occurrences across Australia as well as identifies the potential driving factors of Australian wildfires for the 2019-2020 summer season. The methodical approach and achieved results and drawn conclusions can be of great importance to policymakers, environmentalists, and climate change researchers, among others.

TI  - Evaluating Downscaling Factors of Microwave Satellite Soil Moisture Based on Machine Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Downscaling microwave remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) is an effective way to obtain spatial continuous SM with fine resolution for hydrological and agricultural applications on a regional scale. Downscaling factors and functions are two basic components of SM downscaling where the former is particularly important in the era of big data. Based on machine learning method, this study evaluated Land Surface Temperature (LST), Land surface Evaporative Efficiency (LEE), and geographical factors from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products for downscaling SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) SM products. This study spans from 2015 to the end of 2018 and locates in the central United States. Original SMAP SM and in-situ SM at sparse networks and core validation sites were used as reference. Experiment results indicated that (1) LEE presented comparative performance with LST as downscaling factors; (2) adding geographical factors can significantly improve the performance of SM downscaling; (3) integrating LST, LEE, and geographical factors got the best performance; (4) using Z-score normalization or hyperbolic-tangent normalization methods did not change the above conclusions, neither did using support vector regression nor feed forward neural network methods. This study demonstrates the possibility of LEE as an alternative of LST for downscaling SM when there is no available LST due to cloud contamination. It also provides experimental evidence for adding geographical factors in the downscaling process.

TI  - Impact of Axillary Dissection Among Patients With Sentinel Node-Positive Breast Cancer Undergoing Mastectomy
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Results of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial supports omission of completion axillary lymph node dissection (CLND) after breast-conservation surgery with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). We hypothesized that CLND also does not impact outcomes in women with clinically node-negative (cNO), pathologically node-positive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy. Materials and Methods: A single-institution retrospective review was performed of patients with SLN-positive breast cancer treated from July 1999 through May 2018. Clinicopathologic and outcome data were collected. Patients with SLNBs were compared with those receiving SLNB and CLND. The Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and Fisher exact tests were used to assess for differences between continuous and categorical variables. The log-rank test was used for time-to-event analyses, and Cox proportional hazards models were fit for locoregional and distant recurrence and overall survival (OS). Results: Of 329 patients with SLN-positive breast cancer undergoing mastectomy, 60% had CLND (n=201). Median age at diagnosis was 53 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46-62 years). The median number of SLNs sampled was 3 (IQR, 2-4), and the median number of positive SLNs was 1 (IQR, 1-2). Patients receiving CLND had higher tumor grades (P=.02) and a higher proportion of hormone receptor negativity (estrogen receptor, 19%; progesterone receptor, 27%; both P=.007). A total of 44 patients (22%) had increased N stage after CLND. Median follow-up was 51 months (IQR, 29-83 months). No association was found between CLND and change in OS and locoregional or distant recurrence. Completion of postmastectomy radiotherapy was associated with improved OS (P=.04). Conclusions: CLND is not significantly correlated with reduced recurrence or improved OS among patients who have cNO, SLN-positive breast cancer treated with mastectomy. CLND was significantly correlated with receipt of adjuvant systemic therapy. Completion of postmastectomy radiotherapy was associated with improved OS.

T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Researching the relationship between forest landscape pattern and the damage caused by herbivorous insects provides an important theoretical basis for constructing landscape ecological security pattern and realizing ecological regulation of pests. A field survey was carried out to obtain the data on damage caused by herbivorous insects in the Irtysh river riparian forest, and landscape index was extracted based on remote sensing data. This study analyzed the effects of forest landscape pattern and landscape characteristics of forest land, farmland, grassland and wasteland on the damage caused by two kinds of herbivorous insects, at the level of landscape and landscape type respectively with Linear Mixed. Effects Models. The results showed that landscape fragmentation was the key factor which compounded the damage caused by two herbivorous insects in the Irtysh river riparian forests, but the responses of leaf chewers and leaf miner to the landscape pattern were not completely consistent. At the landscape level, the damage caused by leaf chewers was significantly positively correlated with landscape richness and landscape connectivity, while the damage caused by leaf miner was significantly negatively correlated with mean patch area. At the level of landscape type, the damage caused by herbivorous insects in the Irtysh river riparian forest was positively correlated with the number of patches in the forest. The increase of cultivated land area led to the increase of population density of leaf miners. The landscape cohesion index of wasteland and the average patch fractal dimension of grassland were significantly positively correlated with the rate of damage caused by leaf chewers. Therefore, when optimizing the landscape pattern, making a reasonable landscape composition and reducing landscape fragmentation can help maintain a balance between economic development and ecological protection and promote the sustainable development of forests.

AB  - This study investigated the prototype and structure of folk tales reproduced in Tae Keller’s novel ‘When You Trap a Tiger’ with <Sister and Brother who became Sun and Moon> as a motif. An attempt was made to analyze the meaning of the folktale transformation and how the novel was structured to express the identity of the diaspora protagonist.As globalization progresses, the question of identity in the diaspora has been expanded or transformed into literature. Takeller was interested in the mobility of the national subject and transformed the folktale into a new perspective, paying attention to how diaspora literature structures the prototype of the folktale in a space where the identity of the subject is unfamiliar.Unlike the time and space of myths that transcend history, the time and space of folk tales exist within history, and when considering the educational and cultural values that folk tales aim for, it can be seen that their affinity is firm. In the text, <Sister and Brother who became Sun and Moon> is a folktale that contains the gen eral sentiments of the people and a communal worldview, and is an interesting story that internalizes the social values of the time, revealing the prototype of the national spirit. Folktales including mythological elements contain the universal sentiments of the nation, so the diaspora’s longing for an unreachable hometown or haven and anxiety about identity are harmonized and structured with the prototype of the myth in the novel. Although the external form of folktales has been continuously changed by the storyteller, the original structure of folktales remains the same.Using Tae Keller’s novel ‘When You Trap a Tiger’ as the text, we investigated what the prototype of folk tales and the structure of the novel meant to find the identity of the diaspora, and compared and analyzed the structure with Vladimir Propp’s character function and behavior analysis. We examined how the identity of the diaspora is revealed in the novel. It is expected that the field of identity research in diaspora literature will be expanded through this work.

TI  - Improving the Retrieval of Forest Canopy Chlorophyll Content From MERIS Dataset by Introducing the Vegetation Clumping Index
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate retrieval of canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) is essential to the effective monitoring of forest productivity, and environmental stress. However, the clumping index (CI), a vital canopy structural parameter, affects inaccurate remote sensing of forest CCC. In this article, we proposed a concept of effective CCC (CCCe) and an integrated CI approach to retrieving forest CCC using empirical regression and random forest regression. First, the PROSPECT-D and four-scale models were used to simulate forest canopy spectra, and the forest CCCe including CI was found more feasible to be remotely sensed than the CCC. Then, an empirical regression model and random forest model trained using different combinations of the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI), reflectance, and CI values were used to estimate the CCC. Finally, the proposed approach was tested using satellite-based CI and MERIS product. Using the empirical regression model, the results showed that the retrieval of forest CCC using the MTCI was greatly improved by the inclusion of the CI (RMSE from 63.64 to 36.51 mu g cm(-2) for broadleaf; RMSE from 96.02 to 58.49 mu g cm(-2) for coniferous). Using the random forest approach and the model trained using the reflectance in red and red-edge bands, MTCI, and CI performed best, with RMSE = 27.95 mu g cm(-2) for broadleaf and RMSE = 34.83 mu g cm(-2) for coniferous. Overall, it is concluded that include the CI, particularly the approach using forest random regression, have the potential for satellite-based forest CCC mapping at regional and global scales.

TI  - Vegetation Abundance and Health Mapping Over Southwestern Antarctica Based on WorldView-2 Data and a Modified Spectral Mixture Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In polar regions, vegetation is especially sensitive to climate dynamics and thus can be used as an indicator of the global and regional environmental change. However, in Antarctica, there is very little information on vegetation distribution and growth status. To fill this gap, we evaluated the ability of both linear and nonlinear spectral mixture analysis (SMA) models, including a group of newly developed modified Nascimento's models for Antarctic vegetated areas (MNM-AVs), in estimating the abundance of major Antarctic vegetation types, i.e., mosses and lichens. The study was conducted using WorldView-2 satellite data and field measurements over the Fildes Peninsula and its surroundings, which are representative vegetated areas in Antarctica. In MNM-AVs, we introduced secondary scattering components for vegetation and its background to account for the sparsity of vegetation cover and reassigned their coefficients. The new models achieved improved performances, among which MNM-AV3 achieved the lowest error for mosses (lichens) abundance estimation with RMSE = 0.202 (0.213). Compared with MNM-AVs, the linear model performed particularly poor for lichens (RMSE = 0.322), which is in contrast to the case of mosses (RMSE = 0.212), demonstrating that spectral signals of lichens are more prone to mix with their backgrounds. Abundance maps of mosses and lichens, as well as a map of moss health status for the entire study area, were then obtained based on MNM-AV3 with around 80% overall accuracy. Moss areas account for 0.7695 km(2) in Fildes and 0.3259 km(2) in Ardley Island; unhealthy mosses amounted to 40% (49%) of the area in the summer of 2018 (2019), indicating considerable environmental stress.

TI  - Multiview Inherent Graph Hashing for Large-Scale Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) is one of the most challenging tasks in remote sensing (RS) community. With the volume of RS images increases explosively, conventional exhaustive search is often infeasible in real applications. Recently, hashing has attracted increasing attention for RSIR due to significant advantage in terms of computation and storage. Hashing first generates a set of short compact hash codes to encode RS images, and then applies hash codes for effective RSIR. Multiview hashing usually achieves promising RSIR performance by fusing multiples kinds of RS image features. Conventional multiview hashing simply predefines graph Laplacian in each view, which cannot effectively explore underlying similarity structures among RS images. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel multiview inherent graph hashing (MvIGH) for RSIR. MvIGH captures the latent similarities among RS images, and adaptively learns weights of each view to characterize its contribution. In addition, MvIGH further minimizes the quantization errors. We develop an efficient alternating algorithm to solve the formulated optimization problem. The experiments on three public RS image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing multiview hashing methods in RSIR tasks.

TI  - Estimation of Net Surface Shortwave Radiation From Remotely Sensed Data Under Dust Aerosol Conditions
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complexity and heterogeneity mechanism of aerosol scattering and absorption, there is no systematic operational net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR) retrieval algorithm for considering the forces of different aerosols. This study is to estimate NSSR under dust aerosol conditions. A parameterized model is proposed to quantify the net shortwave radiative forcing (ASRF) of aerosol. Considering the particularity of dust aerosol on shortwave radiation and its mechanisms, aerosol optical properties and atmospheric water vapor content (WVC) are used to quantify the ASRF, and the previous Tang's parameterization model for estimating NSSR is refined to estimate NSSR under dust aerosol conditions. On this basis, a more accurate radiative transfer model MODTRAN 5 is primitively utilized to simulate and fit the complex relationship. Moreover, the coefficients for parameterization are recalculated by an improved algorithm under diverse types of aerosols. Finally, the NSSR measurements in the study areas and the NSSR products from the MODIS satellites are utilized to verify the retrieved NSSR. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) is below 11 W/m(2) under various land cover types and the research findings can significantly increase the estimation accuracy of NSSR around 40 W/m(2) under dust aerosol conditions.

TI  - SAR Image Classification Using Fully Connected Conditional Random Fields Combined with Deep Learning and Superpixel Boundary Constraint
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most important active remote sensing technologies, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides advanced advantages of all-day, all-weather, and strong penetration capabilities. Due to its unique electromagnetic spectrum and imaging mechanism, the dimensions of remote sensing data have been considerably expanded. Important for fundamental research in microwave remote sensing, SAR image classification has been proven to have great value in many remote sensing applications. Many widely used SAR image classification algorithms rely on the combination of hand-designed features and machine learning classifiers, which still experience many issues that remain to be resolved and overcome, including optimized feature representation, the fuzzy confusion of speckle noise, the widespread applicability, and so on. To mitigate some of the issues and to improve the pattern recognition of high-resolution SAR images, a ConvCRF model combined with superpixel boundary constraint is developed. The proposed algorithm can successfully combine the local and global advantages of fully connected conditional random fields and deep models. An optimizing strategy using a superpixel boundary constraint in the inference iterations more efficiently preserves structure details. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides competitive advantages over other widely used models. In the land cover classification experiments using the MSTAR, E-SAR and GF-3 datasets, the overall accuracy of our proposed method achieves 90.18 +/- 0.37, 91.63 +/- 0.27, and 90.91 +/- 0.31, respectively. Regarding the issues of SAR image classification, a novel integrated learning containing local and global image features can bring practical implications.

TI  - Ensemble Learning via Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition for Integrating Data and Classifier Fusion in Water Quality Monitoring
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current multimodal learning in smart feature extraction and classification has reshaped the landscape of remote sensing. The recent developments in smart feature extraction mainly rely on different machine learning and data mining algorithms as powerful classifiers to improve prediction accuracy. This article presents an innovative ensemble learning algorithm for integrated data and classifier fusion via higher order singular value decomposition (IDCF-HOSVD). Based on the fused data, different analytical, semiempirical, and empirical classifiers can be selected and applied to perform information retrieval that can be further synergized via a tensor flow based feature extraction scheme over the classifier space. When preserving core fused image patterns via HOSVD, the final step of IDCF-HOSVD helps rank the contributions from different classifiers via nonlinear correlation information entropy. Practical implementation of the IDCF-HOSVD algorithm was assessed through its application to map the seasonal water quality conditions in Lake Nicaragua, Central America.

TI  - An Anchor-Free Detection Method for Ship Targets in High-Resolution SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of earth observation technology, high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (HR SAR) imaging satellites could provide more observational information for maritime surveillance. However, there are still some problems to detect ship targets in HR SAR images due to the complex surroundings, targets defocusing, and diversity of the scales. In this article, an anchor-free method is proposed for ship target detection in HR SAR images. First, fully convolutional one-stage object detection (FCOS) as the base network is applied to detect ship targets, achieving better detection performance through pixel-by-pixel prediction of the image. Second, the category-position (CP) module is proposed to optimize the position regression branch features in the FCOS network. This module can improve target positioning performance in complex scenes by generating guidance vector from the classification branch features. At the same time, target classification and boundary box regression methods are redesigned to shield the adverse effects of fuzzy areas in the network training. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of CP-FCOS, extensive experiments are conducted on High-Resolution SAR Images Dataset, SAR Ship Detection Dataset, IEEE 2020 Gaofen Challenge SAR dataset, and two complex large-scene HR SAR images. The experimental results show that our method can obtain encouraging detection performance compared with Faster-RCNN, RetinaNet, and FCOS. Remarkably, the proposed method was applied to SAR ship detection in the 2020 Gaofen Challenge. Our team ranked first among 292 teams in the preliminary contest and won seventh place in the final match.

AB  - Poor supervision and tourism activities have resulted in forest degradation in islands in Korea. Since the southern coastal region of the Korean peninsula was originally dominated by warm-temperate evergreen broad-leaved forests, it is desirable to restore forests in this region to their original vegetation. In this study, we identified suitable areas to be restored as evergreen broad-leaved forests by analyzing the environmental factors of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests in the islands of Jeollanam-do. We classified forest lands in the study area into six vegetation types from Sentinel-2 satellite images using a deep learning algorithm and analyzed the tolerance ranges of existing evergreen broad-leaved forests by measuring the locational, topographic, and climatic attributes of the classified vegetation types. Results showed that evergreen broad-leaved forests were distributed more in areas with a high altitudes and steep slope, where human intervention was relatively low. The human intervention has led to a higher distribution of evergreen broad-leaved forests in areas with lower annual average temperature, which was an unexpected but understandable result because an area with higher altitude has a lower temperature. Of the environmental factors, latitude and average temperature in the coldest month (January) were relatively less contaminated by the effects of human intervention, thus enabling the identification of suitable restoration areas of the evergreen broad-leaved forests. The tolerance range analysis of evergreen broad-leaved forests showed that they mainly grew in areas south of the latitude of 34.7Â° and a monthly average temperature of 1.7Â°C or higher in the coldest month. Therefore, we predicted the areas meeting these criteria to be suitable for restoring evergreen broad-leaved forests. The suitable areas cover 614.5 ㎢, which occupies 59.0% of the total forest lands on the islands of Jeollanamdo, and 73% of actual forests that exclude agricultural and other non-restorable forest lands. The findings of this study can help forest managers prepare a restoration plan and budget for island forests.

AB  - Science and technology have defined the limits of the worldview in any era. Since the production and interpretation of works of art are based on this worldview, the development of science stimulates the reinterpretation of art works. Just as Freud's discovery of the unconsciousness presented a new perspective on life and art as a psychoanalytic interpretation, Darwin's theory of the evolution has led to the development of evolutionary psychology that understands all aspects of human psychology from the evolutionary perspective. This paper adds a new interpretation by analyzing Equus from the perspective of evolutionary psychiatry, a branch of psychiatry based on evolutionary psychology.Specifically, we interpret from the evolutionary psychiatry point of view where the psychopathic characteristics of Alan's behavior reveal anxiety, addiction, and delusion.Evolutionary psychology and evolutionary psychiatry have identified the interactions between genes and their environment over evolutionary time to discover a variety of factors affecting normal and abnormal judgments, many of which vary across social and cultural contexts. These features are well-illustrated in Alan's anxiety, addiction, and delusional symptoms, which continue to confuse Dysart and the audience about the boundaries between normal and abnormal. After all, this confusion is due to instincts developed in the evolving process of human psychology interacting with the environment. This paper will be an attempt at art interpretation in line with changes in perception with the development of science, by understanding an artwork written from the psychoanalysis perspective of the past century with a state-of-the-art point of view of evolutionary psychiatry.

AB  - The researcher looked at the changes in the 21st century show program and the transmedia strategies in the spin-off program. To this end, Henry Jenkins’ transmedia content was used as the theoretical background, and the transmedia strategy was examined through the case of a spin-off program with a music audition program as the original content. As an analysis example, TV Chosun’s “Mr. Trot” was targeted at “Call Center of Love” - “Pongsoonga Hakdang” and JTBC’s “Sing Again” as the original content.As a result of the case analysis, it was found that all three spin-off programs targeted had transmedia elements in the differentiation process with the original content. First, the continuous storytelling and worldview from the original content to the spin-off program have achieved more multiple expansion. Second, it can be seen that each performer’s individual personality appearing in the original content leads to a spin-off program, creating and expanding into a single character.In particular, unlike audition programs in the past, which were popular with one or two winners, many of the final winners emphasized their own characteristics and led to spin-off programs.Third, it shows a convergence pattern of generation and genre. It can be seen that the scope of the cast's generation and genre is intentionally expanding to attract more diverse viewers, not the existing fixed class of trot audition and 7080 audition. Fourth, the interaction with the fandom in the original content came to the spin-off program and clearly appeared as a transmedia strategy between media. The original contents “Mr. Trot” and “Sing Again” actively reflected their opinions in the open structure, increasing new fandom every time like TV audition programs.This phenomenon further strengthened the fandom’s activities as it came to the spin-off program and developed into a combination of TV and OTT.

TI  - Enhanced Water Management for Muang Fai Irrigation Systems through Remote Sensing and SWOT Analysis
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The areas of northern Thailand rely heavily on water management by Muang Fai irrigation systems. Outstanding features of these typical systems include public participation and acceptance of regulations established by Muang Fai irrigation management; however, the knowledge and application of modern technologies should be promoted in these systems in collaboration with traditional water management. In this study, remote sensing was applied to analyse plant phenology to estimate the planting dates and farming sizes through Sentinel-2 imagery. CROPWAT 8.0 was also used to analyse the crop water requirements in different periods to enable the water management committee to determine the water quantity needed in each period throughout the area. The greatest water amounts were needed by plants during the dry season in March and April each year. In addition, the researcher team adopted strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis to establish guidelines for the potential enhancement of Muang Fai irrigation systems suited to the current social contexts and environment.

AB  - This research examines the collaboration between agencies in policy-making based on hotspot monitoring from satellites. Valid data regarding the number of hotspots from the satellite is needed in decision making because it provides information used to control forest and land fires in Indonesia. For instance, the Ministry of Forestry uses data from the NOAA-18 satellite for analysis, while the BMKG utilizes those from the Agua/Terra. However, the data generated by each satellite has differences in the number of hotspots. Therefore, this research aims to determine the collaboration between the Ministry of Forestry and BMKG in the use of satellite data for decision-makers to determine disaster alert status. This research uses a qualitative approach to analyze secondary data from two popular media sources collected using the Nvivo 12 plus application. The result showed that agencies involved in fire prevention lack collaboration due to institutional designs that lead to a lack of communication and unclear roles for each institution during the decision making process.

AB  - Drought is a natural disaster that lasts a long time and has an impact on various things that can seriously affect human life, economy, agricultural production, and also ecological environment. In Indonesia, floods and droughts become annual disasters that often occur and are difficult to avoid, even in big cities. Drought cannot be considered a trivial problem because its impact is very detrimental to every aspect of life. Drought can be seen from several indicators. The depth of groundwater can be an indicator of drought. The purpose of this study was to predict the depth of groundwater in the Citarum River Basin. This study uses a spatially distributed Shetran model. The Shetran model was developed by the School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Newcastle upon Tyne University. The hydro-climatological data from satellite measurements during 2001 to 2017 were used in Shetran model. Input data in this study consisted of digital elevation models, TRMNI rainfall data, evaporation data, soil properties, and land-use change land cover change data. The results showed that within 17 years the land use types in the Citarum watershed had undergone significant changes. This land use change affects the depth of groundwater in the Citarum watershed.

AB  - In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for five milk production traits in the Valle del Belice sheep. Repeated measurements for milk yield (MY), fat percentage and yield (F% and FY) and protein percentage and yield (P% and PY) on 481 ewes, were available for the analysis. The animals were genotyped using the Illumina Ovine 50k BeadChip. Weighted deregressed breeding values (DEBVw) were used as phenotypes for GWAS analysis. A total of 23 genome-wide significant SNPs were identified: 3 associated with MY, 9 with FY, and 11 with P%. Several SNPs mapped within known candidate genes or previously reported QTL for milk production traits in livestock species. Additional interesting markers were identified on OAR3 for FY and P%. These SNPs supported some previous findings and also added new information useful to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the milk production and quality traits in dairy sheep.

TI  - Hemodynamic features of an intracranial aneurysm rupture predicted by perianeurysmal edema: A case report.
T2  - Surgical neurology international
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perianeurysmal edema (PAE) has been suggested as an indicator of potential aneurysm rupture; however, the hemodynamic features of these aneurysms are still unknown. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis was performed to evaluate the hemodynamic features of a very rare case of a ruptured middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm with PAE.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 65-year-old woman presented with disturbed consciousness. A subarachnoid hemorrhage due to an azygos anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysm rupture was suspected. An unruptured MCA aneurysm with PAE was identified in the left temporal lobe. Although the ACA aneurysm was clipped to prevent re-bleeding, the MCA aneurysm subsequently ruptured 6 days later. Clipping of the MCA aneurysm was performed, and hemosiderin deposits suggestive of sentinel bleeding were found on the surface of the aneurysm dome. CFD analysis revealed unstable hemodynamic stress at the expanded bleb area after rupture, localized to the rupture site. Moreover, this analysis revealed flow impingement with pressure elevation and low wall shear stress, which indicated increased inflammation and aneurysm wall thinning that likely led to rupture.CONCLUSION: Hemosiderin deposits at the aneurysm wall and PAE indicates leakage from a cerebral aneurysm. Hemodynamic stress at the aneurysm may promote an inflammatory response and lead to wall weakening accompanied by PAE. Based on our findings, we recommend that surgical intervention should be considered as the first line of treatment for such aneurysms to prevent rupture.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes and analyzes film and video materials containing information on the topic of religious practices of the Finno-Ugric peoples in the Soviet period. The main sources of the research are archival audiovisual records created by the staff of the Estonian National Museum in the period from the 1960s to the early 1990 s, as well as field diaries of participants in the Finno-Ugric expeditions. This was the time when official atheism prevailed in the Soviet Union, the main blow of which was directed primarily at the churches. At the same time, this was a period when open persecution of traditional rituals was not observed, and the study of the worldview aspects of the traditional culture of different ethnic groups was strongly encouraged by ethnology. On the basis ofaudiovisual materials, the article analyzes which fragments of the religious practices of the Finno-Ugric peoples are reflected in the museum archives, and which methods were used by researchers to record different rituals. Much attention is paid to building the relationship between the ethnologist and the bearer of the tradition in the field, as well as the special role of the local mediator in the study of religious rituals through a film or video camera. The considered examples of collecting audiovisual material confirm that in the Soviet period, in contrast to today's digital technologies and the usual practice of photographing and filming various (including sacred) events, researchers with a camera were not always welcomed at prayers. In the audiovisual study of religious rites, the process of adaptation to the environment of the culture under study and the effect of building a first impression acquired particular importance for ethnologists, largely related to the authority of the local mediator who brought them to prayers.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to highlight the transformations of the worldview and activities of L.Zhebunov - one of the most active figures of the Ukrainian national movement of the first two decades of the twentieth century. The research methodology is based on personalistic and systemic approaches, principles of science and historicism, on the use of historical-genetic, historical-typological and historical-systemic methods. Scientific novelty. On the basis of archival and published sources and literature the peculiarities of L.Zhebunov's personality formation are investigated; his evolution from the ideology and social practice of Russian social-revolutionary populism to participation in the Ukrainian national movement is studied. The place and role of L.Zhebunov in a number of Ukrainian public organizations, parties, circles, press bodies, his influence on the process of establishing the Ukrainian national consciousness in society are determined. A holistic image of L.Zhebunov as a consistent fighter for the Ukrainian national cause is created. Conclusions. L.Zhebunov went through a difficult path of formation and evolution of his worldview, the essence of which is seen in the transition from Russian populism in the 70's of the 19th century to conscious Ukrainianness in the early 20th century. In 1904-1917 he was one of the most active participants in the Ukrainian national movement. Organizational, journalistic, publishing, agitation and propaganda activities of L.Zhebunov contributed to the spread of Ukrainian national consciousness in the first decades of the twentieth century.

TI  - Lateral flow and contributing area control vegetation cover in a semiarid environment
T2  - Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW)
M3  - Data study
AB  - Semiarid ecosystems attract attention, because they support the life of large human populations, while functioning under growing threats of degradation due to global climate change, that may lead to reduced productivity, and possibly irreversible desertification. Mathematical models have been developed to predict desertification, based on the premise that limited vegetation cover indicates water stress. However, local attributes may mask the smooth relationships quantified by these synthetic models, and empirical support is highly sought after in a bid to validate the soil-moisture-biomass relationship at the local scale. However, field data is limited by costly and time-consuming data acquisition. Spatially and temporally explicit realistic models may be one possible solution for studying the effect of field heterogeneity on these relationships. Combining physically-based models and a database of 32 years of field and remotely sensed data, we examined the effect of soil-moisture content (SMC) on vegetation cover and patch size distribution in the semiarid Lehavim LTER in the Negev Desert, Israel. Within this framework, results from numerical solutions of flow equations in the shallow soil layer, near the soil surface, allowed predictions of distributions of SMC as the outcome of vertical and lateral water fluxes. The association of vertical fluxes with patch size distribution and vegetation cover did not support the notion that direct rainfall is sufficient for the shrubs survival in drought conditions. However, re-infiltration of downslope runoff (also known as run-on) generated in the sealed bare intershrub soil area, significantly contributed to the water available to supporting shrub patches. Accordingly, our approach determines potential vegetation cover in semiarid areas, due to the dependency on contributing area and rainfall-infiltration-runoff processes. This underscores the fact that, in addition to infiltration from direct rainfall, run-on contribution determines shrub patches size and vegetation cover in semiarid environments. We therefore suggest that estimations of shrub resilience in semiarid regions to water stress should consider scenarios involving surface sealing, rainfall intensity and contributing area sizeeach in accordance with the contribution of lateral flows to the water available to shrubs.

T2  - NJAS-IMPACT IN AGRICULTURAL AND LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne diseases are a major human and animal health problem for Western countries, particularly in view of climate change. However, farmers' practices and knowledge of tick management remain poorly addressed. This paper examines this issue through a micro-local case study in a Corsican valley, France. Interviews using several methods were conducted with 17 ruminant or horse farmers. Despite considerable field experience, the farmers exhibit poor spatial and biological knowledge of ticks and related diseases, thus leading to a lack of appropriate management practices. However, the data collected show that these farmers could be an effective sentinel population. More efficient prevention could be developed locally through a hybridization of knowledge among farmers and scientists.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to re-thought Old Testament theologically about “culture mandate” (Creation Commandment) in Genesis 1:26-28 from Christian worldview and following its first cultural activity that presents Adam’s naming behavior in Genesis 2:19-20. This is because it is not easy to call these texts directly with the philosophical terms of “cultural mandate” and “cultural activities”. As criticism of independent responses develops in biblical interpretation, there are frequent cases of interpretation and application of the text according to the age of the second reader without properly recognizing the understanding of the author, the text, and the first reader. As it can be seen, it is important to consider what the text meant to the first reader.To do this, first, the meaning in the “contextual context”(sitz im Literatur) of the texts is considered through Texts Linguistics and exegesis method, and then the meaning in the “life context”(sitz im Leben) of the author and first readers. Through this process, along with the correction of the understanding of the “cultural mandate”, there will be a correction of the understanding of the theological meaning centered on the Elenctics aspect of Adam’s naming behavior, which is the name of Adam. The theological significance of the building incident is clearly revealed when it is interpreted in relation to the creation incident of the woman and the “helper”(Ezer Kennegdo), which overlaps perfectly, rather than as a cultural act interpreted in connection with the cultural mandate.The result of this study are extended and applied to the relationship between God and Israel and the relationship between Jesus and the church, providing an Old Testament theological answer to the problem of “gender” that is a hot topic in our time.  In the end, it reveals what the most important fundamental 'culture' is which the confession community that seeks to practice the Christian worldview movement based on philosophical thinking in life must grow and bear fruit.

TI  - Analysis of Oleksandr Kulchytskyi's Anthropological Research in the Context of European Philosophy
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The paper is aimed at studying the peculiarities of the Oleksandr Kulchytskyi's doctrine of human, taking into account the context of European philosophy and especially in comparison with the paradigm of philosophizing in the Lviv-Warsaw school. The theoretical basis of the study is determined by Kulchytskyi's scholarly works in the field of philosophy and philosophical anthropology, as well as the latest researches that reinterpret the influence of Twardowski's theoretico-methodological ideas on the formation of the philosophical worldview of the Ukrainian thinker. Originality. Based on the appeal to primary sources, Kulchytskyi's philosophical doctrine of human in the unity of its basic principles and theoretico-practical results is reconstructed. The ways of forming the key ideas of his philosophical anthropology are determined, their originality is substantiated, despite the cooperation with Twardowski's school, as well as despite numerous discussions and researches of Western European philosophicoanthro-pological, existentio-ideological and socio-psychological issues. Conclusions. It is found out how the philosophical worldview of Oleksandr Kulchytskyi was formed and how he gradually came from the research of the human psyche within the framework of anthropological structural psychology to the realization of the need to study philosophical anthropology. The personalistic features of his philosophical doctrine of human are characterized; in particular, attention is paid to the distinction between the concepts of person and personality, determining the importance of the social factor for the formation of human worldview, didactic aims of anthropological studies. It is shown how in Kulchytskyi's philosophical anthropology the analysis of the existentio-worldview dimension of human existence, manifested in different spiritual situations and socio-cultural conditions that influence the specifics of thinking and the nature of the personality mentality, acquires special importance. The originality of Kulchytskyi's arguments about human in the context of both Ukrainian philosophy and in general European philosophical thought is stated.

TI  - METAPHYSICS OF REALITY: PRAGMATICO-ANALYTIC INTERPRETATION OF WITTGENSTEIN'S PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACH
T2  - FILOSOFIYA-PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines Ludwig Wittgenstein's views on the world and human beings in it. It is emphasized that the philosopher, in addition to paying a lot of attention to the study of language, which determined the basis of his method of cognition, followed a number of worldview ideas about reality. They were supported by the achievements of physics of that time, although Wittgenstein himself argued that the study of reality is not possible without understanding the metaphysical issues concerning the unspeakable, supernatural, spiritual, and so on. It shows how Wittgenstein interpreted the world and reality, distinguished between different levels of being, studied logical atoms, not laws, analyzed facts, not things, comprehended not only the macrocosm but also the microcosm, and as a result built a pragmatic ontological-cosmological conception, in which human and the way of their being in the world occupied a significant place.

TI  - Quality assurance and assessment framework for large area land cover maps validation in the Copernicus high-resolution hot spot monitoring activity
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus High-Resolution Hot Spot Monitoring activity (C-HSM) delivers a global dataset of Key Landscapes for Conservation (KLC), which are characterized by pronounced anthropogenic pressures that require high mapping accuracy. Detailed land cover and land cover change C-HSM map products are freely available, including map production accuracy assessments, to users and stakeholders in order to understand the map products' confidence levels. Other similar regional or global land cover products provide limited accuracy assessment, which is a significant drawback for evidence-based decision-making, in particular. Without a complete understanding of the map product quality or quantified confidence levels, usability is reduced and can affect stakeholder decision-making and the implementation of sustainable solutions. To take advantage of very high-resolution imagery, time series of Sentinel-2, and historic satellite archives, we developed web-based temporal trajectory and seasonal matrix viewer tools. For the quantitative accuracy assessment we implemented a stratified random sampling approach, where we placed special emphasis on (i) allocation of sampling units for rare land cover change categories; (ii) effective and accurate labelling of large numbers of sampling units; (iii) accuracy and area estimation in one consistent approach; and (iv) derivation of confidence intervals for all accuracy measures and area estimates. To handle correlations, large uncertainties, and complex probability density functions, bootstrapping was applied instead of analytical equations, which are based on normality assumptions. This paper presents the Quality Assurance and Quality Control framework applied to validate all the C-HSM thematic map products. The Kundelungu-Upemba KLC product results are presented as our use case.

T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate land use/land cover changes (1987-2017), prediction (2032-2047), and identify the drivers of Majang Forest Biosphere Reserves. Landsat image (TM, ETM+, and OLI-TIRS) and socioeconomy data were used for the LU/LC analysis and its drivers of change. The supervised classification was also employed to classify LU/LC. The CA-Markov model was used to predict future LU/LC change using IDRISI software. Data were collected from 240 households from eight kebeles in two districts to identify LU/LC change drivers. Five LU/LC classes were identified: forestland, farmland, grassland, settlement, and waterbody. Farmland and settlement increased by 17.4% and 3.4%, respectively; while, forestland and grassland were reduced by 77.8% and 1.4%, respectively, from 1987 to 2017. The predicted results indicated that farmland and settlement increased by 26.3% and 6.4%, respectively, while forestland and grassland decreased by 66.5% and 0.8%, respectively, from 2032 to 2047. Eventually, agricultural expansion, population growth, shifting cultivation, fuel wood extraction, and fire risk were identified as the main drivers of LU/LC change. Generally, substantial LU/LC changes were observed and will continue in the future. Hence, land use plan should be proposed to sustain resource of Majang Forest Biosphere Reserves, and local communities' livelihood improvement strategies are required to halt land conversion.

T2  - The Pan African medical journal
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Multicenter Study
AB  - INTRODUCTION: intussusception is a condition in which one segment of the bowel prolapses into another causing obstruction. Information on the epidemiology of intussusception in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. We describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of children with intussusception in Ethiopia.METHODS: active surveillance for children < 12 months of age with intussusception was conducted at six sentinel hospitals in Ethiopia. Limited socio-economic and clinical data were collected from enrolled children. Characteristics among children who died and children who survived were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables.RESULTS: total of 164 children < 12 months of age with intussusception were enrolled; 62% were male. The median age at symptom onset was 6 months with only 12 (7%) of cases occurring in the first 3 months of life. Intussusception was reduced by surgery in 90% of cases and 10% were reduced by enema; 13% of cases died. Compared to survivors, children who died had a significantly longer time to presentation to the first health care facility and to the treating health care facility (median 3 days versus 2 days, p = 0.02, respectively).CONCLUSION: the high mortality rate, late presentation of intussusception cases, and lack of modalities for non-surgical management at some facilities highlight the need for better management of intussusception cases in Ethiopia.

AB  - The type of bottom resting below the water surface may be difficult to be determined due to the contamination of pixels by glint in satellite reflectance imagery. A nearest neighbor non-glint pixel search algorithm was written in Python to correct glint contaminated pixels. An algorithm was then utilized to estimate water visibility and to analyze the results of the glint corrected pixels by using light attenuation depths and attenuation coefficients based upon glint corrected satellite reflectance in the WorldView-3 (WV-3) image channels. The aforementioned correction was undertaken for sand, mud, and seagrass bottom types. The results suggest that it is possible to estimate attenuation depths (a measure of water visibility).

AB  - We demonstrate a successful navigation and docking control system for the John Deere Tango autonomous mower, using only a single camera as the input. This vision-only system is of interest because it is inexpensive, simple for production, and requires no external sensing. This is in contrast to existing systems that rely on integrated position sensors and global positioning system (GPS) technologies. To produce our system we combined a state-of-the-art object detection architecture, You Look Only Once (YOLO), with a reinforcement learning (RL) architecture, Double Deep Q-Networks (Double DQN). The object detection network identifies features on the mower and passes its output to the RL network, providing it with a low-dimensional representation that enables rapid and robust training. Finally, the RL network learns how to navigate the machine to the desired spot in a custom simulation environment. When tested on mower hardware, the system is able to dock with centimeter-level accuracy from arbitrary initial locations and orientations.

AB  - The main factors of land subsidence are excessive pumping of groundwater for industry, agriculture, snow melting, cooling, pumping of natural gas, and mines' tunnel excavation. The city of Semarang, the capital of Central Java province, is located on the northern coast of Java island in Indonesia. Land subsidence in this city has enormous potentials for many hazards threatening people and urban infrastructures, such as buildings, roads, or whatever necessary for livelihoods. To accurately measure the land subsidence in Semarang, time series analysis of Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) or Permanent/Persistent Scatterers (PS) and Distributed Scatterers (DS) InSAR analysis is essential. This study shows the recent land subsidence volume in Semarang city with the SBAS technique and compares it to historical InSAR analysis. We also conducted the 2.5-dimensional analysis to convert the satellite line-of-site (LOS) displacement into the horizontal and vertical direction to see if there are differences between ascending and descending data. The SBAS analysis result showed the displacement volume in a range of -18.2cm subsided and +6.8cm uplifted. The displacement rate was estimated to be substantially constant over time without any apparent seasonal effect. There is no significant difference in the results between ascending and descending datasets. The 2.5-dimensional analysis identified the horizontal and vertical displacements that we corrected any noise and inclined directional values using incidence angle.

AB  - The paper examine the capabilities of Landsat-8 and SRTM remote sensing data for regional scale structural mapping in a sub-tropical region, which is challenging due to heavy vegetation. Fracture sets are defined using statistical characterization of fracture orientation and genetic parameters. Detailed analysis of the overall structures led to the identification of two major networks corresponding to dextral and sinistral shear zones mainly oriented NE-SW. Fields investigation shows that the area has recorded structures such as foliation, intrafolic boudins, mylonitic schistosity, S/C fabrics and fractures, organized into three phases of deformation D1 to D3 and geological formations include intrusive granite in a metamorphic basement. Remote sensing results are consistent with field data. Copyright: info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0

M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Information monitoring technology is used to reduce information uncertainty about the regularity of air temperature changes during managing work in hard-to-reach places [1]. The task was to create a method for modelling one of the climatic indicators, air temperature, in the given territories in the information monitoring technology structure. Climate models are the main tools for studying the response of the ecological system to external and internal influences. The problem of reducing information uncertainty in making managerial decisions is eliminated by predicting the consequences of using planned control actions using climate modelling methods in information monitoring technology. The information technology of climate monitoring combines satellite observation methods and observations on climate stations, taking into account the spatial and temporal characteristics, to form an array of input data. It was made with the methods for synthesizing models of monitoring information systems [1] and methods of forming multi-level model structures of the monitoring information systems [1] for converting observation results into knowledge, and with the rules for interpreting obtained results for calculating the temperature value in the uncontrolled territories.Objective of the work is to solve the problem of identifying the functional dependence of the air temperature in a given uncontrolled territory on the results of observations of the climate characteristics by meteorological stations in the information technology of climate monitoring structure.Method. The methodology for creating information technologies for monitoring has been improved to expand its capabilities to perform new tasks of forecasting temperature using data from thermal imaging satellites and weather stations by using a new method of climate modelling. A systematic approach to the process of climate modelling and the group method of data handling were used for solving problems of functional dependence identification, methods of mathematical statistics for evaluating models.Results. The deviation of the calculated temperature values with the synthesized monitoring information systems models from the actual values obtained from the results of observations by artificial earth satellites does not, on average, exceed 2.5 degrees C. Temperature traces obtained from satellite images and weather stations at similar points show similar dynamics.Conclusions. The problem of the functional dependence identification of air temperature in uncontrolled territories on the results of observations at meteorological stations is solved. The obtained results were used in the process of creating a new method of climate modelling within information technology of climate monitoring. Experimental confirmation of the hypothesis about the possibility of using satellite images in regional models of temperature prediction has been obtained. The effectiveness of the application of the methodology for the creation of monitoring information technologies during the implementation of the tasks of reducing uncertainty for management decisions during works in non-controlled territories has been proven.

TI  - Assessment of vertical accuracy of open source 30m resolution space-borne digital elevation models
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly accurate air-borne Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are not commonly available in most regions of the world, particularly developing countries like Nepal. Better topographic data are required to assess catchment hydrology, flood/inundation propagation, and sediment transport/deposition. Ground-based surveys (i.e., topographic and bathymetry) and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) are expensive in terms of cost and time. We rely mostly on space-borne DEMs when the area of interest is quite large. And, for river cross-sections at specific regions, ground-based surveys are conducted at some regular intervals. The ALOS World 3 D - 30 m (AW3D30), ASTER Global DEM Version 3 (ASTER GDEM v3), SRTM-30, and Carto DEM v3 are some of the popular and latest space-borne DEMs that have been made available to the general public free of charge at a spatial resolution of 30 m. The availability of multiple space-borne DEMs may likely puzzle the practitioners on the selection of appropriate products. Here in this study, we evaluate the vertical accuracy of different space-borne DEMs with respect to the ground-based survey points (2891 points) at river cross-sections and ground-based indicative spot heights (8102 points) across the West Rapti River basin, Nepal. Performance metrics, like mean error and root mean square error (RMSE), were used to quantify deviation with respect to observed elevation. The AW3D30 showed the lowest RMSE value (i.e., 3.41 m) in the lower region of the study area. We numerically simulated the inundation propagation based on four selected DEMs using a calibrated two-dimensional runoff inundation model, and we find the AW3D30 outperforms other DEMs. All four DEMs showed a similar tendency on a catchment scale with respect to the information of indicative spot heights, suggesting interchangeable applications of all four DEMs in hydrologic analyses. However, precise ground-based observations across the catchment are needed for assuring the applicability.

TI  - Mantle Plume - Source of Indian Ocean Geoid low
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - The probable source for the Indian Ocean geoid low, IOGL, which has been a mystery since the nineteen sixties, is a mantle plume that has not reached the surface. A geoid low can be expressed equally well as a gravity low. Therefore, the gravity low can also be inverted to discover the source of IOGL. Considering wavelengths longer than about 40,000 km, obtained from satellite harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 9, or by averaging surface gravity values averaged over 20x20 degrees, the anomaly pattern of the gravity low has been determined. It is roughly circular, and it lends itself readily to inversion by iterative forward modeling. The inversion yields several alternative source bodies for the gravity low. A cylindrical body that extends up from the core mantle boundary, and which plausibly represents a plume, appears to be the most satisfactory solution. If some shorter wavelengths could also be considered, the inferred plume may extend up to the mantle transition zone where high temperatures have been reported by other investigators. A plume with similar dimensions, has been seismically discovered under the Yellowstone hot spot. Seismic experiments might be able to verify the existence of the plume under IOGL.

T2  - Revista del Jardin Botanico Nacional
M3  - Article
AB  - Miconia rufa is considered an endemic species complex from the eastern Cuban mountains, which includes M. plumieriifolia, a taxonomic decision based on the review of only a few herbarium specimens. Recent collections of this taxa allowed the verification of the foliar shape and size differences between populations of Sierra Maestra and Toa ranges, which indicated the need for a more detailed study regarding this subject. In the current paper, we characterized and morphometrically compared leaves among northeast and southwest groups of eastern Cuba, to provide elements that clarify their delimitation. We analyzed 361 leaves from 45 individuals from different herbaria, the length, maximum width and leaf area were measured, and the shape was described by internal angles, shape indexes, landmarks and Fourier contour descriptors. To characterize environmental conditions of source localities, we extracted bioclimatic models and remote sensing data, a set of variables including mean and annual maximum temperatures, precipitations, altitude, slope, tree cover, NDVI, aridity index and evapotranspiration potential from maps. Populations from northeast and southwest parts were statistically different in length and shape of leaves. Except for the type locality of each name, the rest were not markedly different in environmental conditions, but morphometric differences in leaves were associated with environmental differences. Individuals from the Gran Piedra mountain range show extremes properties. Morphometric characteristics from the type collection of M. rufa and M. plumieriifolia were not representative of all population spatial variability, therefore other studies are required to clarify the origin of these spatial morphometric patterns in the leaves differences of this species complex.

AB  - Indonesia has large areas of forest that spread in almost every island of Indonesia. Forest in Indonesia also have various types of ecosystem, therefore they have an important role to protect each element contained within the ecosystem. The forest monitoring system in Indonesia still using the traditional approach for monitoring forests areas. This paper aims to generate a prediction model using remote sensing data and support vector regression for the model to estimate forest cover, especially in Indonesia. Landsat 8 OLI reflectance value from each band was used to estimate forest canopy cover with the integration of LiDAR data. The prediction model of forest canopy cover was observed at R-2 = 0.6921 and RMSE = 0.1658 of canopy cover. In this case R-2 means the correlation between LiDAR point cloud with Landsat bands. The SVR kernel used in this study was radial basis function with parameter (Cost: 10, Gamma: 1 and Epsilon: 0.1).

AB  - A tradition is comprised of discourses that seek to instruct communities of people on the correct forms and purposes of given practices. Through the social processes of constructing and transmitting shared meanings, Confucian and Christian traditions establish and sustain their own communities of faith, identification, and interpretation. Four observations of Confucian and Christian traditions are noted: (1) there is a plurality of Confucian and Christian traditions; (2) both traditions are based on and find legitimacy in their respective canonical texts; (3) Confucian traditions tend to be more religiously untethered whereas Christian traditions tend to be more religiously tethered; and (4) the comparison between Confucian and Christian traditions in this book is not of their truth claims but of how their respective adherents (re)interpret, appropriate, and apply the teachings in their lives.

TI  - Retrieving Land Surface Temperature From Chinese FY-3D MERSI-2 Data Using an Operational Split Window Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium resolution spectral imager II (MERSI-2) is a payload for the Chinese meteorological satellite Feng Yun 3 (FY-3). China's satellite remote sensing observation capabilities such as climate change research can be improved during MERSI-2's operation in orbit, and the sensor is the world's first imaging instrument that can obtain a global infrared split-window data with a spatial resolution of 250 m. We developed an operational spilt-window (SW) algorithm to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) accurately from the MERSI-2 data. The SW algorithm coefficients were derived from a simulation dataset that was established with the Moderate spectral resolution atmospheric Transmittance model version 5.2 and the thermodynamic initial guess retrieval dataset. In the practical retrieval, the precise algorithm coefficients were determined by view zenith angle and atmospheric water vapor content (WVC), the atmospheric WVC were obtained from the ERA5 dataset, and the land surface emissivity was dynamically estimated using the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global emissivity dataset, considering the fractional of vegetation cover and snow cover. The retrieved LST compared with in situ LST, which was highly consistent with the in situ LST and that the root-mean-square error of the two is within 3 K. The retrieved LST was compared with the MYD11_L2 and MYD21_L2 LST products, and the results indicated that MERSI-2 LST was more consistent with the MYD21 LST. The operational SW algorithm for FY-3D MERSI-2 developed in this study could retrieve LST accurately and has a wide range of popularization and application values.

TI  - Spatial Variability of Relative Sea-Level Rise in Tianjin, China: Insight From InSAR, GPS, and Tide-Gauge Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tianjin coastal region in Bohai Bay, Northern China, is increasingly affected by storm-surge flooding which is exacerbated by anthropogenic land subsidence and global sea-level rise (SLR). We use a combination of synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR), continuous GPS (CGPS), and tide-gauge observations to evaluate the spatial variability of relative SLR (RSLR) along the coastline of Tianjin. Land motion obtained by integration of 2 tracks of Sentinel-1 SAR images and 19 CGPS stations shows that the recent land subsidence in Tianjin downtown is less than 8 mm/yr, which has significantly decreased with respect to the last 50 years (up to 110 mm/yr in the 1980s). This might benefit from the South-to-North Water Transfer Project which has provided more than 1.8 billion cubic meters of water for Tianjin city since 2014 and reduced groundwater consumption. However, subsidence centers have shifted to suburbs, especially along the coastline dominated by reclaimed harbors and aquaculture industry, with localized subsidence up to 170 mm/yr. Combining InSAR observations with sea level records from tide-gauge stations reveals spatial variability of RSLR along the coastline. We find that, in the aquaculture zones along the coastline, the rates of land subsidence are as high as 82 mm/yr due to groundwater extraction for fisheries, which subsequently cause local sea levels to rise nearly 30 times faster than the global average. New insights into land subsidence and local SLR could help the country's regulators to make decisions on ensuring the sustainable development of the coastal aquaculture industry.

TI  - The Assessment of Hydrologic- and Flood-Induced Land Deformation in Data-Sparse Regions Using GRACE/GRACE-FO Data Assimilation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical motion of the Earth's surface is dominated by the hydrologic cycle on a seasonal scale. Accurate land deformation measurements can provide constructive insight into the regional geophysical process. Although the Global Positioning System (GPS) delivers relatively accurate measurements, GPS networks are not uniformly distributed across the globe, posing a challenge to obtaining accurate deformation information in data-sparse regions, e.g., Central South-East Asia (CSEA). Model simulations and gravity data (from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO)) have been successfully used to improve the spatial coverage. While combining model estimates and GRACE/GRACE-FO data via the GRACE/GRACE-FO data assimilation (DA) framework can potentially improve the accuracy and resolution of deformation estimates, the approach has rarely been considered or investigated thus far. This study assesses the performance of vertical displacement estimates from GRACE/GRACE-FO, the PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) hydrology model, and the GRACE/GRACE-FO DA approach (assimilating GRACE/GRACE-FO into PCR-GLOBWB) in CSEA, where measurements from six GPS sites are available for validation. The results show that GRACE/GRACE-FO, PCR-GLOBWB, and GRACE/GRACE-FO DA accurately capture regional-scale hydrologic- and flood-induced vertical displacements, with the correlation value and RMS reduction relative to GPS measurements up to 0.89 and 53%, respectively. The analyses also confirm the GRACE/GRACE-FO DA's effectiveness in providing vertical displacement estimates consistent with GRACE/GRACE-FO data while maintaining high-spatial details of the PCR-GLOBWB model, highlighting the benefits of GRACE/GRACE-FO DA in data-sparse regions.

T2  - SCHOLE-FILOSOFSKOE ANTIKOVEDENIE I KLASSICHESKAYA TRADITSIYA-SCHOLE-ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the basic features of ancient Greek and ancient Jewish world outlook and analyzes their role in European history down to the 20th century. Attention is drawn to the fact that the fundamental difference of the ancient Greek worldview manifests itself in the absolute prevalence of spatial concepts, while time is understood by the model of "eternal return", the repetition of the same, rather than as a history that enriches man. In the center of the ancient Jewish worldview, on the contrary, is the idea of time as a historical process, which includes an endless dialogue between man and God, leading a person to maturity. Interpretations of the key Hebrew worldview concept of ha-olam as the Universe eternity and the Universe as duration are proposed and analyzed. The article shows that the idea inherited by Christian Europe from the ancient Greeks about the perfect arrangement of the Universe (Cosmos), conforming to the laws of nature, became the deepest reason for the domination of scientific rationality in modern civilization. At the same time the newest worldview tendencies connected with philosophy of life, intuitivism, existentialism, protecting the idea of irrational incomprehensibility of human life, can be recognized as originating from the Hebrew worldview. It was Henri Bergson who has clearly shown the opposite of these two trends within the European worldview. His concept of true time, understood as duration, memory and history, reveals striking coincidences with ancient Jewish conceptions of time and history. According to Bergson, duration is the essence of man and at the same time is the absolute being from which the Universe comes; this leads to radical anthropocentrism, which can be considered as a distant consequence of biblical anthropocentrism.

TI  - A New Drought Index for Soil Moisture Monitoring Based on MPDI-NDVI Trapezoid Space Using MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) has been commonly implemented to estimate regional soil moisture in arid and semi-arid regions. However, the parameterization of the dry edge in the TVDI model is performed with a constraint to define the maximum water stress conditions. Mismatch of the spatial scale between visible and thermal bands retrieved from remotely sensed data and terrain variations also affect the effectiveness of the TVDI. Therefore, this study proposed a new drought index named the condition vegetation drought index (CVDI) to monitor the temporal and spatial variations of soil moisture status by substituting the land surface temperature (LST) with the modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI). In situ soil moisture observations at crop and pasture sites in Victoria were used to validate the effectiveness of the CVDI. The results indicate that the dry and wet edges in the parameterization scheme of the CVDI formed a better-defined trapezoid shape than that of the TVDI. Compared with the MPDI and TVDI for soil moisture monitoring at crop sites, the CVDI exhibited a performance superior to the MPDI and TVDI in most days where the coefficients of determination (R-2) achieved can reach to 0.67 on DOY023, 137, 274 and 0.71 on DOY 322 and reproduced more accurate spatial and seasonal variation of soil moisture. Moreover, the CVDI showed higher correlation with the Australian Water Resource Assessment Landscape (AWRA-L) soil moisture product on temporal scales. The R-2 can reach to 0.69 and the root mean square error (RMSE) is also much better than that of the MPDI and TVDI. Overall, it can be concluded that the CVDI appears to be a feasible method and can be successfully used in regional soil moisture monitoring.

AB  - This paper presents the findings derived from the design, implementation, and use of a geovisual analytics platform to explore the use of spatiotemporal data to study the evolution of urban sprawl using remotely sensed data. The ambitious project within which this research was developed aimed at using optical imagery to analyze the evolution of distinct features on the surface of a rapidly urbanizing area in central Mexico. Remotely sensed data were properly processed using Google Earth Engine to estimate the time of urbanization and results are displayed in a platform developed using open source tools and software. Its main goal is to seamlessly integrate both the spatial and temporal components of data to be able to follow the evolution of distinct features through both space and time, while presenting useful visualizations to help the viewer have a more complete understanding of the context of this evolution. Results from this case study show that subpixel mapping of urban coverage is possible using optical imagery, that time of urbanization can be estimated, and that its coupling with geovisual analytics is useful in finding trends and patterns over space and time.

TI  - Intra-Annual Sentinel-2 Time-Series Supporting Grassland Habitat Discrimination
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to discriminate four semi-arid grassland habitats in a Mediterranean Natura 2000 site, Southern Italy, involving 6210/E1.263, 62A0/E1.55, 6220/E1.434 and X/E1.61-E1.C2-E1.C4 (according to Annex I of the European Habitat Directive/EUropean Nature Information System (EUNIS) taxonomies). For this purpose, an intra-annual time-series of 30 Sentinel-2 images, embedding phenology information, were investigated for 2018. The methodology adopted was based on a two-stage workflow employing a Support Vector Machine classifier. In the first stage only four Sentinel-2 multi-season images were analyzed, to provide an updated land cover map from where the grassland layer was extracted. The layer obtained was then used for masking the input features to the second stage. The latter stage discriminated the four grassland habitats by analyzing several input features configurations. These included multiple spectral indices selected from the time-series and the Digital Terrain Model. The results obtained from the different input configurations selected were compared to evaluate if the phenology information from time-series could improve grassland habitats discrimination. The highest F1 values (95.25% and 80.27%) were achieved for 6210/E1.263 and 6220/E1.434, respectively, whereas the results remained stable (97,33%) for 62A0/E1.55 and quite low (75,97%) for X/E1.61-E1.C2-E1.C4. However, since for all the four habitats analyzed no single configuration resulted effective, a Majority Vote algorithm was applied to achieve a reduction in classification uncertainty.

TI  - Everyday Life of the Middle Ages: Historiographical Aspects
T2  - STORINKY ISTORIYI-HISTORY PAGES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the article, the author checks the assumption that the history of everyday life as a scientific field plays an important role in the research of domestic medievalists. The level of the research of the history of medieval everyday life in Ukrainian historiography is clarified. According to the authors observations, historiography about the history of the daily life of the Ukrainian Middle Ages is analyzed for the first time.It has been found that historians have been interested in studying the every-day life of the Middle Ages since the 19th century. This kind of history was called tithe history of the populations. During the Soviet Union, the study of the history of the people was slowed down by the Marxist approach. The history of everyday life as an independent scientific field was formed in independent Ukraine due to the change of the scientific paradigm, and the effective use of foreign historiography. Medievalists explore the material, and the spiritual dimensions of the early, the high, and the late Middle Ages actively, using an interdisciplinary approach. Historical works about the history of daily life combine the study of the late Middle Ages and the early modern times. Ukrainian studies of the history of everyday life are similar to the British, the French, and the Italian versions. Modern researches are based on neo-positivism and postmodern approaches. Furthermore, in the paper, it has been found that the specifics of preserved sources affect the ability of the scientist to study one or another aspect of the daily life of different social groups. Ukrainian historians analyze the everyday life of burghers (including artisans), and monks, and less often peasants. Today there is no comprehensive work about the history of the medieval everyday life of Ukrainians. The publication of the history of Ukrainian everyday life will open perspectives for a deeper understanding of the preconditions, and the causes of political events and economic changes, the changes in worldview of society in the Middle Ages, which influenced the following historical epochs. In most cases, certain topics are reflected in some historical articles. The author has concluded that the assumption is correct, and the history of everyday life is a popular scientific field today.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to adopt a methodology for analysing spatial patterns of danger of forest fire at Margalla Hills, Islamabad, Pakistan. The work is concentrated on burnt areas using Landsat data and to classify forest fire severity with different parameters (climatic, vegetation, topography and human activities). In addition to these four variables, the extent of the burned areas was measured. Statistical analysis at each fire scene was used to measure the effect on the variables. To calculate the fire severity ratio correlated to each variable, logistic and stepwise regressions were used. The results showed that the burned areas have increased at a rate of 25.848 ha/day (R (2) = 0.98) if the number of total days since the start of fire has increased. As a result, forest density, distance to roads, average quarterly maximum temperature and average quarterly mean wind speed were highly correlated with the fire severity. Only average quarterly maximum temperature and forest density affected the size of the burnt areas. Prediction maps indicate that 53% of forests are in the very low severity level (0.25-0.45), 25% in the low level (0.45-0.65) and 22% in high and very high levels (>0.65).

TI  - Interannual measures of nutritional stress during a marine heatwave (the Blob) differ between two North Pacific seabird species.
T2  - Conservation Physiology
M3  - Article
AB  - 'The Blob', a mass of anomalously warm water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean peaking from 2014 to 2016, caused a decrease in primary productivity with cascading effects on the marine ecosystem. Among the more obvious manifestations of the event were seabird breeding failures and mass mortality events. Here, we used corticosterone in breast feathers (fCort), grown in the winter period during migration, as an indicator of nutritional stress to investigate the impact of the Blob on two sentinel Pacific auk species (family Alcidae). Feathers were collected from breeding females over 8 years from 2010 to 2017, encompassing the Blob period. Since Pacific auks replace body feathers at sea during the migratory period, measures of fCort provide an accumulated measure of nutritional stress or allostatic load during this time. Changes in diet were also measured using [delta]15N and [delta]13C values from feathers. Relative to years prior to the Blob, the primarily zooplanktivorous Cassin's auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) had elevated fCort in 2014-2017, which correlated with the occurrence of the Blob and a recovery period afterwards, with relatively stable feather isotope values. In contrast, generalist rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) displayed stable fCort values across years and increased [delta]15N values during the Blob. As marine heatwaves increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change, this study provides insight into the variable response of Pacific auks to such phenomena and suggests a means for monitoring population-level responses to climatological variation.

AB  - Recent breakthroughs in deep learning algorithms introduced the image super-resolution technique that maps the low-resolution image to generate a high-resolution image. These techniques increase various surveillance applications by providing finer spatial details than data from original sensors. Satellite images obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observation offer essential information about the earth's landscape, ocean, and ecosystem, contributing to monitoring various applications in the scientific field. The spatial resolution of satellite images has a significant impact on image accuracy. This paper focuses on improving image resolution by training a convolutional neural network to produce super-resolution images from low-resolution images. We present an implementation of Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN), a GAN-based approach that uses a perceptual loss function that includes an adversarial loss and a content loss. Using a discriminator network that is designed for discerning between super-resolved images and original photorealistic images, the adversarial loss drives the solution of this architecture to natural images. Moreover, the content loss is driven by perceptual similarity rather than pixel space similarity. We used this architecture to satellite images collected from NASA MODIS devices and found satisfactory results. Our key finding is that our system's result can now be used to improve a variety of low-resolution images.

AB  - The provision of Health Care Service Centres (HCSCs) is one of the biggest challenges in developing countries like India. Proper and equitable distribution and provision of health care services is a major challenge in a country like India especially when we talk about concept like 'Smart cities'. The primary objective of this study was to analyze the distribution of health care facilities in making smart cities: a case study of SE Delhi. We need to pay special attention to spatial arrangement of the health care services to make city a smart city in a country like India. The design of the study is such that satellite data together with population data has been modelled to see the spatial distribution of health care services in GIS domain. The availability of satellite data e.g. IKONOS, Quick-bird, Geo-Eye, World-View I and II and even Google Earth in combination with Geographical Information System (GIS) has made added advantage in this context. Health care data were taken from Google Maps and Google Earth, population data from Census of India-2011 and other sources. GIS is used to assess, examine and map the distribution of health care services. Therefore, in this paper, in the light of the above discussion we have tried to assess the spatial distribution of health care services, to relate it with population distribution and if HCSCs are sufficient and equitably distributed or not using spatial data in GIS domain in South-East District of national capital of India, Delhi. As a part of this study, we geocoded 197 health care centres in the 36 ward of SE Delhi. Study shows that healthcare service centres are maximum in the wards where total population, density of population, household density, no. of households, no. of beds are less and moderate, while maximum wards have low spaces to build the healthcare facilities. Density of population and healthcare facilities are less in commercial and industrial area. Hospitals have more than 300 beds such as Indraprastha Apollo are located nearby very dense populated area such as Okhla, Madanpurkhadar and Sarita Vihar and Batra Hospital & Medical Research Centre are located near Sangam Vihar, Badarpur and Jaipur. In order to make Delhi a Smart city, Governments and healthcare planners need to provide healthcare facilities in the wards where it is low or not available.

AB  - Carbon sequestration and water filtering are two examples of many ecosystem services provided by wetlands. Open water mapping is an effective means to measure any wetland extension as these can be comprised of several open water bodies. An economical, though indirect, approach towards mapping open water bodies is through applying geo-computational methods to satellite images. In this work we propose the flexible Beta regression (FBR) model to estimate open water fraction from measurements of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index B-6 (MNDWI6). We focus on observations derived from two MODIS images acquired during the dry season of 2008 in Marismas Nacionales, a wetland located in the north-western Pacific coast of Mexico. A Bayesian estimation procedure is presented to fit the FBR model; in particular, we provide details of a nested Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithm to carry out parameter estimation. Our results show that the FBR model produces valid estimates of water fraction unlike the standard model. Our work is complemented by software developed in the R language which is available through a GitHub repository.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide detection is concerned with delineating the extent of landslides. Most of existing works on landslide detection have limited geographical extents. Therefore, the models developed out of these studies might perform poorly when applied to regions with different characteristics. This study investigates an Object-Based Image Analysis methodology built on unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning to detect the location of landslides occurred in multiple regions across the world. The utilized data includes Sentinel-2 multi-spectral satellite imagery and ALOS Digital Elevation Model. In the segmentation stage, pre and post-landslide images undergo segmentation using K-means clustering. Following the segmentation stage and dataset preparation and removing highly-correlated features from the dataset, two Random Forest classifiers (RF1 and RF2) are trained and tested on two different datasets to measure the generalization level of the algorithms with RF1 dataset spanning over more geographical diversities than RF2 dataset. The results show that the RF models can successfully detect landslide segments with test precision = 0.96 and recall = 0.96 for RF1 and test precision = 0.90 and recall = 0.87 for RF2. Further validation shows that, compared to RF2, RF1 results in less mislabelled non-landslide segments.

AB  - Since creating labelled data in the field of remote sensing requires time and manpower, it has become important to use unlabelled data. In this paper we study a semi supervised long short term memory autocoder approach for crop classification with multi-temporal remote sensing data. In this study, a long short-term memory autoencoder network was trained with unlabelled data and the learned weights were used for the initialization of a model trained for classification with labelled data. The challenging Breizhcrops time series dataset, and multitemporal images of the Sakarya region were used for validation. It has been observed that the network trained with unlabelled data outperformed the network trained with only labelled data. The results shed light on the potential for unlabelled data use in the crop classification field.

TI  - Deriving CME Density From Remote Sensing Data and Comparison to In-Situ Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We determine the three-dimensional geometry and deprojected mass of 29 well-observed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their interplanetary counterparts (ICMEs) using combined Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory - Solar and Heliospheric Observatory white-light data. From the geometry parameters, we calculate the volume of the CME for the magnetic ejecta (flux-rope type geometry) and sheath structure (shell-like geometry resembling the (I)CME frontal rim). Working under the assumption that the CME mass is roughly equally distributed within a specific volume, we expand the CME self-similarly and calculate the CME density for distances close to the Sun (15-30 Rs) and at 1 AU. Specific trends are derived comparing calculated and in-situ measured proton densities at 1 AU, though large uncertainties are revealed due to the unknown mass and geometry evolution: (1) a moderate correlation for the magnetic structure having a mass that stays rather constant (cc approximate to 0.56 - 0.59), and (2) a weak correlation for the sheath density (cc approximate to 0.26) by assuming the sheath region is an extra mass-as expected for a mass pile-up process-that is in its amount comparable to the initial CME deprojected mass. High correlations are derived between in-situ measured sheath density and the solar wind density (cc approximate to -0.73) and solar wind speed (cc approximate to 0.56) as measured 24 h ahead of the arrival of the disturbance. This gives additional confirmation that the sheath-plasma indeed stems from piled-up solar wind material. While the CME interplanetary propagation speed is not related to the sheath density, the size of the CME may play some role in how much material could be piled up.

TI  - "Mythological" thinking and thinking of a child: crossing parallels
T2  - VOPROSY PSIKHOLOGII
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the similarity between the child's thinking and "mythological" thinking, a topic important for various subfields of psychology and social anthropology. The author considers the approaches of Jean Piaget and Heinz Wemer and outlines the special features of child's thinking according to their viewpoints. This research defines the features of the child's perception of the world that can explain animism, magic, and egocentrism of children's thinking and its physiognomic character. The author discusses in depth the differences between the concepts (or "pre concepts") of children's speech and the concepts that are the basis of "mythological" thinking. The conceptual apparatus is determined by the cultural practices and the range of tasks that need to be achieved, and those two are very special for each culture. In contrast to the thinking of a child, "mythological" thinking relies on a vast experience and a well -established complex worldview system. its conceptual apparatus focuses on the spheres of life that are most important for society. Although the systems of concepts in traditional cultures are polyvalent, they are not random and rather conventional. These systems are assimilated by all carriers of culture and passed from generation to generation.Children's preconceptions, however, are non-conventional. They reflect the child's fleeting impressions and experiences. Every child reinvents them. In ontogenesis, children's preconceptions are replaced by the concepts, that were established in child's native culture. The main strategies of child's Cognition are defined by the surrounding culture, which forms Certain expectations of the way the development should proceed. Following H.Werner, the author presents children's physiognomic, polymodal-synesthetic perception as an alterative to the rational "geometrical-technical" perception of the world. These features are the ones that bring together and slow the commonalities among the child's thinking, archaic 'mythological" thinking, and artistic perception of the world.This perspective on the similarities between "mythological", child's and the artistic thinking shifts the paradigm of unilinear evolution from "primitive" forms of thinking to 'progressive", scientific ones. Cognitive development should be viewed as a multilateral process, both in phyllo- and onto-genesis. And indeed, in any culture, people have a wide variety of cognitive strategies and abilities.

TI  - A New Algorithm for the Retrieval of Sun Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence of Water Bodies Exploiting the Detailed Spectral Shape of Water-Leaving Radiance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sun induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SICF) emitted by phytoplankton provides considerable insights into the vital role of the carbon productivity of the earth's aquatic ecosystems. However, the SICF signal leaving a water body is highly affected by the high spectral variability of its optically active constituents. To disentangle the SICF emission from the water-leaving radiance, a new high spectral resolution retrieval algorithm is presented, which significantly improves the fluorescence line height (FLH) method commonly used so far. The proposed algorithm retrieves the reflectance without SICF contribution by the extrapolation of the reflectance from the adjacent regions. Then, the SICF emission curve is obtained as the difference of the reflectance with SICF, the one actually obtained by any remote sensor (apparent reflectance), and the reflectance without SICF, the one estimated by the algorithm (true reflectance). The algorithm first normalizes the reflectance spectrum at 780 nm, following the similarity index approximation, to minimize the variability due to other optically active constituents different from chlorophyll. Then, the true reflectance is estimated empirically from the normalized reflectance at three wavelengths using a machine learning regression algorithm (MLRA) and a cubic spline fitting adjustment. Two large reflectance databases, representing a wide range of coastal and ocean water components and scattering conditions, were independently simulated with the radiative transfer model HydroLight and used for training and validation of the MLRA fitting strategy. The best results for the high spectral resolution SICF retrieval were obtained using support vector regression, with relative errors lower than 2% for the SICF peak value in 81% of the samples. This represents a significant improvement with respect to the classic FLH algorithm, applied for OLCI bands, for which the relative errors were higher than 40% in 59% of the samples.

AB  - Several raw materials for "green" energy production, such as high purity quartz, lithium, rare earth elements, beryllium, tantalum, and caesium, can be sourced from a rock type known as pegmatite. The GREENPEG project (https://www.greenpeg.eu/), started in May 2020, is developing and testing new and advanced exploration technologies and algorithms to be integrated and upscaled into flexible, ready-to-use economically efficient and sustainable methods for finding buried pegmatites and their "green" technology raw materials. One of the tasks of this project aims to apply different image processing techniques to different satellite images (Landsat, ASTER, and Sentinel-2) in order to automatically identify pegmatite bodies. In this work, we will present the preliminary results, regarding the application of machine learning algorithms (ML), more specifically, random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) to one of the study areas of the project in Tysfjord, northern Norway, to identify pegmatite bodies. To be able to determine the classes that would make up the study area, geological data of the region, such as lithological maps, aeromagnetic data, and high-resolution aerial photographs, were used to define the four classes (1. pegmatites, 2. water bodies, 3. vegetation, 4. granite). All training locations were randomly selected, with 25% of the samples split into testing, and the remaining 75% split for training. The SVM algorithm presented more promising results in relation to overfitting and final image classification than RF. Testing the algorithms with several variables of parameters was able to make the process more efficient.

AB  - The city of Yerevan, Armenia has undergone major environmental and economic changes after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The objectives of this study were to: (i) investigate the changes of the Land Cover (LC) and Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) in Yerevan and analyze relations between them, (ii) study the relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and environmental factors/parameters, (iii) explore the accuracy of satellite derived LST. LC and SUHI were derived from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI-TIRS images (years 1989, 2000, 2010 and 2018) by means of three Machine Learning algorithms and the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) ecological evaluation index, respectively. The comparison between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and satellite LSTs showed that the overall spatial pattern of Landsat and UAV LSTs matched. It was found that the green and built-up areas were the main factors affecting LST variation in Yerevan. The results of the LC change analysis revealed an expansion of built-up areas and the reduction of green spaces. Yerevan shares almost an equal percentage of land for the excellent and the worst categories of the UTFVI. The transformations from excellent to the worst category of UTFVI were mainly related to the loss of green spaces, while the opposite transformations were associated with the gain of vegetation cover, the construction of new districts and the reduction/cessation of anthropogenic heat emission. It appeared that the urban construction had possibly led to the improvement of UTFVI index in the case of no/low anthropogenic heat emission.

AB  - y The life and scientific activity of Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor L.N. Korneva is inextricably linked with two university centers in Western Siberia: the oldest university in Siberia, Tomsk University and Kemerovo University, where she has worked practically from the moment of its foundation. L.N. Korneva is rightfully considered one of the leading modern Russian Germanists, one of the founders and later chairman of the West Siberian Center for German Studies. The purpose of the article is to examine the scientific heritage of L.N. Korneva and to analyze her contribution as a German historian to the study of the problems of German National Socialism.The sources for this article were the works of L.N. Korneva.From the very beginning of L.N. Korneva's scientific activity, the focus of her attention was the German historiography of National Socialism. Her worldview and scientific views were formed at the turn of the ages. Having defended her Candidate of Science thesis in the Soviet era, L.N. Korneva wrote her doctoral dissertation and main works already in modern Russia. This allowed her to impartially examine the German historiography of National Socialism at different stages of its development and state. The author deduced the characteristic features of the German historiography of National Socialism, identified its main stages, analyzed the main problem areas, gave a comparative analysis of the West German and East German historiography of National Socialism, and showed its state in a united Germany.The main conclusion of L.N. Korneva about the place and role of German historiography in the study of National Socialism was that she had great services to science and society in the study of this problem. It would not be an exaggeration to say that in modern Russian historical Germanic studies L.N. Korneva was a leading specialist in the field of German historiography of National Socialism. However, L.N. Korneva's interest in the history of National Socialism was not limited only to historiographic subjects. She took an active part in writing, editing and publishing two textbooks dedicated to the history of Germany "History of Germany" (3 volumes) and "Social policy and welfare state in Germany". The chapters in textbooks devoted directly to the history of the Third Reich and the consequences of its collapse, written by her, contain a large amount of factual material, a balanced analysis of the history of Germany under the rule of the Nazis, and at the same time a negative assessment of the brown plague of the 20th century.Thus, the textbooks demonstrated a new feature of L.N. Korneva's scientific heritage. They revealed her capabilities as an empirical historian. L.N. Korneva's works were highly appreciated by her colleagues.

TI  - Combining machine learning, space-time cloud restoration and phenology for farm-level wheat yield prediction
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Though studies showed the potential of high-resolution optical sensors for crop yield prediction, several factors have limited their wider application. The main factors are obstruction of cloud, identification of phenology, demand for high computing infrastructure and the complexity of statistical methods. In this research, we created a novel approach by combining four methods. First, we implemented the cloud restoration algorithm called gapfill to restore missed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from Sentinel-2 sensor (S2) due to cloud obstruction. Second, we created square tiles as a solution for high computing infrastructure demand due to the use of high-resolution sensor. Third, we implemented gapfill following critical crop phenology stage. Fourth, observations from restored images combined with original (from cloud-free images) values and applied for winter wheat prediction. We applied seven base machine learning as well as two groups of super learning ensembles. The study successfully applied gapfill on high-resolution image toget good quality estimates for cloudy pixels. Consequently, yield prediction accuracy increased due to the incorporation of restored values in the regression process. Base models such as Generalized Linear Regression (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) showed improved capacity compared to other base and ensemble models. The two models revealed RMSE of 0.001 t/ha and 0.136 t/ha on the holdout group. The two models also revealed consistent and better performance using scatter plot analysis across three datasets. The approach developed is useful to predict wheat yield at field scale, which is a rarely available but vital in many developmental projects, using optical sensors.& COPY; 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Feature Sets for Delineating Agricultural Fields in Heterogeneous Landscapes
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring Initiative (GEOGLAM) considers agricultural fields as one of the essential variables that can be derived from satellite data. We evaluated the accuracy at which agricultural fields can be delineated from Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) images in different agricultural landscapes throughout the growing season. We used supervised segmentation based on the multiresolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm to first identify the optimal feature set from S1 and S2 images for field delineation. Based on this optimal feature set, we analyzed the segmentation accuracy of the fields delineated with increasing data availability between March and October of 2018. From the S1 feature sets, the combination of the two polarizations and two radar indices attained the best segmentation results. For S2, the best results were achieved using a combination of all bands (coastal aerosol, water vapor, and cirrus bands were excluded) and six spectral indices. Combining the radar and spectral indices further improved the results. Compared to the single-period dataset in March, using the dataset covering the whole season led to a significant increase in the segmentation accuracy. For very small fields (< 0.5 ha), the segmentation accuracy obtained was 27.02%, for small fields (0.5 - 1.5 ha), the accuracy was 57.65%, for medium fields (1.5 ha - 15 ha), the accuracy was 75.71%, and for large fields (>15 ha), the accuracy stood at 68.31%. As a use case, the segmentation result was used to aggregate and improve a pixel-based crop type map in Lower Saxony, Germany.

AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes may lead to vulnerable land resource and imbalanced ecosystem. This paper aimed to identify the change of LULC in the center of the Ba river basin. As well, the risk of land use change (LUC) was assessed based on remote sensing data and Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine the areas where LULC can modify with varying degrees. The LULC and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data processed from Landsat images on Google Earth Engine platform were overlayed to create a zoning map of LUC risk levels in dry season of 2010 and 2020. Over 10 years, the largest increased area was bare land with a growth of 4.98%; whereas the most reduced area was shrub with a decrease of 4.21%. Forest area accounted for the highest proportion of the whole area. LULC classes and NDVI values were assigned different risk weightages to produce the risk distribution map of LUC levels and susceptible areas. The results revealed the most risk zones (High and Very high) constituted more than 50% and stayed steadily from 2010 to 2020, in which shrub areas were partially transformed to bare land or agricultural land due to economic development.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF SHORELINE POSITIONAL UNCERTAINTY USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TECHNIQUES: A CASE STUDY FROM THE EAST COAST OF INDIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE JOVAN CVIJIC SASA
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this research was to assess the shoreline changes by comparing the satellite data from 1980 to 2020. The study area falls in the region between Kodiakarai and Nagapattinam of the east coast of India, which has frequently been distressed by storm surges and cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) detects and measures the erosional and accretional shoreline positions through the statistics of the Shoreline Change Envelope, Net Shoreline Movement, End Point Rate, Linear Regression Rate, and Weighted Linear Regression. The results show that the shoreline from Kodiakkarai to Nagapattinam suffered severe erosion of 17.7% in total with an average annual erosion rate of 3.4 m/year from 1980 to 2020 and the rate of erosion ranged between 0.1 m/year to 19.8 m/year. About 90.5% of the total shoreline was faced high erosion during the period between 2000 and 2010. The maximum erosion was about 1061 m from 2000 to 2010, the maximum accretion was found to be 1002 m in transects at Kodiakkarai during 2010 to 2020. After the effect of 2004 tsunami, the corresponding changes in littoral currents caused the drastic erosion and accretion in this shoreline. The DSAS prediction model shows that 19.3% of the current shoreline will erode in 2030. The maximum predicted erosion is 406 m at Kodiakkarai and the maximum predicted accretion is 148 m at Nagapattinam region. The coastal zone from Kodiakkarai to Nagapattinam needs special attention to prevent the erosion and it is recommended to build suitable coastal protection structures along the coast for sustainable development and to execute the coastal zone management for this region.

TI  - CV4FEE: Flood Extent Estimation Using Consensus Voting in Ensemble of Methods for Change Detection in Sentinel-1 GRD SAR Images

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - There are several methods for finding flooded areas using change detection from C-band Sentinel-1 temporal GRDH Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Using these methods, an automatic flood extent mapping is obtained through differences between multiple time instances of SAR images, which itself is processed to remove noise and isolated pixels. While a few selected methods give comparable results using similar approaches, it is difficult to determine the best result amongst them. Hence, we propose CV4FEE, which is a consensus voting (CV) of outcomes from an ensemble of flood extent estimation (FEE) methods. We select three different state-of-the-art FEE methods, based on a specific criterion. We then use different consensus voting functions to compute deterministic as well as probabilistic flood extent maps, thus accounting for uncertainty in computation in selected methods. We demonstrate our results of flood area estimation in two different flooding events in India, namely the Hyderabad flood and the Nivar cyclone, in 2020. We show that the probabilistic maps give flood extent estimation that confirms the GEE4FLOOD results, qualitatively. Our method successfully demonstrates the uncertainty in the estimation process.

AB  - Plastics in the marine environment constitute a significant problem globally. It is estimated that almost 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the oceanic ecosystem every year. A high concentration of plastics is found within the Mediterranean Sea, which is approximately 22,000 tonnes. Indeed, the South-East Mediterranean, where Cyprus is located, faces a significant problem with plastic debris. Aquaculture fisheries can contribute to marine debris, especially as a result of storm damage or accidents, as their plastic rings float in the ocean and end up in the coastline. Remote sensing techniques can be used to monitor fisheries and plastic debris in marine settings. More recently, research has focused on the ability to detect plastic litter in the water using remote sensing techniques. This paper examines how temporal series Sentinel-2 satellite images can be used to detect the plastic rings from aquaculture fisheries in the Vassiliko area in the south coast of Cyprus. This detection methodology can be used to manage and monitor fisheries using Sentinel-2 images.

AB  - This study will document the abandoned Carmelite monastery located in Polemidia, Limassol District, Cyprus. The monastery was abandoned in 1570 and recently restored by the Greek Orthodox Church, with the name of Panagia Karmiotissa. The church of Panagia Karmiotissa is the only preserved Gothic church in the Limassol area during the time of the Frankish House of Lusignan in Cyprus. To the north area of the church there is a spring, where legend states that a holy shrine of the Virgin Mary springs miraculously. In between the Church and the spring, the rubble of a separate construct is visible, which may possibly be the monk residence halls. From the end of the 12th century to the 19th century, little is known about the site. This study investigates and documents both the church and the surrounding area, using remote sensing data, aerial images and ground penetrating radar. This investigation using remote sensing techniques is an effort to uncover and understand the history of the site.

The method is applied to the Sentinel2-MSI sensor and validated by a Monte Carlo technique. The resulting surface reflectance uncertainties can again be propagated to subsequent treatment processes such as the inversion of the radiative transfer model in the water column.

TI  - Mapping thins to identify active forest management in southern pine plantations using Landsat time series stacks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern United States is unique in terms of both the intensity and scale of forest management, which includes substantial thinning and other forms of harvesting. Because thinning is not a land use transition, and the disturbance signal is relatively subtle compared to a clear cut, there is a dearth of studies that attempt to detect thinning over large areas. Our goal was to detect pine thins as an indicator of active forest management using Landsat data. Areas which undergo thinning are indicative of active forest management in the region.Our approach uses a machine learning method which combines first-order harmonics and metrics from 3-year Fourier regression of Landsat time series stacks, layers from the Global Forest Change product, and other vetted national products into a random forests model to classify forest thins in the southeastern US. Forest Harvest Inspection Records for Virginia were used for training and validation. Models were successful separating thins from clear cuts and non-harvested pines (overall accuracy 86%, clear cut accuracy 90%, thin accuracy 83% for a simplified 10-predictor variable model).Examination of variable importance illustrates the physical meaning behind the models. The curve fit statistics (R-2 or RMSE) of the NDVI, Pan, and SWIR1 harmonic curve fits, which are an indication of a departure from typical vegetation phenology caused by thinning or other disturbances, were consistently among the top predictors. The harmonic regression constant, sine and cosine from the Landsat 8 panchromatic band were also important. These describe the visible reflectance (500-680 nm) phenology over the time period at a high spatial resolution (15 m). The Loss Year from the Global Forest Change product, which is an indication of stand replacing disturbance, was also consistently among the most important variables in the classifiers.High performance computing, such as Google Earth Engine, and analysis-ready data are important for this approach. This work has importance for quantification of actively managed forests in a region of the world where production forestry is the dominant land disturbance signal and a significant economic engine.

TI  - Uncertainty in Observational Estimates of the Aerosol Direct Radiative Effect and Forcing
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - A lower bound on the uncertainty in observational estimates of the aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE; the direct interaction with solar radiation by all aerosols) and the aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF; the radiative effect of just anthropogenic aerosols (RFari)] is quantified by making the optimistic assumption that global aerosol observations can be made with the accuracy found in the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometer retrievals. The globalmean all-sky aerosol DRE uncertainty was found to be 1.1 W m(-2) (one standard deviation). The global-mean all-sky aerosol DRF (RFari) uncertainty was determined to be 0.31 W m(-2). The total uncertainty in both quantities is dominated by contributions from the aerosol single scattering albedo uncertainty. These uncertainty estimates were compared to a literature survey of mostly satellite-based aerosol DRE/DRF values. Comparisons to previous studies reveal that most have significantly underestimated the aerosol DRE uncertainty. Past estimates of the aerosol DRF uncertainty are smaller (on average) than our optimistic observational estimates, including the aerosol DRF uncertainty given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). This disconnect between our observation-based uncertainty and that found in past aerosol DRF studies that rely, at least in part, on modeling is discussed. Also quantified is a potential reduction in the current observational uncertainty possible with a future generation of satellite observations that would leverage aerosol typing and more refined vertical information.

AB  - Satellites have different revisit frequencies (i.e., temporal resolutions), ranging from daily to monthly. The satellite revisit frequencies suitable for accurately monitoring the phenology of deciduous broad-leaved forests (DBF) are not well-known. To fill this knowledge gap, this study used MODIS Daily Nadir BRDF-Adjusted images to simulate EVI time series with a wide range of temporal resolutions from daily to 52 days, to investigate the impacts of satellite revisit frequency on monitoring spatial and temporal patterns of spring phenology, i.e., the start of season (SOS), of DBF in North America. Then, these EVI time series were used to extract SOS by two common phenology extraction methods (i.e., relative threshold and curvature methods). Our results reveal that 1) low temporal resolutions cannot accurately reconstruct real vegetation growth profile, which generally causes a false early SOS detection, 2) the impact of temporal resolutions is nonlinear. The accuracy of SOS detection from data with relatively high frequencies (e.g., 7 days) is only slightly lower than that from daily time series but the accuracy decreases largely with low frequencies, and 3) validation with ground observations from PhenoCam Network stations and an experiment using three real satellite datasets (i.e., MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2) confirm the findings from our simulation study. This study suggests that satellites with medium temporal resolutions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8, could extract reliable phenology metrics in non-cloudy regions.

TI  - Investigating ESA Sentinel-2 products' systematic cloud cover overestimation in very high altitude areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection in optical remote sensing imagery is crucial because undetected clouds can produce misleading results in analyses. Almost all optical remote sensing data access portals rely to some degree on a cloud cover filter. Here we show that cirrus as well as opaque cloud cover in Sentinel-2 Level-1C (L1C) and Level-2A (L2A) imagery is systematically and significantly overestimated in very high altitude areas (e.g. Himalayas, Andes). We argue that this systematic bias is created by applying simple thresholds to single bands instead of using a multi band spectral signature in the cloud detection process. This results in a lot of "hidden" data for very high altitude areas when each image's estimated cloud cover is used as an automated selection criterion for analysis (e.g. global analyses, cloud-free mosaic production). We show geographic locations exemplifying this overestimation, and compare the L1C and L2A cloud masks produced by ESA to cloud masks generated by an expert system that uses comprehensive spectral signatures, showing that reliable cloud estimations are possible in very high altitudes. Based on this comparison, we argue for changes to L1C and L2A cloud detection algorithms in order to improve initial querying and selection of big EO data, where reliable yet automated quality indicators are necessary to handle an overwhelming data volume and velocity. Our contribution raises awareness of potential bias when pre-selecting images based on reported cloud cover in very high altitude areas for researchers and users of Sentinel-2 imagery in the environmental domain.

AB  - This dataset contains information about the spatial dynamics of flooded settlements in the Dosso Region, in Niger. The data was collected by means of photo-interpretation of very high-resolution satellite images available on Google Earth. Settlements were chosen according to Niger's national database on flooding, known by the French acronym, BDINA.The zip archive contains built-up areas of each settlement at three different dates, for a total of 348 files stored in .kmz format.The word document contains two tables describing all settlements information regarding the built-up areas, the years of reference, and the roof composition of the building assets.The figures show a synthesis of the data collected:-Fig. 1 shows the location of the 124 human settlements inundated between 2011 and 2019;-Fig. 2 shows the dates on which the high-resolution images of the 124 settlements are freely available on Google Earth;-Fig. 3 shows a comparison between the built-up area that can be defined with Google Earth and the built-up area of the global settlement dataset based on Landsat data (HBASE);-Figs. 4 and 5 show the built-up area on the three dates for the city of Gaya, the rural town of Tanda, the village of Bouma Manzo, and the hamlet of Kofo.The method used for the data collection is replicable in other contexts and can be used to identify the most rapidly expanding settlements, the extent of the built-up area under the risk of flooding, and to verify the accuracy of the built-up area obtained from coarse satellite images.The data presented can be used for future insights and researches on the region.

M3  - Article
AB  - The process of the formation of a plume of NO2 emitted into the atmosphere by a point source is considered. A new technique is suggested for retrieving NO2 distribution fields in the troposphere from GSA Resource-P satellite data with the use of mathematical simulation. The functional form of the model is determined, which agrees in complexity with the amount of available experimental information; the values of the model parameters are found. The emission power is calculated. The reliability of the simulation results is estimated from the comparison of the calculations with the experimental distribution of the altitude-integratal amount of NO2 in air depending on the horizontal coordinates.

TI  - p Disease X: Exploring the Unexplored, Knowable Unknown
T2  - Journal of Communicable Diseases
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaring uncertainty regarding the identity of certain pathogenic bio-agents having potential for a severe global public health security threat has spurned the international health agencies to classify it as Disease X, which has been added to the "blueprint priority diseases" as a placeholder name for a "knowable unknown" pathogen by the WHO. The zoonotic diseases of viral origin and the synthetic viruses are acknowledged as the most likely agents of Disease X causing public health emergencies of international concern in times to come. The challenges in the rapid containment of Disease X pandemics could be the inability for early detection of the infectious agents, presence of a large immunologically naive population, lack of knowledge of clinical spectrum, no pathogen-specific effective drugs and/ or vaccines and sudden surge of patients requiring hospitalisation which collectively compromise the public health system especially in resource stricken countries and leads to its eventual collapse. Well-equipped field laboratories, sentinel surveillance centres for viruses and other microbial pathogens are needed in strategically important and sensitive areas of concern for monitoring for early detection of possible bio-agents of Disease X, if any. In a changing geo-socio political scenario, use of the synthetic viruses as a potential bio-weapon for mass destruction and/ or for the economic breakdown of a targeted country should not be ruled out. Thus, capacity building, global technical collaboration and stringent international regulations to prevent the development of bio-weapons are also obligatory to prevent any possible future pandemics of Disease X.

TI  - Non-Linear Modeling of Detectability of Ship Wake Components in Dependency to Influencing Parameters Using Spaceborne X-Band SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of the wakes of moving ships in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery requires the presence of wake signatures, which are sufficiently distinctive from the ocean background. Various wake components exist, which constitute the SAR signatures of ship wakes. For successful wake detection, the contrast between the detectable wake components and the background is crucial. The detectability of those wake components is affected by a number of parameters, which represent the image acquisition settings, environmental conditions or ship properties including voyage information. In this study the dependency of the detectability of individual wake components to these parameters is characterized. For each wake component a detectability model is built, which takes the influence of incidence angle, polarization, wind speed, wind direction, sea state (significant wave height, wavelength, wave direction), vessel's velocity, vessel's course over ground and vessel's length into account. The presented detectability models are based on regression or classification using Support Vector Machines and a dataset of manually labelled TerraSAR-X wake samples. The considered wake components are: near-hull turbulences, turbulent wakes, Kelvin wake arms, Kelvin wake's transverse waves, Kelvin wake's divergent waves, V-narrow wakes and ship-generated internal waves. The statements derived about wake component detectability are mainly in good agreement with statements from previous research, but also some new assumptions are provided. The most expressive influencing parameter is the movement velocity of the vessels, as all wake components are more detectable the faster vessels move.

AB  - The research is aimed at the development of original methods of obtaining new information for the study of surface waves in marine conditions. The paper discusses a method for measuring the short-wave part of the wave spectrum (wavelengths in the range from about 50 cm to 2 cm in 6 intervals) in marine conditions. The information obtained will make it possible to study the interaction of wind with the short-wave component of the wave spectrum and will be in demand by scientists engaged in numerical modeling of the global wave climate and interested in refining the model of the interaction of the surface wind with waves. In addition, this will improve the accuracy of retrieving the surface wind speed from remote sensing data. In this paper, a theoretical study of the algorithm for retrieving the slope variance from the shape of the reflected pulse is carried out. The multifrequency underwater acoustic wave gauge will measure the slope variance at the selected surface wave frequency intervals, which will allow us to consider their correlation with the wind speed. A new approach to retrieving the height spectrum of the short-wave part has been developed, using measurements in several frequency intervals.

AB  - The article is devoted to the preservation of survival (vitality) of the Russian language through the prism of translational literature, which is created by ethnically non-Russian authors. The author of the article is trying to prove that the survival of the Russian language depends not only on territorial and demographic factors, but also on translingual (Russian-language literature). In the fiction of Russian-speaking authors, the Russian language is a translator of a worldview that is not inherent in native speakers of the Russian language and culture.

TI  - Adjuvant S-1 plus endocrine therapy for oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative, primary breast cancer: a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Oral fluoropyrimidines, such as S-1, have been shown to have a role in controlling disease progression in metastatic breast cancer. We examined adjuvant treatment with S-1 in patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive and HER2-negative primary breast cancer.Methods We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial in 139 sites (137 hospitals and two clinics). Eligible patients were women aged 20-75 years with histologically diagnosed stage I to IIIB invasive breast cancer (intermediate to high risk of recurrence). Patients were temporarily registered at participating institutions and biopsy or surgical samples were collected and sent for central pathological assessment. Patients received 5 years of standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (selective oestrogen receptor modulators with or without ovarian suppression and aromatase inhibitors) with or without 1 year of S-1. Oral S-1 80-120 mg/day was administered twice a day for 14 days with 7 days off. Randomisation (1:1) using the minimisation method was done with six stratification factors (age, axillary lymph node metastasis at surgery or sentinel lymph node biopsy, preoperative or postoperative (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) chemotherapy, preoperative endocrine therapy, proportion of ER-positive cells, and study site). The primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival, in the full analysis set (all randomly assigned patients, excluding those with significant protocol deviations). The safety analysis set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Here, we report the results from the interim analysis at the data cutoff date Jan 31, 2019. This trial is registered with Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, jRCTs051180057, and the University hospital Medical Information Network, UMIN000003969.Findings Between Feb 1, 2012, and Feb 1, 2016,1930 patients were enrolled in the full analysis set, 957 (50%) received endocrine therapy plus S-1 and 973 (50%) received endocrine therapy alone. Median follow-up was 52.2 months (IQR 42.1-58.9). 155 (16%) patients in the endocrine therapy alone group and in 101 (11%) patients in the endocrine therapy plus S-1 group had invasive disease-free survival events (hazard ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.494.81, p=0.0003). As the primary endpoint was met at interim analysis, the trial was terminated early. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (72 [8%] of 954 patients in the endocrine therapy plus S-1 group vs seven 11%1 of 970 patients in the endocrine therapy alone group), diarrhoea (18 [2%] vs none ), decreased white blood cells (15 [2%] vs two [<1%]), and fatigue (six [<1%] vs none). Serious adverse events were reported in nine (1%) of 970 patients in the endocrine therapy alone group and 25 (3%) of 954 patients in the endocrine therapy plus S-1 group. There was one (<1%) possible treatment-related death in the endocrine therapy plus S-1 group due to suspected pulmonary artery thrombosis.Interpretation These data suggest that this combination of S-1 with endocrine therapy could be a potential treatment option for this intermediate and high-risk group of patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative primary breast cancer.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF RESTORATION DYNAMICS OF BURNT FOREST AREA VEGETATION USING LANDSAT SATELLITE DATA
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Relevance. Up to 400 thousand forest fires that occur annually on Earth lead to the release of up to four billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere and the burning of up to 0.5 % of the forest area. Forest fires destroy wood resources, reduce the efficiency of their use, and cause enormous damage to the economy. Operational and objective information about their consequences is in demand for solving a set of theoretical and practical problems in the field of land management, cadastre and monitoring of forest lands, as well as for scientific justification of the use, restoration, conservation and protection of forests.Object: forest lands that exposed to fires.Subject: post-pyrogenic dynamics of vegetation cover on the example of forest harems of the Tomsk region.Methods: thematic mapping of the territory according to the state of vegetation; estimation of the amount of photosynthetically active bio-mass NDVI (Normalize Difference Vegetation Index) and normalized burn index NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) according to remote sensing data; use of satellite images from the archive of the US Geological Survey and the Internet service Earth Explorer 1999-2017; analysis of information from Landsat satellites 5 (camera TM), 7 (ETM+) and 8 (OLI) using geoinformation technologies and statistical processing of the received data.Results. The authors have assessed the vegetation state of the burnt forest areas in comparison with the background forest area of similar breed composition (46 %- Siberian Pine, 36 %- Hanging birch, 11 %- Common Aspen, 7 %- Common Pine and Siberian Larch). The disturbance of the vegetation of the studied burnt forest areas is characterized as low. The study uses Landsat satellite images acquired in the period from 1998 to 2016 and obtained from the archives of the US Geological Survey. The NDVI and NBR were calculated for the burnt forest areas and background areas. Sharp differences in their values and anomalous course of annual dynamics for burnt forest area are revealed. The NDVI values for the burnt forest areas and the background area differed by 3-56 %, and the NBR values by 20-198 %. The differences persisted 17 years after the fire. The correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between the values of the NBR and NDVI of the burnt forest areas and the average values of air temperature and precipitation in the fire season. It turned out to be negative medium and weak strength for May; strong and medium for July and weak for August. Precipitation is associated with the values of the NBR and NDVI of the burnt forest areas with an average strength: negative in May and June, positive in August. This indicates sufficient moisture of the ecotopes at the beginning of the growing season, subsequent drying of the soil, optimal for the vital activity of trees, and its desiccation, which determines the possibility of forest fires. There is a clear territorial variability of the NDVI and NBR values within the burnt forest area boundaries.

AB  - Modern technologies are often used in agriculture, which allow increasing yields while minimising production costs. Many tools are created to support farmers' activities in the so-called precision agriculture consisting of adapting agrotechnical operations to changing conditions in different areas of the cultivated field. For field yield variability mapping and other precision agricultural applications is used high-resolution satellite imagery. This paper presents the possibility of monitoring the areas of crops specified by the user and informing about the hazards that appear thereby detecting areas showing vegetation degradation based on a series of satellite spectral and radar data recorded at specific points in time. This paper presents an example of the application of imaging performed by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites as well as advanced imaging techniques and digital image processing for precision farming. The possibility of using satellite images to calculate indices NDVI and RVI4S1 that determine changes in vegetation in the study area was presented. Combined analysis of changes in these indicators in the analysed period may be performed to support the decision-making process and perform actions adequate to the identified situation. The research presented in this paper is conducted to determine the possibility of using combined, satellite spectral and radar data (so-called hybrid set) to detect areas of vegetative degradation in crops in the absence of an element of the spectral data series.

TI  - Backscatter Characteristics of Snow Avalanches for Mapping With Local Resolution Weighting
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow avalanches cause a sudden change of snow properties making them detectable with synthetic aperture radar (SAR). However, steep alpine terrain combined with the slant view geometry of SAR sensors complicates detection: the avalanche brightness depends on the incidence angle and the observed area is limited by radar layover and shadow. Likewise, the spatial resolution varies strongly with the local incidence angle relative to the terrain. To increase the avalanche brightness and to improve the imaging coverage and resolution we apply local resolution weighting (LRW) on Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter images from ascending and descending orbits. LRW merges acquisitions by averaging them, weighted with the local ground-range resolution. To analyze the relative avalanche brightness with respect to the local incidence angle and polarization, and to quantify the benefit of LRW, we created a dataset of 914 manually drawn avalanche outlines based on S1 imagery of an extreme avalanche event on January 4, 2018 in the Swiss Alps. We show that avalanches appear brightest at slopes facing away from the radar at local incidence angles of 55 +/- 20 degrees; such slopes are weighted considerably stronger through LRW. With a processing pipeline for avalanche segmentation using a fixed threshold on the backscatter difference we obtain a higher F1 score (0.75) with LRW compared to an unweighted orbit average (F1 = 0.68) or single orbit acquisitions (F1 = 0.5). For automatic segmentation, we used the manually drawn dataset for training and testing of a deep neural U-Net and achieved a F1 score of 0.81 on LRW backscatter differences.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the capability of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to detect hydrothermal alteration zones within the caldera of the Nisyros volcano in Greece through a multitemporal interferometric coherence analysis. For that purpose, seven ascending pass Sentinel-1B SAR Single Look Complex images were collected spanning October 2017 to January 2018. The local meteorological conditions, precipitation in particular, were taken into consideration as the humidity levels could affect the radar scattering properties. Six coherence images were calculated using as master image the 16th October 2017 acquisition and as slave images the other dates. The coherence products were then used for a multitemporal interferometric coherence analysis through the calculation of the average coherence map. The average coherence map showed that Sentinel-1 data seems to well delimitate the hydrothermal alteration area according to the geologic map of Nisyros. Comparing the hydrothermal alteration with the loose alluvial deposits within the caldera, the hydrothermal altered products showed high coherence values while the loose alluvial products low coherence values. The preliminary results show the potential of Sentinel-1 multitemporal interferometric coherence to differentiate hydrothermal alteration from volatile loose formations such as alluvial deposits.

TI  - Spatial Gap-Filling of SMAP Soil Moisture Pixels Over Tibetan Plateau via Machine Learning Versus Geostatistics
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in ecology, environment, agriculture, and hydrology. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite provides global SM products with reliable accuracy since 2015. However, significant gaps of SMAP SM appeared over Tibetan Plateau. Considering the important role of the Tibetan Plateau in global climate and environment, it is essential to develop methods to infill the gaps to generate seamless SMAP SM data. To address this issue, we proposed two methods, machine learning and geostatistics technique. For the machine learning technique, we train a Random Forest algorithm which aims to match the output of available SMAP L3 SM using a series of input variables such as SMAP brightness temperature (TBH and TBV) in ascending orbits (6:00 PM local time), surface temperature, MODIS NDVI, land cover, DEM, and other auxiliary data. Then, the established RF estimators were applied to the SMAP brightness temperature from descending orbits (6:00 AM local time) to reconstruct complete SM data over the Tibetan Plateau. For the geostatistics technique, the Ordinary kriging was applied to the available SMAP L3 SM pixels to interpolate complete SM data. To cross-validate the performances of the algorithms, we assume certain areas with available SMAP SM values as missing, and then compared the gap-filling results with the actual ones. The cross-validations show that the gap-filling results from two algorithms were highly correlated to the official SMAP SM products with high coefficients of determination (R-RF(2) = 0.97 and R-OK(2) = 0.85) and low RMSE (RMSERF = 0.015 cm(3)/cm(3) and RMSEOK = 0.036 cm(3)/cm(3)). Furthermore, the gap-filling SM data present a better correlation with the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity SM data (R = 0.55-0.7) than the Global Land Data Assimilation System simulations (R = 0.18-0.62). The reconstructed SM from RF (R = 0.71) and OK (R = 0.55) algorithms are well related to the Maqu network measurements. Thus, the machine learning and geostatistics algorithms have the potential to reproduce the missing SMAP SM products over the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Mapping Microscale PM2.5 Distribution on Walkable Roads in a High-Density City
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring pollution of PM2.5 on walkable roads is important for resident health in high-density cities. Due to the spatiotemporal resolution limitations of aerosol optical depth observation, fixed-point monitoring, or traditional mobile measurement instruments, the microscale PM2.5 distribution in the walking environment cannot be fully estimated at the fine scale. In this article, by the integration of mobile measurement data, OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, Landsat images, and other multisource data in land-use regression (LUR) models, a novel framework is proposed to estimate and map PM2.5 distribution in a typical microscale walkable environment of the high-density city Hong Kong. First, the PM2.5 data on the typical walking paths were collected by the handheld mobile measuring instruments, to be selected as the dependent variables. Second, geographic prediction factors calculated by Google Street View, OSM data, Landsat images, and other multisource data were further selected as independent variables. Then, these dependent and independent variables were put into the LUR models to estimate the PM2.5 concentration on sidewalks, footbridges, and footpaths in the microscale walkable environment. The proposed models showed high performance relative to those in similar studies (adj R-2, 0.593 to 0.615 [sidewalks]; 0.641 to 0.682 [footpaths]; 0.783 to 0.797 [footbridges]). This article is beneficial for mapping PM2.5 concentration in the microscale walking environment and the identification of hot spots of air pollution, thereby helping people avoid the PM2.5 hotspots and indicating a healthier walking path.

TI  - Delineation of Individual Tree Crowns Using High Spatial Resolution Multispectral WorldView-3 Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineation of individual tree crowns can provide valuable information for sustainable forest management and environmental protection. However, it is hard to find a reliable tree crown delineation method that can continually generate expected results in high spatial resolution multispectral satellite images, because most of the existing methods need user-assigned parameters that greatly affect the quality of the delineation results. In this article, we propose a method based on the marker-controlled watershed segmentation to delineate individual tree crowns using high spatial resolution multispectral WorldView-3 satellite imagery. A gradient binarization process is proposed to accurately locate tree crown borders. The threshold for the binarization is determined by a supervised searching process. Markers used in marker-controlled watershed segmentation are spatial local maxima detected from the information provided by tree crown borders. Moreover, the definition of spatial local maxima from the literature is improved to eliminate false treetops. To validate the performance of the proposed delineation method, delineation results are compared with those obtained from the spectral angle segmentation (SAS) method that has been proposed in literature because the quality of delineation results generated by SAS does not rely on user-assigned parameters. The experiment results in two test images demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms SAS in terms of both delineation accuracy and visual quality of the delineation map. Moreover, it is proved that the modified spatial local maxima are more reliable for detecting treetops.

TI  - WAS THE GEOPOLITICAL CATASTROPHE OF THE USSR MAN-MADE?
T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes causes, conditions and factors of the 1991 events, which became the starting point for the collapse of the USSR, liquidation of the first socialist state and rejected the possibility to realize socialism and communism ideas. Various attempts are analyzed from different worldview and ideological positions to explain the course that returned Russia to the capitalist path of development. Challenging and rejecting many of these explanations, created under the influence of both purposeful and speculative reasoning and spontaneous conscientious delusions, the article focuses on the absence in most publications and political statements of an analysis of such key factors as ignoring the will of the people and scholarly conclusions and recommendations that focused on rational, balanced and reasonable means and methods of overcoming the crisis -ridden state of society. A significant place is given to the subjective factor - poverty of imagination, limited vision, primitive thought of those ruling the country who failed to offer a scientifically grounded development strategy. As a result, the country evolved in the framework neither of a revolutionary, nor an evolutionary path, but embarked on a turbulent, chaotic and contradictory path of development leading to what the author calls society of trauma. In conclusion, it is stated that the geopolitical catastrophe was largely man-made, caused by subjective factors that played a decisive role in the destruction of the great country. These conclusions are based on the results of 1985-1991 all-Union studies of social consciousness carried out by sociologists of the Academy of Social Sciences under the Central Committee of the CPSU.

TI  - Vulnerabilities Manager, a platform for linking vulnerability data sources
T2  - 2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In order to get a deeper understanding of security breaches, their severity, impact and ways to mitigate them, many vulnerability databases and dictionaries have been developed. However, all that information on vulnerabilities is scattered all over the web, which makes locating and mitigating vulnerabilities an arduous task. This paper introduces the Vulnerabilities Manager, a tool that automates the process of linking information from well-known external vulnerability data sources. Its goal is to present an enriched vulnerability report to its final users, assisting them in pinpointing software and hardware assets' defects, categorizing and prioritizing them, thus, contributing to the cyber defense against potential security breaches and adversary actions. To achieve this, the Vulnerabilities Manager exploits current state of the art machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The tool may also be enriched with forensic capabilities, detecting cyber threats, unveiling information about the nature of the attacker, and proposing mitigations against them in real-time.

TI  - Convective System Observations by LEO and GEO Satellites in Combination
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of low earth orbit (LEO) and GEO stationary (GEO) satellites brings significant advantages to observe, monitor, and understand convective systems and the associated vertical and horizontal dynamics. Two LEO, C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar and L-band soil moisture active passive (SMAP) radiometer, are used to observe surface wind patterns, while the other LEO (Aeolus lidar instrument) offers the measurements of intense convective downdrafts. Meteosat GEO is used to detect deep convective clouds. Four case study examples of LEO and GEO combination illustrate here the matching in location and observation time between deep convective clouds, intense downdrafts, and strong surface wind gusts. In particular, the two-dimensional deep convective cloud patterns and surface wind patterns have the same direction displacement. The observations of surface wind patterns by two different LEO (Sentinel-1 and SMAP) indicate that the high-intensity radar backscattering on Sentinel-1 images should be induced by convective wind gusts rather than hydrometeors or convective precipitation at the sea surface as suggested in previous references. Finally, the convective wind gusts estimated from Sentinel-1 and SMAP data correspond to those obtained by the high-frequency radars, small-scale numerical models, and in-situ measurements.

TI  - EVALUATION OF ANISOTROPIC CORRECTION FACTORS FOR THE CALCULATION OF LANDSAT 8 OLI ALBEDO ON THE ICE SHEETS
T2  - GEOGRAFIA FISICA E DINAMICA QUATERNARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The calculation of ice and snow albedo on the ice sheets from re-mote sensing has always been an important objective in climate research, especially at a high spatial resolution. In this study, a model of albedo retrieval based on Landsat 8 OLI satellite data is validated by comparing ground observations from Antarctica and Greenland, with a particular focus on the anisotropic correction of satellite data. Different correction factors for the anisotropy of snow and ice were considered, as well as two different conversion formulas from narrowband to broadband albedo. Our findings point out that existing anisotropic-correction models are unable to adequately account for albedo variations at high solar zenith angles, which is a relevant factor in Greenland and especially in Antarc-tica. Thus, the present study suggests that the anisotropic correction may be omitted when calculating ice and snow albedo on the ice sheets, as on average worse statistics were found when using the correction.

TI  - Headline Indicators for Global Climate Monitoring
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The World Meteorological Organization has developed a set of headline indicators for global climate monitoring. These seven indicators are a subset of the existing set of essential climate variables (ECVs) established by the Global Climate Observing System and are intended to provide the most essential parameters representing the state of the climate system. These indicators include global mean surface temperature, global ocean heat content, state of ocean acidification, glacier mass balance, Arctic and Antarctic sea ice extent, global CO2 mole fraction, and global mean sea level. This paper describes how well each of these indicators are currently monitored, including the number and quality of the underlying datasets; the health of those datasets; observation systems used to estimate each indicator; the timeliness of information; and how well recent values can be linked to preindustrial conditions. These aspects vary widely between indicators. While global mean surface temperature is available in close to real time and changes from preindustrial levels can be determined with relatively low uncertainty, this is not the case for many other indicators. Some indicators (e.g., sea ice extent) are largely dependent on satellite data only available in the last 40 years, while some (e.g., ocean acidification) have limited underlying observational bases, and others (e.g., glacial mass balance) with data only available a year or more in arrears.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the assessment of the influence of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors on the dynamics of production processes of various ecosystems located in one natural and climatic subzone - the southern taiga of the Eastern European Plain.The study was carried out on the example of four key sites in the Vladimir region, located in different landscape provinces in similar climatic conditions, but with certain differences associated with the characteristics of the soil and vegetation cover, anthropogenic load, and land use structure. Calculation of productivity indicators in carbon units is based on MODIS GPP/NPP data. The amount of organic carbon in the soil is determined according to the UN Food Organization (FAO) based on the Trends.Earth module of the GIS QGIS package.Common to the four ecosystems is the course of changes in the indicators of vegetation productivity over the years against the background of its different absolute values. Favorable conditions for the accumulation of carbon in the soil are formed in areas with high productivity and a large number of overgrown lands. The results of analysis of variance ANOVA demonstrate that the factors of time and spatial position of key sites do not affect the content of soil organic carbon and gross biological productivity. Land use structure is a significant factor. It is shown that the insufficient productivity of some ecosystems is compensated by an increase in the productivity of neighboring ones, therefore, the preservation of intra-landscape diversity is a necessary condition for maintaining the stability of their functioning.

TI  - SYSTEMATIZATION OF THE LAW IN ENGLAND IN THE EARLY 17th CENTURY: THE IMPORTANCE OF FRANCIS BACON'S IDEAS
T2  - VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-JURIDICHESKIE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: in the year of the 460th anniversary of the birth of Francis Bacon, an English philosopher and lawyer, statesman and court practitioner, of special relevance is research into Bacon's contribution to the development of theoretical and organizational bases of the law reform and the technique of law systematization. In his works, Bacon put forward a set of ideas concerning rationalization of common law and novelization of statutory law in early modern England. Purpose and objectives: to identify the features of legal discourse and dogmatic opposition between legal corporations of lawyers of common and civil law; to analyze their influence on the formation of Bacon's legal worldview; to determine his contribution to the development of the concept of the 'reform of law' and the doctrine of the sources of law in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence; to evaluate the content of his theoretical treatises and legislative proposals concerning the systematization of statutory and case law in early Stuart England. Methods: in the course of the study of Bacon's development as a thinker and his career advancement, we employed methodological approaches such as dialectical, cultural, general historical, sociological, dogmatic. When analyzing Bacon's legal ideas and doctrines, his legislative projects and theoretical writings, we applied both general scientific methods (system-structural and formal logical, inductive and deductive) and special legal methods of cognition: historical-legal, comparative-legal and formal-legal, as well as methods of legal hermeneutics, interpretation, and juris linguistics. Results: we have formulated the definitions of the 'reform of law' and 'systematization of law' in the context of the legal discourse of early Stuart England and specifically in the framework of Bacon's teachings; studied the directions of Bacon's activity aimed at improving the judicial procedure and evidentiary practice, at unifying the law within the Anglo-Scottish union, and also the special model of the gradual reform of English law developed by Bacon. He defined the proper legal and technical conditions for the systematization of law, the necessary elements of legalistics, and the 'general part' in the form of a list of legal maxims and regulis juris provided in his translation. Conclusions: according to Bacon, 'schematism' of reforming the law involved several successive stages. We have established the following scheme of legal systematization as the ultimate goal of the legal reform according to Bacon's plan: review and revision of statutory law - chronological incorporation of statutes and precedents - thematic hybrid codification (or consolidation) - creation of a 'digest' (corpus of laws) as a final document.

M3  - Article
AB  - The "frozen" borders as a result of the world order established after the Second World War seemed unshakable in Europe and North America, despite the active redrawing of space in other regions. However, the collapse of the dual system of orders in the 1980s and the subsequent active movement of borderlines led to the desire for creating a basis for their fixation. The political will to "stable" the borders coincided with the electoral expectations of stability and order, in this connection, state entities that are not able to oppose a sufficiently stable economic, cultural, and political boundaries to pressure on the borders from outside, in order to preserve the internal social status quo, are forced to create conditions for the preservation of social order, in fact, sacrificing development. The article attempts to explain the "condencing" ("solidifying") borders through the concept of order, which is realized at the mental level in the conservative essentialist worldview, designated in the text as a stable identity. The result of the research was to explain the relationship between the fixation of boundaries in space, the fading of the processes of economic and political development, and the adoption of the conservative model of identity as the most comfortable as an ideal. This allows us to describe many of the processes taking place in public consciousness, and by the presence of one of the outlined elements we can predict the further development of the other two.

Through an eleven-year (2003-2013) IAV surveillance project in seven DHPs in Maryland, USA, we frequently identified IAVs in the resident, free-flying mallard ducks (5.8% of cloacal samples were IAV-positive). The IAV population had high genetic diversity, including 12 HA subtypes and 9 NA subtypes. By sequencing the complete genomes of 290 viruses, we determined that genetically diverse IAVs were introduced annually into DHP ducks, predominantly from wild birds in the Anatidae family that inhabit the Atlantic and Mississippi flyways. The relatively low viral gene flow observed out of DHPs suggests that raised mallards do not sustain long-term viral persistence nor do they serve as important sources of new viruses in wild birds. Overall, our findings indicate that DHPs offer reliable samples of the diversity of IAV subtypes, and could serve as regional sentinel sites that mimic the viral diversity found in local wild duck populations, which would provide a cost-efficient strategy for long-term IAV monitoring. Such monitoring could allow for early identification and characterization of viruses that threaten bird species of high economic and environmental interest.

AB  - In the Ba river basin, the natural forest area has been decreasing and agriculture area has been increasing at an uneven rate for the last 30 years. Objective of this research is analysing the change in the agricultural and forest areas under the impact of socioeconomic activities in this basin. Landsat satellite images with a resolution of 30 m acquired from 1989 to 2019 were used to assess the changes. To enhance the classification speed of data, this research applied the online Google Earth Engine platform and GIS tools to process and edit results. The results showed that the largest decrease in forest area was from 1989-2000 (-159,000 ha) while the agricultural area increased the most in the period 2010-2017 with more than 176,000 ha. The main reasons of conversion forest land into agricultural land such as fruit trees and perennial industrial crops were the increasing of population and agricultural prices. Besides, the demand of electricity caused the deforestation for hydropower plantations.

TI  - The Effect of Surrounding Greenness on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort in Taiwan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study determines whether surrounding greenness is associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in Taiwan. A retrospective cohort study determines the relationship between surrounding greenness and the incidence of T2DM during the study period of 2001-2012 using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database. The satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the global MODIS database in the NASA Earth Observing System is used to assess greenness. Cox proportional hazard models are used to determine the relationship between exposure to surrounding greenness and the incidence of T2DM, with adjustment for potential confounders. A total of 429,504 subjects, including 40,479 subjects who developed T2DM, were identified during the study period. There is an inverse relationship between exposure to surrounding greenness and the incidence of T2DM after adjustment for individual-level covariates, comorbidities, and the region-level covariates (adjusted HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.79-0.82). For the general population of Taiwan, greater exposure to surrounding greenness is associated with a lower incidence of T2DM.

AB  - A healthy nation is a sign of a competitive state, but the natural population decline in Russia is increasing every year. Over the past ten years, the incidence of cancer among Russians has increased by 23.7%. Women most often have breast cancer - 20.6% of cancers among women. One of the risk factors for breast cancer is an environmental factor or environmental factor, which is considered the cause of 50% of unexplained disease cases. First of all, attention should be paid to the industrial regions with developed heavy industry, where the toxicity of the environment is high and, accordingly, the risks of malignant neoplasms are high. Modem psychological studies prove that cancer patients' survival rate is determined by a complex set of psychological factors, which may include the patient's worldview. The worldview is a set of fundamental beliefs about the world, good and justice, oneself and one's luck, and the ability to control what is happening. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate women's worldview with breast cancer at various stages of the disease, living in the Chelyabinsk region as an industrial region. Data were obtained on a positive worldview of women with breast cancer and the characteristics of the fundamental beliefs that accompany the disease's stages. The problem of the influence of mental tratuna - oncological diagnosis on the worldview of women and untimely appeal for medical help is outlined. (C) 2021 Published by European Publisher.

AB  - The dynamic rhythm of life in a modem megalopolis and the socio-cultural context of the countryside determine differences in the lifestyle, culture, worldview of townspeople and rural residents. The low rhythm of life, a fusion of work and everyday life, continuity of traditions and value systems are characteristic of rural residents. It acts as a psychological resource for coping with difficult life situations, including the situation of cancer. The article aims to study the features of subjective control of patients with cancer in the industrial metropolis and rural areas. The study involved 80 women with breast cancer living in the city of Chelyabinsk and rural settlements of the Chelyabinsk region, who are hospitalized at the Chelyabinsk Regional Clinical Center for Oncology and Nuclear Medicine. According to the data obtained, the inhabitants of rural areas interpret significant life events occurring with them as a result of their activities, and not of the prevailing circumstances. They tend to take responsibility for their achievements and failures, and for the events of their family life. The revealed differences in the peculiarities of subjective control in patients with cancer living in an industrial metropolis and rural areas serve as the basis for the development of a system of psychological support for patients with malignant neoplasms.

T2  - The Pan African medical journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: intussusception is the leading cause of bowel obstruction in infants and young children. We describe the epidemiology and diagnostic and treatment characteristics of intussusception among Togolese infants over a 4-year period.METHODS: we implemented active surveillance among infants younger than 1 year of age admitted with intussusception from 2015 to 2018 at Sylvanus Olympio Teaching Hospital and in 2018 at Campus Teaching Hospital. Brighton Collaboration Level 1 case definition criteria were used to confirm the diagnosis of intussusception.RESULTS: during four years, 41 cases of intussusception, with an annual range of 8 to 14 cases (median: 10) were reported; and the highest number of cases (89%) was enrolled at Sylvanus Olympio teaching hospital. Intussusception was uncommon in the first 2 months of life, peaked from 5 to 7 months old (63%), with male predominance (63%), and showed no significant seasonality. One third of cases (34%) were transferred to the sentinel surveillance site from another health facility; and the median delay in seeking care was 4 days (range: 0-11) with ≥ 48-hour delay in 59% of cases. Clinical symptoms, ultrasound and surgery were combined to diagnose intussusception in all the cases (100%). The treatment was exclusively surgical, and intestinal resection was common (28/41, 68%). A high case fatality rate (23%) was observed and the average length of hospital stay was 10 days (range: 1-23).CONCLUSION: active surveillance for intussusception in Togo has highlighted exclusive use of surgical therapy; often associated to an intestinal resection with a very high case fatality rate.

AB  - The maximum rivers inflow into the northwestern part of the Black Sea is on May-June. The plume occupies the largest area during this period. The alongshore current of desalinated waters, directed to the south, is formed, its transport increases. The mixing of water and its transport affect the spatiotemporal distribution of chlorophyll-"a" concentrations and, in general, the ecological state of the shelf waters. The six typical wind field distributions are obtained as a result of synoptic situations analysis by self-organizing Kohonen map method. It's can be grouped by the predominance of the northward and southward winds Estimates of the frequency of occurrence of synoptic situations for a decade have been obtained and their interannual variability has been analyzed in comparison with climatic indices characterizing large-scale atmospheric circulation.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing rate of sandy desertification lands in Zoige County has been regarded as an imminent threat recently. There is an urgent need to monitor the status, trend of desertification. This study used a land cover classification process of integrating Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM) with threshold method to extract the sandy lands based on Landsat data collected from 1990 to 2017. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyzed the evolution trend of the grassland desertification and verified the effect of desertification control using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image acquired in 2019. Three conclusions are drawn from the study. First, the sandy land is mainly distributed along the directions of prevailing wind at the edges of mountains in the southwest. Second, the area of sandy lands increased from 29.75 km(2) in 1990 to 46.87 km(2 )in 2005 and then decreased to 22.58 km(2) in 2013. While during 2014-2017, the area increased to 33.61 km(2). Third, the increasing of sandy lands is closely related to the terrain and water resources distribution. Ecological restoration policies, especially the ecological recovery projects implemented are the main driving factor of desertification reversion. The results of this study can provide effective data and decision support for combating desertification.

TI  - Optimizing flood mapping using multi-synthetic aperture radar images for regions of the lower mekong basin in Vietnam
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One major characteristic of floods is flood extent. Information on this characteristic is indispensable for flood monitoring. Recently, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been increasing in quality and quantity. This allows more flood studies conducted over large areas regardless of cloud and weather conditions and provides advantages including clear surface water classification based on SAR scattering mechanisms for low values (open water) and high values (inundated vegetation, etc.). However, challenges remain due to sources of uncertainties, such as atmospheric disturbances and vegetation masking parts of water surfaces. Therefore, in this study, we aim to optimize flood mapping processes on flooded vegetation that generated high-value pixels based on a SAR scattering mechanism called double bounce that classifies vegetative flooded water in L-band SAR images. This optimization is nearly impossible using Sentinel-1 scenes. Backscattering of time-series Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 images acquired for the 2018 and 2019 flood season was analysed, thresholded and hybridized for flood mapping of a study site in the Tam Nong district of the Dong Thap Province of Vietnam. We found that the accuracy of SAR flood maps was improved compared to ground truth data when the SAR-extracted vegetative-flooded plains were considered flooded.

The main lake mapping script is run in Google Earth Engine (GEE), and requires three inputs: 1) A start and end date for the mapping period; 2) A shapefile to specify the total area over which lakes will be mapped; 3) The temporal resolution at which results will be generated (e.g. given number of days/months). Results are exported from GEE as a GEOJSON file. The post-processing script is run in Matlab, and performs post-processing steps on the GEOJSON file. This script creates shapefile lake outputs for each time step.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning techniques have been improved to classify geographical information by assigning remote sensing images pixels. CNN models can fix the feature learning techniques in the field of visualization systems. This paper proposed a hybrid pre-trained VGG16 -convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - SVM classifier models. VGG16 conducts the features extraction from the input remote sensing data, and SVM classifier solves the classification output based on the CNN output feature maps. Our proposed model can play its neural network layers with a novel feature extraction strategy to achieve good classification accuracy over high-resolution remote sensing data. Classification experience is performed on the two remote sensing public datasets (UC Merced Land and RSSCN7), using high computational performance support that achieved reliable classification results within the shortest time.

AB  - The Estuary area is an area where there is a mixture of seawater with fresh water from the mainland. This estuary area is unique because seawater mixing with fresh water causes brackish water formation with fluctuating salinity. The fluctuation in salinity is influenced by the depth and shape of the water bed and the season. This study analyzes the estuary area (zone) in Ciletuh Bay, West Java, based on the rainy and dry seasons associated with bathymetry. The salinity value is obtained from Sentinel-2A image processing, using the salinity estimator algorithm's calculation, namely the Cilamaya Algorithm. The results showed that the mapping of the distribution of salinity forms the estuary boundaries, and the variables of rainfall and bathymetry affect the distribution of salinity values. The shallower the water, the lower the salinity level. Conversely, the deeper the waters, the higher the salinity level. The statement is due to the influence of freshwater entry into the sea, which is also related to rainfall (season), affecting fluctuations between saltwater and freshwater.

AB  - In this study, one of the state-of-the-art computer vision methods, namely superpixel-based graph convolutional networks (GCN), was used to achieve an accurate semantic segmentation of SAR images. In more detail, first, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) is used to over-segment the input SAR image into a set of superpixels, then a feature extraction method is employed to extract features from each of the superpixels. U-Net is used as deep feature extractors. Last, GCN architecture is used for node-based classification. We thus intend to exploit the spatial informationvia superpixels, as well the spatial relations among them via node edges. The experiments were conducted on real-world single polarization SAR images obtained from the Sentinel-1 satellite to test the performance of the proposed segmentation method. The results of these experiments show the advantage of the proposed GCN-based method for SAR image segmentation.

T2  - JOURNAL FOR EDUCATORS TEACHERS AND TRAINERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article covers various definitions of the concept of "culture", which expand and fill the concept of "a teacher's professional culture" with a new meaning and content. The specified personal phenomenon is viewed on the basis of the culturological approach and it manifests itself in the permanent process of professional and personal development and self-development, identifying humanistic orientation, self-actualization, and, in this regard, the ability to carry out purposeful activities, find the new meanings of the professional life, professional "self", professional functions, find the ways of one's "essential forces" realization. The definition of the problem field allowed us to identify the tasks of the possible directions of the formative process in relation to a future teacher's professional culture. The task should be focused around future teachers' culturological and worldview preparation.

TI  - The Concept of the Illegitimate Child in the Naive Picture of the World: Linguocognitive and Ethnocultural Angles
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the frame modeling of the concept of "illegitimate child" in the Russian, Czech and Slovak languages compared to English. On the basis of the fundamentals of Slavic ethnolinguistics, cognitive semantics and cultural anthropology, the epistemological layer of the concept of illegitimate child is reconstructed. Its evaluative, figurative and metaphorical components are analyzed These components are presented mainly in dialectal and regional phrasemic content of the compared languages and partly in some literary texts (based on the data of the National Corpus of the Russian language). The following principles and structural and semantic types of secondary figurative nomination were revealed. These which are objectified in phraseological euphemisms FIND + PHYTONYM LOCUS, FIND (BE BORN) + UNCLEAN PLACE, BRING + ARTIFACT (SUBJECT, PLACE), SUDDENLY APPEAR FROM). The related naive notions, stereotypes and beliefs that act as mental-symbolic correlates of the signs of cultural nomination are reconstructed.

TI  - THE PIVOTAL NARRATOLOGICAL CATEGORY IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines narrative strategies in their historical dynamics. It singles out the so-called narrative worldview and the ethos of narrativity as basic parameters of a narrative strategy. Heroic legends and fairy tales inherited a precedent worldview and the ethos of peace from mythology. The post-mythological development of religious consciousness leads to a narrative strategy of the parable type that implies an imperative world model and prescriptive ethos, as implemented, for example, in the Old Testament. The narrative strategy of the New Testament stands out due to the constructive combination of the precedent worldview and a fundamentally new ethos of personal solidarity. The practice of telling jokes and ancient Greek adventure novels develop a circumstantial world model and the ethos of self-realization. Finally, the classic novel explores the probabilistic worldview and becomes a basis of several new narrative strategies that vary in their ethos.

TI  - Multifractal classification of Sentinel-1 SAR images of ice-covered sea areas
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In this study, a technique for multifractal classification (MC) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of ice-covered sea areas is proposed. This technique is based on the use of SAR image local Holder exponents (LHEs) and coarse Holder exponents (CHEs) calculated for sliding windows with different sizes. Holder exponents are very effective and easily computable image texture descriptors that characterize the degree of local irregularity of image functions. The main steps of the presented SAR image classification technique are following: Sentinel-1 SAR image transformation (application of orbit file, radiometric calibration, speckle filtering, terrain correction and conversion to dB), extracting local and coarse Holder exponents from HH- and HV-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR images, stacking local and coarse Holder exponents into high-dimensional feature vectors, classification of the formed feature vectors by some classifier. Experimental testing of the proposed technique for classification of SAR images was carried out on several regions of Sentinel-1b SAR images demonstrating ice-covered areas of the Kara Sea. The first step of the technique was implemented by SNAP toolbox, and the next three steps were implemented using own MATLAB application (https://github.com/UchaevD/GMAToolbox). SAR image classification results were compared with ice charts of U.S. National Ice Center (NIC), which contain weekly information on sea ice concentration and ice thickness. As a result of comparison with NIC ice charts, it has been established that Kara Sea areas with widely-spreading types of floating ice can be successfully separated by MC of Sentinel-1b SAR images, and overall and average classification accuracies are not less than 75%. The results of the study suggest that MC of SAR images of ice-covered sea areas can be used to automate the generation daily ice charts for various ice-covered sea areas in the Arctic and Antarctic.

TI  - COMPARING FACTORS CONDITIONING LANDSCAPE CHANGE DURING VOLCANIC ERUPTION AT VIRUNGA NATIONAL PARK, EAST AFRICA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The change on Virunga National Park (VNP) landscape due to climate change, anthropogenic activities and natural disasters calls for appropriate monitoring and management policies. This study aimed to assess and compare the factors conditioning landscape change during volcanic eruption at VNP located in the East Africa from 1990 to 2018. Land use and land cover Landsat 5 images of 1990 and 2004, and Landsat 8 images of 2018 were analyzed by the supervised maximum likelihood classification techniques. The calculation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its relationship with precipitation and temperature referred to the same images. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) facilitated data analysis. The results highlighted human activities as key drivers to landscape changes recorded in the central and northern parts. The southern part recorded high extent of changes which transformed 8.36 Km(2) of the park into new lava flow linked to 11.6 Km(2) of grassland and almost 1 Km(2) of shrubland changed into lava plains. The two volcanoes are associated with volcanic plume and gas emission, which mainly cause NDVI perturbation. This study can serve as a baseline in the conservation and management of protected areas and reduction of volcanic effects on national parks.

TI  - IR-SSL: IMPROVED REGULARIZATION BASED SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING FOR LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION
T2  - 2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING (ICIP)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Land cover classification has significant contributions in several applications including natural calamities estimation and response, observation of environmental changes, and urban planning to name a few. These types of applications demand the identification of different categories of land cover. Traditional land cover classification is significantly dependent on the availability of huge amount of labeled data. However, labeling satellite data is very time consuming and it often requires expert knowledge. To alleviate the dependency on labeled data, we propose a novel and improved regularization based deep semi-supervised learning (IR-SSL) method for land cover classification. Adaptation of deep semi-supervised learning approach in such a task gains reliability due to its robustness in feature learning. To consolidate the performance of our deep semi-supervised learning method, we combine it with a robust data augmentation technique. We perform experiments on a benchmark dataset. Considering limited labeled samples from the dataset, our method outperforms many state-of-the-art models.

TI  - A New Mask R-CNN-Based Method for Improved Landslide Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a novel method of landslide detection by exploiting the Mask R-CNN capability of identifying an object layout by using a pixel-based segmentation, along with transfer learning used to train the proposed model. A data set of 160 elements is created containing landslide and nonlandslide images. The proposed method consists of three steps: augmenting training image samples to increase the volume of the training data; fine-tuning with limited image samples; and performance evaluation of the algorithm in terms of precision, recall, and F1 measure, on the considered landslide images, by adopting ResNet-50 and 101 as backbone models. The experimental results are quite encouraging as the proposed method achieves precision equals to 1.00, recall 0.93, and F1 measure 0.97, when ResNet-101 is used as backbone model, and with a low number of landslide photographs used as training samples. The proposed algorithm can be potentially useful for land-use planners and policymakers of hilly areas where intermittent slope deformations necessitate landslide detection as a prerequisite before planning.

AB  - The article is focused on the issues of professional training of students for teaching and education in post-industrial society: worldview uncertainty, unpreparedness for personal and professional development. Though the competence-based approach is prevalent in the system of higher pedagogical education, it is deficient. The necessity of its integration with approaches that can contribute to the harmonious socialization of the personality of the future teacher and educator is considered of significant importance. One of these approaches is the existential-logo therapeutic approach. Its essence is revealed in two interdependent aspects: a) facilitating the development of the existential sphere of the future teacher's personality; b) helping students' master the teaching profession as a meaningful purpose in life through striving for self-transcendence and self-realization in the work of love. In the educational process, the effectiveness of this approach can be achieved through implementation of methods and techniques of logo therapy within the framework of the pedagogy of life-meaning orientations.

TI  - Contextualising Etienne de Villiers' Ethics of Responsibility in the African context: Some recommendations
T2  - STELLENBOSCH THEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Being a South African systematic theologian, Etienne de Villiers has been involved in discourses regarding public morality with specific interest in the ethics of responsibility. In pursuing this task, his recent scholarship has resulted in proposing a contemporary Christian ethic of responsibility that addresses public moral issues. While this proposal has significant promise for engaging with issues distorting the moral fabric of most African societies, it is considered as lacking some resources for speaking to the African person critically and clearly because of its Western character. Hence, there appears to be an incompatibility with aspects of African moral and social identities in his proposal that require critical consideration of concepts more appealing to the African context. Hence, this article proposes an African (primarily Nigerian) theological engagement with de Villiers' views. The intention is to make de Villiers' work more accessible and, contextual, to the broader African ethical worldview.

T2  - Korean Journal of Remote Sensing

M3  - research-article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) at C-band is an ideal remote sensing system for crop monitoring owing to its short wavelength, which interacts with the upper parts of the crop canopy. This study evaluated the potential of dual polarimetric Sentinel-1 at C-band for monitoring rice phenology. Rice phenological variations occur in a short period. Hence, the short revisit time of Sentinel-1 SAR system can facilitate the tracking of shortterm temporal morphological variations in rice crop growth. The sensitivity of SAR backscattering coefficients, backscattering ratio, and polarimetric decomposition parameters on rice phenological stages were investigated through a time-series analysis of 33 Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex images collected from 10th April to 25th October 2020 in Gimhae, South Korea. Based on the observed temporal variations in SAR parameters, we could identify and distinguish the phenological stages of the Gimhae rice growth cycle. The backscattering coefficient in VH polarisation and polarimetric decomposition parameters showed high sensitivity to rice growth. However, amongst SAR parameters estimated in this study, the VH backscattering coefficient realistically identifies all phenological stages, and its temporal variation patterns are preserved in both Sentinel-1A (S1A) and Sentinel- 1B (S1B). Polarimetric decomposition parameters exhibited some offsets in successive acquisitions from S1A and S1B. Further studies with data collected from various incidence angles are crucial to determine the impact of different incidence angles on polarimetric decomposition parameters in rice paddy fields.

It will employ digital beamforming capabilities, which will allow for high-resolution wide-swath imaging. The scan-on-receive operation and phase spoiling of the antenna pattern are core features to achieve desired SAR imaging performance. Aiming for mission preparation and calibration studies, a framework to simulate digital beamforming systems for ALOS-4 is presented. A model of the instrument is developed and point target response is used as metrics to validate performance predicted. Simulation algorithms for calibration and evaluation strategies will be discussed in this work.

AB  - Vegetation indices (VIs), such as the normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel-2 images, can be a useful tool for delineating nitrogen fertilizer site-specific management zones (SSMZs) before applying fertilizer. In this study, the agreement between the yield map and the NDVI images was analysed in 13 wheat plots using the Kappa Index (KI). In one-third of the plots, moderate KI agreement was achieved before the nitrogen application date. However, for four of the plots, adequate agreement was not obtained at any time of crop development. The lack of moderate agreement between the maps may be due to the inability of the NDVI to appropriately detect changes in fertility structures at the tittering stage.

TI  - American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in an endemic municipality in the North of Minas Gerais State: spatial analysis and socio-environmental factors
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
M3  - Article
AB  - American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) is endemic in the municipality of Montes Clams, Minas Gerais State. The use of geotechnology such as spatial statistics and remote sensing has contributed to a better understanding of the eco-epidemiology of diseases, and consequently a better definition of control strategies. This study aimed to analyze the spatial distribution of probable sites of cases of ATL infection (2007-2011) in the municipality of Montes Clams and to identify related socio-environmental factors. Data on ATL cases notification were obtained from the Municipal Health Department of Montes Claros. The annual incidence of ATL in the municipality was calculated and the probable sites of infection were georeferenced. Crude Rate and the Local Empirical Bayesian Rate were calculated with census sectors considered as the unit of analysis. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from LANDSAT 5 TM images. The spatial association between the crude rate of ATL and the NDVI of the census tracts was evaluated using the Local Bivaiiate of Moran I. The socio-environmental aspects of household structures were assessed based on a structured questionnaire. The incidence of ATL in the evaluated period ranged from 6.2 to 16.6 cases/100,000 inhabitants. The highest rates of ATL occurrence were found in the census sectors located in the rural area and in the peripheral census sectors in the city. Through the Empirical Bayes Smoothed Rate map, it was found that in the peripheral areas of the city. the rates of ATL occurrence were lower than in the rural area and their values decreased as they approach the city center. Local Bivariate of Moran I showed a positive correlation between NDVI and crude ATL rates, with significant high-high clusters observed in the rural area and in the census sectors in the Western peripheral area of the city that have experienced an urban expansion concomitant to the period investigated. In most homes of people affected by the disease, there were domestic animals and organic matter in the peridomicile. In addition, a high percentage of individuals affected by ATL reported the presence of rodents circulating near their homes. In conclusion, it is possible that the disorderly expansion process in the city of Montes Clams favored the establishment of the ATL periurban and urban transmission cycle. These regions deserve special attention from health surveillance to combat this zoonosis.

AB  - Data Summary: EQUATES: EPAs Air QUAlity TimE Series Project The US EPA developed a set of modeled meteorology, emissions, air quality and pollutant deposition spanning the years 2002 through 2017. Modeled datasets cover the Conterminous US (CONUS) at a 12km horizontal grid spacing (12US1) and the Northern Hemisphere at a 108km (108NHEMI) using WRFv4.1.1 for meteorology and CMAQv5.3.2 for air quality modeling. New hemispheric and North American emissions inventories were developed using, to the extent possible, consistent input data and methods across all years, including emissions from mobile, fire, and oil and gas sources.

T2  - DIALOG SO VREMENEM-DIALOGUE WITH TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the peculiarities of the Russian landed gentry's self-identification in the 15-16th centuries after taking of monastic vows. The author shows that some of them (Vassian (Patrikeev), the Rostov archbishop Iosaf (Obolensky), Iosif Volocky) shared the worldview typical for the nobility. But in these cases, we face with the exception to the general rule. The long period of the church leaders' preparation (no less than 2-3 decades) usually had impact on weakening the ties with their social environment. That's why it is impossible to speak about the connection between their status in the world and in the Church.

AB  - The paper presents the results of studies of medieval archaeological sites, the Laishevsky and Ostolopovsky settlements, and the Ostolopovsky hillfort, using multitemporal remote sensing data and modern field research methods. The studied sites are located in the zone of active bank transformation and have been destroyed since the creation of the Kuibyshev reservoir. To assess the dynamics of the coastline, multitemporal remote sensing data were used. Shoreline positioning for the historical period of the 1950s was interpreted from archival aerial images (Kazan University Library). 1975 satellite images obtained during the Corona reconnaissance space program KeyHole-9 Hexagon satellite (10.06.1975). For their georeferencing very high-resolution satellite images were used (2019). The maximum errors of georeferencing are less than 3 pixels for both sites. In 2018-2019, field surveys of the shoreline fragments at the Ostolopovsky and the Laishevskoe settlements were carried out in 2020 - at Ostolopovo hillfort placement. For field studies, a DJI Phantom 4 drone and GNSS receiver with real-time kinematic corrections were used. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), as an extension module of the ArcGIS software, was used to quantify shoreline displacement. Shoreline indicators such as linear retreat rate (m/year), shoreline displacement (m) were automatically calculated. A quantitative assessment of the Kuibyshev shoreline transformation makes it possible to evaluate the damage caused to archaeological sites and the risk of their further destruction.

TI  - INTER-CIVILIZATIONAL APPROACHES TO INVESTORSTATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT
T2  - UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - After having described the main features of investor-state arbitration and the key challenges it is facing, this Article investigates whether arbitral tribunals can be analogised to global constitutional courts, or whether they are analogous to other international tribunals. It then examines the promises and pitfalls of constitutional theories of investor-state arbitration. This Article argues that investor-state arbitration is not a form of global constitutional adjudication, as arbitral tribunals are not akin to constitutional courts, and for the time being maintain structural and functional differences from the latter. In other words, arbitral tribunals currently lack constitutional density. This does not necessarily mean that they cannot acquire such density; they certainly can, should states desire them to. Constitutional theory can offer useful conceptual tools to reflect on investor-state arbitration, and the dialogue between constitutional courts and arbitral tribunals can be a fertile one. Nonetheless, this Article highlights the importance of methodological pluralism and of an inter-civilizational approach to address the current challenges investor-state arbitration is facing. Under international law, countries are delimited by borders and remain the subjects of this field of law. Nonetheless, this Article proposes the use of a broader notion, that of civilization, to indicate a community of language, culture, and worldview. Some countries are multicultural in that their history has involved the encounter of different cultures and civilizations. Adopting an inter-civilizational or inter-cultural approach entails acknowledging the cultural (and constitutional) diversity of countries and applying international law in a manner that is sensitive to the cultural differences and constitutional preferences of given countries. Adopting such an approach entails a historical, anthropological, and principally legal understanding that different cultures may prioritize different values and that international law is a composite system that can applied in a manner that is respectful of cultural differences. Recent developments seem to suggest that, at least in some regional contexts, there are ongoing attempts to fine-tune investment treaties to the needs of different cultures and humanise the settlement of investment disputes.

TI  - A Systematic Review of the Legal Considerations Surrounding Medicines Management
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objectives: There is a paucity of integrated knowledge regarding legal considerations required to ensure patient safety through safe medicines management. This study explores the legal considerations surrounding medicines management, providing a synthesis of existing knowledge. An integrative systematic review of the current international knowledge was performed. Materials and Methods: The search encompassed the online databases of PubMed (including Medline), Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science using MeSH terms and relevant keywords relating to the legal considerations of medicines management in healthcare settings. Results: The search process led to the identification of 6051 studies published between 2010 and 2020, of which six articles were found to be appropriate for data analysis and synthesis based on inclusion criteria. Research methods were varied and included qualitative interviews, mixed-methods designs, retrospective case reports and cross-sectional interrupted time-series analysis. Their foci were on the delegation of medicines management, pharmacovigilance and reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) before and after legislation by nurses, physicians and pharmacists, medico-legal litigation, use of forced medication and the prescription monitoring program. Given the heterogenicity of the studies in terms of aims and research methods, a meta-analysis could not be performed and, therefore, our review findings are presented narratively under the categories of 'healthcare providers' education and monitoring tasks', 'individual and shared responsibility', and 'patients' rights'. Conclusion: This review identifies legal aspects surrounding medicines management, including supervision and monitoring of the effects of medicines; healthcare providers' knowledge and attitudes; support and standardised tools for monitoring and reporting medicines' adverse side effects/ADRs; electronic health record systems; individual and shared perceptions of responsibility; recognition of nurses' roles; detection of sentinel medication errors; covert or non-voluntary administration of medication, and patient participation.

TI  - An object-based fuzzy prior knowledge sparse coding algorithm for image fusion
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Image fusion methods are designed to combine multiple input images with complementary information from a scene that can increase the interpretation capabilities of the objects. The spatial or spectral quality of a fusion method highly depends on the employed fusion method and prior information exploited from input data. Spectral distortion and spatial artifacts are common drawbacks in many image fusion methods. In this study, we propose a model-based image fusion approach using sparse representation (SR) with fuzzy prior knowledge, which incorporates three constraints as prior information for better modeling of the spatial and spectral characteristics of the fusion results. These prior constraints include sparsity of coefficients, patch-wise spectral similarity, and improvement of edge details extracted from a precise unsupervised classification based on a fuzzy inference system (FIS). Edge pixels are vulnerable to spectral distortions due to the spectral mixture of neighboring pixels. Therefore, an objects-based fuzzy classification was used to separate edge pixels from background information and smooth fusion results over edge pixels to prevent spectral distortion. Moreover, in the optimization step of sparse coding, the spectral basis was estimated along with sparse coefficients in an iterative procedure. Results from the proposed fusion approach over real satellite data revealed the promising performance of the proposed SR approach based on its quantitative and qualitative results. Objective and subjective enhancement of the proposed approach compared to other well-known fusion methods included pixel-wise detail preservation and object-based spectral injection to the fused image.

AB  - The article deals with the key stages of the formation and development of German fragmentary prose in the 19th-20th centuries. Using the materials from German novels of the 20th century, the authors analyze the artistic devices that motivate the discreteness of the narrative and determine their artistic function - the manifestation and structuring of aesthetic information. Based on the analysis of artistic devices, the aesthetic content of the discrete novel structure is identified, which depends on the writers' worldview. The discrete structure has proven to be a universal art form that has shaped the typological features of the modern novel.

AB  - Currently, there is significant progress in the interpretation of remote images of the earth's surface using various recognition systems. To train these systems, large labeled datasets are required. The creation of such datasets is carried out by experts and is quite a time-consuming task. This paper proposes a method for creating specialized datasets for their use in monitoring the state of agricultural lands undergoing degradation. The method allows you to automate the process of creating such datasets The datasets are generated from freely available data obtained by the Sentinel satellites as part of the European Copernicus space program. The method is based on the processing of the results of the preliminary classification of images of the earth's cover, previously produced by the Sentinel Hub service.

TI  - Water Pollution Monitoring through Remote Sensing
T2  - CURRENT ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Water is undoubtedly a very precious resource that helps life thrive on this planet, and its pollution is a problem, which is potent in erasing almost all forms of life on the earth. Hence, considering the magnitude of this problem, studies and experiments have been focused (from the day water pollution was recognised as an eminent issue) on monitoring and finding possible solutions for water pollution. While the latter deals with treating and purifying water using a variety of concepts, monitoring deals with the continuous assessment of water quality of a waterbody. Methodology: There are several methods for monitoring purposes, and remote sensing is a popular choice, thanks to its wide applicability and flexibility in implementation. Remote sensing deals with collecting data about a place (which is to be monitored) and sending the data to another 'remote' location for analysis. This article provides a description of some methods employed in recent times for remote sensing and a short section which deals with the analysis of the remotely sensed data using machine learning / deep learning models, hence making the reader aware of the concept of remote sensing and its scope for monitoring water pollution (or any form of pollution) in the future. Conclusion: The detailed comparative analysis of these methods showed that sensor-based water quality monitoring with Geographical Information System (GIS) would be more efficient for the detection of water pollutants. Further research in this field may introduce many advancements to enable efficient water pollution detection techniques.

T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE'21
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - While the value of high-resolution remote sensing data for viticulture has already been demonstrated, very few winegrowers use them in their decision-making process at the plot level. Apart from the price, this is mainly due to a lack of awareness of the advantages and limitations of these data. This paper aims to present a tool, PICA, whose ambition is to serve as a support for discussion and interaction around these data with practitioners. PICA is an agri-game that uses a practical viticulture operation, yield estimation, to make professionals see all the benefits of these data. The game will be deployed on a demonstration site for numerical tools within a commercial vineyard.

TI  - An automated procedure to map breaking river ice with C-band HH SAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of effective strategies to manage the river ice breakup process or the associated risks is hindered by a lack of understanding and information. Radar earth observation satellites offer excellent potential for collecting up-to-date information on the conditions of and changes in river ice cover during the breakup period. This text describes the development, performance and limitations of an automated procedure to map breaking river ice by means of C-band, HH-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. An original two-step supervised classification model (IceBC), which uses backscatter intensities, lies at the core of the procedure. First, IceBC identifies three primary classes: water, sheet ice and rubble ice. Next, each primary ice class is divided in three secondary classes that denote top surface roughness scale differences. Input images must have incidence angles from similar to 27 degrees to similar to 60 degrees. Below similar to 36 degrees, IceBC may assign a class labelled "unclassified" to water or sheet ice pixels. The primary classification model yields overall accuracies of similar to 86% and similar to 93% for independent test pixels with incidence angles <= similar to 49 degrees and >= similar to 29 degrees or >= similar to 36 degrees, respectively. The associated class accuracies for water, sheet ice and rubble ice are similar to 97% & 96%, similar to 69% & 85% and similar to 97% & 99%. Given its connection to ice jam flood events, the classification accuracy achieved for rubble ice is particularly important. Maps produced by means of IceBC comprise detailed spatial information regarding ice cover conditions and the development of the breakup process. Their quality may be affected by: freezing conditions, wet snow cover, meltwater pools, infrastructure, rapids or high winds. Monitoring is the key to managing the impacts of most of these challenges. An IceBC prototype has been used operationally since 2015.

AB  - Since the 1980s, discourse on religious piety has taken many different forms, from mosque lessons by lay preachers-such as `Amr Khalid-to religious TV programmes and leisure activities. Within this widespread religious culture and cultivation of forms of visible piety, wearing the veil became an almost uncontested norm for women. As Saba Mahmood demonstrated, the veil became a crucial way to express and cultivate a 'pious self'. Yet especially since the 2011 revolution and its aftermath, many young Egyptians started to question political, religious and patriarchal authorities. Amongst others, this took on open or hidden forms of non-believing, as well as a search for new forms of spirituality. Based on fieldwork and interviews, this contribution looks into the motives and experiences of women who decided to cast off the veil. In view of the hegemonic piety discourse, this is a huge issue, which is met by fierce reactions and accusations of immorality and non-belief. Whereas for some women this decision is an expression of religious doubt or a turn to a non-religious worldview, for others it is a way to contest the current piety discourse in a search for a more personal and spiritual connection with God. While the relationship with religion among my interlocutors might differ, they share a common attempt to uncover their 'authentic selves'. By unveiling, they express their wish to define their own space and ideas regarding religion, gender and their bodies.

TI  - The Turkish harem in the Karyatid Temple and antagonistic narratives on the Athenian Acropolis
T2  - OPUSCULA-ANNUAL OF THE SWEDISH INSTITUTES AT ATHENS AND ROME
M3  - Article
AB  - According to received history, the Karyatid Temple on the Acropolis of Athens (commonly known as the "Erechtheion") was, in the city's first Ottoman period (1456-1687), converted into a Turkish harem. In this article, I investigate the story by scrutinizing sources from this period. I argue that the notion of the harem, although historically suspect, found fertile ground in an orientalist worldview that has been prevalent among western visitors and scholars. I propose that the tale may have been inspired by the temple's conspicuous Kary-atid statues. I close by considering the story of the harem as part of a phenomenon of "antagonistic narratives" (stories that concern the desecration or destruction of monuments by enemies) in history and archaeology. The article offers new perspectives on later uses of and stories about the Karyatid Temple, on western attitudes towards the presence of Turks in Greece, and on the role that material remains can play in the creation of narratives about the past.

TI  - Towards the quantitative and physically-based interpretation of solar-induced vegetation fluorescence retrieved from global imaging
T2  - PHOTOSYNTHETICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Due to emerging high spectral resolution, remote sensing techniques and ongoing developments to retrieve the spectrally resolved vegetation fluorescence spectrum from several scales, the light reactions of photosynthesis are receiving a boost of attention for the monitoring of the Earth's carbon balance. Sensor-retrieved vegetation fluorescence (from leaf, tower, airborne or satellite scale) originating from the excited antenna chlorophyll a molecule has become a new quantitative biophysical vegetation parameter retrievable from space using global imaging techniques. However, to retrieve the actual quantum efficiencies, and hence a true photosynthetic status of the observed vegetation, all signal distortions must be accounted for, and a high-precision true vegetation reflectance must be resolved. ESA's upcoming Fluorescence Explorer aims to deliver such novel products thanks to technological and instrumental advances, and by sophisticated approaches that will enable a deeper understanding of the mechanics of energy transfer underlying the photosynthetic process in plant canopies and ecosystems.

TI  - Closing the Gap Between Urban Planning and Urban Ecology: A South African Perspective
T2  - URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological considerations should be an integral part of the decision-making processes of urban planners. Specifically, ecological aspects used in urban ecology, such as green infrastructure and ecosystem services, are substantiated by literature as strategies for improving quality of life, human health, and well-being. Studies dealing with such concepts in the Global South recently gained interest; however, these lack empirical evidence on the integration thereof in mainstream South African urban planning practice. This article conducts a preliminary investigation into the knowledge of ecological aspects of a sample of South African urban planners and their willingness to implement ecological aspects in urban planning practice. The new environmental paradigm scale is employed to determine the environmental worldview (ecocentric or anthropocentric) among respondents and how this relates to their knowledge of ecological aspects. The initial research sample consisted of a total of 283 questionnaires distributed. Although findings of this article are based on a low response rate (15%) of 42 documented responses, it did not affect the validity of the data collected in this context. The initial findings indicated that the environmental worldview of the sample of planners is only one factor influencing their perspective on incorporating ecological considerations. Low to moderate knowledge and awareness regarding ecological aspects such as ecosystem services, green infrastructure, and multi-functionality are argued to be main factors preventing integration in urban planning practice. Findings emphasize the need for context-based implementation strategies and broad recommendations are made for the planning profession as a point of departure to introduce or ingrain ecological considerations.

TI  - Did We Produce More Waste During the COVID-19 Lockdowns? A Remote Sensing Approach to Landfill Change Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to ordinary lives. These disruptions included restricting human movement through local "lockdowns." This article applies a multitemporal analysis of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar to evaluate the relationship between restrictions on movement and solid waste production in landfill sites. We selected three landfill sites from Africa, Euro-Asia, and America to assess the impact of restricted mobility on waste production. Our research shows that solid waste production and restrictions on human mobility are significantly correlated. This article indicates that a reduction in human mobility increases human waste production even after accounting for changes in economic activities. The research highlights the benefit of using remote sensing SAR data for monitoring the impact of human activities on the environment. The use of remote sensing data is crucial for these applications, given that the outcomes might be counter-intuitive. The source code for the workflows, Jupyter notebooks and scripts are available at https://github.com/tvanzyl/sar_jhb_dumps to support reproducible research in remote sensing.

TI  - Change detection based flood mapping using multi-temporal Earth Observation satellite images: 2018 flood event of Kerala, India
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The future projections of climate change envisage a global increase in extreme precipitation events and subsequent flooding. The reliable and rapid flood maps are the critical parameters in preparing the disaster management plans. This study demonstrated an effective flood mapping framework using freely available multi-temporal Earth Observation (EO) images, including C-band Sentinel-1A & 1B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and optical WorldView-3 images, for analyzing the 2018 flood event of Kerala, India. Two Change Detection (CD) techniques, i.e. Ratio Index (RI) and Normalized Change Index (NCI) combined with semi-automatic thresholding are implemented on temporal descending pass SAR images for flood identification. For ascending pass SAR images, the statistical-based thresholding method is implemented. The results indicate that combined use of ascending and descending pass SAR images contributed to a better understanding of flood conditions. It is also inferred that the use of a pre-flood image can enhance flood area estimation and helps in minimizing the overestimation errors. The results also found that NCI outperforms RI for Kerala flood event. Flood area extracted from these techniques is plotted against the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall datasets, which showed a similar trend. Field photographs and optical images are used for validation purposes.

TI  - Rapid monitoring of cyclone induced flood through an automated approach using multi-temporal Earth Observation (EO) images in RSS CloudToolbox platform
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The new era of cloud platform technologies opens up many opportunities for near real-time dissemination of disaster information to the end-users. The present study utilizes the European Space Agency (ESA) Research and Service Support (RSS) CloudToolbox platform to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of a flood event. A collective flood monitoring framework is formulated to rapidly assess cyclone-induced flood in the CloudToolbox platform. The outputs of the framework are spatio-temporal maps of flood extent, depth, and hot spot zones. The framework utilizes Earth Observation (EO) images such as optical and C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and an automatic Kittler and Illingworth thresholding algorithm for rapid flood mapping. The temporal flood depth maps are created with the Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET) which requires only two input parameters, viz. flood extent, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Subsequently, flood hotspot zones are also identified. We tested the flood monitoring framework on Amphan cyclone-induced flood event at both regional and local levels. The spatio-temporal flood extent, depth, and hot spot maps are generated for the Amphan cyclone event and a 97% overall accuracy is achieved at the local level. The entire process took less than one hour for regional and local level analysis.

TI  - Investigation of Airborne Particulate Matter in the Atmosphere of the Black Sea Coastal Zone Based on the Measured and Satellite Data
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. One of the most pressing problems of large cities is air pollution resulting from presence of various large and fine particles in the air. These micro-particles can be transported by the air currents over considerable distances, as well as coagulate various substances also present in the atmosphere. The purpose of the work is to study the content of particulate matter of 2.5 and 10 microns (PM2.5 and PM10) in the atmosphere of Sevastopol, as well as the processes affecting their concentration.Methods and Results. During the period from February to June, 2020, the scientists of Marine Hydrophysical Institute (MHO, RAS measured mass concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 in Sevastopol using the "Atmas" dust analyzer. A total of 180 measurements of the micro-particle concentrations in the air of Sevastopol were done, and 60 values of the PM2.5 and PM10 daily average concentrations were obtained. To analyze the preferred aerosol type for the dates with high content of suspended particles in the air, the CALIPSO satellite data were used. It is shown that the smoke recorded in the Sevastopol atmosphere on 19.02.2020 could lead to increase of the PM10 particles concentration. A day before the increased concentrations of suspended particles were revealed in the Sevastopol atmospheric air, the CALYPSO satellite data on aerosol typing over the Black Sea had shown predominance of the smoke aerosol in the atmosphere over the region under study.Conclusions. The results of the investigation shows that in the atmosphere of Sevastopol, the cases when the PM2.5 and PM10 particles contents exceeded the maximum permissible daily average concentration by up to 3.4 times were detected. It was found that the main cause of air pollution with micro-particles in Sevastopol was the transfer both of air masses from the deserts in the African continent and Asia and the burning biomass aerosol (smoke). Air pollution with the PM10 particles caused by the local source, namely soil excavation in immediate proximity to the air sampling point, was less significant.

TI  - Representation of Suffering in the Vocabulary of the Dialect Language Personality of a Siberian Peasant Woman
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the semantic field "suffering" that represents a fragment of the emotional and sensual existence of a language personality. The linguopersonological research based on the material of the idiolectal vocabulary of Vera Vershinina, a Siberian old resident, continues the comprehensive description of a dialect language personality made by Tomsk dialectologists. The research sources are A Complete Dictionary of a Dialect Language Personality edited by E.V. Ivantsova, transcripts of the informant's speech made through participation in the linguistic existence of the speaker. The article focuses on 52 lexical and phraseological units. The research aims to describe a fragment of an individual linguistic worldview representing suffering. The view on the research object develops in the following way: word - definition - examples represented in the dictionary - text - idiolectal discourse. At the first stage of the research, the lexical and phraseological units are divided into seven functional semantic classes (FSC) according to the categorial lexical seme uniting them. The researcher examines the numerical composition of each class, the linguistic features of its elements (presence of figurative units, features of the use of the examined words). The most developed is the FSC of emotional state, since suffering is perceived as a long and deep feeling caused by a certain reason, but infinite. Classes of emotional impact and receiving the emotional state characterize suffering as a feeling hurting physically, exhausting with its length and intensity. A large number of units with the semantics of weeping in the FSC of external expression of emotions can indicate that the informant replaces reflection with a detailed description of external manifestations of suffering. Classes of emotional characterization and attitude show the informant as a person deeply empathetic to the grief of others. The last FSC demonstrates that names of the feeling and the situation causing this feeling coexist in one unit, which is typical for representatives of the folk speech culture. At the second stage of the research, the author describes the most frequent situations associated with the actualization of the semantic field "suffering" in the informant's speech. These situations include: disease or death; disability caused by an injury; difficult living conditions, etc. It corresponds to the core values of the traditional peasant culture: life and health of a person, wealth, stability of a family's life. The material shows that, for the dialect speaker, suffering is one of the dominants of reality, a constant of everyday life fully accepted by the speaker. However, the informant does not ignore other people in her grief, she is empathetic towards their life because of such personal qualities as optimism and spiritual power.

TI  - Lossy compression of three-channel remote sensing images with controllable quality
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In this paper, we consider a problem of lossy compression of three-channel or color images with application to remote sensing. The main task of such a compression is to provide a trade-off between compression ratio and quality of compressed data that should be appropriate for solving the basic tasks as classification of sensed terrains, object detection and so on. Then, alongside with a desire to increase compression ratio, one needs to control introduced distortions (image quality) to ensure that compressed data are appropriate for further use. We propose a way to lossy compression that is based on providing quality of compressed images not worse than desired according to quality metrics. The outcome of our approach is that classification accuracy either does not get worse than for uncompressed data (and sometimes even improves) or gets worse only slightly. Earlier, we have shown that it is possible to control quality for component-wise compression of multichannel images. Here, it is demonstrated that it is possible to control quality for 3D compression. Compared to component-wise compression, 3D approach leads to two important benefits: 1) compression ratio can be almost twice larger; 2) probability of correct classification can be slightly better. These benefits are confirmed for real-life three-component data acquired by Sentinel sensor using maximum likelihood-based classifier.

TI  - Evapotranspiration mapping of commercial corn fields in Brazil using SAFER algorithm
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) is a relatively new algorithm applied successfully to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration (ET) at different spatial scales of different crops in Brazil. However, its use for monitoring irrigated crops is scarce and needs further investigation. This study assessed the performance of SAFER to estimate ET of irrigated corn in a Brazilian semiarid region. The study was conducted in Sao Desiderio, Bahia State, Brazil, in corn-cropped areas in no-tillage systems and irrigated by central pivots. SAFER algorithm with original regression coefficients (a = 1.8 and b = -0.008) was initially tested during the growing seasons of 2014, 2015, and 2016. SAFER performed very poorly for estimating corn ET, with RMSD values greater than 1.18 mm d(-1) for 12 fields analyzed and NSE values < 0 in most fields. To improve estimates, SAFER regression coefficients were calibrated (using 201 4 and 2015 data) and validated with 2016 data, with the resulting coefficients a and b equal to 0.32 and -0.0013, respectively. SAFER performed well for ET estimation after calibration, with r(2) and NSE values equal to 0.91 and RMSD = 0.469 mm d(-1). SAFER also showed good performance (r(2) = 0.86) after validation, with the lowest RMSD (0.58 mm d(-1)) values for the set of 14 center pivots in this growing season. The results support the use of calibrated SAFER algorithm as a tool for estimating water consumption in irrigated corn fields in semiarid conditions.

TI  - Geomorphological and Climatic Drivers of Thermokarst Lake Area Increase Trend (1999-2018) in the Kolyma Lowland Yedoma Region, North-Eastern Siberia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermokarst lakes are widespread in Arctic lowlands. Under a warming climate, landscapes with highly ice-rich Yedoma Ice Complex (IC) deposits are particularly vulnerable, and thermokarst lake area dynamics serve as an indicator for their response to climate change. We conducted lake change trend analysis for a 44,500 km(2) region of the Kolyma Lowland using Landsat imagery in conjunction with TanDEM-X digital elevation model and Quaternary Geology map data. We delineated yedoma-alas relief types with different yedoma fractions, serving as a base for geospatial analysis of lake area dynamics. We quantified lake changes over the 1999-2018 period using machine-learning-based classification of robust trends of multi-spectral indices of Landsat data and object-based long-term lake detection. We analyzed the lake area dynamics separately for 1999-2013 and 1999-2018 periods, including the most recent five years that were characterized by very high precipitation. Comparison of drained lake basin area with thermokarst lake extents reveal the overall limnicity decrease by 80% during the Holocene. Current climate warming and wetting in the region led to a lake area increase by 0.89% for the 1999-2013 period and an increase by 4.15% for the 1999-2018 period. We analyzed geomorphological factors impacting modern lake area changes for both periods such as lake size, elevation, and yedoma-alas relief type. We detected a lake area expansion trend in high yedoma fraction areas indicating ongoing Yedoma IC degradation by lake thermokarst. Our concept of differentiating yedoma-alas relief types helps to characterize landscape-scale lake area changes and could potentially be applied for refined assessments of greenhouse gas emissions in Yedoma regions. Comprehensive geomorphological inventories of Yedoma regions using geospatial data provide a better understanding of the extent of thermokarst processes during the Holocene and the pre-conditioning of modern thermokarst lake area dynamics.

AB  - The peculiarities of the world model and the human model in the Eastern European music art of the postmodern era were revealed. The research is based on a hermeneutical analysis of the contemporary Russian and Ukrainian composers' works. The research method builds on the systematic and historical approaches. It allows to consider the individual musical text as a subsystem of a higher order system. The sociocultural context was considered. The scientific novelty consists in revealing the specifics of the Eastern European artists' worldview of the last third of the XX and beginning of the XXI centuries. It is the consequence of studying their creativity in an anthropological dimension. The anthropological essence of the music of contemporary Ukrainian and Russian composers lies in a certain inconsistent polarity. The polarity is represented by the ironic and fragmented worldview combined with the religious quest. The awareness of the chaos and apocalyptic culture is combined with the religious support in its various manifestations. Therefore, the character in modern music has a dual essence. He is both marginal and a personality with strong spiritual support. In the works of contemporary Russian and Ukrainian composers, two postmodern worldview poles are organically combined: a destructive worldview and a desire for harmony. This polarity is caused by the crisis mentality of the modern post-totalitarian society.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 data in the early recognition of irrigated areas in central Italy
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of various remote sensing (RS) data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8) in the early recognition of irrigated areas in a densely cultivated area of central Italy. The study was based on crop data collected on more than 2000 plots in 2016 and 2017, characterized by quite different climatic conditions. The different RS data sources were used both alone and combined and with precipitation to define corresponding random forest (RF) classifiers whose overall accuracy (OA) was assessed by gradually increasing the number of available features from the beginning of the irrigation season. All tested RF classifiers reach stable OAs (OA 0.9) after 7-8 weeks from the start of the irrigation season. The performance of the radar indexes slightly improves when used in combination with precipitation data, but three weeks of features are required to obtain OA above 80%. The optical indices alone (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) reach OA similar to 85% in the first week of observation. However, they are ineffective in cloudy conditions or when rainfed and irrigated fields have similar vigour. The most effective and robust indices are those based on combined sources (radar, optical, and meteorological), allowing OAs of about 92% and 96% at the beginning and in the middle of the irrigation season, respectively.

AB  - The Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments are on-board the Aqua and Terra spacecraft, launched in 2002 and 1999, respectively. Since beginning operation, they have continued to collect valuable remote sensing data of the Earth in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelengths from 0.41 to 14.5 mu m. The Level 1B (L1B) algorithm produces calibrated top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances for each Earth-view (EV) pixel and calibrated TOA reflectances for the reflective solar bands using geo-located, uncalibrated instrument data and calibration look up tables (LUTs) produced regularly by the MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST). The L1B algorithm also calculates an uncertainty value for each EV pixel. The calibrated radiance and reflectance products are used to generate higher-level science products. A separate L1B code version is maintained for both MODIS instruments so that sensor specific issues can be handled individually. The current L1B algorithm version produces the Collection 6.1 (C6.1) products and was released in 2017. An overview of the C6.1 algorithm is provided together with improvements made since its release. Also discussed briefly are the planned improvements in the Collection 7 L1B algorithm.

TI  - Space for society: How Eurisy's activities and research support publicawareness raising on satellite applications in meeting societal needs
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - When we talk about Space, our interlocutors think about planets, stars, asteroids, astronauts and, sometimes satellites. But, only a small percentage is aware of what satellite technology can do and the relevance of satellite applications in our everyday life. From satellite communication, to navigation and to earth imagery, satellites data and technology are contributing in improving our daily life, or businesses or helping the management of our cities. Often, the end users come across an obstacle in communicating their needs to the service providers. On the other side, the service providers themselves are not fully aware how to communicate with the end-users. In some cases, this lack of communication makes difficult to meet the demand of space applications from the user side with the supply from the service providers. Eurisy, an association of space agencies established thirty years ago, works to put the end users at the core of the space value chain. In this last decades, Eurisy has been attentive and responsive to the changes of the space sector trying to picture how end users are becoming familiar with space technology. In particular, how the democratisation of space is turning space, especially satellite technology, into an enabler to guarantee the development of a sustainable living, accessible to everyone. Eurisy recently started a review of the case studies collected over the last ten years thanks to direct testimonials, event and conferences, publications and surveys. The user-centred approach adopted is innovative in the space sector and over the years proved to be effective in connecting users and service providers in different contexts. The paper aims at: 1-Identifying challenges and barriers that characterise the relations between service and/or information providers and end users. 2- Analysing the changes occurred in the relations between end users and service providers from 2007 to date in Europe. 3- Presenting the reasons that motivates the use of satellite data and technologies and which of these is the most used. 4- Presenting Eurisy's approach as an applicable model outside the European borders and the benefits deriving from connecting space and society. Furthermore, the paper will briefly present the ongoing activities as examples of the work put in place by the organisation and how the user-centred approach is applied.

CP  - 13th European Conference on Precision Agriculture (ECPA)
CL  - Budapest, HUNGARY
AB  - The aim of the work was to investigate the applicability of the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) in mapping the moisture content within an agricultural field. The study area was situated in Hungary and consisted of 2 fields with total area of 224 ha. The OPTRAM-based surface soil moisture estimates were compared with soil moisture ground truth data. The estimated moisture values (W) were significantly correlated with the in situ measurements values (R-2 =0.74). The model was also used to detect the soil moisture content change after large rainfalls. According to the results of the study, the variability of soil moisture within a field can be clearly detected and its changes over time can be mapped by using OPTRAM model.

TI  - PRECIOUS METALS IN THE WORLDVIEW SYSTEM OF ANCIENT IRANIAN-SPEAKING PEOPLES ON THE TEXTS OF AVESTA
T2  - ARHEOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - An overview and contextual-semantic analysis of the cases of usage the lexeme 'gold' (zaraniia-) and 'silver' in corpus of Avestan sources (Yasna, Yashts, Videvdat, Aogamadaeca, etc.) are provided in the article. 'Gold' is used in the Avesta 101 times. 'Silver' - only 12 uses, while this metal is always contextually linked with gold. Silver has a semantic connection with the aquatic sphere. Gold is the material from which, according to the texts, the garments of several deities are made (Vayu, Aredvi Sum (partially)). Gold attributes or decorated with this metal tools have a number of gods and heroes (Yima, Mithra, Verethragna, Tishtria, Sraosha) are made completely or partially from it. In the myth of Yuna, the divine instruments, the golden su beta ra and gilded astra, are endowed with reproductive features and help to create the first kingdom (Videvdat 2.6-38). This ideal mythical world turns into the Afterworld. A set of semantic attributes show that gold is directly related to the Otherworld, where the souls of the righteous deceased receive gold places, golden or silver clothes (Videvdat 19.31-32; Aog. 12, 17). The fact that silver and other "colors" are added to gold may indicate the expansion of the spectrum of precious metals and their penetration into the sphere of limeral beliefs. In the treatise of Aogemadaeca (84), silver-gold (a metaphor of wealth), along with cattle, horses and bravery, is included in the system of concepts related to the Thanatological worldview of the pre-Zoroastrian representations of ancient Iranian tribes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to analyse epidemiological and clinical characteristics of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults before and after the introduction of the general childhood conjugate pneumococcal vaccination programme in the Czech Republic.Material and Methods: The retrospective observational sentinel study included adults with IPD admitted to the Na Bulovce Hospital in Prague from 1/2000 through 12/2019. A case of IPD was defined as isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from a primarily sterile site.Results: A total of 304 IPD cases were diagnosed during the study period, with a male to female ratio of 1.49:1 and age median of 58 years (IQR 43-73). The most prevalent clinical forms were bacteraemic pneumonia (185 cases; 60.9%) and purulent meningitis (90; 29.6%). A total of 157/293 patients (53.6%) required intensive care, and the case fatality rate was 25.3% (n = 77). The serotype was determined in 292 (96.0%) isolates, the most prevalent being serotypes 3 (38; 12.5%), 4 (28; 9.2%), 7F (24; 7.9%), 8 (21; 6.9%), and 1 (18; 5.9%). Both clinical and epidemiological characteristics of IPD caused by the most prevalent serotypes differed considerably. Patients diagnosed with serotype 3 were older, more frequently required intensive care, and showed higher mortality. The proportion of IPD caused by non-PCV13 serotypes increased from 28.8% (19/66) in 2000-2005 to 54.8% (40/70) in 2015-2019 (p = 0.001).Conclusion: The study demonstrated that invasive diseases caused by the most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes differ in their epidemiological and clinical characteristics and case fatality rate. During the study period, there was a significant increase in IPD caused by non-PCV 13 serotypes, limiting the effect of vaccination in adults.

TI  - Extrapolating forest canopy cover by combining airborne LiDAR and Landsat data: The case of the Yeste Fire (Spain)
T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS XII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XII / SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Wildfires play a key role on forest composition and structure in the Mediterranean biomes. Hence, Mediterranean species are adapted to fire, developing ecological strategies to naturally recover. Nevertheless, climate change impacts and land use changes are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme wildfire events, endangering forest resilience to fire. Combining LiDAR and Landsat data provides a valuable opportunity to temporally extend detailed information on the forest structure. This study attempts to evaluate the feasibility of extrapolating LiDAR-derived canopy cover variables, as indicators of vegetation recovery, to Landsat time-series using Support Vector Regression (SVR) in a large forest fire. Canopy Cover (CC) and Canopy Cover above 2 m (CC2m) were derived from LiDAR data acquired in 2009 and 2016 from the National Plan for Aerial Orthophotography of Spain (PNOA) and time-series of annual Landsat composites for the period 1990-2020 were generated through the Google Earth Engine platform. We calibrated a SVR model from a stratified random sample using a 60% of the sample from 2016 for calibrating and the remaining 40% from both 2016 and 2009 for spatial and temporal validation, respectively. The two canopy cover variables yielded highly acceptable accuracy, with an R-2 of 0.78 (CC) and 0.64 (CC2m), and an RMSE around 12.5-15% for the spatial validation, and with an R-2 of 0.74 (CC) and 0.51 (CC2m), and an RMSE around 14-16.5% for the temporal validation. These results ensure the applicability of the extrapolation of the LiDAR-derived canopy cover variables to Landsat time-series.

AB  - Based on the ecological utopianism of Narodnik thinkers, this article assesses the programmatic concept of ecological neo-narodnism, as put forth by Martinez-Alier (1987), addressing (1) to what extent it conforms to the intellectual legacy of the Narodniki? (2) what are its main theoretical foundations and policy recommendations for a peasant economy in the 21st century? and (3) how it contributes to contemporary social and environmental challenges. It explores in detail the ecological economic theories which can be applied to the peasant economy according to the ideology of ecological neo-narodnism, the latter analyzed from the perspectives of the fields of political economy and political ecology. Peasant movements are addressed as the manifestation of such a worldview. Finally, the contributions of ecological neo-narodnism to overcome current social and environmental challenges are discussed and associated with economic degrowth.

AB  - In recent years there has been a growing interest in detecting, delimit and inventory wetlands under an ecohydrogeomorphic approach to expand the knowledge of these ecosystems and enable the development of management guidelines for their use. The aim of this article is detect and delimit those sectors that reflect favorable ecohydrogeomorphic conditions to define them as wetlands in a sector of the Alsina basin located in the southwest of the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. A complementary methodology was applied between optiand radar images, consisting of the use of a digital AlosPalsar elevation model and Sentinel 2 A and Sentinel 1 images. A flood pulse was addressed in the shallow lake that occurred in 2017. The wet events reflect the operation of the shallow lake and the wetland systems. Biophysical changes that occurred in the perilaguna sectors were analyzed in reference to the entry of precipitations. The results verified the presence of different types of wetlands between the shallow lake and its perilagunar area that during a flood function as a hybrid ecosystem.

TI  - FORMATION OF CONCEPTUAL PRINCIPLES AND ARSENAL OF ASYMMETRIC ("HYBRID") WARFARE DURING THE PERIOD OF INTERBLOC MILITARY AND POLITICAL CONFRONTATION IN THE WORLD (1946 - 1990)
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to identify the formation of a set of conceptual principles during the period of the "Cold War", global confrontation in the world and the collapse of the world colonial system, of relevant military and political structures and specific strategies, forms and methods of military and special activities, which formed the basis of doctrines and arsenal of modern asymmetric ("hybrid", unconventional) conflict. The methodological basis of the work is based on the methods of classification, typology, structural-system, historical and comparative, historical and typological, historical and genetic methods, methods of military and special science, security science, political conflictology. The scientific novelty of the study consists in the authors' attempt to study systematically, on the historical material of the period of the "Cold War", the formation of doctrinal preconditions and strategy, a set of special structures and methods of destructive activity, which found their structured embodiment in "hybrid" conflicts at the beginning of the XXIst century. The Conclusions. During "World War III" or "Cold War" (1946 - 1990) paradigms, forms and methods of hybrid confrontation, its doctrinal and conceptual principles, and the relevant theoretical and methodological, scientific, practical and technological principles achieved unprecedented development. Special services and affiliated with them "non-governmental" and paramilitary (irregular) structures, specialized analytical, forecasting and research centers, media structures became able to influence purposefully the change of political reality in the national, interstate and transnational dimensions.There was a qualitative improvement of Special Forces which became an important (sometimes decisive) factor in local wars and armed conflicts, participation in complex special operations, the deployment of controlled irregular armed formations. A new qualitative stage in the organization of "elite troops" began - their reorganization into special operations forces as autonomous component of the armed forces. As part of SOF, units (structures) of information and psychological struggle and work with civilian population were further developed.During the period of inter-bloc confrontation in the post war world, the core of which was the psychological war, significant and growing importance acquired the methods (mechanisms) of influence on the sphere of controlling collective activity of people, reformatting the mass consciousness and worldview by manipulating human consciousness and creating virtual reality by means of modern information and socio-cultural technologies.On the basis of the powerful legacy of the planetary confrontation of social systems and the inter bloc confrontation of 1946 - 1990 numerous strategic, tactical and technological, and information cognitive preconditions for the formation of a new qualitative type of conflict developed - "hybrid", in the sense of synthesizing various new forms and methods of destructive activity, and their complex and coordinated application.Such essential features of "hybrid" confrontation developed as lack of registration in accordance with international law of war, use of anti-government organizations and movements, illegal armed formations, separatist movements, extremist groups, destructive communities, etc., a priority role of special services, special operations forces, use of other methods of non-military pressure on the victim state, including diplomatic, financial and economic, humanitarian and the others. The main driving forces of the asymmetric strategy were non-governmental organizations, insurgent and "opposition" movements, special operations forces, means and forces of psychological operations, and the focus in the strategy shifted in favor of special operations and low intensity conflicts.

AB  - Relevance of the research is conditioned by the growth of competition on the space services market, determined by the increase in competitiveness of the services being sold due to the efficiency of economic processes at all stages of their life cycle: service development planning, development of the service, launch of the service on the market, increase in the volume of service sales, market saturation, reduction of sales. The most important stage of the space service life cycle is the stage of its creation by an organization, which, as a rule, has competences in developing methods and algorithms of remote sensing data processing and other satellite information resources. The availability of resource support to create radical innovations underlying the development of highly competitive satellite services is determined by the scientific and technological potential of the developing organization, i.e. a combination of different types of resources and factors, including production, technological, financial and economic, intellectual, research and other resources needed for innovation activities. Due to this, in the article we see a model of an economical assessment of the satellite services with the consideration of their life cycles and the type of resources used in such a process. They also take into account the influence of the competitive costs and the competitive edge of the services. The proposed method of assessment of resource support uses the known cost of development of basic provided services as initial information for the development of new remote sensing services depending on the target technical characteristics.

TI  - Prediction of Land Use and Land Cover Changes in Mumbai City, India, Using Remote Sensing Data and a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network-Based Markov Chain Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, prediction of the future land use land cover (LULC) changes over Mumbai and its surrounding region, India, was conducted to have reference information in urban development. To obtain the historical dynamics of the LULC, a supervised classification algorithm was applied to the Landsat images of 1992, 2002, and 2011. Based on spatial drivers and LULC of 1992 and 2002, the multiple perceptron neural network (MLPNN)-based Markov chain model (MCM) was applied to simulate the LULC in 2011, which was further validated using kappa statistics. Thereafter, by using 2002 and 2011 LULC, MLPNN-MCM was applied to predict the LULC in 2050. This study predicted the prompt urban growth over the suburban regions of Mumbai, which shows, by 2050, the Urban class will occupy 46.87% (1328.77 km(2)) of the entire study area. As compared to the LULC in 2011, the Urban and Forest areas in 2050 will increase by 14.31% and 2.05%, respectively, while the area under the Agriculture/Sparsely Vegetated and Barren land will decline by 16.87%. The class of water and the coastal feature will experience minute fluctuations (<1%) in the future. The predicted LULC for 2050 can be used as a thematic map in various climatic, environmental, and urban planning models to achieve the aims of sustainable development over the region.

AB  - Information systems development (ISD) project control has been traditionally seen as a tool against agency concerns, i.e. to align the interests of project participants with the organization's interests. However, this perspective barely fits into the agile worldview. Agile methods, that became popular choices for ISD projects, shifted away from the commander role of project leaders, and propagate the importance of collaboration and facilitation. Therefore, it became ambiguous why project managers of agile ISD projects engage in control activities. This qualitative study employs the "Gioia method" to investigate managerial reasons for these exercises and draws attention to the range of problems and needs these procedures can address. The analysis found that control mechanisms are enacted not only due to agency concerns, but also to enhance cooperation and communication, to signal to senior management and to become isomorphic with other projects.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, droughts, water shortages, and saltwater intrusion have caused bad effects on the socio-economic and livelihood. Weather and hydrological conditions dynamically change during the time that makes a single sensor data impossible for natural disasters such as flood and drought monitoring and management. Multi- sensor data can be applied for data integration and analysis for these applications. In this research, different remote sensing satellite platforms as microwave sensors as Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) topographic data, Sentinel-1B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), optical sensor as QuickBird data (GoogleEarth Pro) are integrated with ground survey echo-sounder and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data in real-time kinematic (RTK) mode. This research demonstrates the available data sources and free software functions for remote sensing and GIS analysis for a case study of Huai Prue Reservoir in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand. Water areas are temporal identified, analyzed, and compared based on SRTM data and Sentinel-1B SAR data with ground survey and echo-sounder, linking positioning using GNSS data. The topographic maps of these changes are presented for visual assessment.Disciplinary: Civil Engineering (Hydrology), Geomatics and Spatial Technology (Navigation Application, Remote Sensing).

T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The images of the Others are an integral part of the folklore worldview, also they play a significant role in the (self) identification of ethnic and confessional groups. Folk ideas about the confessional characteristics of the Others, as well as a set of features that allowed to mark them as the Others are formed in the course of direct communication. The article examines the formation and transformation of ideas about a confessional Other in a mono-ethnic and poly-confessional environment, using the example of Old-Believers Wanderers who lived in the Udorskii and Troitsko-Pechorskii districts of the Komi Republic. The article based on the archival data and field materials of folklore and ethnographic' expeditions that took place in the early 2000s.The emergence of Wanderers, who were positioning themselves as keepers of the "true faith", and striving to limit contacts with non-Wanderers as much as possible, became the impetus for singling out this group as confessional Others. On the upper Pechora, where at the time of our research Wanderer's communities existed, the ideological confrontation between different groups of believers were still persisted, that was reflected in various local nomination of Wanderers. On Udora, where the followers of the Wanderers disappeared in the 1970s, an outer nomination of this confessional group was widely used, which had no evaluative connotations.Their religious practices had a decisive influence on the formation of perceptions of the Wanderers as Others. The key indicator that characterizes the essence of the religion of the Wanderers in the eyes of their confessional neighbors, as for Wanderers themselves, was "flight from the world" - a complete refusal to participate in state and social life, and to have any interaction with representatives of the other faith. No less significant for the system of ideas about this group were the features of the funeral rituals (secret funerals of Udora' Wanderers) and ritual of baptism (baptism in old age). The closedness of the daily and ritual life of the Wanderers contributed to the spread of rumors, which compensated the lack of information. Objective changes of the reality (the disappearance of Wanderers communities of Udora, the change in the age structure of the communities) led to changes and adjustments of the existing ideas.

AB  - Introduction: the traditional worldview of the Khanty and Mansi peoples has been undergoing transformation over the past two centuries. It can be considered as a gradual erosion of the semantic "core" of the Ob-Ugric culture, which also includes the ideas associated with reincarnation. On the other hand, these changes are an expression of the modern development of indigenous ethnic groups, choosing for themselves the strategy that allows them to fit into the modern common human culture, responding to the challenges of the era of globalization.Objective: to determine the degree of preservation of traditional Ob-Ugric beliefs associated with reincarnation in the first decades of the XXI century.Research materials: the results of a survey conducted among representatives of the Ob Ugrians in 2017-2018.Results and novelty of the research: the work is a continuation of the author's research on the traditions of reincarnation in the culture of the Khanty and Mansi peoples. The study of their current state on the basis of a social survey was conducted for the first time, which showed that the traditions associated with the reincarnation are practiced sporadically. Their deeper knowledge is typical for the elderly, while a significant part of the youth is poorly informed. The source of knowledge about reincarnation is a family, as well as literature and the media.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study is to develop interactive spruce stands map of two model landscapes of the Moscow region, Russia (Istrinsky and Luzgarinsky) considering the foci of insects' mass reproduction. The studies were carried out in 2016, in the Moscow region (Russia). For comparative analysis of spruce forests and stands for the Istrinsky and Luzgarinsky landscape, an interactive map based on Landsat satellite images has been developed, and cartographic data from 1991 to 2016 has been analyzed. The survey was carried out on a model area of 190 hectares in Kurilovo (Moscow region) at an altitude of 300 m using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Ptero-E. The processing of satellite images showed an unequal decrease in forest cover for the spruce forests and stands during 1991-2016, namely from 53% to 44% and from 73% to 70% in the Istrinsky and Luzgarinsky landscape, respectively. The data obtained with the UAV helped to determine the area affected by the bark beetle (Ips typographus), one of the most destructive pests of spruce trees, especially those that are over 70 years old: 3.2 out of 93.6 hectares of the total area of spruce forests. The short-term productivity and conditional inference forests decreased in area by 67% during 1991-2016, while long-term productivity -only by 28%.

AB  - Over the last decade, climate change has impacted Earths' atmosphere and environment more than anytime before. Glaciers are the most sensitive indicators of its impact. In this work, we model a glacier's evolution by applying computer vision algorithms on high-resolution satellite imagery. We detect changes in the ice coverage movement by applying a dense optical flow algorithm over an image time series covering a particular scene (region) and processed to extract the NDSI. We perform tests on the Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn (JAB) glacier in the Swiss Alps. Our results show that we are able to obtain relevant information by computing motion vectors across time. Furthermore, we observe small differences between our predicted NDSI and the observed values demonstrating the efficiency of the approach.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article concerns the changes in the definition of the word 1)riest" in encyclopedias and lexicographical works in the course of shaping of the European culture of Modernity. The article argues that the notion of sacrum (as related to God), which directly correlated with the position of priest and defined its meaning until the 17th century, later, through the 18th century, was replaced by the notion of the community, in which the priest performs some cultic functions. The definitions of Enlightenment partly discredited the priestly power and position often representing them as dangerous for society and contradicting the civic duty of the priest. This shift is interpreted as reflecting the main changes in the modern worldview, when the hierarchical unity of social and cosmological orders was replaced by the functional understanding of society.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface mining represents the dominant driver of land coverage changes in the Jiu Valley mining area in Romania. Detecting and quantifying active mines and reclaimed areas are very important tasks given the effects of surface mining on the environment. In this paper, Landsat imagery for the years 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2017 was used to map the extent of surface mining and reclamation in the Jiu Valley mining area. The satellite images were classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to map land cover classes, including mined areas, and post-classification comparison (PCC) technique to track changes through time. In order to identify and quantify active mines and reclaimed areas of mined areas, we used indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index-2 (MSAVI-2). For the entire area studied, during the period 1988-2017, the extent of surface mining was 6.5%, with peaks in the periods 1988-1998 and 1998-2008, namely, 205.2% and 4.0%, respectively, as a result of the extension of surface exploitation as distinct from that underground. Land cover conversion to mined areas was almost exclusively from agricultural, forest, and pasture. The results show that NDVI estimated the largest surfaces with active mines, reclaimed grassland, and reclaimed woodland, within the mined areas. SAVI and MSAVI-2 estimated larger surfaces classified as reclaimed forest. As a result of the expansion of surface mining areas, the landscape was considerably degraded through mining scars, landscape fragmentation, degradation, and pollution. However, during the past few years, reclamation activity has intensified in the affected areas through the occurrence of spontaneous vegetation, but also through forestation.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The author analyses the understanding of crime and punishment of Lev Shestov, a Russian religious existential philosopher. The study is based on Shestov's early publications in the Kiev newspaper Life and Art that was run by the earlier generation of Russian socialists known as Narodniks. In his early articles, published in 1895-1900, the future philosopher opens up as a literary critic, spiritually close to the leaders of the 60s, preaching humanism and love to humankind, and as a journalist, who writes on legal and social and economic topics. Shestov opposes violence in all its forms: revolutions, wars, and the principle of criminal repression in the name of respect for human rights and the protection of human dignity. He supports the liberal reforms of Alexander II, the Tsar-Liberator, the launching of jury trials (as a progressive form of legal proceedings), advocates for the institution of suspended sentences. Based on previously unknown Shestov's articles, the author traces how the beliefs of the philosopher evolved, transformed and were "reborn" from Narodnik to religious and existential philosophy. The article reflects the main stages of the philosopher's worldview evolution, encompasses his views from Narodnik to Nietzscheanism and existential type religious philosophy, studies the transformation of his views, as a result of which he "overcomes" the ethics and follows the route of philosophy of tragedy and immoralism. The article analyses the origins of his ideas, examines the influence of thinkers and philosophers who were close to Shestov (among them Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Nietzsche, Shakespeare, Luther, Kierkegaard), observes his method of reading and constructing texts (" peregrination through souls"). In his latest works, Shestov rejects projects of rational reorganization of society... thinks the law and any moral regulations and norms should be overcome. Laws for Shestov do not have love and mercy, they indicate a desire for justice, but human justice is not related to the divine. The only "law" for Shestov is the commandment that "man is the measure of all things".

AB  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a powerful remote sensing method for measuring and monitoring surface displacements on the Earth's surface. With the launches of Sentinel-1A and 1B, C-band SAR data with a spatial resolution of 5x20 meters became freely available. This study investigates the applicability of freely available Sentinel-1 radar data for supporting assessment of infrastructure assets within the ASFINAG road network. While the absence of consistently reflecting objects remains a limiting factor in open areas, measuring points are well detected at prominent features and corresponding deformation rates can be derived. At the same time, certain challenges related to selection of reference points, phase unwrapping, topographic phase correction and atmospheric correction still need to be overcome. The application with freely available Sentinel-1 data is tested for the first time on a prestressed concrete bridge in the alpine region.

AB  - The effects of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation on life on Earth differ greatly. While overexposure to UV rays is harmful, small amounts of exposure are necessary for the synthesis of Vitamin D and good health. To optimize individual exposure to solar UV, it is therefore crucial to use UV data sources representative for entire populations and realistically accounting for various influencing factors. A UV climatology for Switzerland based on satellite data has been developed to provide risk estimates at population level. An algorithm generating ground based radiation estimate has been transformed from the visible to the UV wavelength domain by adapting both a clear-sky radiation transfer model and a cloud modification factor model using satellite imagery.The algorithm allows the computation of global UV erythemal irradiance at a spatial resolution of 1.5 - 2 km and an hourly temporal resolution over fifteen years. A validation, conducted with measurements from three meteorological stations over ten years, showed that the expanded uncertainty for low hourly UVI values (UVI > 3) is about 0.3, while for high hourly UVI values (UVI > 6) it can go up to +/- 1.5. In clear-sky situation, the uncertainty is in the range of 10-15%.The climatology developed allows to visualise potential UV exposure at regional and national scale. National prevention intervention could use new strategies to better focus on populations at risk and better tailor available researches. The UV climatology allows a high versatility in adapting the data extraction to the goal of studies using it. Further tailored data extraction and analysis will be necessary to exploit this climatology in a wide range of environmental and occupational health applications. Its development was focused on Switzerland, but the techniques used can be extended globally.

TI  - Assessing Leaf Biomass of <i>Agave sisalana</i> Using Sentinel-2 Vegetation Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass is a principal variable in crop monitoring and management and in assessing carbon cycling. Remote sensing combined with field measurements can be used to estimate biomass over large areas. This study assessed leaf biomass of Agave sisalana (sisal), a perennial crop whose leaves are grown for fibre production in tropical and subtropical regions. Furthermore, the residue from fibre production can be used to produce bioenergy through anaerobic digestion. First, biomass was estimated for 58 field plots using an allometric approach. Then, Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery was used to model biomass in an 8851-ha plantation in semi-arid south-eastern Kenya. Generalised Additive Models were employed to explore how well biomass was explained by various spectral vegetation indices (VIs). The highest performance (explained deviance = 76%, RMSE = 5.15 Mg ha(-1)) was achieved with ratio and normalised difference VIs based on the green (R560), red-edge (R740 and R783), and near-infrared (R865) spectral bands. Heterogeneity of ground vegetation and resulting background effects seemed to limit model performance. The best performing VI (R740/R783) was used to predict plantation biomass that ranged from 0 to 46.7 Mg ha(-1) (mean biomass 10.6 Mg ha(-1)). The modelling showed that multispectral data are suitable for assessing sisal leaf biomass at the plantation level and in individual blocks. Although these results demonstrate the value of Sentinel-2 red-edge bands at 20-m resolution, the difference from the best model based on green and near-infrared bands at 10-m resolution was rather small.

TI  - The impact of aeration on ecological state of lake Telbyn in Kyiv
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Telbyn is considered to be one of the largest lakes located in the eastern part of Kyiv. The artificial aeration of this lake was started at the end of 2016 by using of 8 aerators, which has been continuing so far. The main perpose of this measure is improving the ecological state of the lake mostly for recreational use. There were carried out a field study of the lake and the analysis of remote sensing data. Physical and chemical characteristics of water, phytoplankton biomass, chlorophyll a concentration and some other parameters at the different depths were studied. It was found out that artificial aeration has a positive effect on the ecological state of the lake. The water aeration causes the blur of thermocline whereas the impact on its depth is not essential. Under impact of aeration the concentration of dissolved oxygen become larger, mostly in the bottom layer. The highest concentration of ammonium nitrogen in a warm period is observed in the bottom layer of the lake. The deep location of aerators causes the increasing of concentration in bottom layer. At the same time there is not visible impact on concentration near the surface. The similar result was obtained for the concentration of inorganic phosphorus. The impact of aeration on algal bloom is not such essential as on hydrochemical characteristics. The artificial aeration causes negative impact on the phytoplankton abundance and less effect on their biomass. It means the larger effect on the algae with small cells. In other words the aeration has larger impact on green algae than on blue-green ones. The use of remote sensing data showed that ecological state of Lake Telbyn during the aeration period improved comparably with other lakes of Kyiv. As a result of aeration, the view of water surface of the lake became more similar to water surface of the Dnipro River, which flows through the city.

AB  - According to the climate change and energy policy of the EU, each member state needed to identify and develop a series of energy efficient goals and regulations, of which buildings are a key element, in order to reach the set goals. However, Europe has numerous traditional buildings, which need permanent maintenance and refurbishment in order to fulfil the requirements of sustainability and use. When responsible bodies do spend money anyway, it seems logical and ecologically worthwhile to apply "soft" maintenance procedures, which save costs and also reduce energy consumption of traditional buildings in the long-run. Integrating these buildings into national climate change and energy policies seems therefore quite necessary and a challenge, as far as appropriate techniques and procedures are concerned, which can only be met through excellently trained professionals (e.g. architects, site and maintenance managers, craftspersons) and apprentices of the works concerned. PRO-Heritage (PROtect Traditional Built Heritage Skills) partners aim to offer initial and permanent education for professionals and craftspersons providing traditional competences and skills for built heritage, based on best practice of partner organisations. Additionally, PRO-Heritage is going to establish a structure and environment for regular journeyman's travel in Europe, in order to further support the exchange and safeguarding of competences and skills across Europe.

TI  - Indicative Lake Water Quality Assessment Using Remote Sensing Images-Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The major lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the socio-economic development of the world. On the other hand, there are also reports of reduced pollution levels. In this study, an indicative analysis is adopted to understand the effect of lockdown on the changes in the water quality parameters for Lake Hussain Sagar using two remote sensing techniques: (i) spectral reflectance (SR) and (ii) chromaticity analysis (Forel-Ule color Index (FUI) and Excitation Purity). The empirical relationships from earlier studies imply that (i) increase in SR values (band B2) indicates a reduction in Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) concentrations, and (ii) increase in FUI indicates an increase in Total Suspended Solids (TSS). The Landsat 8 OLI satellite images are adopted for comparison between (i) January to May of year 2020: the effect of lockdown on water quality, and (ii) March and April for years 2015 to 2020: historical variations in water quality. The results show notable changes in SR values and FUI due to lockdown compared to before lockdown and after unlock suggesting a significant reduction in lake water pollution. In addition, the historical variations within April suggest that the pollution levels are least in the year 2020.

TI  - MAPPING DEFORESTATION IN PERMANENT FOREST RESERVE OF PENINSULAR MALAYSIA WITH MULTI-TEMPORAL SAR IMAGERY AND U-NET BASED SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is the long-term or permanent conversion of forest land to other uses, such as agriculture, mining, and urban development. As a result, deforestation has catastrophic consequences for the environment, including the loss of biodiversity, disruption of clean water supplies, and the acceleration of climate change. According to statistics, the deforestation trend in developing countries is at an alarming rate including Malaysia where plantation activities are the primary cause of forest loss. Recent anecdotal studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the deep learning based (DL) approach in producing deforestation maps. However, there are limited studies concentrating on DL approach for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging due to complexity of the computational concepts of the method. The SAR imagery can be challenging to interpret but its all-weather and all-day capability can be critical in forest monitoring compared to optical imagery. Thus, in this study, we propose to map deforestation areas in Permanent Forest Reserve (HSK) using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data. Deep learning-based U-Net was employed to classify the SAR imagery as forest and non-forest due to its semantic segmentation capabilities. The experiment results showed that the proposed deep learning-based technique successfully achieved 0.993 of intersection over union (IoU) and 0.980 of overall accuracy (OA). Also, we explained the entire procedure from beginning to end as simple as possible for beginners to comprehend. In brief, the findings of this study have the potential to improve monitoring of damaged HSK areas, prioritize the restoration of the affected forest areas and protecting the forest lands from illegal deforestation activities.

TI  - Flooded Rice Paddy Detection Using Sentinel-1 and PlanetScope Data: A Case Study of the 2018 Spring Flood in West Java, Indonesia
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to detect flooded rice paddies in Indonesia using remotely sensed data from a relatively extensive flood that occurred in the Tegalluar area of Bojongsoang in the spring of 2018, which was observed by the Sentinel-1 and PlanetScope satellites. We propose an automatic thresholding method for the detection of flooded areas in rice paddy fields using Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquisitions from before and during flooding. The flood-detection accuracy was verified using visible and near-infrared images acquired by the PlanetScope satellites. The proposed method showed that the VV (transmit V and receive V polarizations) data outperformed the VH (transmit V and receive H polarizations) data in terms of correlation ratio and discriminant accuracy. The overall classification accuracy of the nonflooded and flooded areas reached 84.7% with the VV data and 80.6% with the VH data, including the error that resulted from the time difference in the data acquired by Sentinel-1 and PlanetScope. Utilizing speckle-reducing filters with SAR data was found to improve the overall classification accuracy by 5%.

AB  - Rice is one of the most significant food commodity products in Indonesia. The production of rice in 2019 reached 49.8 million tons. On a global scale, rice is consumed by half of the human population around the world. This study will support the development of sustainable natural resources management, which is an important thing to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals in zero poverty and zero hunger. Remote sensing is a useful instrument to monitor natural resources. This study used Sentinel-2 imageries to extract rice phenology using vegetation indices (NDVI and NDWI), then acquired the planting and harvesting time using the temporal analysis. The NDVI value is showing a parabolic curve regarding the planting stage of the rice. The value of NDVI is high in the transplanting stage but decreases in the harvesting phase. Besides that, in the seedling and transplanting stage, NDWI has a higher value than NDVI. However, in tillering until the harvesting phase, NDWI has a similar characteristic but lower value than NDVI. Based on the spatial and temporal distribution of rice planting and harvesting date, it is known that climate is not a resistant factor, especially the irrigated rice field. Nevertheless, in the rainfed rice field, the planting time depends on climate conditions.

AB  - The article presents previously unpublished letters written by Andrzej Walicki (15.05.1930-21.08.2020), a worldly renowned Polish historian of Russian thought, to Professor Michael Maslin, the head of the Department of the History of Russian Philosophy at Lomonosov Moscow State University. Walicki's letters (1997-2019) together with books, articles and other materials formed his gift to the abovementioned Department. Walicki himself referred to these materials as "my small Russian archive". The letters are written in excellent Russian and require no additional revision or stylistic improvement. This publication retains the letters in their full originality including some phrases of Polish origin. These unique epistles reveal Walicki's individual creative worldview. The letters contain new information about the details of Walicki's biography and his work in Poland, Russia, USA, Great Britain, Japan, Australia. The letters provide a unique perspective on the "flow of ideas", which was Walicki's personal conception of understanding and interpretation of the Russian intellectual history from the Enlightenment through the Russian religious and philosophical Renaissance of the twentieth century. The letters discuss his interactions with Sergei Gessen, Isaiah Berlin, Leszhek Kolakowski, Czeslaw Milosz, George Kline, James Scanlan, Leonard Shapiro, Martin Malia, Richard Pipes, Nicholas Riasanovsky, James Billington etc. A special attention is paid to the critique of the Western and especially Polish Russophobia based on various superstitions and stereotypes about Russia as well on a lack of knowledge, various kinds of bias and blunders. Of considerable interest are Walitsky's expert assessments of the general state of the scientific historiography of Russian philosophy, its fundamental differences from Soviet dogmatic Marxism, of which the Polish scientist was a consistent critic.

AB  - Floods cause large losses for society. The frequency of these events has been increasing in recent decades in different regions of the world as a consequence of the global climate change. In Argentina, Santa Fe city is vulnerable to the flooding of two major rivers, i.e. the Parana and the Salado-Juramento. For this reason, this paper aims to develop an online monitoring system for the metropolitan area of Santa Fe, in order to improve the response to a water risk. For this purpose, satellite information and the programming interface available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, were used here. The following indicators were evaluated to monitoring water excess: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the water ratio index (WRI), the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and the radar signal thresholding technique of the Sentinel 1 mission. The spatial-temporal behaviour of the indicators was analysed for the period 2016-2021, including the 2016 Parana River flood, to determine the monitoring capacity of the indicators studied. The results presented suggest that the proposed set of optical indices and the thresholding of the Sentinel 1 radar signal allow monitoring the evolution of flooded zones in the area of influence of the city of Santa Fe in near-real time.

TI  - Tree Species Classification of Forest Stands Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of forest stands is one of the fundamental properties of forests. Timely and accurately obtained stand distribution can help people better understand, manage, and utilize forests. The development of remote sensing technology has made it possible to map the distribution of tree species in a timely and accurate manner. At present, a large amount of remote sensing data have been accumulated, including high-spatial-resolution images, time-series images, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, etc. However, these data have not been fully utilized. To accurately identify the tree species of forest stands, various and complementary data need to be synthesized for classification. A curve matching based method called the fusion of spectral image and point data (FSP) algorithm was developed to fuse high-spatial-resolution images, time-series images, and LiDAR data for forest stand classification. In this method, the multispectral Sentinel-2 image and high-spatial-resolution aerial images were first fused. Then, the fused images were segmented to derive forest stands, which are the basic unit for classification. To extract features from forest stands, the gray histogram of each band was extracted from the aerial images. The average reflectance in each stand was calculated and stacked for the time-series images. The profile curve of forest structure was generated from the LiDAR data. Finally, the features of forest stands were compared with training samples using curve matching methods to derive the tree species. The developed method was tested in a forest farm to classify 11 tree species. The average accuracy of the FSP method for ten performances was between 0.900 and 0.913, and the maximum accuracy was 0.945. The experiments demonstrate that the FSP method is more accurate and stable than traditional machine learning classification methods.

AB  - Virtual Earth has become an effective tool for browsing geospatial data. These Virtual Reality based geospatial information systems, are successfully employed today for real-time visualization in such diverse fields as urban planning, city planning and architectural design. On the basis of experience of satellite stereo image processing, web-based service, and cloud data management system, we composed 3D geospatial visualization, automatic terrain models generation, massive satellite image tiling and other cutting-edge technologies and advanced concepts, in order to build an integrated platform of virtual Earth. This paper demonstrates design and implementation of this Geo Image Hub system with architecture, components and applications. The data processing approach uses multiview-stereo imagery from China's land observation satellites as a starting point, and the work focuses on ortho-rectification method and regularized elevation information extraction. A map service provided by the SIWEI Earth RESTful API is leveraged to access high resolution satellite images of nationwide coverage. The web-based application is deployed on ECS Cloud that runs the algorithms and presents the results. With remote sensing satellite data, visualization experiences can be extended beyond the simulated environment, feature realistic live mapping and provide valuable information.

TI  - A Novel Impervious Surface Extraction Method Integrating POI, Vehicle Trajectories, and Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces are essential elements for the urban ecological environment. Machine-learning-based approaches have achieved successful breakthroughs in impervious surface extraction. These methods require large sets of labeled impervious surface data to train a model. However, it is a challenge to acquire massive impervious surface sample data because of complexity, time consumption, and high cost. To address this issue, we explore a method to generate massive impervious surface training samples using point of interest (POI) data and vehicle trajectory global positioning system data. Furthermore, a neural-network-based method is proposed for impervious surface extraction based on the generated training samples. One Landsat-8 image of Shenzhen City, China, was selected to test our approach. The extraction accuracy of the impervious surface was 90.88%, and the overall accuracy based on this method was improved by 8.57% and 8.45% compared with the support vector data description and weighted one-class support vector machine methods, respectively. The results show that the method integrating POI, trajectory data, and satellite imagery can be a viable candidate for impervious surface extraction.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - According to historical records, land subsidence has been occurring in Xi'an, China, since the 1960s, characterized by complex land subsidence patterns. This subsidence has the potential to cause serious societal and economic problems during the process of urbanization. Long-term, large-scale monitoring and dynamic high precision tracking of the evolution of surface deformation associated with geohazards is a prerequisite for effective prevention or advance warning of geological disasters. Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR), a satellite remote sensing technology, can facilitate such monitoring. Both currently operating and planned SAR satellites would provide extensive amounts of SAR data. In this article, we describe an approach for continuously updating long-term multisensor InSAR deformation time series using robust sequential least squares. It is successfully applied to near-real-time monitoring of the long-term evolution of surface deformation in Xi'an, China, from January 3, 2007 to February 12, 2021, using four SAR satellites: ALOS/PALSAR-1, TerraSAR-X, ALOS/PALSAR-2, and Sentinel-1A. In order to analyze deformation evolution, temporal independent component analysis was used to interpret deformation patterns. We found that land subsidence in Xi'an has slowed and even halted in some areas. However, large areas are uplifting, which presents a potential for geohazards. We conclude that the proposed approach using continuously updated deformation time series from multisensor InSAR can provide near-real-time deformation measurements, which are necessary for an early warning system.

TI  - Land Cover Classification based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Feature-based Data Augmentation
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiation information is essential to land cover classification, but general deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) hardly use this to advantage. Additionally, the limited amount of available remote sensing data restricts the efficiency of DCNN models though this can be overcome by data augmentation. However, normal data augmentation methods, which only involve operations such as rotation and translation, have little effect on radiation information. These methods ignore the rich information contained in the image data. In this article, the authors propose a feasible feature-based data augmentation method, which extracts spectral features that can reflect radiation information as well as geometric and texture features that can reflect image information prior to augmentation. Through feature extraction, this method indirectly enhances radiation information and increases the utilization of image information. Classification accuracies show an improvement from 80.20% to 89.20%, which further verifies the effectiveness of this method. (C) 2021 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

TI  - Framework to Create Cloud-Free Remote Sensing Data Using Passenger Aircraft as the Platform
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud removal in optical remote sensing imagery is essential for many Earth observation applications. To recover the cloud obscured information, some preconditions must be satisfied. For example, the cloud must be semitransparent or relationships between contaminated and cloud-free pixels must be assumed. Due to the inherent imaging geometry features in satellite remote sensing, it is impossible to observe the ground under the clouds directly; therefore, cloud removal algorithms are always not perfect owing to the loss of ground truth. Recently, the use of passenger aircraft as a platform for remote sensing has been proposed by some researchers and institutes, including Airbus and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Passenger aircraft have the advantages of short visitation frequency and low cost. Additionally, because passenger aircraft fly at lower altitudes compared to satellites, they can observe the ground under the clouds at an oblique viewing angle. In this study, we examine the possibility of creating cloud-free remote sensing data by stacking multiangle images captured by passenger aircraft. To accomplish this, a processing framework is proposed, which includes four main steps: first, multiangle image acquisition from passenger aircraft, second, cloud detection based on deep learning semantic segmentation models, third, cloud removal by image stacking, and fourth, image quality enhancement via haze removal. This method is intended to remove cloud contamination without the requirements of reference images and predetermination of cloud types. The proposed method was tested in multiple case studies, wherein the resultant cloud- and haze-free orthophotos were visualized and quantitatively analyzed in various land cover type scenes. The results of the case studies demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high quality, cloud-free orthophotos. Therefore, we conclude that this framework has great potential for creating cloud-free remote sensing images when the cloud removal of satellite imagery is difficult or inaccurate.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of social economy, science and technology, the rapid development of Chinese cities has led to the great changes of regional society and economy. Reducing the adverse effects of economic growth and social progress on ecological environment landscape pattern and promoting the virtuous cycle of natural resource system and social economic system have become the social goals. Ecological environment landscape image feature extraction can provide timely and effective regional environment landscape information, which is important to analyze, predict and comprehensively evaluate the dynamic changes of landscape environment caused by the implementation of regional planning. In this paper, the Landsat-TM remote sensing images in 2010 and 2017 are used to extract and analyze the features of the remote sensing images by using the maximum likelihood classification method. The results show that the overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient of TM images in 2010 are 89.2409% and 0.8532, respectively, and the overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient of TM images in 2017 are 86.2134% and 0.8012, respectively. The deviation rate of classified data in 2010 and 2017 is not large. The deviation rate of woodland landscape is the smallest (2.89% for 2010 and 1.28% for 2017), followed by construction land landscape (3.54% for 2010 and 3.13% for 2017), and the deviation rate of other land landscape is the largest (7.85% for 2010 and 11.23% for 2017).

TI  - Estimating Daily Actual Evapotranspiration at a Landsat-Like Scale Utilizing Simulated and Remote Sensing Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ET) with high spatiotemporal resolution is very important for the research on agricultural water resource management and the water cycle processes, and it is helpful to realize precision agriculture and smart agriculture, and provides critical references for agricultural layout planning. Due to the impact of the clouds, weather environment, and the orbital period of optical satellite, there are difficulties in providing daily remote sensing data that are not contaminated by clouds for estimating daily ET with high spatial-temporal resolution. By improving the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), this manuscript proposes the method to fuse high temporal and low spatial resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model surface skin temperature (TSK) with the low temporal and high spatial resolution remote sensing surface temperature for obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution daily surface temperature to be used in the estimation of the high spatial resolution daily ET (ET_WRFHR). The distinction of this study from the previous literatures can be summarized as the novel application of the fusion of WRF-simulated TSK and remote sensing surface temperature, giving full play to the availability of model surface skin temperature data at any time and region, making up for the shortcomings of the remote sensing data, and combining the high spatial resolution of remote sensing data to obtain ET with high spatial (Landsat-like scale) and temporal (daily) resolution. The ET_WRFHR were cross-validated and quantitatively verified with MODIS ET products (MOD16) and observations (ET_Obs) from eddy covariance system. Results showed that ET_WRFHR not only better reflects the difference and dynamic evolution process of ET for different land types but also better identifies the details of various fine geographical objects. It also represented a high correlation with the ET_Obs by the R-2 amount reaching 0.9186. Besides, the RMSE and BIAS between ET_WRFHR and the ET_Obs are obtained as 0.77 mm/d and -0.08 mm/d respectively. High R-2, as well as the small RMSE and BIAS amounts, indicate that ET_WRFHR has achieved a very good performance.

TI  - Dryland Crop Classification Combining Multitype Features and Multitemporal Quad-Polarimetric RADARSAT-2 Imagery in Hebei Plain, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of dryland crop classification using satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is often unsatisfactory owing to the similar dielectric properties that exist between the crops and their surroundings. The main objective of this study was to improve the accuracy of dryland crop (maize and cotton) classification by combining multitype features and multitemporal polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images in Hebei plain, China. Three quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes were acquired between July and September 2018, from which 117 features were extracted using the Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi, and multiple-component polarization decomposition methods, together with two polarization matrices (i.e., the coherency matrix and the covariance matrix). Random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were used for classification of dryland crops and other land-cover types in this study. The accuracy of dryland crop classification using various single features and their combinations was compared for different imagery acquisition dates, and the performance of the two algorithms was evaluated quantitatively. The importance of all investigated features was assessed using the RF algorithm to optimize the features used and the imagery acquisition date for dryland crop classification. Results showed that the accuracy of dryland crop classification increases with evolution of the phenological period. In comparison with SVM, the RF algorithm showed better performance for dryland crop classification when using full polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data. Dryland crop classification accuracy was not improved substantially when using only backscattering intensity features or polarization decomposition parameters extracted from a single-date image. Satisfactory classification accuracy was achieved using 11 optimized features (derived from the Cloude-Pottier decomposition and the coherency matrix) from 2 RADARSAT-2 images (acquisition dates corresponding to the middle and late stages of dryland crop growth). This study provides an important reference for timely and accurate classification of dryland crop in Hebei plain, China.

AB  - Multispectral (MS) pan-sharpening aims at producing a high spatial resolution (HR) MS image by fusing a single-band HR panchromatic (PAN) image and a corresponding MS image with low spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous two-stream network (HTSNet) with hierarchical feature prefusion for MS pan-sharpening. The HTSNet employs a heterogeneous group of spatial and spectral streams for spatial and spectral information extraction, respectively. The spatial stream utilizes a 2D CNN for spatial information extraction from the PAN images, and the spectral stream obtains spectral feature cubes from the MS images by a 3D CNN. At the same time, a prefusion module is introduced to prefuse the spatial details with spectral information and transfer information between different streams, which can enhance later processing. In the experiment, the Gaofen-2 satellite dataset is utilized to compare the proposed method with the state-of-the-art MS pan-sharpening methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our HTSNet in terms of visual effect and quantitative qualities.

TI  - Mining Subsidence Prediction Parameter Inversion by Combining GNSS and DInSAR Deformation Measurements
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Line of Sight (LOS) deformation based on Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques cannot be used in traditional probability integration method (PIM) parameter inversion. To improve the accuracy of parameter inversion, a model based on 3D deformation was proposed. The model simulates 3D deformation using PIM directly. The inverse of the Sum of the Squared Errors (SSE) of the PIM results and the measured deformation results was used as a fitting function within the GA. Reliable PIM parameters can be obtained based on this GA model. To identify the surface movement law of the Jinfeng coal mine, 6 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) monitor points were established over the 011207 and 011809 working panels. Due to the limited number of points and the large distance between the points, it is not sufficient to obtain reliable PIM parameters using GNSS only. As a complement, 83 Sentinel-1A images were analyzed with small baseline subset (SBAS) DInSAR, and the LOS direction deformation was obtained. The reliable PIM parameters were calculated with the 3D inversion model based on the combination of LOS direction deformation and GNSS-monitored deformation. Then, those parameters were used to predict the coal mine deformation of panels 011207 and 011809, which demonstrated that the prediction results coincide with the measured results. The model can be used to study the laws of mining subsidence combined with DInSAR and GNSS, which can reduce the requirements of the number of GNSS points and the impact of radar decoherence. This provides a new technical approach for studying the law of surface movement in mining subsidence research.

TI  - Global NO<sub>2</sub> Dynamics During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparison Between Two Waves of the Coronavirus
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as one of the key pollutants in the atmosphere, is an important trace gas of traffic emissions or industrial activities. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic preventions have significantly reduced the emissions of NO2, which provided an opportunity to disentangling the contributions to global emissions in major epidemic regions. Here, we quantified the influences of lockdown measures on the NO2 concentration at a global scale during the two waves of the COVID-19 epidemic, and disentangled the relative contributions of the major epidemic regions (i.e., China, Europe, and USA) on the global NO2 densities due to the lockdown measures. Our results revealed that there was an evident decrease of global NO2 in 2020, especially in China, Europe, and USA. The global mean NO2 densities decreased approximately 2.1 and 3.9 mu mol/m(2) in the first and second waves of the epidemic. While in the Northern Hemisphere, NO2 densities decreased 6.6 mu mol/m(2) on average during the first stage of the epidemic, and a slight increase (i.e., 1.7 mu mol/m(2)) in the second wave of the epidemic. The magnitudes and durations of the second wave were much smaller than the first wave of the coronavirus infections. The strict lockdown measures implemented in China significantly decreased the NO2 concentration, which therefore the largest contributor in the first wave decreases of global average NO2 densities. Intervention at an early stage would be beneficial to the preventions of epidemic situation. Our study could provide references for economic loss assessments and economic recovery strategies during the stages ofpost-pandemic.

TI  - 3-D Force Sensing Strategy of Laryngeal Continuum Surgical Robot Based on Fiber Bragg Gratings
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The laryngeal tissue is sensitive to the operating force of the surgical instrument in the tissue resection. A large operating force may cause rupture of the vocal cords and surrounding tissues, which affect the patients' normal voice. However, a small operating force cannot achieve tissue resection. Based on experience, surgeons can estimate the operating force in the process of using a surgical robot. The estimated operating force is usually inaccurate, which may increase the failure rate of surgery. Therefore, a fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs)-based 3-D force sensing sensor for the surgical robot, which consists of two flexible hinges in series is designed. And the force sensing model is constructed through mechanical modeling and temperature decoupling algorithm. The experimental results show that the designed sensor has a resolution of 14.3, 9.7, and 13.8 mN for external forces F-x, F-y, and F-z, respectively. The proposed mechanism has good axial and lateral force sensing capability. In the experiment of simulating diseased tissue with the silicone-steel ball, the designed sensor can accurately determine the position of the steel ball, which verifies the effectiveness and feasibility of the designed FBG sensor in force perception.

TI  - Condom Use Consistency and Associated Factors Among College Student Men Who Have Sex with Men from Seven Colleges in Changsha City: A Cross-Sectional Survey
T2  - HIV AIDS-RESEARCH AND PALLIATIVE CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: College student men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV infection due to multiple social and behavioral factors. Consistent condom use is nationally advocated for HIV prevention. This study explored the sexual behaviors and factors associated with condom use consistency in the past six months among college student MSM from seven colleges in Hunan Province, China.Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from September 2017 to March 2018. Condom use consistency, sexual behaviors, HIV testing performance, substance use, and alcohol consumption were examined using researcher-created questionnaires. Condom use self-efficacy and HIV-related knowledge were assessed using the Condom Use Self-Efficacy Scale and the unified National AIDS Sentinel Surveillance Questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used. P <0.05 was considered significant.Results: In the 214 respondents, the rate of consistent condom use was 56% (n = 119) during the past six months. Participants who were studying at first-tier universities (odds ratio [OR]: 2.522, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.255-5.067) and had higher scores for condom use self-efficacy (OR: 2.617, 95% CI: 1.462-4.685) were more likely to report consistent condom use than the others. The risk factor was having suspicious symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (OR: 0.357, 95% CI: 0.163-0.780).Conclusion: Numerous students were at high risk of HIV infection with inconsistent condom use. Comprehensive and specific topics about safe sex education from parents and peers should be offered on campuses in China.

AB  - The Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (COCTS), as one of the key payloads onboard the Haiyang-1D (HY-1D) satellite, has infrared channels for global sea surface temperature (SST) monitoring. In this paper, a cross-comparison for the COCTS onboard HY1D, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua and iQuam data is applied for the SST validation. The results of the difference between COCTS and in-situ SST show a bias of -2.16 degrees C, a standard deviation of 1.04 degrees C, a median of -2.15 degrees C and a robust standard deviation of 1.21 degrees C for daytime, a bias of a -2.48 degrees C, a standard deviation of 0.92 degrees C, a median of -2.48 degrees C and a robust standard deviation of 1.09 degrees C for nighttime. And the results of the difference between COCTS and MODIS demonstrate a bias of -2.18 degrees C, a standard deviation of 0.88 degrees C, a median of -2.13 degrees C and a robust standard deviation of 1.03 degrees C. The results show that the COCTS shows a cooler SST than in-situ and MODIS SST. The sensor performance, cloud detection failure and the SST algorithms could contribute to the obvious errors. In future, more work should focus on the sensor performance and the SST algorithms to improve the HY-1D SST products accuracy.

AB  - The evaluation of forest fire damage degree is a particularly important operational need in carrying out forest fire rehabilitation work. Comparing to traditional evaluation methods, satellite remote sensing is faster and more effective with a larger field of view, which is supposed to be used to evaluate the degree of forest fire. The paper takes the forest fire of Datong Volcano Group Geopark on April 30, 2020 as the research object. Firstly, sentinel-2 satellite images were acquired before, during and after the fire periods, and the images were band synthesized and calculate the remote sensing index, and finally the change detection method was used to analyze the extent of forest damage after the fire. The results show that the combined short-wave infrared and near-infrared bands of sentinel-2 satellite can be used to detect the origin of fire and fire line. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) shows fire area intuitively and Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) shows how severe the forest is damaged. After the fire, the slightly damaged area is the largest and the extremely severely damaged area is the smallest and the damage evaluation can provide an effective technical method for subsequent forestry vegetation restoration and forest fire prevention.

TI  - Optimal Grain Size Based Landscape Pattern Analysis for Shanghai Using Landsat Images from 1998 to 2017
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - While they are an effective tool for studying landscape patterns and describing land-use change, landscape metrics are sensitive to variation in spatial grain sizes. It is therefore crucially important to select an optimal grain size for characterizing urban landscape patterns. Due to accelerated urbanization, Shanghai, the economic capital of China, has seen drastic changes in landscape patterns in recent decades and it would be interesting to take Shanghai as an example for examining the grain effect of landscape patterns. In this study, from Shanghai's land use maps derived from Landsat images of 1998, 2007, and 2017 via random forest classification, a selection of landscape metrics was measured with 14 grain sizes ranging from 30 m to 460 m. Both the conventional first scale domain method and the information loss evaluation model were adopted to comprehensively determine an optimal grain size for characterizing Shanghai's landscape pattern. After that, the land use dynamic degree model was used to explore the change in Shanghai's landscape pattern under the optimal grain size. Results demonstrate that (1) the responses of landscape metrics varied with grain size, which could be divided into three categories, namely irregular trend, decreasing trend, and no clear change; that (2) the optimal spatial grain size for landscape pattern analysis was 60 m; and that (3) the degree of landscape aggregation decreased, whereas that of landscape diversity and fragmentation increased. This study shows a clear grain effect of landscape patterns and can provide useful insights for urban landscape planning.

TI  - Soil Salinity Mapping Using Machine Learning Algorithms with the Sentinel-2 MSI in Arid Areas, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of soil salinization plays a key role in the ecological security and sustainable agricultural development of arid regions. As a branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning acquires new knowledge through self-learning and continuously improves its own performance. The purpose of this study is to combine Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data and MSI-derived covariates with measured soil salinity data and to apply three machine learning algorithms in modeling to estimate and map the soil salinity in the study sample area. According to the convenient transportation conditions, the study area and sampling quadrat were set up, and the 5-point method was used to collect the soil mixed samples, and 160 soil mixed samples were collected. Kennard-Stone (K-S) algorithm was used for sample classification, 70% for modeling and 30% for verification. The machine learning algorithm uses Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). The results showed that (1) the average reflectance of each band of the MSI data ranged from 0.21-0.28. According to the spectral characteristics corresponding to different soil electrical conductivity (EC) levels (1.07-79.6 dS m(-1)), the spectral reflectance of salinized soil in the MSI data ranged from 0.09-0.35. (2) The correlation coefficient between the MSI data and MSI-derived covariates and soil EC was moderate, and the correlation between certain MSI data sets and soil EC was not significant. (3) The SVM soil EC estimation model established with the MSI data set attained a higher performance and accuracy (R-2 = 0.88, root mean square error (RMSE) = 4.89 dS m(-1), and ratio of the performance to the interquartile range (RPIQ) = 1.96, standard error of the laboratory measurements to the standard error of the predictions (SEL/SEP) = 1.11) than those attained with the soil EC estimation models established with the RF and ANN models. (4) We applied the SVM soil EC estimation model to map the soil salinity in the study area, which showed that the farmland with higher altitudes discharged a large amount of salt to the surroundings due to long-term irrigation, and the secondary salinization of the farmland also caused a large amount of salt accumulation. This research provides a scientific basis for the simulation of soil salinization scenarios in arid areas in the future.

TI  - Image Navigation for FY-4A Lightning Mapping Imager
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Navigation of images from lightning mapping instruments in geostationary orbits is very important for data applications. However, few scientific peer-reviewed papers have been reported, except a few works in the prelaunch tests. On December 11, 2016, China launched the three-axis stabilized geostationary meteorological satellite Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), which carries a lightning mapping imager (LMI) onboard. LMI is now providing lightning observations above the equator at 104.7E and covers a large portion of the eastern Asian continent. In this article, a new method has been set up to perform the image navigation for FY-4A/LMI. First, landmarks were used to calculate thermal deformation parameters and edge-binding technique was proposed to solve the inconsistency between the two tubes' pointing directions. Second, temperatures of the mounting plate were used to be correlated with the daytime thermal deformation parameters to deduce the nighttime pointing directions when the landmarks were not available. Furthermore, the operational timetable for LMI was determined by analyzing the variations of navigation accuracy caused by the landmark observation interval and the sensor's integration time for landmarks. Analysis of about 9200 background images of 153 consecutive days from the housekeeping data were investigated to validate the proposed methods' accuracy for LMI image navigation. Compared to the baseline algorithm, navigation accuracy has been improved on average from 2-10 pixels to 1 pixel. The FY-4A/LMI navigation system has been put into operation since May 1, 2018, which has been in normal service ever since.

TI  - Changes in Biomass Turnover Times in Tropical Forests and Their Environmental Drivers From 2001 to 2012
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests store about 70% of the total living biomass on land and yet very little is known about changes in this vital carbon reservoir. Changes in their biomass stock, determined by changes in carbon input (i.e., net primary production [NPP]) and carbon turnover time (tau), are critical to the global carbon sink. In this study, we calculated transient tau in tropical forest biomass using satellite-based biomass and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NPP and analyzed the trends of tau and NPP from 2001 to 2012. Results show that tau and NPP generally have opposite trends across the tropics. Increasing NPP and decreasing tau ("N+T-") mainly distribute in central Africa and the northeast region of South America, while decreasing NPP and increasing tau ("N-T+") prevail in Southeast Asia and western Amazon forests. Most of the N+T- tropical forest areas are associated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) below 2,000 mm.y(-1) and most N-T+ tropical forests with MAP above 2,000 mm.y(-1). The tau and NPP trends in the N+T- region are statistically associated with radiation, precipitation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), while the tau and NPP trends in the N-T+ region are mainly associated with temperature and VPD. Our results inherit the uncertainties from the satellite-based datasets and largely depend on the carbon use efficiency from MODIS. We thus systematically assessed the robustness of the findings. Our study reveals regional patterns and potential drivers of biomass turnover time and NPP changes and provides valuable insights into the tropical forest carbon dynamics.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the safety, efficacy, and prognosis of advanced gastric cancer patients treated with molecular targeted drug therapy. Methods: A total of 200 patients with metastatic gastric cancer admitted to our hospital from March 2018 to December 2018 were randomly selected and divided into the control group, group A, group B and group C, with 50 patients in each group. Patients in the control group received surgical treatment combined with conventional chemotherapy. Patients in group A were provided with surgical treatment combined with bevacizumab, patients in group B received surgical treatment combined with apatinib, and patients in group C received surgical treatment combined with recombinant human endostatin (RHE). Clinical efficacy, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) levels, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), sentinel lymph node (SLD) metastasis, and adverse reactions were compared among different groups of patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Results: There were no significant differences in treatment efficiency, VEGF and VEGFR-2 levels, RECIST, SLD metastasis value and adverse reactions among group A, group B and group C, and the results were not statistically significant (P>0.05). The levels of VEGF, VEGFR-2, SLD metastasis, and adverse reactions in group A, B, and C were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The effective rate of treatment and RECIST in group A, B and C were significantly higher than those in the control group, and the comparison results were statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion: Molecular targeted drug therapy is effective and safe in patients with advanced gastric cancer, and the prognosis of patients is satisfactory, without the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells.

TI  - Boundary Extraction of Urban Built-Up Area Based on Luminance Value Correction of NTL Image
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light image (NTL) is an effective data for urban built-up area. Due to the shortcomings of low resolution and the blooming effect of NTL, the extraction result of the original NTL image is not ideal. We combined point of interest (POI), road network, and land surface temperature (LST) data to propose the POI, road density, and LST-adjusted NTL Index (PRLANI) to correct the luminance value of the NTL image. The proposed index was verified by NTL images of different developed areas and different spatial resolutions. The threshold segmentation method was used to obtain the result of the built-up area extraction from the original NTL and the image modified by the PRLANI. Then, we generated the vector boundary from the built-up area. Taking Changchun urban area as an example, the kappa coefficient based on PRLANI-VIIRS is 0.802, which is 0.293 higher than of NTL-VIIRS. The kappa coefficient based on PRLANI-LJ is 0.838, which is 0.179 higher than that of NTL-LJ. The results show that: the PRLANI can effectively suppress the blooming effect and improve the overestimation of the built-up area caused by light dimming; the PRLANI can enhance the weak light signal in the original NTL image and compensate for the missing information of the built-up area; and the fusion of road network data improves the extraction accuracy and refines the internal structure of built-up area, especially the NPP/VIIRS. The vector boundary was consistent with the built-up area range of reference data, and the visualization effect was good.

AB  - The validity of the network topology and routing planning parameters must be evaluated and confirmed before use to realize the service performance of a complex inter-satellite link network represented by the global navigation satellite system. In this study, an evaluation is designed and divided into two phases: the rapid evaluation of validity and the evaluation of the business service performance. In the first phase, a rapid evaluation method is defined for evaluating the validity of the multi-dimensional integrated network planning parameters, including scene element compliance, node feature compliance, measurement service constraint satisfaction, and data transmission performance satisfaction. In the second phase, an implementation method is proposed for evaluating the business service performance. Specifically, an inter-satellite link network simulation system comprising a network behavior model and a data access model is used to achieve accelerated simulation of the inter-satellite data transmission performance, which calculates the number of chain constructions and the packet transmission performance, and compares them with the business service indicators. Furthermore, the validity of the evaluation method is verified by comparing the evaluation results of the two phases for the same typical scenario.

TI  - Long-Term Changes in Inland Water Surface Temperature across China Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water surface temperature is a direct indication of climate change. However, it is not clear how China's inland waters have responded to climate change in the past using a consistent method on a national scale. In this study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2000 to 2015 to study the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of water surface temperature in China using the wavelet transform method. The results showed the following: 1) the freezing date of China inland water has shown a significant delaying trend during the past 16 years with an average rate of -1.5 days yr(-1); 2) the shift of the 0 degrees C isotherm position of surface water across China has clear seasonal changes, which first moved eastward about 25 degrees and northward about 15 degrees, and then gradually moved back after the year 2009; 3) during the past 16 years, the 0 degrees C isotherm of China's surface water has gradually moved north by about 0.09 degrees in the latitude direction and east by about 1 degrees in the longitude direction; and 4) the interannual variation of water surface temperature in 17 lakes of China showed a similar fluctuation trend that increased before 2010, and then decreased. The El Nino and La Nina around 2010 could have impacts on the turning point of the annual variation of water surface temperature. This study validated the response of China's inland surface water to global climate change and improved the understanding of the wetland environment's response to climate change.

TI  - Estimating Downward Shortwave Solar Radiation on Clear-Sky Days in Heterogeneous Surface Using LM-BP Neural Network
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) plays an important role in the energy balance of the earth's surface. Accurate estimate of DSSR is of great significance for the rational and effective use of solar energy. Some parameterization schemes were proposed to estimate DSSR using meteorological measurements given ground-based radiation observation sites are scare and uneven. With the development of remote sensing technique, remotely sensed data can be applied to obtain continuous DSSR in space. Commonly, the spatial resolution of most radiation products is relatively low and cannot meet the needs of certain fields. Moreover, some retrieval algorithms based on the radiation transfer models are complicated for non-professionals. In this study, a back-propagation (BP) neural network method with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm (hereafter referred to as LM-BP) was applied to predict DSSR by building the relationship between measured DSSR and high-resolution remote sensing data from the Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER). The DSSR observations from the four-component radiation sensor installed at the land covered by vegetable, village, maize, orchard, Gobi, sandy desert, desert steppe, and wetland were used to validate the model estimates. The results showed that the estimates of DSSR from LM-BP agreed well with the site measurements, with the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean bias error (MBE) values of 27.34 W/m(2) and -1.59 W/m(2), respectively. This indicates that by combining the LM-BP network model and ASTER images can obtain precise DSSR in heterogenous surface. The DSSR results of this study can provide accurate high-spatial resolution input data for hydrological, evapotranspiration, and crop models.

AB  - Flood disasters pose numerous hazards which seriously endanger human life and property. Therefore, flood monitoring is essential. In August 2018, an unusual precipitation occurred in Weifang City, Shandong Province, China, causing severe flooding. By making full use of polarization information from Sentinel-1A SAR data before and during the disaster in Weifang City, we were able to employ the Doublet, Otsu and Region Growing methods towards VV and VH images to extract the water body information. To improve the accuracy of water body identification we took the intersection processing of VV and VH images before and during disaster respectively. Then we monitored the submerged area by taking overlay analysis of the results of before and during flood. The comparison analysis between these three methods and the InSAR result show that the Doublet method has the largest difference with the InSAR result and has the lowest recall and precision rate. The Otsu and Region Growing methods are equivalent, but the Otsu had a higher recall rate while the Region Growing method had a higher precision. The area of flood inundation in Weifang City based on the Otsu method is about 1892.7km(2), while the area of flood inundation according to the Region Growing method is about 1576.6km(2).

TI  - Quantifying Turbidity Variation for Lakes in Daqing of Northeast China Using Landsat Images From 1984 to 2018
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water turbidity is an important proxy to measure water quality and environmental conditions. Based on extensive field data and Landsat data (2011-2018), this article developed a retrieval model suitable for turbidity. The determination coefficient (R-2) of the model was 0.946 and the root-mean-square error was 23.82 NTU. The model was implemented to obtain the turbidity information of hundreds of lakes in Northeast China (1984-2018). The results revealed the distinctive spatial pattern of water turbidity values of the lakes (i.e., high turbidity in the south; low turbidity in the northwest; and moderate turbidity in the east). In terms of temporal pattern, the water turbidity values of most lakes trended downward at an average rate of 1.39 NTU/a (P < 0.05) with obvious seasonal differences (i.e., decreased from May to the lowest in July, and then increased from September onward). Finally, we quantitatively examined how several typical factors affect turbidity variation at different scales. We found that water turbidity was highly correlated with NDVI (R = 0.56, P < 0.001), followed by water temperature and wind speed (0.02 < R < 0.5, P < 0.05). Water turbidity varies because of the interaction of multiple factors (e.g., area, temperature, water depth, precipitation, and land use) instead of one factor. This article highlights the potential of remote sensing in large-scale and long-term monitoring of lake water quality, and provides important information and support for water quality management in China.

TI  - Estimating Soil Organic Matter Content Using Sentinel-2 Imagery by Machine Learning in Shanghai
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role in the field of climate change and terrestrial ecosystems. SOM in large areas, especially in urban areas, is difficult to monitor and estimate by traditional methods. Urban land structure is complex, and soil is a mixture of organic and inorganic constituents with different physical and chemical properties. Previous studies showed that remote sensing techniques that provide diverse data in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR)-shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral range, are promising in the prediction of SOM content on a large scale. Sentinel-2 covers the important spectral bands (VNIR-SWIR) for SOM prediction with a short revisit time. Thus, this article aimed to evaluate the capacity of Sentinel-2 for SOM prediction in an urban area (i.e., Shanghai). 103 bare soil samples filtrated from 398 soil samples at a depth of 20 cm were selected. Three methods, partial least square regression (PLSR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM), were applied. The root mean square error (RMSE) of modelling (mRMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) of modelling (mR(2)) were used to reflect the accuracy of the model. The results show that PLSR has the poorest performance. ANN has the highest modelling accuracy (mRMSE = 7.387 g kg(-1), mR(2) = 0.446). The ANN prediction accuracy of RMSE (pRMSE) is 4.713 g kg(-1) and the prediction accuracy of R-2 (pR(2)) is 0.723. For SVR, the pRMSE is 4.638 g kg(-1), and the pR(2) is 0.732. The prediction accuracy of SVR is slightly higher than that of ANN. The spatial distribution of SOM demonstrates that the value obtained by ANN is the closest to the range of the bare soil samples, and ANN performs better in vegetation-covered areas. Therefore, Sentinel-2 can be used to estimate SOM content in urban areas, and ANN is a promising method for SOM estimation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Velocity and Influence of Glacier Thickness Using Landsat Imagery: Hunza River Basin, Karakoram Range
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karakoram Anomaly has been intensively investigated, but the factors that control this anomaly, such as the glacier velocity, topography, and mass balance, remain poorly understood. To improve our understanding of the velocity, topography, and mass balance of the Karakoram Glacier, in this study, the spatiotemporal variability of four glacier velocities in the Hunza Basin of the Karakoram range were surveyed using co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation (COSI-Corr) on Landsat imagery from 1993-2019. The results show that the velocity of the Gulmit Glacier increases with a rising altitude from the glacier terminal. The three other glaciers initially display high velocity, followed by a decrease from the glacier terminal, with the maximum velocity attained in the middle of the glacier. In addition, the Karakoram glaciers produced a slight mass gain, with all mountain glaciers exhibiting clear regional acceleration from 1993-2019. The ice deformation velocity of the Batura Glacier diminished at an average rate of 8.49 %. However, the topography of the glacier base and physical factors require further analysis to determine their contribution to the observed changes in glacier velocity. In the present work, multi-temporal remote sensing image interpretations were carried out to determine glacier kinematics, which could enhance our understanding of glacier change mechanisms.

TI  - NSTMR: Super Resolution of Sentinel-2 Images Using Nonlocal Nonconvex Surrogate of Tensor Multirank
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we address the super-resolution problems, which estimate the high-resolution multispectral images from the multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) images with different resolutions. Since S2 images can be naturally represented by tensors, we reformulate the degradation process as the tensor-based form. Based on the degradation mechanism, we build a tensor-based optimization model for S2 images super-resolution problem, which fully exploits intrinsic nonlocal spatial similarity and global spectral redundancy. Specifically, the model consists of the data fidelity term and the low-multirank regularizer tailored to thoroughly mining the inherent spatial-nonlocal and spectral redundancy. Then, we develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm with theoretically guaranteed convergence to tackle the resulting tensor optimization problem. Numerical experiments including simulated and real data demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods visually and qualitatively.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the fusion of spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and airborne SAR images and its application to ship target enhancement. In this paper, we propose a new target proposal and clutter copula (TPCC)-based image fusion method for the collaboration of spaceborne and airborne SARs. TPCC enhances the common ship target areas in spaceborne and airborne SAR images via the intersection of target proposals and suppresses the clutter areas by establishing the joint distribution of clutter in the spaceborne and airborne SAR images based on the copula theory. Compared with other commonly used image fusion methods, the target dependence and clutter dependence in the spaceborne and airborne SAR images are newly exploited in TPCC. We demonstrate the superiority of TPCC in terms of target-to-clutter ratios (TCRs) by using composite images combining Gaofen-3 satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) SAR images.

AB  - Low-frequency spaceborne polarimetric radar system is susceptible to the ionospheric Faraday rotation (FR). High-quality FR estimates are required for advanced polarimetric and ionospheric applications. Noise reduction plays a key role in higher quality FR estimation. Based on the Baran filter and Bickel-Bates FR estimator, this paper proposes a denoising technique for FR estimation using spaceborne polarimetric SAR data. Experiments on L-band ALOS-PALSAR data of Alaska demonstrate that this technique can achieve nice noise smoothing of FR estimates.

AB  - Water conservation is one of the ecological service functions of terrestrial ecosystem, which is of great significance for monitoring and protecting the ecological environment using remote sensing methods. Danjiangkou ecological area is an important ecological service function region of water conservation in China. Aimed at the distribution and dynamic change of water conservation function, this paper quantitatively evaluates the regional water conservation capacity based on the water balance principle in 2015 and 2020. The remote sensing products such as Terra, Landsat Satellite data, SRTM and so on are used. Based on the results, combined with the changes of land use, precipitation and temperature, the spatial difference and interannual variation are analyzed. The results show that the type of land use plays a decisive role for the maintaining and improving of regional water conservation, and the climatic conditions such as precipitation and temperature have a great impact on the fluctuation of water conservation capacity.

TI  - Geomorphic analysis of Xiadian buried fault zone in Eastern Beijing plain based on SPOT image and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents geomorphic analysis of Xiadian buried fault in eastern Beijing plain (China), based on the analysis of a Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT-5) image, a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) derived from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, SRTM DEM and field investigation. Interpretations of the SPOT-5 image show that the pits always distribute between fault scarp segments or shallow grooves. The geomorphic features near the fault show echelon arrangements caused by dextral strike-slip activities of the fault. Based on this, the characteristics of stress field in this area have been clearly inferred. At centimeter-level accuracy, UAV-derived DEM profiles can clearly show micro tectonic landforms such as fault scarps, shallow grooves, steep slopes, and pits. Combined with previous research and field measurements, the evolution rates in length and height of the fault scarps are analysed. Furthermore, the deflection analysis of the drainage system also shows the characteristics of the continuous strike slip activity of the Xiadian fault. The study can provide valuable insight into geomorphic analysis of buried and semi-buried active faults in plain areas with increasingly frequent human activities.

TI  - Using TerraSAR X-Band and Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR Interferometry for Deformation Along Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway (BTIR) is an important transportation hub connecting Beijing and Tianjin. It is the China's first high-speed railway reaching a speed of 350 km/h and has been in operation for ten years. Since the foundation of the BTIR is made up of soft and loose soil, hence suffers greatly from potential deformation. In order to investigate the impact of ground subsidence on the railway line, 26 TerraSAR-X SpotLight images, 23 TerraSAR-X StripMap images, and 31 Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide images were processed to obtain the deformation of the Yizhuang areas along the BTIR from January 2015 to March 2017 by permanent scatterers interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology. The deformation results of these three datasets are self-consistent. Through the vertical and horizontal deformation of the railway using fusion of the railway deformation results from different line of sight direction, we found that the deformation of the railway line is mainly in the vertical direction. Furthermore, the high precision spatial-temporal evolution of the deformation along the BTIR is revealed. Finally, the advantages and limitations of different SAR resolution are analyzed and summarized.

T2  - SEVENTH SYMPOSIUM ON NOVEL PHOTOELECTRONIC DETECTION TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Symposium on Novel Photoelectronic Detection Technology and Applications
CL  - Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In recent years, the commercialized low-cost rotor UAV equipped with small hyperspectral camera has become an emerging way to acquire hyperspectral remote sensing data due to its advantages of convenient data acquisition and low cost, and has been widely used in environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, ocean development and other fields. Due to its light weight, the flight process of the rotor UAV is vulnerable to the influence of air flow, which leads to the poor stability of the platform and resulting in the geometric distortion of the imaging. This situation is particularly prominent in the obvious air flow areas such as the lake and the sea, which restricts the application in related fields. In this paper, the geometric processing of UAV-borne hyperspectral measured data collected at a wharf in Qiandao Lake is studied. There are two major factors lead to geometric error. One is the longitude and latitude step error, the other is the frame frequency of the navigation data is lower than the image exposure frame frequency. In this situation, this paper proposes a step fitting method to perform geometric correction and error correction for the hyperspectral airstrip data. Compared with the traditional Kalman filtering method and the global linear fitting method, the proposed method can better correct the geometric distortion of hyperspectral image caused by the low-precision GPS/INS system, which provides a foundation for the subsequent quantitative application of lightweight UAV hyperspectral camera in various fields.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional forest fire high-temperature target monitoring methods cannot correct the geometric distortion of fire images, resulting in large deviations in the monitoring results of high-temperature targets. In this study. a new target monitoring method for forest fires in Chongqing based on domestic satellite data FY3-B and FY3-C is studied. Based on the principle of surface fire monitoring, the information data of satellites FY3-B and FY3-C are preprocessed, the radiance in the infrared band and the reflectivity in the visible light band are obtained through calibration, and the brightness temperature value in the infrared band is obtained according to Planck's law. Based on the control point data, combined with the fire point monitoring algorithm of the pixel background brightness temperature, we judge the cloud pixel and the water pixel, process the suspected fire point background temperature, and filter the non-fire point pixel and flares, to achieve target monitoring of abnormally high temperature points in fire. The experimental results show that the deviation can be effectively reduced after data correction by this method. The data after the information fusion of the satellites FY3-B and FY3-C has higher positioning accuracy. At the same time, the number of fire points detected by this method is the largest, and there is no missed judgment and false judgment.

AB  - The purpose of pansharpening is to fuse low-resolution multispectral image (LRMS) and high-resolution panchromatic image (PAN) to obtain high-resolution multispectral (HRMS). In response to the shortcomings of traditional remote sensing image fusion algorithms causing spectral distortion, more and more deep learning algorithms are utilized, and this paper proposes a new deep network structure, two-branch Self-Attentive DenseNet network. In terms of maintaining high spatial resolution, the image feature information is extracted by different inch-scale convolutional kernels, and the effective feature information is enhanced to suppress the invalid image information by using DenseNet network model and introducing Self-Attention, and the fused image spectral information is enhanced by using hopping connection to maintaining the spectral structure. Experiments show that the proposed method of this paper has improved image quality evaluation metrics compared with the previously existing traditional fusion algorithms and deep network algorithms.

TI  - Assessing the Accuracy of Landsat-MODIS NDVI Fusion with Limited Input Data: A Strategy for Base Data Selection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its wide applications, the spatiotemporal fusion of coarse- and fine-resolution satellite images is limited primarily to the availability of clear-sky fine-resolution images, which are commonly scarce due to unfavorable weather, and such a limitation might cause errors in spatiotemporal fusion. Thus, the effective use of limited fine-resolution images, while critical, remains challenging. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new phenological similarity strategy (PSS) to select the optimal combination of image pairs for a prediction date. The PSS considers the temporal proximity and phenological similarity between the base and prediction images and computes a weight for identifying the optimal combination of image pairs. Using the PSS, we further evaluate the influence of input data on the fusion accuracy by varying the number and temporal distribution of input images. The results show that the PSS (mean R = 0.827 and 0.760) outperforms the nearest date (mean R = 0.786 and 0.742) and highest correlation (mean R = 0.821 and 0.727) strategies in both the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the linear mixing growth model (LMGM), respectively, for fusing Landsat 8 OLI and MODIS NDVI datasets. Furthermore, base images adequately covering different growth stages yield better predictability than simply increasing the number of base images.

TI  - Double-Variance Measures: A Potential Approach to Parameter Optimization of Remote Sensing Image Segmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unsupervised segmentation evaluation (USE) method has been commonly used for remote sensing segmentation parameter (SP) determinations to produce good segmentation results, due to its objectiveness and high efficiency. Existing studies have used different criteria to measure homogeneity and heterogeneity and have used certain combination strategies to form overall evaluations. However, different criteria have unique statistical characteristics. The differentiated statistical characteristics maintained in homogeneity and heterogeneity calculations may result in inherent instability in the USE results, leading to unsuitable SP selections. Moreover, few studies have focused on the simultaneous determination of a single optimal SP and multiple optimal SPs. In this article, double-variance (DV) measures were proposed for recognizing more suitable SPs. Then, two combination strategies, F-measure and local peak (LP), were applied to test the potential of using DV measures to determine a single SP and multiple SPs, respectively. The multiresolution segmentation algorithm and Gaofen-1 data were used to test the proposed method. The comparative results indicated that the DV is a more promising internal homogeneity and external heterogeneity metric for segmentation evaluation and optimal SP determination compared to conventional methods. The F-measure-based DV method could produce better overall goodness of segmentation for differently sized natural geo-objects, compared with the competing methods. The LP-based DV method could obtain multiple optimal scales that produced better segments for the identification of small, natural geo-objects to large, semantic geo-objects, compared to the competitive methods.

AB  - Spacecraft telemetry data is the only basis for the ground management and operation system to determine its on-orbit status. The rapid development of on-orbit spacecraft generates a large amount of telemetry data with high dimensionality and complex correlation between variables, which brings great challenges for current and future ground management and operation for these spacecrafts. As a result, its anomaly detection becomes an essential solution for enhancing the operation safely and reliably and realizing intelligent maintenance. The above issues make it a hot spot research topic for realization of high detection rate, low false detection rate, and strong interpretability of anomaly detection of telemetry data. In further, timely detection of abnormalities can reduce spacecraft unexpected accidents. Recently, Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) has arisen much attention for telemetry time series data modeling by its good parallel processing ability and temporal characterization. Thus, this paper proposes an anomaly detection model for spacecraft telemetry data based on TCN time series prediction. Firstly, TCN algorithm is used to extract features of telemetry data and make a prediction. Then, the potential anomalies are determined by the static threshold judgement method. Actual satellite telemetry data are used to implement performance evaluation and comparison. The proposed method is compared with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm which is also a widely utilized algorithm in recent time series analysis. Four metrics are adopted for the experiments: the detection accuracy, detection rate, false detection rate and model inference time. TCN achieves high accuracy, high detection rate and low false detection rate. In addition, TCN save much more model inference time than LSTM with long timestep. Generally, TCN is superior to LSTM on operating efficiency.

TI  - Climate Change Will Reduce the Carbon Use Efficiency of Terrestrial Ecosystems on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: An Analysis Based on Multiple Models
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon use efficiency (CUE) of ecosystems, expressed as the ratio of net primary production (NPP) and gross primary production (GPP), is extremely sensitive to climate change and has a great effect on the carbon cycles of terrestrial ecosystems. Climate change leads to changes in vegetation, resulting in different CUE values, especially on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the most climate-sensitive regions in the world. However, the change trend and the intrinsic mechanism of climate effects on CUE in the future climate change scenario are not clear in this region. Based on the scheme of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6), we analyze the simulation results of the five models of the scenario model intercomparison project (ScenarioMIP) under three different typical future climate scenarios, including SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2015-2100 with methods of model-averaging to average the long-term forecast of the five several well-known forecast models for three alternative climate scenarios with three radiative forcing levels to discuss the CUE changes and a structural equations modeling (SEM) approach to examine how the trends in GPP, NPP, and CUE related to different climate factors. The results show that (1) GPP and NPP demonstrated an upward trend in a long time series of 86 years, and the upward trend became increasingly substantial with the increase in radiation forcing; (2) the ecosystem CUE of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will decrease in the long time series in the future, and it shows a substantial decreasing trend with the increase in radiation forcing; and (3) the dominant climate factor affecting CUE is temperature of the factors included in these models, which affects CUE mainly through GPP and NPP to produce indirect effects. Temperature has a higher comprehensive effect on CUE than precipitation and CO2, which are negative effects on CUE on an annual scale. Our finding that the CUE decreases in the future suggests that we must pay more attention to the vegetation and CUE changes, which will produce great effects on the regional carbon dynamics and balance.

AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is an important physical attribute that affects the ecological environment of lakes. It plays an important role in the ecological process of the water environment and directly affects human production and life, the ecological environment system of the water area, and the diversity of organisms. In order to adjust and improve the ecological conditions of the watershed, it is necessary to obtain a large amount of effective lake surface water temperature data, and use this as a basis to analyze the temporal and spatial change process of the LSWT. This study uses MODIS (MOD11A2) surface temperature product data to obtain the LSWT of Dianchi Lake, and then analyzes the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the LSWT of Dianchi Lake on different time scales (year, season, month) during the day and night. The research results show that the annual, seasonal and monthly average values of the LSWT during the day and night are all increasing from 2001 to 2017. The average annual temperature rise rate of Dianchi LSWT during the day and night is 0.09 degrees Cyr(-1) and 0.05 degrees Cyr(-1), respectively. The spatial analysis results show that the LSWT increase area of Dianchi Lake is expanding.

TI  - Tighten the Bolts and Nuts on GPP Estimations from Sites to the Globe: An Assessment of Remote Sensing Based LUE Models and Supporting Data Fields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) determines the amounts of carbon and energy that enter terrestrial ecosystems. However, the tremendous uncertainty of the GPP still hinders the reliability of GPP estimates and therefore understanding of the global carbon cycle. In this study, using observations from global eddy covariance (EC) flux towers, we appraised the performance of 24 widely used GPP models and the quality of major spatial data layers that drive the models. Results show that global GPP products generated by the 24 models varied greatly in means (from 92.7 to 178.9 Pg C yr(-1)) and trends (from -0.25 to 0.84 Pg C yr(-1)). Model structure differences (i.e., light use efficiency models, machine learning models, and process-based biophysical models) are an important aspect contributing to the large uncertainty. In addition, various biases in currently available spatial datasets have found (e.g., only 57% of the observed variation in photosynthetically active radiation at the flux tower locations was explained by the spatial dataset), which not only affect GPP simulation but more importantly hinder the simulation and understanding of the earth system. Moving forward, research into the efficacy of model structures and precision of input data may be more important for global GPP estimation.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purposes are to solve the isomorphism encountered while processing hyperspectral remote sensing data and improve the accuracy of hyperspectral remote sensing data in extracting and classifying lithological information. Taking rocks as the research object, Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) is introduced. After the hyperspectral image data are normalized, the lithological spectrum and spatial information are the feature extraction targets to construct a deep learning-based lithological information extraction model. The performance of the model is analyzed using specific instance data. Results demonstrate that the overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient of the lithological information extraction and classification model based on deep learning were 90.58% and 0.8676, respectively. This model can precisely distinguish the properties of rock masses and provide better performance compared with the state of other analysis models. After introducing deep learning, the recognition accuracy and the Kappa coefficient of the proposed BPNN model increased by 8.5% and 0.12, respectively, compared with the traditional BPNN. The proposed extraction and classification model can provide some research values and practical significances for the hyperspectral rock and mineral classification.

TI  - A Novel Two-Step Scheme Based on Joint GO-DPCA and Local STAP in Image Domain for Multichannel SAR-GMTI
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multichannel synthetic aperture radar ground moving target indication has been widely used and get great attention nowadays. Traditional adaptive methods like space-time adaptive processing (STAP) need to calculate and search the maximum of the test statistic pixel by pixel over a large range of radial velocity, which will cause great computational burden. Nonadaptive methods like displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) will cause signal loss of moving targets, thereby degrading the performance of moving targets detection and radial velocity estimation. To improve the problem mentioned above, this article proposes a novel two-step scheme based on greatest of (GO)-DPCA and Local STAP. In step I, GO-DPCA utilizes the complex images of the channels with different baselines for joint moving target detection. Then, in step II, only the local data of moving targets detected in step I needs to be extracted from the original image domain for clutter suppression and radial velocity estimation simultaneously by STAP. Since the processing gain of moving targets depends on the radial velocity and baseline length, the detection performance of moving targets with different radial velocity can be improved by proposed GO-DPCA compared to conventional DPCA. Considering the moving targets usually distribute sparsely in the scene, step II can avoid most computational burden caused by processing pixel by pixel. Finally, the experimental results of both simulated and acquired data are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Estimating particulate organic carbon flux in a highly dynamic estuary using satellite data and numerical modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative estimates of the flux, transportation, and burial of riverine particulate organic carbon (POC) in estuaries and shelf areas are crucial for understanding the carbon cycle in marginal seas. The complexity of the hydrodynamic environment and estuarine processes in the Changjiang River estuary (CRE) results in a POC flux with high spatiotemporal variability. In this study, we proposed a new method for time series monitoring of riverine POC flux by combining satellite ocean color and numerical modeling data. We used 500-m resolution geostationary satellite data from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) to retrieve surface POC concentrations in the CRE and used the numerical Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) to simulate three-dimensional (3D) current and sediment distribution. Diurnal, seasonal, and annual variations in POC flux through the lower reaches (Datong Hydrological Station), upper estuary (Xuliujing Hydrological Station), and outlets of the CRE, as well as transportation and deposition outside the CRE, were examined from July 2011 to June 2018. The annual mean POC fluxes through the Datong, Xuliujing, and outlet sections were 1.16 +/- 0.16 Tg C/yr, 1.29 +/- 0.11 Tg C/yr, and 1.17 +/- 0.11 Tg C/yr, respectively. After passing through the estuary, 35.2% of POC was deposited in the sandbar outside the outlets, 52.9% was transported to the south, and a small amount entered the eastern shelf. Thus, these results indicated that POC flux through the river and estuary sections differed from the effective riverine POC flux into the sea. The proposed method combining high spatiotemporalresolution satellite data and numerical modeling not only makes full use of their advantages, but also reduces the uncertainty of their individual estimates. This approach also supports long-term monitoring of riverine fluxes to the sea and helps clarify the effects of terrestrial inputs on marginal seas under multiple stresses from human activities and climate change.

TI  - Bidirectional Spatio-Temporal Association Between the Observed Results of <i>Ulva</i> Prolifera Green Tides in the Yellow Sea and the Social Response in Sina Weibo
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive green tides caused by Ulva prolifera have annually occurred in the Yellow Sea since 2007, which has attracted much attention from the government and society. There are associations between the green tides in the Yellow Sea and social response in the social media (i.e., Sina Weibo), which are bidirectional and could be captured by the bidirectional neural network. For instance, how to detect daily U. prolifera green tides by fusing remote sensing data with social media data, and howto use the observed U. prolifera green tides to infer the social response are two challenges of StateOceanicAdministration, China. This article first illustrated that there are bidirectional associations between green tides and Sina Weibo data. Then, this article introduced a bidirectional spatio-temporal associative memory neural network (BSAMNN) model for modeling this bidirectional association from the spatio-temporal perspective. BSAMNN first extracted six characteristics fromgreen tides and nine characteristics fromthe social responses in 2016-2019. Second, these characteristics were split by year, and the characteristics in 2016-2018 were, respectively, put into the bidirectional associative memory neural network (BAM), which is a two-layer artificial neural network. Based on the BAM results and the observed data, the residual network was constructed. Third, BSAMNN extracted the spatio-temporal rules from the characteristics in 2016-2018 as the constraints through the mining rule algorithm and modify the results via sea surface wind and ocean surface current. Last, BSAMNN put the characteristics in 2019 into BAMand used the residual network to modify the results, which was constrained by the spatio-temporal rules. The feasibility and reliability of our approach were demonstrated by using the U. prolifera green tides in 2019. The average accuracy, false alarm rate, and missing alarm rate of BSAMNN results were 0.69, 0.25, and 0.31, respectively, which was 0.11 higher, 0.10 lower, and 0.11 lower than that of the traditional BAM. The results indicated that our method is an effective alternative of linking the U. prolifera green tides and its public sentiments on social media.

AB  - The dynamic detection of coastline is important for the study of sea level rising caused by global climate change. Therefore, it is especially meaningful to select an appropriate method to extract the coastline accurately. In this paper, the coastal zones of Reykjavik, Iceland was chosen for the study area, and the method of combination water indices (i.e., NDWI, MNDWI, EWI, and AWEI) and the maximum interclass variance method (Otsu) was used to automatically detect the coastline. The results show that the NDWI and EWI can accurately extract the coastlines in this region, and NDWI performs better than others (accuracy of 91%). The conclusions obtained in this paper have the potential to be applied to coastline extraction in the polar regions.

AB  - Timely and accurate crop type classification plays an essential role in the study of agricultural application. However, large area or cross-regional crop classification confronts huge challenges owing to dramatic phenology discrepancy among training and test regions. In this work, we propose a novel framework to address these challenges based on deep recurrent network and unsupervised domain adaptation (DA). Specifically, we firstly propose a Temporal Spatial Network (TSNet) for pixelwise crop classification, which contains stacked RNN and self-attention module to adaptively extract multi-level features from crop samples under various planting conditions. To deal with the cross-regional challenge, an unsupervised DA-based framework named Phenology Alignment Network (PAN) is proposed. PAN consists of two branches of two identical TSNet pre-trained on source domain; one branch takes source samples while the other takes target samples as input. Through aligning the hierarchical deep features extracted from two branches, the discrepancy between two regions is decreased and the pre-trained model is adapted to the target domain without using target label information. As another contribution, a time series dataset based on Sentinel-2 was annotated containing winter crop samples collected on three study sites of China. Cross-regional experiments demonstrate that TSNet shows comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods, and PAN further improves the overall accuracy by 5.62%, and macro average F1 score by 0.094 unsupervisedly.

TI  - Prior-Information Auxiliary Module: An Injector to a Deep Learning Bridge Detection Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of data samples has become a bottleneck for the performance improvement of bridge detection model training via transfer learning. This article proposes a deep learning bridge detection algorithm aided by a traditional bridge detection method to alleviate this problem. First, we explore the theoretical constraints on the integration of prior-information feature maps extracted via the traditional unsupervised method. Second, we design a prior-information auxiliary module (PAM) to receive and inject prior information. Finally, we introduce this module into different kinds of object detection networks for testing. The experimental results show that prior masks generated through multiextremal segmentation can assist object detectors in many respects. In addition, the PAM can use a few prior-information feature maps to enhance the performance of four representative object detection models on the bridge recognition dataset from the 2020 Gaofen challenge on automated high-resolution earth observation image interpretation. Our method preserves the validity of end-to-end training, making the traditional method more valuable in the artificial intelligence context.

TI  - Synthetic Imagery for Spatial Resolution Selection in Maritime Remote Sensing
T2  - GEOSPATIAL INFORMATICS XI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Geospatial Informatics XI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In recent years, deep neural-networks have gained popularity in maritime detection problems. Successes in deep-learning have been due, partially, to the controlled and constrained nature of the training dataset. However, remote sensing data are highly variable, highly unconstrained, and lack both the quality and quantity of labeled and curated training samples usually required for current state-of-the-art approaches. In this paper we address a lack of class coherency across datasets at varying spatial resolutions by introducing a large 42-class synthetic dataset, Maritime Vessels at Varying Resolutions (MVVR-42). We leverage MVVR-42 in our experimentation, taking advantage of the ability to easily render imagery at varying resolutions and augmenting the training set to produce data points to aid in sensor selection for remote systems. Using state-the-art detection models like YOLO and FasterRCNN, we explore the effect of spatial resolution on performance in ship detection tasks.

AB  - The problem of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria has not been adequately explored in the tropical island environment. To date, there has not been a systematic investigation into the prevalence and distribution of antimicrobial resistance determinants in the Hawaiian Islands. Urinary isolates are the most common bacterial pathogens encountered in the clinical laboratory. Therefore, the antimicrobial resistance determinant profiles of these organisms can serve as a sentinel of the overall antimicrobial resistance situation in a localized patient population. In this study, 82 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli derived from 82 distinct patients were collected at a large medical center on the island of O'ahu. Each isolate was evaluated for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes using a microarray-based approach. A total of 36 antimicrobial resistance genes covering 10 classes of antimicrobial compounds were identified. Most isolates were found to harbor between 3 and 5 antimicrobial resistance genes. Only a few isolates were found to harbor more than 12 genes. Significantly, a high rate of phenotypic resistance to one of the first-line treatments for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (sulfamethoxazole) was identified. This phenotype was correlated to the presence of sulfonamides and trimethoprim resistance determinants. Since E. coli is one of the most encountered pathogens in the hospital environment, the presence of clinically relevant resistance determinants in isolates of this organism from a clinical setting on O'ahu is a significant finding that warrants further investigation.

T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW OF JAPAN-SERIES B
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper is a systematic review of scholarly articles published in Japan from 1989 to 2019 that discuss instruction regarding the formation of spatial cognition in the context of elementary school social studies. This study aims to examine the trends, transitions, and challenges of this field of research and clarify the backgrounds of these studies. Based on the results of the review, four research themes were determined: "objectives, principles, and curriculum," "lesson design," "maps and globes," and "learning assessment." For the continued development of this field, we assert the need for further research into (1) the construction of a lesson model that encourages participation in community development and its actual practices based on children's formation of their worldview; (2) collaboration between researchers and teachers to investigate actual situations and obstacles to teaching and propose strategies for teacher competence development based on evidence; and (3) assessment of the relationships between geography, geography education, and social studies, and consideration of curricula and learning instruction with respect to the formation of children's spatial cognition, via collaboration among researchers involved in these fields.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article positions Harold Pinter's later plays within the context of both rationalizations of violent means to achieve justifiable ends and a tradition of violent staging at the Royal Court Theatre. The former context includes explanations of violence in dramatic Tragedy, in Antonin Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty, and Edward Bond's political theatre; the latter, scenes of violence in the post-"In-Yer-Face" plays of Simon Stephens, David Ireland, and Jez Butterworth. The argument finally arrives at Pinter's increasingly negative worldview that while no discourse can justify the use of violent means to achieve desired ends, violence is both omnipresent and inevitable in human events.

TI  - Metastatic Breast Cancer, Organotropism and Therapeutics: A Review
T2  - CURRENT CANCER DRUG TARGETS
M3  - Review
AB  - The final stage of breast cancer involves spreading breast cancer cells to the vital organs like the brain, liver lungs and bones in the process called metastasis. Once the target organ is overtaken by the metastatic breast cancer cells, its usual function is compromised causing organ dysfunction and death. Despite the significant research on breast cancer metastasis, it's still the main culprit of breast cancer-related deaths. Exploring the complex molecular pathways associated with the initiation and progression of breast cancer metastasis could lead to the discovery of more effective ways of treating the devastating phenomenon. The present review article highlights the recent advances to understand the complexity associated with breast cancer metastases, organotropism and therapeutic advances.

TI  - Tracking lake surface elevations with proportional hypsometric relationships, Landsat imagery, and multiple DEMs
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Multidecadal inland surface water dynamics are of increasing interest due to their importance to climate, ecology, and society, yet several key challenges impede long-term monitoring of inland surface waters globally. This research investigates two novel methods, one addressing subhydroflattened surface estimate uncertainty issues, and a second addressing temporal resolution issues, using 46 water bodies across the western United States. First, low water level estimate uncertainty was reduced using multiple digital elevation models (ALOS, SRTM, and NED) to derive the hypsometric relationship for each lake from the digital elevation model with the lowest hydroflattened water surface. This technique reduced the number of images with subhydroflattened water surfaces by at least 549 over the best individual DEM resulting in higher water surface elevation estimate accuracy. Second, this paper introduces proportional hypsometry which dynamically generates surface area/elevation relationships for every image using clear pixels only by removing contamination from both the image and DEM. Proportional hypsometry was found to be ill-suited for subhydroflattened water surface levels but produced comparable accuracy to clear images for above hydroflattened water levels. Overall, using the lowest hydroflattened surface along with proportional hypsometry improved temporal resolution enabling analysis of nearly 10,000 additional images while maintaining similar accuracy levels as images with <1% contamination (2.35 m RMSE vs. 2.17 m RMSE). This research increases lower water elevation estimate accuracy and temporal resolution and is scalable enabling regional and global water dynamic analysis.

AB  - This work discusses InSAR time series analysis using multi-reference stacks with exclusively short time intervals. A 5 months long stack of Sentinel-1 acquisitions over a high alpine territory that includes fast moving landslides is used. Use of the multi-look phases becomes problematic due to non-zero closure phase. The errors induced by non-zero phase closure can be avoided by the use of single-look phases for all scatterers, including distributed scatterers. A weighted least-squares solution of the deformation time-series is obtained using the multi-reference stack interferometric single-look phases. Quality control is done during the regression analysis, the conversion to the time series, and considering the temporal coherence. Spatial filtering of the single-look phase time series can be used to further reduce the phase noise present in areas with intermediate coherence levels. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - A Remote Sensing-Based Assessment of Water Resources in the Arabian Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources is crucial for the sustainable development of hyper-arid regions. Here, we focus on the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and use remotely sensed data to (i) analyze the local climatology of total water storage (TWS), precipitation, and soil moisture; (ii) characterize their temporal variability and spatial distribution; and (iii) infer recent trends and change points within their time series. Remote sensing data for TWS, precipitation, and soil moisture are obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), respectively. The study relies on trend analysis, the modified Mann-Kendall test, and change point detection statistics. We first derive 10-year (2002-2011) seasonal averages from each of the datasets and intercompare their spatial organization. In the absence of large-scale in situ data, we then compare trends from GRACE TWS retrievals to in situ groundwater observations locally over the subdomain of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). TWS anomalies vary between -6.2 to 3.2 cm/month and -6.8 to -0.3 cm/month during the winter and summer periods, respectively. Trend analysis shows decreasing precipitation trends (-2.3 x 10(-4) mm/day) spatially aligned with decreasing soil moisture trends (-1.5 x 10(-4) g/cm(3)/month) over the southern part of the AP, whereas the highest decreasing TWS trends (-8.6 x 10(-2) cm/month) are recorded over areas of excessive groundwater extraction in the northern AP. Interestingly, change point detection reveals increasing precipitation trends pre- and post-change point breaks over the entire AP region. Significant spatial dependencies are observed between TRMM and GRACE change points, particularly over Yemen during 2010, revealing the dominant impact of climatic changes on TWS depletion.

TI  - Greenland bare-ice albedo from PROMICE automatic weather station measurements and Sentinel-3 satellite observations
T2  - GEUS BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Programme for Monitoring of the Greenland Ice Sheet (PROMICE) provides surface meteorological and glaciological measurements from widespread on-ice automatic weather stations since mid-2007. In this study, we use 105 PROMICE ice-ablation time series to identify the timing of seasonal bare-ice onset preceded by snow cover conditions. From this collection, we find a bare-ice albedo at ice-ablation onset (here called bare-ice-onset albedo) of 0.565 +/- 0.109 that has no apparent spatial dependence among 20 sites across Greenland. We then apply this snow-to-ice albedo transition value to measure the variations in daily Greenland bare-ice area in Sentinel-3 optical satellite imagery covering the extremely low and high respective melt years of 2018 and 2019. Daily Greenland bare-ice area peaked at 153 489 km(2) in 2019, 1.9 times larger than in 2018 (80 220 km(2)), equating to 9.0% (in 2019) and 4.7% (in 2018) of the ice sheet area.

TI  - An evaluation of the Arctic clouds and surface radiative fluxes in CMIP6 models
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the performances of state-of-the-art global climate models on simulating the Arctic clouds and surface radiation balance, the 2001-2014 Arctic Basin surface radiation budget, clouds, and the cloud radiative effects (CREs) in 22 coupled model intercomparison project 6 (CMIP6) models are evaluated against satellite observations. For the results from CMIP6 multi-model mean, cloud fraction (CF) peaks in autumn and is lowest in winter and spring, consistent with that from three satellite observation products (CloudSat-CALIPSO, CERES-MODIS, and APP-x). Simulated CF also shows consistent spatial patterns with those in observations. However, almost all models overestimate the CF amount throughout the year when compared to CERES-MODIS and APP-x. On average, clouds warm the surface of the Arctic Basin mainly via the longwave (LW) radiation cloud warming effect in winter. Simulated surface energy loss of LW is less than that in CERES-EBAF observation, while the net surface shortwave (SW) flux is underestimated. The biases may result from the stronger cloud LW warming effect and SW cooling effect from the overestimated CF by the models. These two biases compensate each other, yielding similar net surface radiation flux between model output (3.0 W/m(2)) and CERES-EBAF observation (6.1 W/m(2)). During 2001-2014, significant increasing trend of spring CF is found in the multi-model mean, consistent with previous studies based on surface and satellite observations. Although most of the 22 CMIP6 models show common seasonal cycles of CF and liquid water path/ice water path (LWP/IWP), large inter-model spreads exist in the amounts of CF and LWP/IWP throughout the year, indicating the influences of different cloud parameterization schemes used in different models. Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) observation simulator package (COSP) is a great tool to accurately assess the performance of climate models on simulating clouds. More intuitive and credible evaluation results can be obtained based on the COSP model output. In the future, with the release of more COSP output of CMIP6 models, it is expected that those inter-model spreads and the model-observation biases can be substantially reduced. Longer term active satellite observations are also necessary to evaluate models' cloud simulations and to further explore the role of clouds in the rapid Arctic climate changes.

TI  - Reconstructing 1-km-resolution high-quality PM<sub>2.5</sub> data records from 2000 to 2018 in China: spatiotemporal variations and policy implications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can significantly harm human health and increase the risk of death. Satellite remote sensing allows for generating spatially continuous PM2.5 data, but current datasets have overall low accuracies with coarse spatial resolutions limited by data sources and models. Air pollution levels in China have experienced dramatic changes over the past couple of decades. However, country-wide ground-based PM2.5 records only date back to 2013. To reveal the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5, long-term and high-spatialresolution aerosol optical depths, generated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multi-Angle implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, were employed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations at a 1 km resolution using our proposed Space-Time Extra-Trees (STET) model. Our model can capture well variations in PM2.5 concentrations at different spatiotemporal scales, with higher accuracies (i.e., cross-validation coefficient of determination, CV-R-2 = 0.86-0.90) and stronger predictive powers (i.e., R-2 = 0.80-0.82) than previously reported. The resulting PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM(2.5)) provides the longest record (i.e., 2000 to 2018) at a high spatial resolution of 1 km, enabling the study of PM2.5 variation patterns at different scales. In most places, PM2.5 concentrations showed increasing trends around 2007 and remained high until 2013, after which they declined substantially, thanks to a series of government actions combating air pollution in China. While nationwide PM2.5 concentrations have decreased by 0.89 mu g/m(3)/yr (p < 0.001) during the last two decades, the reduction has accelerated to 4.08 mu g/m(3)/yr (p < 0.001) over the last six years, indicating a significant improvement in air quality. Large improvements occurred in the Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas, while the most polluted region remained the North China Plain, especially in winter. The ChinaHighPM(2.5) dataset will enable more insightful analyses regarding the causes and attribution of pollution over mediumor small-scale areas.

TI  - Enblending Mosaicked Remote Sensing Images With Spatiotemporal Fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosaicking of remote sensing images stitches images of different moments or sensors to produce a new image under a uniform geographic coordinate system. In a mosaicking process, the critical enblending operation is divided into color balance, seamline finder, and fusion of overlapping areas, which is still challenging to maintain color consistency and data fidelity. In this article, a new mosaicking framework using spatiotemporal fusion is proposed to solve the enblending issue. Two additional low-resolution reference images are introduced for each mosaicking image. With spatiotemporal fusion methods, all mosaicking images are reconstructed to a uniform time, then the combination of overlapping areas become easy. Furthermore, a new spatiotemporal fusion method is proposed by cascading enhanced deep neural networks to fuse images quickly and effectively. In the validation procedure, the proposed method is compared with eight color harmony methods or tools by mosaicking the red, green, and blue bands of Landsat-8 images with images from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer as the reference. The digital evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate that the newly method outweighs majority methods regarding to the radiometric, structural, and spectral fidelity, which proves the feasibility of our new enblending method.

TI  - Evapotranspiration estimation using three-temperature model and influencing factors of Nanning City, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is the key element of hydrological energy cycle and climate system. It is of great significance to estimate the spatiotemporal variation of evapotranspiration and its response to climate and land use changes for understanding the effects of water cycle and ecological processes in urban basins. Based on the three-temperature model and MODIS Image , we estimated and analyzed the spatiotemporal variation of evapotranspiration in Nanning City from 2001 to 2018, and examined the influence and driving mode of main climate factors and land use types on evapotranspiration. The results showed that the annual average evapotranspiration of Nanning City ranged from 495.7 to 781.1 mm during 2001 - 2018, with the inter annual relative variability ranging from -22.5% to 23.1%, showing an overall upward trend. The regional evapotranspiration showed a distribution pattern of high north-south and low middle, with the urban evapotranspiration being significantly lower than suburban area. The evapotranspiration had a significant multiple correlation with climate factors. The influence of temperature on the evapotranspiration was stronger than precipitation. Evapotranspiration was temperature driven in suburbs, but was driven by multiple factors in urban area. The average evapotranspiration of different land use types in Nanning was forests (823.4 mm) > grasslands (675.6 mm) > croplands (582.9 mm) > urban area (346.6 mm). The change of land use type was the main underlying surface factor leading to the significant change of regional evapotranspiration.

TI  - DYNAMIC MONITORING OF ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT QUALITY OF LAND CONSOLIDATION BASED ON MULTI-SOURCE REMOTE SENSING DATA AND RSEI MODEL
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Land consolidation and ecological transformation are the inevitable trend of land consolidation development. It is very important to carry out scientific, reasonable, long-term and comprehensive monitoring of ecological environment quality in the study area. Therefore, a dynamic monitoring of ecological environment quality of land consolidation based on multi-source remote sensing data and RSEI model is proposed. Firstly, Taking Xiong'an New Area as the research area, according to the data sources of Landsat TM and OLI remote sensing images, the multi-source remote sensing data were preprocessed by ENVI5.1 software, so as to correct the distortion caused by atmospheric quality and sensor sensitivity. Then, the (RSEI was constructed by principal component analysis (PCA), which was integrated into the four indicators of greenness, humidity, dryness and heat, so as to evaluate the changes of eco-environmental quality in the process of renovation of Guilin city. Finally, based on the remote sensing data of Xiong'an New Area from 2005 to 2019, the results show that: humidity and greenness index have a positive effect on the eco-environmental quality of the project area, while the heat and dryness index have a negative effect, and the impact of the dryness index is the largest; the ecological environment quality of Xiong'an New Area presents the trend of "first decline, then rise, overall decline", which is shown as follows" The results show that the disturbance of land consolidation to the ecological environment of the city is persistent.

AB  - Integrated aquaculture systems, that is, systems involving the cocultivation of aquatic food with crops, provide high protein and energy outputs per unit of land and raise farm incomes. However, they can also cause substantial environmental problems, such as water and soil pollution. We used time series of satellite images to map the evolution of a new farming system integrating paddy rice production with crawfish cultivation from its implementation in 2013 to 2020 in five provinces (805,600 km2) in China. We used an object-based water difference method that integrates pixel-based identification with object-based segmentation. We first mapped the distribution of the water bodies by using the automated water extraction index and then extracted the integrated rice-crawfish area at the pixel level based on changes in the presence of water between the fallow and rice planting periods. We used the noniterative clustering algorithm in GEE to segment the Landsat images. Finally, we intersected the segmentation results with the rice-crawfish pixels and calculated the percentage of crawfish pixels within each image object using 50 % as the threshold for rice-crawfish detection. The object-based water difference method captured integrated rice-crawfish production only when there was a change in the presence of water between the fallow and planting periods. Rice-crawfish farming systems that were not associated with a change in the presence of water could not be identified.

TI  - Soil salinity prediction based on scale-dependent relationships with environmental variables by discrete wavelet transform in the Tarim Basin
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation in soil salinity is affected by environmental factors that occur at different scales with varying intensities. It is critical to adequately consider environmental variables under scale effects for digital soil mapping which has been minimally discussed in previous studies. The objectives of this research are to analyze the scale-dependent variability in soil salinity distribution under environmental controlling factors using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) techniques and to compare the differences between the accuracy of soil salinity predictions with and without multiple scale-specific relationships. Thirteen environmental factors related to soil salinity that included influencing environmental factors and indicative environmental factors involving climate, soil, terrain, and vegetation were extracted at 500 m intervals along four transects through farmland and salt-affected land situated at the oasis and oasis-desert ecotones of Xinjiang, China. Each spatial series of soil salinity and environmental variables along the four transects was separated into seven scale components (six details components, namely Dl through D6, and one approximation component, namely A6). A Hilbert transform was used to identify the specific spatial scales of each scale component in the DWT procedure. The results indicate that 21.77 km and > 32 km were the dominant scales, which explained approximately 60-80% of the spatial variation of soil salinity throughout the oases. The prediction accuracy with wavelet reconstruction that depended on all the scale components of environmental variables is significantly improved compared with the accuracy of those with the stepwise multiple linear regression method at a single sampling scale. The generalized difference vegetation index (GDVI) was the major predictor of soil salinity on salt-affected land, while evapotranspiration and the terrain ruggedness index (TRI) were the major contributing factors in farmland inside the oases. This study demonstrated that specific scale-dependent relationships can reveal the scale control of soil salinity variation and had the potential to improve the prediction accuracy of soil properties.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of the spatial distribution and severity of soil salinization has long plagued local governments and researchers in the arid parts of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XJUAR). The emergence of machine learning has brought hope to this research field, such as Random Forest (RF) and Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT),however, which are few applications to the quantitative assessment of soil salinization. Therefore, in order to evaluate the accuracy level of the two algorithms for predicting soil salinity, twenty-seven environmental subsets were designed. Each data set is calculated using both RF and SGT to produce an optimal set of variables. The simulation results from 70.37% (19/27) of the subsets showed that the predicted value of soil salinity from SGT is closer to the observed value than is that from RF. The statistics of all datasets showed that the average values of R-2 value for RF and SGT were 0.38 and 0.40, the average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value were 28.59 and 27.46, and the Ratio of Prediction to Deviation (RPD) averages were 1.20 and 1.24, respectively. The important dominant factor were topographic variables with coarse resolution, temperature and vegetation indices, land use and landform.

At present, passive microwave remote sensing is the most effective method for monitoring global and regional snow depth (SD). The traditional SD inversion algorithms use empirical or semiempirical methods to establish a fixed relationship between the SD and brightness temperature difference, given snow particle size and snow density. However, the snow characteristics present large temporal heterogeneity in Northeast China, and it leads to the inadaptability of the SD retrieval algorithm; using a fixed empirical coefficient will lead to large errors in SD inversion. In this study, a novel dynamic method was proposed to retrieve SD based on AMSR2 brightness temperature data. A snow survey experiment was designed to collect snow characteristics in different periods in Northeast China, and the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks was applied to simulate brightness temperature with varying snow characteristics to determine the dynamic coefficients in the SD retrieval algorithm. The validation results at 98 meteorological stations demonstrate that the novel dynamic SD inversion algorithm achieved better stability in the long-term sequence, its RMSE, bias, and R are 7.79 cm, 1.07 cm, and 0.61, respectively. Furthermore, compared with Che SD products, Chang algorithm, and AMSR2 SD products, the novel algorithm can obtain specific dynamic coefficients considering the snow metamorphism and has a higher accuracy of SD inversion in the whole winter. In conclusion, this novel SD inversion algorithm is more applicable and accurate than the existing SD inversion products in Northeast China.

AB  - This paper takes Chunwon's 'Heo Saeng biography' and Lu Xun’s 'mending the sky' as the research objects, and investigates the literary thoughts of the two writers by comparing the creative background and the characteristics of the protagonists in the two works.First of all, this paper investigates the background of Chunwon and Lu Xun's creation of "imitating classical works", and finds that their social background is relatively similar. In adversity, they hope to enlighten literature with new literary forms. But in 'Heo Saeng biography' and 'mending the sky', the characteristics of the characters they created and their motives for creating these works are very different.Heo Saeng in Chunwon's "Heo Saeng biography" made him a national hero and a savior. Chunwon painted Heo Saeng as a perfect hero with extraordinary abilities through exaggerated tactics. Unlike Yeonam's "Heo Saeng biography" intended to criticize society with satire, Chunwon expressed his ideal worldview by giving Heo Saeng a perfect and extraordinary image of a savior, raising interest in tradition and ethnicity.Lu Xun's Nu Wa, the main character in ‘mending the sky’, is different from the superwoman Nu Wa in mythology. The author adds the characteristics of Nu Wa, who is portrayed as a female worker with the physique, feelings and emotions of an ordinary person. Through Nu Wa, Lu Xun demonstrated his motivation to open up new literary forms and enlighten the nation and the people.In addition, Lu Xun painted a sad and heroic figure with Nu Wa through his "slickness" technique.This shows the author's positive evaluation of the pioneers and critical evaluation of the dark reality. In addition, Lu Xun's thinking of "creating human beings" can be seen in the contents of "Independent Development of Humanity created by Nu Wa" in "mending the sky"s as the research object to investigate their religious views at that time.

TI  - TimeSen2Crop: A Million Labeled Samples Dataset of Sentinel 2 Image Time Series for Crop-Type Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents TimeSen2Crop, a pixel-based dataset made up of more than 1 million samples of Sentinel 2 time series (TSs) associated to 16 crop types. This dataset, publicly available, aims to contribute to the worldwide research related to the supervised classification of TSs of Sentinel 2 data for crop type mapping. TimeSen2Crop includes atmospherically corrected images and reports the snow, shadows, and clouds information per labeled unit. The provided TSs represent an agronomic year (i.e., period from one year's harvest to the next one for agricultural commodity) ranging from September 2017 to August 2018. To generate the dataset, the publicly available Austrian crop type map based on farmer's declarations has been considered. To ensure the selection of reliable labeled units from the map (i.e., pure pixels correctly associated to their labels), an automatic procedure for the extraction of the training set based on a multitemporal deep learning model has been defined. TimeSen2Crop also includes a TS of Sentinel 2 images acquired in the following agronomic year (i.e., from September 2018 to August 2019). These data are provided with the aim of attract more research activities for solving a typical challenge of the crop type mapping task: adapting multitemporal deep learning models to different year (domain adaptation). The design of the dataset is described along with a benchmark comparison of deep learning models for crop type mapping.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - This work presents a system for multi-year crop type mapping based on the multi-temporal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Learning (DL) model and Sentinel 2 image Time Series (TS). The method assumes the availability of a pre-trained LSTM model for a given year and aims to update the corresponding crop type map for a different year considering a small amount of recent reference data. To this end, the proposed approach combines Self-Paced Learning (SPL) and fine-tuning (FT) techniques. While the SPL technique gradually incorporates samples from crop types that can be classified with high-confidence by the pre-trained model, the FT strategy adapts the network to those classes having low-confidence accuracy. This condition allows us to reduce the labeled samples required to achieve accurate classification results. The experimental results obtained on three tiles of the Austrian country on TSs of Sentinel 2 data acquired in 2019 and 2020 (considering a model pre-trained on images of 2018) demonstrate the capability of the LSTM to adapt to TS of images with different temporal and radiometric characteristic with respect to the one used to pre-train the model, with a relatively small number of training samples. As expected, by directly applying the model without performing any adaptation, we obtain a mean F-score (F1%) of 64% and 62% compared to 76% and 70% achieved by the proposed technique with only 1500 samples for 2019 and 2020, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - A legend of the Flying Dutchman was suggested to Wagner by Heine's prose, along with the "blood-red sails" of the mariner. The composer turned it into an incoherent set of heterogeneous religious, Romantic, and theatrical cliches. This eclecticism was united only by the late Romantic cult of death and extermination which permeated the libretto. It was alien to Heine's sad irony of, but quite typical of Wagner's worldview. This cult of death gave a gloomy shade to the composer's aggressive journalism which was later absorbed by the German Nazism as a leading ideology, eventually practically implemented. Heine compared his ill-fated mariner with the Wandering Jew, that is, Ahasuerus: he saw in this allegorical character his own national and personal prototype. In the auto-commentaries to the opera, Wagner borrowed Heine's identification with the character, which did not prevent him from using Ahasuerus as an anti-Semitic gollywog in his pamphlet against Jewishness in music, calling for his destruction. In the XX century, both Wagner's libretto and Heine's story were transformed by Kafka into the novella "The Hunter Gracchus" that also had an autobiographical component. On the other hand, the plot of Wagner's opera found, by contrast, an optimistic solution in Alexander Grin's story Scarlet Sails, where Heine's and Wagner's initially "blood-red sails" acquired a new shade with a different, solar, that is, lifeasserting connotation.

TI  - An aberration detection-based approach for sentinel syndromic surveillance of COVID-19 and other novel influenza-like illnesses
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 has emerged as a significant global concern, triggering harsh public health restrictions in a successful bid to curb its exponential growth. As discussion shifts towards relaxation of these restrictions, there is significant concern of second-wave resurgence. The key to managing these outbreaks is early detection and intervention, and yet there is a significant lag time associated with usage of laboratory confirmed cases for surveillance purposes. To address this, syndromic surveillance can be considered to provide a timelier alternative for first-line screening. Existing syndromic surveillance solutions are however typically focused around a known disease and have limited capability to distinguish between outbreaks of individual diseases sharing similar syndromes. This poses a challenge for surveillance of COVID-19 as its active periods tend to overlap temporally with other influenza-like illnesses. In this study we explore performing sentinel syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses using a deep learning-based approach. Our methods are based on aberration detection utilizing autoencoders that leverages symptom prevalence distributions to distinguish outbreaks of two ongoing diseases that share similar syndromes, even if they occur concurrently. We first demonstrate that this approach works for detection of outbreaks of influenza, which has known temporal boundaries. We then demonstrate that the autoencoder can be trained to not alert on known and well-managed influenza-like illnesses such as the common cold and influenza. Finally, we applied our approach to 2019-2020 data in the context of a COVID-19 syndromic surveillance task to demonstrate how implementation of such a system could have provided early warning of an outbreak of a novel influenza-like illness that did not match the symptom prevalence profile of influenza and other known influenza-like illnesses.

TI  - Rapid cloud-based temporal compositing of Sentinel-1 radar imagery for epibenthic shellfish inventory.
T2  - Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineation of shellfish beds through field surveys is time consuming. Remote sensing can help in detecting the location and boundaries of shellfish beds. This can be achieved through the use of aerial photographs and optical satellite sensors during cloud-free and low-tide conditions. Cloud penetrating radar is an alternative, but still requires careful selection of low tide imagery. Manual selection becomes cumbersome for large areas, such as the entire Dutch Wadden Sea. We therefore developed a method that automatically combines dense time series of Sentinel-1 radar imagery into a useful mosaic that allows for effective delineation of shellfish beds. The method consists of temporal compositing many images in the cloud-based Google Earth Engine. We evaluated different combinations of 1) compositing options (average backscatter and various percentiles), 2) temporal periods for compositing, 3) different polarizations, and 4) imagery from ascending versus descending satellite paths. The resulting composite images were visually compared with in-situ records to identify which composite visually best allowed for shellfish bed delineation. Although the average VH-polarized backscatter for one full year provided effective demarcation, an RGB color composite containing three average VH images for four months each provided improved visibility of the shellfish beds. We then quantitatively compared which compositing option was most effective in separating pixels with shellfish beds from those without. For this purpose, the unsupervised classification approach of K-means clustering was applied to the different composite images, and outcomes (i.e. selected classes) were compared with field data derived from the annual in-situ survey. The multi-season image composites (i.e. Jan-Apr, May-Aug, and Sep-Dec) that were made by combining VH image acquisitions of only descending and of combined ascending and descending paths resulted in higher accuracies than other compositing options tested. The producer and user accuracy of the multi-season descending composite were respectively 40% and 70% for the full Dutch Wadden Sea, against 59% and 73% for a smaller subset. These accuracies are similar to what is previously achieved for small study areas with carefully selected radar images acquired around low tide. Moreover, our approach could identify various shellfish beds that were initially missed by the in-situ surveys, but for which later the presence was confirmed (so the actual producer accuracy would increase to about 82%). The composite images can be created on the fly with Google Earth Engine shortly before a field campaign and used as a base for sampling design.

M3  - Article
AB  - Death is one of the main themes, perhaps the main theme of the work of Velimir Khlebnikov. It occurs everywhere in his work, from the very first poem (1904) to his famous supersaga Zangezi (1922). For Khlebnikov death is not the result of a tragic worldview. He considers death as something which on the one hand belongs to life, but on the other has to be, and can be, conquered. The article discusses the many images of death in Khlebnikov's early poems (1904-1908). Just as in his later work death is often connected with water (drowning), love, fighting and horses.

TI  - Bluetongue virus serotype 12 enters Australia - a further incursion of novel western lineage genome segments
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an arbovirus (genus: Orbivirus) that occurs worldwide. It infects domestic and wild ruminant species and can cause disease in livestock, producing high economic impact. Recently, it gained extra prominence throughout Europe, with disease occurring in regions traditionally free of BTV. BTV enters Australia from Southeast Asia via wind-borne infected Culicoides spp. The first Australian isolation was 1975 (BTV-20) and further serotypes were isolated between 1979-86 (BTV-1, -3, -9, -15, -16, -21, -23). Despite increased, more sensitive, monitoring, no more were detected in over two decades, implying a stable BTV episystem of eastern ancestry. Isolations of BTV-2, -7 and -5 then occurred between 2007-15, with the latter two possessing genome segments with high sequence identity to western isolates. We report on the first isolation and genomic characterization of BTV-12, which revealed that three more novel western topotype gene segments have entered northern Australia.

T2  - European Nucleotide Archive
M3  - Data study
AB  - We investigated the effect of a temperature shift from 23˚C to 37˚C, mimicking the temperature transition experienced by a microbe as it enters a human host. This strategy allowed the exploration of the kinetics of gene expression changes in immediate response to a temperature upshift and to characterize the suite of genes required to respond to 37˚C in the first few hours. We demonstrate that a significant number of genes are rapidly altered in expression within minutes to hours after a temperature shift. Some are only induced transiently, while are required for long-term adaptation. Many of these genes are related to metabolism, stress response, and immune evasion suggesting that temperature may serve as a sentinel cue to predict and prepare for niche adaptation in the host. Overall design: An aerobic, mid-exponential phase (A600= 0.2-0.6) culture was grown at 23˚C in M9 minimal medium containing glycerol as a carbon source. Aliquots of the initial culture were shifted to 37˚C to allow harvest of cells at time points after a shift to 37˚C. Microarray results compare each timepoint after the shift to 37˚C (T= 0.5, 1, or 4 hours) to the initial T=0 timepoint grown at 23˚C.

AB  - Land subsidence is a problem in several big cities and areas in Indonesia; some of them occurred in Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, and the North Coast of Java location. The subsidence conditions are different and highly dependent on many factors, including geological and excessive groundwater extraction. One of the cities experiencing severe subsidence conditions in Indonesia is Bandung. This research is based on Interferometric SAR analysis using C-Band Sentinel 1A frequency data released by the European Space Agency (ESA), recorded on 11 November 2018 and 18 November 2019. Based on the analysis of SAR interferometry, Bandung City experienced subsidence with an average size of 6 cm per year. The city of Bandung is located between the mountains and can be described as a bowl. The city of Bandung itself is formed from alluvial plains resulting from the sedimentation process from the surrounding mountains. Geologically, the city of Bandung can be described as a city composed of materials that have not undergone a perfect consolidation process. This condition causes the city of Bandung to be prone to land subsidence disasters. In addition, another factor that plays a dominant role in the process of excessive groundwater extraction by residential and primarily industrial activities scattered in the Bandung area. If not handled properly, the phenomenon of land subsidence in the city of Bandung will cause a very detrimental impact, reduce the carrying capacity of the environment, and threaten the sustainability of the city. Among the actual effects on the broader area in Bandung that is affected by floods, especially during the rainy season.

TI  - The Influence of Shadow Effects on the Spectral Characteristics of Glacial Meltwater
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenomenon of shadows due to glaciers is investigated in Antarctica. The observed shadow effect disrupts analyses conducted by remote sensing and is a challenge in the assessment of sediment meltwater plumes in polar marine environments. A DJI Inspire 2 drone equipped with a Zenmuse x5s camera was used to generate a digital surface model (DSM) of 6 King George Island glaciers: Ecology, Dera, Zalewski, Ladies, Krak, and Vieville. On this basis, shaded areas of coves near glaciers were traced. For the first time, spectral characteristics of shaded meltwater were observed with the simultaneous use of a Sequoia+ spectral camera mounted on a Parrot Bluegrass drone and in Landsat 8 satellite images. In total, 44 drone flights were made, and 399 satellite images were analyzed. Among them, four drone spectral images and four satellite images were selected, meeting the condition of a visible shadow. For homogeneous waters (deep, low turbidity, without ice phenomena), the spectral properties tend to change during the approach to an obstacle casting a shadow especially during low shortwave downward radiation. In this case, in the shade, the amount of radiation reflected in the green spectral band decreases by 50% far from the obstacle and by 43% near the obstacle, while in near infrared (NIR), it decreases by 42% and 21%, respectively. With highly turbid, shallow water and ice phenomena, this tendency does not occur. It was found that the green spectral band had the highest contrast in the amount of reflected radiation between nonshaded and shaded areas, but due to its high sensitivity, the analysis could have been overestimated. The spectral properties of shaded meltwater differ depending on the distance from the glacier front, which is related to the saturation of the water with sediment particles. We discovered that the pixel aggregation of uniform areas caused the loss of detailed information, while pixel aggregation of nonuniform, shallow areas with ice phenomena caused changes and the loss of original information. During the aggregation of the original pixel resolution (15 cm) up to 30 m, the smallest error occurred in the area with a homogeneous water surface, while the greatest error (over 100%) was identified in the places where the water was strongly cloudy or there were ice phenomena.

TI  - Warning Signs in the Era of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms: Report on 2 Cases of Fatal Aneurysmal Hemorrhage
T2  - CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES EXTRA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The timing of treatment remains unresolved for patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) and headaches, particularly when the pain is short term, localized, and related to the aneurysm site. We lack evidence to support the notion that when a headache accompanies an aneurysm, it elevates the risk of rupture. Results: We describe 2 cases of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with a history of headache and known aneurysms. Both of these patients had good indications for treatment: a young age and an aneurysm >7 mm, and both were qualified for elective surgery. However, both patients died of fatal aneurysm ruptures before the planned surgery. Conclusion: These cases suggested that treatment should be started as soon as possible, when a UIA is diagnosed based on a short-term period of severe headaches or when a UIA is observed and then severe headaches appear. There is no straightforward guideline for treatment timing in these patients. However, in this era of UIAs, the significance of sentinel headaches should be reevaluated. Given the incidence of headaches in the general population and the very low risk of aneurysm rupture, there may be a tendency to neglect the role of headache as a possible warning sign.

T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess the compositions and configurations of the urban green spaces (UGS) in urban functional land use areas in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The UGS data were extracted from Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) imagery and examined along with ancillary data. The results showed that the high-density mixed residence, medium-density mixed residence, and low-density mixed residence areas contained 16.7%, 8.7%, and 42.6% of the UGS, respectively, and together occupied 67.5% of the total UGS in the study area. Manufacturing and storage, social services, transport, administration, municipal function, and commercial areas contained 11.6%, 8.2%, 6.6%, 3.3%, 1.3%, and 1% of the UGS, respectively, together account for only 32% of the total UGS, indicating that two-third of the UGS were found in residential areas. Further, the results showed that 86.2% of individual UGS measured less than 3000 m(2), while 13.8% were greater than 3000 m(2), demonstrating a high level of fragmentation. The results also showed that there were strong correlations among landscape metrics, while the relationship between urban form and landscape metrics was moderate. Finally, more studies need to be conducted on the spatial pattern characteristics of UGS using very high-resolution (VHR) images. Additionally, future urban planning, design, and management need to be guided by an understanding of the composition and configuration of the UGS.

T2  - ACTA POLONIAE HISTORICA
M3  - Biographical-Item
AB  - Jerzy Wojciech Borejsza was the son of communist activist Jerzy Borejsza, referred to as an 'international communist', and Ewa nee Kantor. His grandfather Abraham Goldberg was one of the leaders of Polish Zionists. Borejsza described himself as a Pole of Jewish origin'. His personality was greatly influenced by the Second World War experiences, including the pogrom of Jews in German-occupied Lwow in July 1941 and the tragic events of occupied Warsaw. As a result of the decision of the communist party authorities, in 1952, Borejsza was sent to study in the Soviet Union, first to Kazan, then to Moscow. This made it impossible for him to study Polish philology in Warsaw; Borejsza, therefore, chose historical studies. After returning to Poland in 1957, he undertook research on the history of Polish emigration after the January Uprising (1863-4). He was also interested in the history of the Polish socialist movement and its connections to socialism in Western Europe. Later, Borejsza intervened in the historiography of the Crimean War (1853-6), intending to bring this forgotten armed conflict back to light. He coined the phrase 'the beautiful nineteenth century', in contrast to the twentieth century as a time of hatred, extermination, and the Holocaust. Initially, Borejsza worked at the Polish Academy of Sciences (1958-64), then at the University of Warsaw (1964-75). In the early 1970s, he began research on Italian fascism and Italy's unsuccessful attempts to create a fascist International. He also conducted research on the worldview of Adolf Hitler, formulating the view that, apart from anti-Semitism, another vital component of the Fuhrer's racism was anti-Slavism. Borejsza was the author of a textbook on totalitarian and authoritarian systems in Europe in 1918-45 (entitled Schools of Hatred). After the anti-Semitic campaign launched by the communist authorities in March 1968, he was removed from the University of Warsaw (1975). From then until the end of his life, he worked at the Institute of History of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw. In the years 2004-12, he was also employed at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun. In the last years of his life, he researched Russian archives, dealing with the history of communism as a totalitarian system and the Comintern's attitude toward Poland and Stalinist persecution of Polish communists. Jerzy W. Borejsza was an outstanding Polish researcher of the history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. He also witnessed the tragic history of the century of extermination.

AB  - Climate change has a significant impact on vegetation growth and terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, the possibility of ecological drought was investigated using satellite remote sensing data. First, the Vegetation Health Index was estimated from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Land Surface Temperature provided by MODIS. Then, a joint probability model was constructed to estimate the possibility of vegetation-related drought in various precipitation/evaporation scenarios in forest areas around 60 major ASOS sites of the Meteorological Administration located throughout Korea. The results of this study show the risk pattern of drought related to forest vegetation under conditions of low atmospheric moisture supply or high atmospheric moisture demand. It also identifies the sensitivity of drought risks associated with forest vegetation under various meterological drought conditions. These findings provide insights for decision makers to assess drought risk and develop drought mitigation strategies related to forest vegetation in a warming era.

M3  - research-article
AB  - I propose the necessity of ecological aesthetics and explore the possibility based on the problem that Korean ecological poems must expand their methodology as well as change their perceptions in order to respond to a new era of ecological transformation in the 21st century in this paper. Therefore, unlike ecological literature research, which has been biased toward content, the aesthetic characteristics of ecological literature are attracting attention. In order to build ecological aesthetics, standards for perspective, expression, and ethical dimensions are presented. In addition, by applying these criteria to actual works analysis, the specific feasibility of ecological aesthetics is reviewed.In dimension of perspective, ecological aesthetics, unlike the human-centered perspective of existing aesthetics, is characterized by a convergent perspective between humans and nature. The phenomenological perspective that values the mutual fusion between the subject and the other has good implications for ecological aesthetics. Since ecological aesthetics values the interdependent relationship of the entire ecological system, it aims for the diversity and resilience of the life community beyond the human-centered gaze.In dimension of expression, ecological aesthetics utilizes various senses, unlike the visualism of modern aesthetics. Through the oriental aesthetic category, ‘Uigyeong’, we can explore the possibility of external nature and human inner life coordinating and expanding by combining the vitality of the senses and free imagination. In order to express the diversity of senses and the interrelationship between subjects and objects, it is necessary to have a positive attitude and intuitive insight to listen to the language of nature, not the language of instruments.In dimension of ethics, ecological aesthetics takes precedence over subjects, so ethical practices beyond aesthetic autonomy are emphasized. Aesthetics and ethics cannot be separate in ecological aesthetics where nature and humans are perceived as life communities. The aesthetic principles of balance, harmony and fairness are also a social and ethical definition.The worldview of the past, which was convinced that humans could dominate and control nature, is changing its perception that cooperation between nature and humans is more important than anything else in order to achieve the goal of a sustainable future. Along with this change in worldview, our views on nature and aesthetic sensitivity are bound to change. Ecological aesthetics suggests the possibility of new aesthetics that can respond to the spirit of the times by inheriting or transforming some of the long aesthetic traditions that nature has shared.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper explores the concept of romanticism in Chunhyangjeon against the backdrop of social class. Chunhyangjeon’s progressive nature is realized not only through its reflection of reality but also in its romanticism; however, this is an insufficiently researched subject. This paper shows that the romanticism in Chunhyangjeon is divided into the use of attractive protagonists, enchanted spaces, and love that transcends status.The male and female protagonists of Chunhyangjeon are attractive, projecting the romantic perception of reality. Chunhyang’s absolute beauty represents the fact that even lower-class women have human dignity, which cannot be infringed by power or status. Lee Doryeong is a prodigal character, but Chunhyang accepts him as a hero. This contradiction reveals that her desires and human understanding transcend status.Chunhyangjeon also presents spaces that cannot exist in reality. Lee Doryeong feels ecstasy in this space, affirming that the way of life is beyond the worldview of the Sadebu (士大夫) and revealing the confidence of a new class. In addition, it seems logical to the narrative wherein Lee Doryeong assumes the duty of love.The progressiveness of Chunhyangjeon is seen in its idea of love that transcends status. This can be called romantic in that it presents emotions, attitudes, and actions that cannot be found in the reality of the social status system as an ideal. Chunhyang and Lee Doryeong begin their relationship by defying the existence of the status system. This is shown through the Bariga and love songs used in the love scenes on the wedding night. They ask each other who they are or want to be. The pleasure of love and the pursuit of a new existence are identified here. This allows us to experience the limits of the status system and to trust in human dignity.Chunhyangjeon forms an aesthetic community based on this romanticism, showing the play to be a narrative of a group that created a new sense of self amid the social changes of 19th century Joseon (朝鮮).

AB  - I explored how the novel form of the female protagonist exists in Jeondeungsinhwa(剪燈新話) and Geumosinhwa(金鰲新話). This was to understand the identity of Geumosinhwa in terms of novel form and aesthetic experience. In Jeondeungsinhwa and Geumosinhwa, the female protagonist is formalized as the subject of affection desire. If the novel form is the object of aesthetic experience in the process of accepting the novel text, the subject of affection desire is the substance of that form. In Jeondeungsinhwa and Geumosinhwa, as the subject of affection desire, the female protagonist tries to settle the pleasure of sex and the psychology of affection as an institution of marriage. In both works, the female protagonist as the subject of affection desire is a normative being. This may be because both works follow the tradition of Jeongi novels(傳奇小說) which is the narratives of intellectual men. In both works, the female protagonist is formalized as the subject of affection desire, but the actual appearance and the aesthetic experience are not the same. The moment is not particularly important for the female protagonist to love men, as Jeondeungsinhwa reflects the male intellectual’s self-centered view of affection. From this point of view, it can be seen that the novel form of the female protagonist in Jeondeungsinhwa is cliched. The cliche found in the formalization of the female protagonist as the subject of affection desire has three meanings. The origin of form lies in the custom of Jeongi novels, that form follows the dominant worldview, and that form does not imply a new aesthetic experience. If the formalization of the female protagonist is cliched in Jeondeungsinhwa, the formalization of the female protagonist in Geumosinhwa shows a crack in such cliche. This has three meanings. It is that the form originates from the work itself, that the existing worldview's intervention on the form is limited, and that the form escapes the conventional and ideological perception of affection or affectionate relationship.In the process of the female protagonist pursuing the desire for affection, the uniqueness of the Geumosinhwa is in the end to newly present the subjectivity of the female protagonist and the male protagonist. Under the influence of patriarchy, the Jeondeungsinhwa presents a woman who voluntarily accepts not only the pleasures of affection desires, but also painful obligations, and a man who passively enjoys only pleasures, but stands out of duty. Contrary to this, Geumosinhwa presents a woman who faces pain and has a conflict and a man who runs away from pain and feels self-defeating. As for the relationship between affection desire and the subject, in Jeondeungsinhwa which has some variations, intellectual men’s cliched world perception is visioble. But in Geumosinhwa, there is a reflection that goes beyond such cliches. I think this aspect is the originality of Geumosinhwa and the aesthetic uniqueness.

AB  - When Mao Zedong’s ‘Intermediate Zone’ theory was presented to the world, it was the first time in the history of the CCP that a unique world view, different from the Soviet’s, had appeared. However, as the cold war confrontation spread, the CCP accepted the ‘Two Camps’ theory of the Soviet Union and adopted the ‘Lean to One Side’ policy for the practical needs of state building, and as a result, the independence of worldview was delayed. Although the ‘Intermediate Zone’ theory was raised again after the Korean War, the meaning of it was different from the one raised in 1946. In 1946, since China was to be the core of the ‘Intermediate Zone’, an active role was assigned to it. But, in 1950s as China became a member of the ‘Soviet-led socialist camp’, not of the ‘Intermediate Zone’, the role of the ‘Intermediate Zone’ was more downplayed. It can be said that the ‘Intermediate Zone’ theory of the 1950s did not deviate from the framework of the ‘Two Camps Theory’, and was the result of policy adjustments according to changes in the international environment.The ‘Two Intermediate Zones’ theory proposed in the early 1960s, meant that Mao Zedong's world perception had begun to deviate from the official framework of the ‘Two Camps’ theory. As the Sino-Soviet relations broke down, Mao Zedong and the CCP leadership classified the Soviet Union as a hostile force, and these changes were naturally reflected in their world perception. The ‘Two Intermediate Zones’ theory was to include the developed capitalist countries other than the United States as a ‘Second Intermediate Zone’, which was to be different in nature from the existing ‘First Intermediate Zone’ consisted of underdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and thereby drawing them into the anti-U.S. united front. In that respect, the ‘Two Intermediate Zones’ theory did not change significantly from the ‘Intermediate Zone’ theory of the 1950s. However, as the contradictions between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries were emphasized, the world perception of the ‘Two Intermediate Zones’ theory became very different from the existing ‘Two Camps’ theory or the ‘Intermediate Zone’ theory. The ‘Three Worlds’ theory presented by Mao in the early 1970s was the outcome of such perceptional changes of the world, and at this stage, the Soviet Union was officially classified as a hegemonic state more dangerous than the United States, and was set as the target of the global anti-hegemonic united front.Historically, it can be said that the development of Mao Zedong’s world perception was a process of trial and error, leading towards complete perceptional independence from the worldview of the Soviet Union. The departure from the Soviet-centered worldview of the ‘Two Camps’ theory began with the ‘Intermediate Zone’ theory in 1946, and after going through some variations of the theory, the process was finally completed in the early 1970s with the appearance of the ‘Three Worlds’ theory. The evolution of Mao Zedong’s world perception can be evaluated as an important achievement in the history of Chinese nationalist revolution.

AB  - This thesis examines the problem of the ecological environment, which is becoming important in modern society, through the worldview in Zhouyi (周易), how to find a solution with a certain sense of problem within the community called 'global village'. The worldview establishes the ecological structure of heaven and earth and deals with the sustainability and principle of human existence and values in it. It presents a series of processes that flow in the spatio-temporal structure of all beings: webs of Yi (易), emergent methods of contrivance (變通), creative symbols of Qiankun (乾坤), and sustainability of social morality. This comes from recognizing the web of the natural world, including humans, as a community of life and understanding its essence in terms of the spirit of life.An important factor in understanding the worldview of Zhouyi is the spirit of life. The spirit of life has resulted in understanding the character of nature's ecosystem and the reason all life exists in it and the way it lives. "The great virtue of heaven and earth is called life" in the Xicizhuan (繫辭傳, Copula commentary). "Heaven and earth" represents the phenomena of the natural world, whose essential properties lie in life and its spiritual material. This reflects a series of cycles in which life is constantly created, changed, and extinguished, which has a "producing, reproducing, and never ceasing" way in which everything proceeds with metabolism and generational change. This way is related to the inherent capabilities of heaven and earth.Sustainable reality can be sought in an ecological environment centered on the natural world. Nature's network, which is full of vitality, is recognized as a certain framework that all living things can share throughout the phenomena of the natural world. This framework is the "base of the life community." "Life community" refers to the human community's sense of all living things and their activities in accordance with the operating order of the celestial or natural world. Also, in the relationship in which life is respected and it is implemented, the "base of life community" is an ideological world in which ideological pursuit and value orientation in individuals and societies are consistent. It refers to the most ideal stage or level which brings life into existence and exists and continuance. It can be returned to the best reasonable state and ultimate goal, or the reasonable value of good, to reach in an ecological environment. Therefore, the "good as a life community" presupposes the consciousness that human society is a "sustainable" world that harmonizes with natural ecosystems and is based on faith or creed.

AB  - Jeju Pungtorok is an excerpt and photoprint from the contents contained in the fourth volume of Collection of Scholar Chungam’s Works, a collection of poems and writings written by Kim Jeong. This is Kim Jeong’s reply to the questions from his sister’s son about Jeju's climate and local produce more than a year after he was exiled to Jeju in 1520 (the 15th year of King Jungjong's reign). The contents include Jeju's climate, house, religion, Jeju Dialect, customs, the life and sentiment of the people, topography, indigenous produce, the flora and fauna, places of natural beauty, and life of exile. Apparently, they were written based on the experiences and facts Kim Jeong gained and learned while living there in exile. Jeju Pungtorok is the first Jeju topography, as well as a vivid picture of Jeju's situation in the first half of the 16th century. As a result, its value as the historical materials can be regarded very high.On the other hand, Kim Jeong was a man of deep Neo-Confucianism and thorough in his thoughts enough to be revered by Neo-Confucian scholars even after his death. On the contrary, Jeju Island was a place where Neo-Confucian ideology was less developed as a socio-cultural standardization throughout the Joseon Dynasty. As a result, Kim Jeong is believed to have a rather negative viewpoint on Jeju's situation in the first half of the 16th century. He is also believed to describe the Jeju society from his own subjective perspective on the basis of Neo-Confucian worldview, not of the cultural pluralism.

AB  - This study examines the use of satellite images for river classification and determination of stream reach, which is the first priority in the river environment assessment system. In the river environment assessment system used in South Korea, it is proposed to set a stream reach by using 10 or 25 times the width of the river based on the result of river classification. First, river classification for the main stream section of Cheongmi stream was performed using various river-related data. The maximum likelihood method was applied for land cover classification. In this study, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, which is an open data technology with a resolution of 10 m, was used. A total of four satellite images from 2018 was used to consider various flow conditions: February 2 (daily discharge = 2.39 m3/s), May 23 (daily discharge = 15.51 m3/s), June 2 (daily discharge = 3.88 m3/s), and July 7 (daily discharge = 33.61 m3/s). The river widths were estimated from the result of land cover classification to determine stream reach. The results of the assessment reach classification were evaluated using indicators of stream physical environments, including pool diversity, channel sinuosity, and river crossing shape and structure. It is concluded that appropriate flow conditions need to be considered when using satellite images to set up assessment segments for the river environment assessment system.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) funded a program to leverage cloud-based processing of satellite data with a program called Commercially Augmented Space Inter-Network Operations (CASINO) Processing, Exploitation, and Dissemination (PED). Southwest Research Institute (SwRI (R)) is one of two teams developing demonstrations using different commercial cloud computing services. Our CASINO PED team is leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the satellite data processing chain. Over the last decade, the military has significantly increased the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) data it collects. Unfortunately, this data surplus has created a bottleneck in processing and analysis. This prototype will demonstrate rapid, scalable delivery of processed satellite data to the tactical units needing the information in areas of conflict. The CASINO PED demonstration project will integrate a ground network supporting a constellation of satellites with unique processing capabilities and cloud access to deliver data needed to meet military objectives. One of the concerns is the reliability and throughput of this process. We collected data from operation of the prototype processing stream to determine throughput and reliability. We present our analysis of the system performance and observations on the applicability of cloud-based processing for needs of this type.

TI  - Genomic Drivers of Multidrug-Resistant <i>Shigella</i> Affecting Vulnerable Patient Populations in the United States and Abroad
T2  - MBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Shigella infections have been identified globally among men who have sex with men (MSM). The highly drug-resistant phenotype often confounds initial antimicrobial therapy, placing patients at risk for adverse outcomes, the development of more drug-resistant strains, and additional treatment failures. New macrolide-resistant Shigella strains complicate treatment further as azithromycin is a next-in-line antibiotic for MDR strains, and an antibiotic-strain combination confounded by gaps in validated clinical breakpoints for clinical laboratories to interpret macrolide resistance in Shigella. We present the first high-resolution genomic analyses of 2,097 U.S. Shigella isolates, including those from MDR outbreaks. A sentinel shigellosis case in an MSM patient revealed a strain carrying 12 plasmids, of which two carried known resistance genes, the pKSR100-related plasmid pMHMC-004 and spA-related plasmid pMHMC-012. Genomic-epidemiologic analyses of isolates revealed high carriage rates of pMHMC-004 predominantly in U.S. isolates from men and not in other demographic groups. Isolates genetically related to the sentinel case further harbored elevated numbers of unique replicons, showing the receptivity of this Shigella lineage to plasmid acquisition. Findings from integrated genomic-epidemiologic analyses were leveraged to direct targeted clinical actions to improve rapid diagnosis and patient care and for public health efforts to further reduce spread.IMPORTANCE Multidrug-resistant Shigella isolates with resistance to macrolides are an emerging public health threat. We define a plasmid/pathogen complex behind infections seen in the United States and globally in vulnerable patient populations and identify multiple outbreaks in the United States and evidence of intercontinental transmission. Using new tools and sequence information, we experimentally identify the drivers of antibiotic resistance that complicate patient treatment to facilitate improvements to clinical microbiologic testing for their detection. We illustrate the use of these methods to support multiagency efforts to combat multidrug- resistant Shigella using publicly available tools, existing genomic data, and resources in clinical microbiology and public health laboratories to inform credible actions to reduce spread.

TI  - A Novel Single Fuzzifier Interval Type-2 Fuzzy C-Means Clustering With Local Information for Land-Cover Segmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of land cover segmentation from remote sensing image, there are some uncertainties such as "significant difference in class density", "different objects with same spectrum", and "same object with different spectra". Existing fuzzy c-means clustering is not sufficient to describe the high-order fuzzy uncertainties and cannot achieve accurate segmentation. Type-2 fuzzy set is perfect for handling with interclass multiple uncertainties, and clustering algorithm can suppress the noise of remote sensing image effectively by incorporating local information. Therefore, on the basis of integrating local information, this article proposes a robust single fuzzifier interval type-2 fuzzy local C-means clustering based on adaptive interval-valued data for land cover segmentation. First, interval-valued data modeling is performed for remote sensing data, and remote sensing features are represented as interval-valued vectors, and the robust interval-valued distance measure that can maximize the distance between interval-valued numbers is used to generate an interval type-2 fuzzy set through robust fuzzy clustering. Second, this article adopts an efficient type reduction method to seek equivalent type-1 fuzzy set adaptively, and realizes the segmentation of land cover by the principle of maximum type-1 fuzzy membership. The test results of multispectral remote sensing images show that the segmentation performance of this proposed algorithm outperforms existing state of the art adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithms, and it is beneficial to the interpretation of remote sensing image.

TI  - Hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration Monitoring With Spatiotemporal Continuity by the Fusion of Satellite and Station Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hourly monitoring of ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations forms the basis to assess the short-term PM2.5 exposure and make rapid responses to pollution events. Satellite remote sensing and ground monitoring stations are able to measure hourly PM2.5 concentrations, but both of them have strengths and weaknesses: the former features wide spatial coverage, whereas displaying a discontinuous timeline as the retrievals have numerous gaps; conversely, the latter allows for temporally continuous monitoring, but with a limited spatial range around stations being reflected. Thus, efforts are required to map ground-level PM2.5 at an hourly scale with spatiotemporal continuity. In this article, we developed a framework to generate hourly seamless PM2.5 estimates by integrating the aforementioned two data sources with complementary spatiotemporal traits. The satellite-derived aerosol optical depth acquisitions are converted along with auxiliary predictors to retrieve ground-level PM2.5, and then the missing gaps in the retrievals are filled by fusing the satellite-based retrievals and station-based measurements. Meanwhile, we proposed a promising approach to fill the gaps by combining an adapted spatiotemporal fusion model and an error correction method. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by mapping hourly PM2.5 distributions for 2016 in the Wuhan urban agglomeration, China. The proposed reconstruction method achieved R-2 (root-mean-square error) of 0.87 (6.50 mu g/m(3)) and 0.82 (15.01 mu g/m(3)) in the area-based and point-based evaluation, respectively, indicating an excellent model performance. The presented framework maps hourly ground-level PM2.5 with spatiotemporal continuity and satisfactory accuracy, and represents an important step towards near real-time monitoring.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The study aimed to analyse the clinical effect of homotype ET method and compatible ET method in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia caused by non-blood-group antibodies (non-blood-group antibodies refers to due to cause other than blood-group antibodies) as well as to provide relevant reference materials for clinical diagnosis and treatment in Fuzhou city.Patients and Methods: Between January 2011 and December 2020, a total of 125 neonates, who were admitted to the Sentinel hospital of Fuzhou city, Fujian Provincial Maternity and Children's Hospital for hyperbilirubinemia and treated with ET therapy were selected. They were divided into homotype ET (n=32) and compatibility ET (n=93) treatment groups. We analysed changes in serum total bilirubin (STB), serum indirect bilirubin (SIB), and platelet count before and after ET; retrospectively analysed the neonates' clinical data; and compared findings between the 2 groups.Results: The homotype ET group and the compatible ET group showed higher STB, SIB, and platelet levels before ET and decreased levels of the same after ET; the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Compared with the compatible ET group, the decreases in STB, SIB, and platelet count in the homotype ET group showed no significant difference (P>0.05).Conclusion: ET therapy is the most timely and effective treatment method for severe hyperbilirubinemia in neonates clinically, and the effects of homotype and compatible ET are similar.

TI  - Monitoring tree-crown scale autumn leaf phenology in a temperate forest with an integration of PlanetScope and drone remote sensing observations
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In temperate forests, autumn leaf phenology signals the end of leaf growing season and shows large variability across tree-crowns, which importantly mediates photosynthetic seasonality, hydrological regulation, and nutrient cycling of forest ecosystems. However, critical challenges remain with the monitoring of autumn leaf phenology at the tree-crown scale due to the lack of spatially explicit information for individual tree-crowns and high (spatial and temporal) resolution observations with nadir view. Recent availability of the PlanetScope constellation with a 3 m spatial resolution and near-daily nadir view coverage might help address these observational challenges, but remains underexplored. Here we developed an integration of PlanetScope with drone observations for improved monitoring of crown-scale autumn leaf phenology in a temperate forest in Northeast China. This integration includes: 1) visual identification of individual tree-crowns (and species) from drone observations; 2) extraction of time series of PlanetScope vegetation indices (VIs) for each identified tree-crown; 3) derivation of three metrics of autumn leaf phenology from the extracted VI time series, including the start of fall (SOF), middle of fall (MOF), and end of fall (EOF); and 4) accuracy assessments of the PlanetScope-derived phenology metrics with reference from local phenocams. Our results show that (1) the PlanetScopedrone integration captures large inter-crown phenological variations, with a range of 28 days, 25 days, and 30 days for SOF, MOF, and EOF, respectively, (2) the extracted crown-level phenology metrics strongly agree with those derived from local phenocams, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 4.1 days, 3.0 days and 5.4 days for SOF, MOF, and EOF, respectively, and (3) PlanetScope maps large variations in autumn leaf phenology over the entire forest landscape with spatially explicit information. These results demonstrate the ability of our proposed method in monitoring the large spatial heterogeneity of crown-scale autumn leaf phenology in the temperate forest, suggesting the potential of using high-resolution satellites to advance crown-scale phenology studies over large geographical areas.

TI  - Detecting the Deformation Anomalies Induced by Underground Construction Using Multiplatform MT-InSAR: A Case Study in To Kwa Wan Station, Hong Kong
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground constructions are implemented in cities to relieve the pressure of urbanization. Ground deformation often occurs with improper construction activities. Such deformation can be measured with techniques such as multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR). However, the deformation anomalies, such as the building horizontal tilt can cause the MT-InSAR line-of-sight deformation to tend to zero, the deformed area is likely to be ignored when the individual SAR dataset is applied. In this article, we explore deformation induced by the underground construction of To Kwa Wan (TKW) station in Hong Kong with an improved MT-InSAR method. Multiplatform SAR datasets from TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1A are adopted to retrieve comprehensive deformation of ground buildings for stability investigation. The results are validated through cross-validation between SAR datasets. Both spatial and temporal variations of ground deformation are revealed. Ground buildings suffered significant deformation in vertical and horizontal directions, the maximum deformation is around 30 and 40 mm, respectively. Due to the anomalous deformation, the ground buildings around the station are dumped towards the street center. In view of temporal evolution, the deformation is strongly related to the construction stages. The deformation turned to be stable after the completion of the main framework of the TKW station in December 2016. This article suggests that the deformation obtained from individual SAR datasets may sometimes is not noticeable or reliable in the area with complex underground construction. Such complex phenomena can be revealed by using the multiplatform SAR datasets with MT-InSAR.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Fractional Evergreen Forest Cover Estimation at Subpixel Scale in Cloudy and Rainy Areas by Harmonizing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Time-Series Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evergreen forest provides essential ecosystem services such as maintaining the balance in carbon and oxygen cycles and air purification. However, under cloudy and rainy weather conditions, it is difficult to obtain optical remote sensing images with high spatial resolution and complete time series. In addition, surfaces underlying the forest canopy can be complex and fragmented. To solve this problem, we developed a new approach (NDVICV-LS) for mapping urban evergreen forest at the subpixel scale. In order to capture more accurate growth characteristics of evergreen forest, we harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images with cloud cover less than 10% acquired within 1 year to denser the time-series dataset. In view of the time series fluctuation stability of evergreen forest, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to distinguish evergreen forest from other vegetation. Meanwhile, the annual minimum NDVI (NDVIann-min) was used as the parameter in a dimidiate pixel model for estimating fractional evergreen forest cover (FVCever). Hefei, a cloudy and rainy subtropical city in China, was selected as a case study to evaluate the validity of the model. The verification results revealed that harmonizing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 time-series images to extract evergreen forest improved the overall accuracy by 8% compared with using Landsat-8 images alone, indicating that the NDVICV-LS model can improve the accuracy of FCVever estimation, especially for areas with complex underlying surfaces under cloudy and rainy conditions.

TI  - Urban Black-Odor Water Remote Sensing Mapping Based on Shadow Removal: A Case Study in Nanjing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban black-odor water is a serious water environmental problem worldwide that seriously affects the living environment and the health of residents. The detection of black-odor water is a primary problem of centralized governance. Remote sensing is an effective means for water-quality monitoring. However, in most urban areas, with their complex underlying conditions, black-odor water always shows an uncertain distribution and small area. Furthermore, because of similar spectral characteristics, it is easily confused with dark objects such as asphalt roads, dark roofs, bridges, river levees, and building shadows. In this article, we propose a new black-odor water detection method, without shadow misjudgment, for complex urban conditions. A remote sensing image from the Chinese high-resolution satellite Gaofen-2 (GF-2) was used for detection. Using in situ water-quality measurement data for verification, the results showed that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 85.7% while reducing the false alarm rate to 3.5%. Compared to four other existing methods, the proposed method proved to be more practical because it can reduce the false extraction of nonblack-odor water to the greatest extent possible while ensuring accuracy The method proposed in this article has a good effect on the extraction of black-odor water in Nanjing City. Therefore, our method can be applied widely to screening and management of large-scale urban black-odor water and can provide reliable data for centralized treatment.

TI  - Geoparcel-Based Spatial Prediction Method for Grassland Fractional Vegetation Cover Mapping
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland resources guarantee the balance of ecosystems and the sustainable development of animal husbandry. Spatial information is essential for grass resource management in pastoral areas, which can be extracted quickly on a large-scale by using remote sensing data. However, most conventional methods are based on the grid pixels of remote sensing images. The spatial information based on these regular units inevitably has the phenomenon of mixed pixels, which leads to the unreliability of grassland resource information with irregular spatial heterogeneity. To resolve this problem, this article takes the spatial mapping of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) as a typical target task of information extraction of grassland resources and proposes a geoparcel-based spatial prediction method in which irregular geographic objects from high spatial resolution remote sensing images, i.e., grassland geoparcels, are used as basic mapping units instead of traditional regular units. This change can make the spatial expression of mapping closer to the reality of grassland due to the fine spatial structure. Moreover, multisource spatial data can be integrated together in the regression-based procedure of prediction through the geoparcel as a unified spatial benchmark. A case experiment of Abag Banner, Inner Mongolia, China, shows that the proposed method can achieve good FVC mapping results. The spatial prediction of FVC based on grassland geoparcels is verified to be effective when a random forest regression is used in the modeling. In comparison with traditional regular grid-based methods, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy with 11.89% in relative root mean squared error (%RMSE), and 0.86 in determination coefficient of regression (R-2). It has advantages in sensing the tiny spatial heterogeneity of FVC at the boundary of grassland change. The formalized procedure potentially promotes the development of spatial mapping technology for grassland resources.

AB  - The black-odor water has significant negative impacts on the sustainable development of society and survival of mankind. Taking the main rivers in the urban built-up area of Fuzhou city as the research object, we obtained 15 normal water samples and 45 black-odor water samples on the remote sensing image of Gaofen-2(GF-2) on December 7, 2016 according to the list of black-odor water bodies announced by the municipal government. The paper puts forward a new Black and Odorous Water Index (BOWI) model that based on the ratio of band 2 and 3 to band 3 and 4 to identify the urban blackodor water body based on the reflectance spectrum on image. And the model is validated by the observation and the producer's accuracy can be up to 71.43%. Result shows that black-odor water sections are widely distributed but discontinuous, and they are concentrated in the densely populated areas of urban areas. Domestic sewage, industrial waste water and broken waterfront are the main reasons.

TI  - A Network Optimized Ridge Estimator for Robust PSI Parameter Estimation and Its Application on Deformation Monitoring of Urban Area
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer (PS) interferometry (PSI) has the ability to achieve submeter-scale digital elevation model and millimeter-scale deformation. However, it is difficult to maintain good performance under long baseline and large phase gradient. In this article, we develop a network optimized ridge estimator for two-tier network PSI. Such a method can increase parameter estimation robustness and spatial continuity in single-prime mode and urban build environments. First, we construct an optimized first-tier network by outlier detection and subsets network construction. On this basis, we utilize the ridge estimator as a substitute for the weighted least squares (WLS) estimator to improve the estimation accuracy in network adjustment. In the second-tier network, we detect the remaining PSs by constructing local star networks, thus increasing the density of the measurements in the first-tier network. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by using the 2016-2018 TerraSAR-X dataset acquired in Shenzhen Metropolis, China. In addition, the stress deformation of two typical buildings, i.e., Shenzhen CITIC Building and Shenzhen Convention and Exhibition Center, are monitored and analyzed.

TI  - Rapid computation of set boundaries of multi-scale grids and its application in coverage analysis of remote sensing images
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, the amount of remote sensing data is increasing, service objects are increasingly extensive, and requests from users to query the coverage of remote sensing images under specific conditions have also increased. These conditions have increased efficiency and precision requirements for concurrent access and response. Remote sensing images provide multiple coverages of the same area, and the nested and overlapping relationships among data are complex. Therefore, calculating the range of multiple overlaps of images becomes increasingly difficult as the number of images increases. To query the range of a coverage area of multiple images is to calculate its boundary, which is an important part of spatial overlay analysis. Traditional vector methods are inefficient in processing many spatial objects or complex shapes. The overlay of traditional spatial grids is mostly addressed via single-scale methods, which have low computational efficiency and low boundary fitting precision. Combined with the current gridding management method for multi-source remote sensing images, we proposed a new algorithm for rapid computation of the set boundaries of multi-scale grids and applied it to coverage analysis of remote sensing images. The algorithm can effectively trace the boundaries of multi-scale grids formed in the regions covered by remote sensing images, and it can solve all types of complex boundaries, such as convex and concave boundaries, holes and islands. The experiments in this study show that the new algorithm greatly improves computational efficiency and boundary fitting precision compared with the single-scale grid methods. Compared with the vector algorithms of ArcGIS and other commercial software, this study's algorithm can greatly improve calculation efficiency while ensuring a precision above 99%. The new algorithm is suitable for rapid calculations of large areas and widespread coverage of remote sensing images.

TI  - Geomorphological responses of the lower river channel and delta to interruption of reservoir regulation in the Yellow River, 2015-2017
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the major link between land and ocean, rivers play a significant role in global biogeochemical cycles. Owing to the proliferation of dams over the past decades, however, most of the river systems throughout the world have been largely fragmented and regulated by dams. Significant dam interception has largely decreased the sediment supply from drainage basins to coastal settings, inducing unintended consequences of geomorphological evolution (e.g., coastal erosion). China's Yellow River has been dammed since the 1950s, with the result that the Yellow River-derived sediment has become an order of magnitude smaller. The Yellow River Conservancy Committee (YRCC) started to initiate the Water and Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS) through a coordinated regulation of three large reservoirs along the mainstream (Wanjiazhai, Sanmenxia, and Xiaolangdi reservoirs) in July 2002. Since then, the WSRS has been generally operated every summer to mitigate the siltation of the lower reach by scouring the lower riverbed, and to prolong the operational life expectancy of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir by expelling the sediment that previously accumulated within the reservoir. Such an unprecedented engineering effort has brought the Yellow River under human control. The monsoon-fed flood peaks are largely controlled, replaced by man-made floods. Consequently, the geomorphological features of the lower river channel and delta of the Yellow River have been substantially altered from their natural states. Furthermore, the functional degradation of the WSRS in recent years has received increasingly more attention. From 2015 to 2017, the WSRS was interrupted due to a decrease in precipitation in the drainage basin. Herein, the impact of the interruption of the WSRS from 2015 to 2017 on the Yellow River's water and sediment transport is examined, and the geomorphological responses of the lower reaches and delta of the river are discussed. The main datasets used in this study include the sediment load measured by the YRCC at Xiaolangdi and Lijin stations from 1999 to 2017, erosional volume of the river channel downstream from the Xiaolangdi from 2002 to 2017, Landsat-image-derived area data of the active Yellow River mouth from 2002 to 2017, and bathymetric data off the active Yellow River mouth in 2002, 2015 and 2017. The results show that there was no sediment export from the Xiaolangdi Reservoir from 2015 to 2017, resulting in the lower Yellow River, for the first time ever, not receiving sediment from the Loess Plateau for an entire year. All sediment delivery to the sea during this period was eroded from the lower reaches by dam-released clear water. Owing to the lack of sediment supply from the Loess Plateau, the sediment delivered from the Yellow River to the sea fell to 7.7 million tons in 2017, which is the lowest since record-keeping began in 1950. The lower Yellow River channel became widened and deepened due to continuous scouring, with erosion mainly occurring in the reaches from Xiaolangdi to Gaocun. Because of the lack of WSRS-released flood water, the erosive effectiveness gradually decreased. Since 2015, the subaerial Yellow River delta has transitioned to an erosive phase due to the lack of sediment supply. Additionally, the subaqueous delta off the active river mouth suffered net erosion, with a maximum erosive rate of 1.8 m/a. As a consequence, the surface sediment off the active Yellow River coarsened, with the median grain size reaching as high as 105.4 mu m.The results of this work show that, under the current circumstances, the geomorphic stability of the deltaic area seems to be extremely in danger without the operation of the WSRS. Optimizing the reservoir regulation scheme is urgently necessary to maintain the sustainable development of the Yellow River delta, especially in the era when functional degradation of the WSRS is considerable.

TI  - Impact of Urban Agglomeration and Physical and Socioeconomic Factors on Surface Urban Heat Islands in the Pearl River Delta Region, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An understanding of the driving factors of urban heat islands could improve the urban thermal environment and provide planning strategies for sustainable urban/regional development. We selected Guangdong province in China as a case area, which covers 21 cities and more than 110 million people. We used multitemporal remote sensing data from multiple sources and socioeconomic statistical data to analyze the effects of various drivers of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs). The tested drivers include urban agglomeration, physical indicators (e.g., vegetation and built-up indices), and socioeconomic indicators (e.g., population, gross domestic production, and nightlight intensity). The results show that physical indicators are determinants of daytime SUHIs whereas socioeconomic indicators are determinants of nighttime SUHIs, which indicates that daytime and nighttime SUHIs have different causal mechanisms in this region. Moreover, the results reveal that the influence of urban agglomeration on urban surface temperature is more significant at nighttime than in daytime, which implies that the warming effect of urban agglomeration is stronger at night. Together, the results indicate that joint control of urban size, urbanization level, and socioeconomic activities is crucial to alleviate SUHIs and safeguard sustainable development in this region.

AB  - Bathymetrical information plays an important role in the management of coastal resources such as fisheries and shipping lanes, and is basic information of coastal resources besides benthic habitat. The extraction of satellite data for bathymetry mapping or SDB (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry) has emerged as an effective method to obtain information in terms of cost and time. Kemujan Island is an island with unique geomorphology and thus selected as a study area for bathymetry mapping. The method applied single band and band ratio methods on PlanetScope imagery. PlanetScope was chosen because it has high spatial and temporal resolution. The image used was acquired on June 30, 2017. The results show that linear regression is more representative than SVR-based modeling, with the best single band modeling from the (ln) Green band and the best band ratio modeling from the ratio transformation of Blue (ln)/(ln) Green. Single band had higher correlation and accuracy than band ratio (0.89 and 0.66, respectively) and RMSE value of 0.78 and 0.96, respectively. However, based on bathymetry profiling, the results of band ratio modeling are more appropriate as the single band method cannot afford to minimize the effect of various bottom types.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution Characteristics of Ecosystem Service Values Based on NDVI Changes in Island Cities
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays a dominant role in and serves as the structural foundation of island-land ecosystems. Island cities, as sea-land ecological complexes, are able to somewhat reflect the general realities of island ecological environments. By using the Landsat series remote-sensing images and an ecosystem service value (ESV) evaluation system, in this paper, the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of the NDVIs and ESVs of China's 12 island counties over the past three decades are analyzed. According to the research results, (1) The average NDVI of China's island counties dropped from 0.380 to 0.347 in 1990-2018, reflecting a continuous downtrend. The NDVIs of Changhai County and Changdao County show significant changes, with decreases of 45.24% and 37.57%, respectively. (2) The total ESV of China's island counties showed a "V"-shaped change trend from 1990-2018; the minimum value reached USD 362 million in 2010, then essentially recovered to the 2000 level in 2018. (3) The high and low values of NDVI and ESV in island counties over the years were distributed with the spatial characteristics of high values in the center of the islands and low values at the edges of the islands. The island counties north of the Yangtze River showed the largest changes in NDVI and ESV. (4) Forest cover is the main factor that drives ESV reduction in China's island counties, followed by grassland cover. This study provides an effective method to study the changes in the NDVI and ESV of island cities and proposes the strengthening of island vegetation protection and the promotion of sustainable development in the ecological environments and economies of island cities.

TI  - Scalable Wide Neural Network: A Parallel, Incremental Learning Model Using Splitting Iterative Least Squares
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of research on machine learning models, especially deep learning, more and more endeavors have been made on designing new learning models with properties such as fast training with good convergence, and incremental learning to overcome catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a scalable wide neural network (SWNN), composed of multiple multi-channel wide RBF neural networks (MWRBF). The MWRBF neural network focuses on different regions of data and nonlinear transformations can be performed with Gaussian kernels. The number of MWRBFs for proposed SWNN is decided by the scale and difficulty of learning tasks. The splitting and iterative least squares (SILS) training method is proposed to make the training process easy with large and high dimensional data. Because the least squares method can find pretty good weights during the first iteration, only a few succeeding iterations are needed to fine tune the SWNN. Experiments were performed on different datasets including gray and colored MNIST data, hyperspectral remote sensing data (KSC, Pavia Center, Pavia University, and Salinas), and compared with main stream learning models. The results show that the proposed SWNN is highly competitive with the other models.

TI  - Exploitation of Time Series Sentinel-2 Data and Different Machine Learning Algorithms for Detailed Tree Species Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of tree species through remote sensing data is of great significance to monitoring forest disturbances, biodiversity assessment, and carbon estimation. The dense time series and a wide swath of Sentinel-2 data provided the opportunity to map tree species accurately and in a timely manner over a large area. Many current studies have applied machine learning (ML) algorithms combined with Sentinel-2 images to classify tree species, but it is still unclear, which algorithm is more effective in the automotive extraction of tree species. In this study, five ML algorithms were compared to identify the composition of tree species with multitemporal Sentinel-2 images in the JianShe forest farm, Northeast China. Three major types of deep neural networks [Conv1D, AlexNet, and long short-term memory (LSTM)] were tested to classify Sentinel-2 time series, which represent three disparate but effective strategies to apply sequential data. The other two models are support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which are renowned for extensive adoption and high performance for various remote sensing applications. The results show that the overall accuracy of neural network models is better than that of SVM and RF. The Conv1D model had the highest classification accuracy (84.19%), followed by the LSTM model (81.52%), and the AlexNet model (76.02%). For non-neural network models, RF's classification accuracy (79.04%) is higher than that of SVM (72.79%), but lower than that of Conv1D and LSTM. Therefore, the deep neural networks combined with multitemporal Sentinel-2 images can efficiently improve the accuracy of tree species classification.

TI  - Modeling Daily Temperatures Via a Phenology-Based Annual Temperature Cycle Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal resolution land surface temperature (LST) plays an important role in various environment applications. However, the limitation of thermal infrared sensors and the effect of clouds and other atmospheric conditions result in discontinuous daily thermal observations of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Annual temperature cycle (ATC) models can help to supply daily continuous LSTs via limited observations, but these ATC models seldom consider the disturbance of weather conditions or the land cover change. On the other hand, spatial interpolation techniques also limit in implementation when available data in one day or several days are not able to obtain enough spatiotemporal information for LST reconstruction. The objective of this study is to propose a phenology-based ATC model (termed PATC), which takes the phenology change and local weather change into account, to reconstruct daily unscanned LSTs at an annual scale. Daily MODIS LSTs collected in 2015 were utilized to analyze the performance of PATC compared with other ATC models. Results show that PATC improved the accuracy by 1.6 and 0.5 K compared to the classic ATC model in the daytime and nighttime, respectively. Compared to the enhanced ATC model, PATC also shows better performance with higher accuracies, especially during the growing season of vegetation in the daytime. Future research may focus on an incorporation with Landsat observations and diurnal temperature cycle models to implement LST reconstruction at a diurnal scale.

TI  - A Benchmark High-Resolution GaoFen-3 SAR Dataset for Building Semantic Segmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning is increasingly popular in remote sensing communities and already successful in land cover classification and semantic segmentation. However, most studies are limited to the utilization of optical datasets. Despite few attempts applied to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) using deep learning, the huge potential, especially for the very high resolution (VHR) SAR, are still underexploited. Taking building segmentation as an example, the VHR SAR datasets are still missing to the best of our knowledge. A comparable baseline for SAR building segmentation does not exist, and which segmentation method is more suitable for SAR image is poorly understood. This article first provides a benchmark high-resolution (1 m) GaoFen-3 SAR datasets, which cover nine cities from seven countries, review the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods applied to SAR, and then summarize the potential operations to improve the performance. With these comprehensive assessments, we hope to provide the recommendation and roadmap for future SAR semantic segmentation.

TI  - Modeling Saline Mudflat and Aquifer Deformation Synthesizing Environmental and Hydrogeological Factors Using Time-Series InSAR
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clarifying the surface and subsurface deformation is important for protecting the infrastructures attached to the ground and reasonably exploiting the underground resources. This article presents an improved deformation model combining environmental factors (i.e., precipitation and temperature) with hydrogeological parameters to separate the saline-soil deformation from the aquifer deformation over Qarhan Salt Lake, China. First, the vertical ground deformation was derived by 119 ascending and 113 descending synthetic aperture radar images of Sentinel-1A collected from July 2015 to May 2020. Subsequently, we estimated the deformation components derived from temperature, precipitation, seasonal oscillation, magnitude, and decay coefficient of the hydrodynamic function by the proposed deformation model. The estimated deformation and decay coefficient maps pinpoint the existing and previously unknown faults. Next, we compared our proposed prototype with the sinusoidal and exponentially decaying model to present the reliability and efficiency in separating the deformation components and estimating the decay coefficient. Finally, we collected the stratigraphic data from 50 drilling wells to validate our model results by simulating the cumulative silt and clay layers (aquitard) thickness utilizing the Ordinary Kriging interpolation method. Findings show that by quantifying the aquitard thickness in the drilling wells, there is a strong relationship in the spatial distribution between cumulative thickness and the decay coefficient. The results suggested that both the decay coefficient and the aquitard-layer thickness can be used as the vital parameters to partition hydrogeological units, which provides an opportunity to detect and mitigate the potential geological hazards in the saline mudflat.

TI  - Socioeconomic development evaluation for Chinese poverty-stricken counties using indices derived from remotely sensed data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensively and objectively evaluating the development of poverty-stricken counties is important for poverty alleviation. In this study, we propose a relatively objective and efficient method that utilizes indicators derived from remote sensing images to assess the socioeconomic development of poverty-stricken counties. Four indicators representing the area of developed land, area of forest vegetation cover, area of cultivated land, and average nighttime light intensity were integrated via the entropy method and used to construct a model for evaluation of the socioeconomic development of poverty-stricken counties (ESDPC). Then, 42 impoverished counties in Henan Province and Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province in China were selected, and their ESDPC values for 2013, 2015, and 2017 were estimated. The average ESDPC value of the selected poverty-stricken counties increased from 0.29 to 0.34 between 2013 and 2017. The accuracy of this estimate was verified through an assessment based on the comprehensive development index (CDI) model constructed using 10 socioeconomic indices. The correlation coefficient between the ESDPC values and the CDI values was 0.60, and the fitting relationships between the two models and the remotely sensed indicators showed good consistency, indicating the potential for use of these remotely sensed indicators to assess regional socioeconomic development.

TI  - Progressive Data Augmentation Method for Remote Sensing Ship Image Classification Based on Imaging Simulation System and Neural Style Transfer
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning has shown great power in processing remote sensing data, especially for fine-grained remote sensing ship image classification. However, the lack of a large amount of effective training data greatly limits the performance of neural networks. Based on current data augmentation methods, images of ships on the sea generated for remote sensing have the problem of distortion, blurring, and poor diversity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel progressive remote sensing ship image data augmentation method that combines ship simulation samples and a neural style transfer (NST) based network to generate a large amount of transferred remote sensing ship images. Our method consists of two stages. The first stage uses a visible light imaging simulation system to generate ship simulation samples through three-dimensional models of real images. This stage can significantly increase the diversity of the training dataset. For the second stage, to eliminate the domain gap between real ship images and ship simulation samples, a few real images and a newly designed NST-based network called Sim2RealNet are employed to realize style transfer from simulation samples to real images. The proposed method was applied to a variety of ship targets to verify its effectiveness compared to other data augmentation methods on remote sensing image classification tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Evaluation of gap-filling approaches in satellite-based daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately half of satellite aerosol retrievals are missing that limits the application of satellite data in PM2.5 pollution monitoring. To obtain spatiotemporally continuous PM2.5 distributions, various gap-filling methods have been developed, but have rarely been evaluated. Here, we reviewed and summarized four types of gap-filling strategies, and applied them to a random forest PM2.5 prediction model that incorporated ground observations, chemical transport model (CTM) simulations, and satellite AOD for predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations at a 1-km resolution in 2013 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze River Delta. The model out-of-bag predictions were compared with national station measurements and external measurements to assess the performance of different gap-filling methods. We also conducted a by-city cross-validation and characterized the spatial distributions of PM2.5 prediction when the AOD coverage was low. We found that the methods filling in missing data by regression, i.e. multiple imputation and decision tree, performed robustly to characterizing PM2.5 variation at a high spatial resolution and the method filling in missing PM2.5 predictions with decision tree overcame the problem of time-consuming computations. The method using spatiotemporal trends to fill in missing data, i.e. ordinary kriging and generalized additive mixed model, may be overrated in statistical evaluation tests, and predicted artificially oversmoothed PM2.5 spatial distributions. We also revealed that CTM simulations benefited the prediction of PM2.5 spatial distribution in all the models with various gap-filling strategies with higher prediction accuracy in the by-city cross-validation. We noticed that the PM2.5 prediction was not sensitive to the resolution of CTM simulations and even the 12-km resolution CTM simulations benefited the high-resolution PM2.5 prediction.

TI  - Retrieving Soil Moisture Over Soybean Fields During Growing Season Through Polarimetric Decomposition
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (Mv) estimation and monitoring over agricultural areas using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are often affected by vegetation cover during the growing season. Volume scattering and vegetation attenuation can complicate the received SAR backscatter signal when microwave interacts with the vegetation canopy. To address the existing problems, this article employed the model-based polarimetric decomposition method considering the two-way attenuation to remove the volume scattering and vegetation attenuation. A deorientation process of SAR data was applied to remove the influence of randomly distributed target orientation angles before the polarimetric decomposition. To parameterize the two-way attenuation, Radar Vegetation Index derived from the SAR intensity images was adopted. The Dubois model was used to describe backscattering from the underlying bare soil. Since the soil roughness parameters are difficult to measure under vegetation cover, the optimum surface roughness method was used to parameterize the Dubois model. This soil moisture retrieval algorithm was applied to the polarimetric multitemporal RADARSAT-2 SAR data over soybean fields. The validation indicates the root-mean-square error of 9.2 vol.% and 8.2 vol.% at HH and VV polarization, respectively, over the entire soybean growing period, suggesting that the proposed method is capable of reducing the effect of vegetation cover for soil moisture monitoring over the soybean field.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Satellite optical images are useful for creating updated land cover maps but suffer the cloud contamination problem with region below the clouds are not mapped. On the other hand, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries are all-weather sensor able to see through cloud but with different sensing properties and normally poorer resolution. In this work, a SAR data-based deep learning recovery approach is proposed and explored to remove cloud and reconstruct realistic ground mapping. The model utilized an autoencoder structure which intakes the SAR image and other optical features to provide a cloud free edge map, later use the edge map, together with the SAR image, as a guide to an inpainting model, which provides a reasonable cloud-free image for both human perception and industrial application. Numerical examples show that the proposed method works well with Sentinel dataset. With the resolution of SAR data improving rapidly through recent years, using SAR imageries to enhance data from other sources could be a more promising topic for research as well as practical applications.

TI  - Temporal Series Crop Classification Study in Rural China Based on Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification is one of the focused topics in remote sensing study nowadays. Optical imageries, although providing much information, are often contaminated with cloud or other weather effects while SAR imageries are more resilient to those. Temporal series data are often used to improve classification accuracy, especially in crop classification. This article investigates the usage of temporal series SAR imagery on crop classification in vast rural areas of China. The selected area of interest has a complicated, heavily mixed agriculture as well as lots of nonagricultural landcovers. Total ten classes are considered, six of them being crop types. A pixel-based classifier using subspace kth nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is applied to open source Sentinel-1 polarized SAR data. Discussion includes analyzing temporal features of the SAR observation, time domain smoothing, feature engineering, different classification algorithms, and selection of temporal series. The study results in an overall accuracy of 98.2% for the ten classes in fivefold cross validation, indicating a propitious application for agricultural monitoring using SAR data.

TI  - Land use and land cover change within the Koshi River Basin of the central Himalayas since 1990
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land change is a cause and consequence of global environmental change. Land use and land cover have changed considerably due to increasing human activities and climate change, which has become the core issue of major international research projects. This study interprets land use and land cover status and the changes within the Koshi River Basin (KRB) using Landsat remote sensing (RS) image data, and employs logistic regression model to analyze the influence of natural and socioeconomic driving forces on major land cover changes. The results showed that the areas of built-up land, bare land and forest in KRB increased from 1990 to 2015, including the largest increases in forest and the highest growth rate in construction land. Areas of glacier, grassland, sparse vegetation, shrub land, cropland, and wetland all decreased over the study period. From the perspective of driving analysis, the role of human activities in land use and land cover change is significant than climate factors. Cropland expansion is the reclamation of cropland by farmers, mainly from early deforestation. However, labor force separation, geological disasters and drought are the main factors of cropland shrinkage. The increase of forest area in India and Nepal was attributed to the government's forest protection policies, such as Nepal's community forestry has achieved remarkable results. The expansion and contraction of grassland were both dominated by climatic factors. The probability of grassland expansion increases with temperature and precipitation, while the probability of grassland contraction decreases with temperature and precipitation.

TI  - A Prediction Model of Water In Situ Data Change Under the Influence of Environmental Variables in Remote Sensing Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation is an essential process to evaluate the quality of waterbody remote sensing products, and the reliability and effective application of the in situ data of waterbody parameters are an important part of validation. Based on the in situ data of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended solids (TSS) and other environmental variables (EVs) measured at the fixed station in Taihu Lake, we attempt to develop a prediction model to determine whether the in situ measurement has enough representativeness for validating waterbody remote sensing products. Key EVs that affect the changes of Chl-a and TSS are firstly identified by using correlation analysis, which participate in modeling as variables. In addition, three multi-parameter modeling approaches are selected to simulate the daily changes of Chl-a and TSS under different EVs configurations. The results indicate that the highest prediction accuracy can be achieved through the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) based model. In the all-valid dataset, the testing absolute average relative errors (AEs) of GRNN-based Chl-a and TSS prediction model are 11.4% and 11.3%, respectively, and in the sunny-day dataset, the testing AEs are 8.6% and 8.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, the application example proves that the prediction model in this paper can be effectively used to screen the in situ data and determine the time window for satellite-ground data matching.

TI  - Integrated Remote Sensing and Crop Model Approach for Impact Assessment of Aerosols on Biomass Accumulation of Maize
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing data and crop model were used to explore the dynamic changes and accumulation of maize biomass in China caused by aerosols in this study. Maize varieties were divided into spring maize and summer maize. Two spring maize and three summer maize stations were selected. The results indicated that the solar radiation through all stages of maize development was reduced by aerosols, with daily average reductions of 3.23 MJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) for spring maize and 8.96 MJ center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) for summer maize from 2001 to 2014. Aerosols reduced the daily actual maize biomass in the study area, with an average daily decrease of 3.78 g center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) from 2001 to 2014. Moreover, the changes in daily actual biomass caused by aerosols varied in different growth stages. The reduction in daily actual biomass caused by aerosols in the stage of emergence-flowering was larger than that in the stage of flowering-maturity. For spring maize, the changes in daily actual biomass caused by aerosols were -2.12 to -2.29 g center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) from emergence to flowering and -0.72 to 0.08 g center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) from flowering to maturity. For summer maize, the changes in daily actual biomass caused by aerosols were -8.94 to -3.45 g center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) from emergence to flowering and -6.50 to -2.24 g center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1) from flowering to maturity. In addition, the annual maize biomass from 2001 to 2014 at five stations clearly decreased owing to aerosols. Moreover, the decrease in the annual biomass of summer maize was greater than that of spring maize, with an average decrease of 27.77% in summer maize biomass and 10.94% in spring maize biomass.

TI  - Effects of Regulation on Carbapenem Prescription in a Large Teaching Hospital in China: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis, 2016-2018
T2  - INFECTION AND DRUG RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Carbapenem resistance due to the overuse of carbapenems has become a public health problem worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there are few policies guiding carbapenem prescription, and their effectiveness is still unclear. A regulation targeting carbapenem prescription was implemented in March 2017 in China. This study aimed to assess the effects of the regulation for providing evidence on the prudent use of carbapenems.Patients and Methods: This was an interventional, retrospective study started in January 2017. The intervention covered establishing performance appraisal indicators, special authorisation, strict prescribing restrictions, and dedicated supervision, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU). Data on adult inpatients who received at least one carbapenems were extracted from January 2016 to December 2018. Segmented regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of the regulation.Results: A total of 2005 inpatients received carbapenems. Segmented regression models showed an immediate decline in the intensity of antibiotic consumption (IAC) of carbapenems (coefficient = -9.65, p < 0.001), particularly imipenem (coefficient = -6.82, p = 0.002), and the antibiotic consumption of carbapenems (coefficient = -133.60, p = 0.003) in the ICU. And there is a decreasing trend in the IAC of meropenem (coefficient = -0.03, p = 0.008) in all departments. Furthermore, the IAC of carbapenems and imipenem (coefficient = -0.36, p = 0.035; coefficient = -0.49, p = 0.025, respectively), and the average length of stay (ALoS) (coefficient = -0.73, p < 0.001) showed downward trends in the ICU.Conclusion: The intervention effectively reduced the IAC of carbapenems and imipenem, carbapenem consumption and the ALoS in the ICU, and the IAC of meropenem in all departments. The effects of the intervention were significant in the ICU, which indicated an urgent need for stronger regulations focusing on critical departments in the future.

TI  - Detecting the Cool Island Effect of Urban Parks in Wuhan: A City on Rivers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a nature-based solution, development of urban blue-green spaces is widely accepted for mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. It is of great significance to determine the main driving factors of the park cool island (PCI) effect for optimizing park layout and achieving a maximum cooling benefit of urban parks. However, there have been obviously controversial conclusions in previous studies due to varied case contexts. This study was conducted in Wuhan, a city with high water coverage, which has significant differences in context with the previous case cities. The PCI intensity and its correlation with park characteristics were investigated based on remote sensing data. The results indicated that 36 out of 40 urban parks expressed a PCI effect, with a PCI intensity of 0.08 similar to 7.29 degrees C. As expected, larger parks with enough width had stronger PCI intensity. An increased density of hardened elements in a park could significantly weaken PCI effect. Noticeably, in this study, water bodies in a park contributed the most to the PCI effect of urban parks, while the vegetated areas showed a negative impact on the PCI intensity. It implied that in a context with higher water coverage, the cooling effect of vegetation was weakened or even masked by water bodies, due to the interaction effect of different variables on PCI intensity.

TI  - In-Orbit Calibration of FengYun-3C Microwave Radiation Imager: Characterization of Backlobe Intrusion for the Hot-Load Reflector
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a correction algorithm to remove the backlobe intrusion from the hot-load reflector of microwave radiation imager (MWRI) on-board China FengYun-3C (FY-3C) meteorological satellite. Discontinuities in the radiometric gain of MWRI, due to inaccurate backlobe spillover of the hot-load reflector, have been diagnosed. A physical correction method, relating the radiometric gain difference between two distinct backlobe scenes to the spillover of the hot-load reflector, is thus established to estimate the in-orbit spillover factor of the MWRI hot-load reflector. Meanwhile, it is found that brightness temperature (TB) at each 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid could not address the backlobe pattern appropriately, leading to abrupt changes in the radiometric gain occurring near the coastlines. To better represent the backlobe spillover, the effective backlobe TB is now averaged over a 4 degrees x 4 degrees area from advanced microwave scanning radiometer-observed TBs, which is now in a finer resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. With the adjusted spillover for the hot-load reflector, anomalous behaviors of the radiometric gain are mitigated effectively and the improvement at the coastlines is pronounced, inducing TB variation up to 2 K in magnitude at the 10.65 GHz channel. Although the algorithm presented in this study is only restricted to channel frequencies up to 23.8 GHz due to its accuracy limitation, it could tackle similar issues for those microwave radiometers not capable of in-orbit backlobe maneuvers and receiving the radiances inevitably from the outer edge of the hot-load or cold-sky reflectors.

TI  - Comparison of Simple Averaging and Latent Class Modeling to Estimate the Area of Land Cover in the Presence of Reference Data Variability
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of the area or percent area of the land cover classes within a study region are often based on the reference land cover class labels assigned by analysts interpreting satellite imagery and other ancillary spatial data. Different analysts interpreting the same spatial unit will not always agree on the land cover class label that should be assigned. Two approaches for accommodating interpreter variability when estimating the area are simple averaging (SA) and latent class modeling (LCM). This study compares agreement between area estimates obtained from SA and LCM using reference data obtained by seven trained, professional interpreters who independently interpreted an annual time series of land cover reference class labels for 300 sampled Landsat pixels. We also compare the variability of the LCM and SA area estimates over different numbers of interpreters and different subsets of interpreters within each interpreter group size, and examine area estimates of three land cover classes (forest, developed, and wetland) and three change types (forest gain, forest loss, and developed gain). Differences between the area estimates obtained from SA and LCM are most pronounced for the estimates of wetland and the three change types. The percent area estimates of these rare classes were usually greater for LCM compared to SA, with the differences between LCM and SA increasing as the number of interpreters providing the reference data increased. The LCM area estimates generally had larger standard deviations and greater ranges over different subsets of interpreters, indicating greater sensitivity to the selection of the individual interpreters who carried out the reference class labeling.

TI  - A Land Cover Change Detection Method Combing Spectral Values and Class Probabilities
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change detection plays an important role in natural disaster monitoring, tracking urban expansion, and many social benefit areas. The spectral-based direct comparison (SDC) methods are commonly used for change detection, but such methods are vulnerable to the influence of external factors. In general, land changes among different land cover types have different characters of change magnitude. The class probability-based direct comparison (CPDC) methods consider land type information and reduce the influence of external factors, but these methods are strongly dependent on the training samples. To address the above problems, we proposed a novel change detection method that integrates spectral values and class probabilities (SVCP). First, a new change magnitude map based on spectral values and class probabilities is constructed by using the maximum interclass variance and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which greatly enhances the differentiation between changed and unchanged areas. Second, the Kapur threshold selection method is improved by using the variance of the changed and unchanged areas as well as the class probabilities for adaptive thresholding. The SVCP approach was assessed by two case studies from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The "change/no-change" detection and "from-to" change types were evaluated. The experimental results indicated that the SVCP method is more accurate in the change detection, with lower false and missed detection rates than the traditional methods.

TI  - An Adaptive Change Threshold Selection Method Based on Land Cover Posterior Probability and Spatial Neighborhood Information
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change threshold selection (CTS) plays an important role in land cover change detection. The traditional CTS methods are mainly based on the information contained in grayscale histogram distributions or pixel neighborhoods. However, land cover is highly spatially heterogeneous, and changes in different land cover types are characterized by different magnitudes. Unfortunately, few CTS studies have considered the effects of both land cover type and spatial heterogeneity on CTS, potentially leading to false alarms or missed alarms. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive CTS method based on land cover posterior probability and spatial neighborhood information (LCSN). First, the posterior probability of the change magnitude in each land cover type is calculated according to a Bayesian criterion to integrate the land cover type information. Second, the posterior probability is calculated using a bilateral filtering method to construct the spatial surface based on the land cover type and spatial neighborhood information. Finally, the degree of difference between the spatial surface and the change magnitude map is taken as the final threshold. The proposed LCSN method is verified with Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager images and IKONOS images. The experimental results show that the LCSN method is effective in reducing the pseudo changes and identifying changes in land cover types with low grayscale values in the corresponding change magnitude maps.

TI  - Robust SAR Image Registration Using Rank-Based Ratio Self-similarity
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in different polarizations or from different sensors are becoming easily available, but registering these images is challenging because of the presence of significant speckles in SAR images and the existence of radiometric differences between images. To address the problems, we propose a novel feature descriptor named rank-based ratio self-similarity (RRSS) for robust SAR image registration. The descriptor first calculates a ratio surface by replacing the distance surface, as the use of the ratio is more robust to multiplicative noise, and then sorts the ratio values to construct the rank surface. Subsequently, the rank surface is partitioned into an index map, and the index map is then transformed into the descriptor vector based on a restricted adaptive binning grid to discriminatively describe features. Furthermore, a rotation invariance enhancement method is designed for the RRSS descriptor to efficiently calculate descriptor vectors in multiple orientations. We conduct experiments with six SAR image pairs of various bands, polarizations, and resolutions from different sensors, including ALOS-PALSAR, Gaofen-3, Sentinel-1, and TerraSAR-X. The results demonstrate that the proposed descriptor is superior to state-of-the-art descriptors and robust for SAR image registration.

TI  - Pan-Sharpening Based on Panchromatic Colorization Using WorldView-2
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to overcome the lack of the multispectral image (MS) and adequately preserve the spatial information of panchromatic (PAN) image and the spectral information of MS image, this study proposes a method which adds the spectral information of the prior MS to the prior PAN during training, and only the posterior PAN is needed for predicting. Firstly, we introduce the autoencoder model based on image colorization and discuss its feasibility in the field of multi-band remote sensing image pan-sharpening. Then, the image quality evaluation functions including spatial and spectral indexes are formed as the loss function to control the image colorization model. Because the loss function contains spatial and spectral evaluation indexes, it could directly calculate the loss between the network output and the label considering characteristics of remote sensing images. Besides, the training data in our model is original PAN, this means that it is not necessary to make the simulated degraded MS and PAN data for training which is a big difference from most existing deep learning pan-sharpening methods. The new loss function including the spectral and spatial quality instead of the general MSE (mean square error), only the original PAN instead of the simulated degraded MS + PAN to be inputted, only the spectral feature instead of the direct fusion result to be learned, these three aspects change the current learning framework and optimization rule of deep learning pan-sharpening. Finally, thousands of remote sensing images from different scenes are adopted to make the training dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we selected seven representative pan-sharpening algorithms and four widely recognized objective fusion metrics to evaluate and compare the performance on the WorldView-2 experimental data. The results show that the proposed method achieves optimal performance in terms of both the subjective visual effect and the object assessment.

TI  - Pan-Sharpening Based on Convolutional Neural Network by Using the Loss Function With No-Reference
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to preserve the spatial and spectral information of the original panchromatic and multispectral images, this article designs a loss function suitable for pan-sharpening and a four-layer convolutional neural network that could adequately extract spectral and spatial features from original source images. The major advantage of this study is that the designed loss function does not need the reference fused image, and then the proposed pan-sharpening method does not need to make the simulation data for training. This is the big difference from most existing pan-sharpening methods. Moreover, the loss function takes into account the characteristics of remote sensing images, including the spatial and spectral evaluation indicators. We also add the feature enhancement layer in convolutional neural network, thus, the proposed four-layer network contains feature extraction, feature enhancement, linear mapping and reconstruction. In order to evaluate the effectiveness and universality of the proposed fusion model, we selected thousands of remote sensing images that include different sensors, different times and different land-cover types to make the training dataset. By evaluating the performance on the WorldView-2, Pleiades and Gaofen-1 experimental data, the results show that the proposed method achieves optimal performance in terms of both the subjective visual effect and the object assessment. Furthermore, the codes will be available at https://github.com/Zhangxi-Xiong/pan-sharpening.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Algal Blooms Using Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat OLI Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal bloom is a serious global issue for inland waters, posing poses a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems. The timely and accurate detection of algal blooms is critical for their control, management and forecasting. Optical satellite imagery with short revisit times has been widely used to monitor algal blooms in marine and large inland waters. However, such images typically are of coarse resolution, limiting their utility to map algal blooms in small inland waters. We developed a new method to map the spatial extent of algal blooms using sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and Landsat operational land imager (OLI) images with higher spatial resolution but lower temporal resolution based on the concept of local indicator of spatial association. The mapping results was applied to measure the duration and frequency of algal blooms in Lake Taihu from 2017 to 2020. Our results show that the developed methodology is able to extract the spatial distribution of moderate algal blooms using near-infrared and red-edge bands (bands 6, 7, 8, and 8a of sentinel-2 MSI images or band 5 of Landsat OLI images) by comparison with MODIS FAI data (R2 = 0.888 for sentinel-2 MSI and R2 = 0.85 for Landsat OLI, P < 0.05). However, the temporal resolution of combined Landsat OLI and sentinel-2 MSI images (i.e., up to 2-3 days) is insufficient to monitor algal blooms during the summer time in Lake Taihu due to cloud effects and rapid algal change. Our research has benefits for the management of small inland waters with complex water conditions.

TI  - Unmixing-based Sentinel-2 downscaling for urban land cover mapping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of Sentinel-2 new opportunities for large scale urban mapping arise. However, the spectral information embedded in the Sentinel-2 20 m spatial resolution bands cannot yet be fully explored in heterogeneous urban landscapes. The 20 m image pixels are often composed of different land covers, resulting in a difficult to interpret mixed pixel spectrum. Here, we propose an unmixing-based image fusion algorithm (UnFuSen2) that self-adapts to the spectral variability of varying land covers and improves the image fusion accuracy by constraining the unmixing equations on the basis of spectral mixing models and the correlation between spectral bands of coarse and fine spatial resolution, respectively. When compared to alternative state-of-the-art downscaling methods UnFuSen2 consistently showed the highest accuracy when applied across test sites in three different European cities (RMSEuuruseu2 203 vs RMSEalternatives [252, 337]). In a next step, we applied Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) on the downscaled Sentinel-2 image cube (i.e. ten 10 m bands) to generate subpixel urban land cover fractions. We compared our MESMA results against the traditional MESMA output as applied on the original Sentinel-2 image cube (i.e. four 10 m bands and six 20 m bands) and tested its robustness against reference data obtained over all three study sites. Results revealed an average decrease in RMSE of respectively 18% and 8% for impervious surface and vegetation fractions when our approach was compared to the traditional MESMA outcomes.

TI  - Estimation of Particulate Backscattering Coefficient in Turbid Inland Water Using Sentinel 3A-OLCI Image
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The particulate backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) plays an important role in the underwater light field. However, it is difficult to accurately estimate b(bp)(lambda) in turbid inland water with complex optical properties. To accurately estimate the backscattering coefficients in inland water, a simple classification method based on the shape of remote sensing reflectance was first proposed to distinguish two water types (i.e., water type 1 and water type 2) with different backscattering characteristics. Then, trigonometric functions were developed to simulate the backscattering coefficients at all bands in water type 1 and the backscattering coefficients in the visible band of water type 2, whereas a linear function was built to estimate the backscattering coefficients in the near-infrared band of water type 2. The proposed algorithm was compared with four state-of-the-art methods and validated by an independently measured dataset of three lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in 2020. The results showed that the proposed algorithm performed well in inland waters, with all mean absolute percentage errors < 40% and root-mean-square errors < 0.25 m(-1). Finally, the algorithm was applied to Ocean and Land Color Instrument images from 2016 to 2020 in Lake Taihu and Lake Hongze. It was found that the backscattering coefficients in Lake Taihu and Lake Hongze showed opposite seasonal variation trends, and the b(bp)(676) in Lake Hongze began to decrease since 2017, whereas no obvious interannual variation was observed in Taihu Lake in recent five years.

TI  - Bias Compensation Model for Sensor Orientation Under Weak Conditions
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-precision geometric positioning of satellite images is the basis for the geometric processing of remote-sensing images and acquisition of various geospatial information. It is an important premise for the wide application of high-resolution remote-sensing satellite images. To correct systematic biases in rational function models (RFMs), many compensation methods for system errors inherent of RFMs have been proposed. Thus far, the bias compensation model (BCM) is the most widely accepted method under rigorous conditions, namely narrow camera field, small off-nadir angle, and small attitude error. However, research studies on the compensation effect of the BCM under weak conditions (wide camera field, large off-nadir angle, or large attitude error) are still lacking, and some researchers commented that the BCM is inapplicable under weak conditions in the absence of experiments. This letter analyzes the effect of position and attitude errors on orientation accuracy in the image space. An experiment was conducted using data from the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide-field-view-4 (WFV-4) sensor to compare the proposed analysis with the traditional analysis, and the results obtained using the BCM under weak conditions were found to be consistent with our analysis rather than the traditional analysis. This confirms that the BCM can also be used under weak conditions.

TI  - A New Machine Learning Approach in Detecting the Oil Palm Plantations Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of oil palm is a major driver of deforestation and other associated damage to the climate and ecosystem in tropical regions, especially Southeast Asia. It is therefore necessary to precisely detect and monitor oil palm plantations to safeguard the ecosystem services and biodiversity of tropical forests. Compared with optical data, which are vulnerable to cloud cover, the Sentinel-1 dual-polarization C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquires global observations under all weather conditions and times of day and shows good performance for oil palm detection in the humid tropics. However, because accurately distinguishing mature and young oil palm trees by using optical and SAR data is difficult and considering the strong dependence on the input parameter values when detecting oil palm plantations by employing existing classification algorithms, we propose an innovative method to improve the accuracy of classifying the oil palm type (mature or young) and detecting the oil palm planting area in Sumatra by fusing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 images. We extract multitemporal spectral characteristics, SAR backscattering values, vegetation indices, and texture features to establish different feature combinations. Then, we use the random forest algorithm based on improved grid search optimization (IGSO-RF) and select optimal feature subsets to establish a classification model and detect oil palm plantations. Based on the IGSO-RF classifier and optimal features, our method improved the oil palm detection accuracy and obtained the best model performance (OA = 96.08% and kappa = 0.9462). Moreover, the contributions of different features to oil palm detection are different; nevertheless, the optimal feature subset performed the best and demonstrated good potential for the detection of oil palm plantations.

TI  - Deriving Highly Accurate Shallow Water Bathymetry From Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 Datasets by a Multitemporal Stacking Method
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirical models have been widely used to retrieve shallow water bathymetry from multispectral/hyperspectral satellite imagery. In traditional studies on deriving the topography and monitoring its temporal changes, a single date satellite image without clouds corresponded to a bathymetric map and multidate images corresponded to multiple bathymetric maps. The satellite image noise caused by various environmental conditions and satellite sensors can inevitably introduce errors or gaps in deriving bathymetric maps. Also, empirical models are limited in some remote areas due to the lack of prior bathymetric points. In this article, using only satellite data, including multitemporal Sentinel-2 images and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data, a multitemporal stacking method was developed to derive highly accurate and cloud free shallow water bathymetry with accuracy of approximately 1 m and the depth range exceeding 22 m. The proposed method was tested and validated by an airborne bathymetric lidar. To be specific, our method using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images can achieve a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.08 m (R-2 = 0.94) by comparing with in-situ airborne lidar data around Ganquan Island, which is better than the result (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 1.46 m) derived from single date image based methods.Also, the gaps in a bathymetric map due to clouds or other noise can be avoidable benefitting from the stacking of multiple date satellite images. In the future, this satellite data driven method can be further extended to the globe to produce highly accurate and cloud free bathymetry around clear shallow water benefited from prior ICESat-2 bathymetric data.

TI  - A Simple Phenology-Based Vegetation Index for Mapping Invasive Spartina Alterniflora Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) after introduced to China, has rapidly expanded along the coastline and become one of the top invasive plants in coastal wetland. While it has been well accepted that phenological information derived from multitemporal remotely sensed data improves vegetation mapping accuracy, previous research primarily relied on scene-based features for invasive plant mapping. In the coastal regions with frequent cloud cover such as SouthChina coast, extracting phenological features at scene level was impossible due to lack of sufficient cloud-free imageries. In this study, we aimed to propose a simple phenological vegetation index (PVI) using pixel-level composition of Sentinel-2 observations with the assist of Google Earth Engine platform. By developing and comparing six PVIs, separability analysis showed that phenological normalized vegetation difference index (PNDVI) of S. alterniflora and other land cover types were more separable than other PVIs and single-seasonNDVI. Based on the PNDVI, we further proposed supervised and unsupervised Otsu thresholding methods for S. alterniflora extraction. The overall accuracies of supervised Otsu-PNDVI-thresholding method using 10-fold cross validation reached 97.84%, and that of the unsupervised Otsu-PNDVI-thresholding method reached 97.20%. Kappa Z-test statistics showed that both supervised and unsupervised Otsu-PNDVI-thresholding methods yielded statistically similar accuracies as random forest classifiers based on six PVIs, and higher accuracies than scene-based classification. The success of the unsupervised Otsu-PNDVI-thresholding method suggested that the method was practical and operational for S. alterniflora mapping and its expansion monitoring in wide area such as South China coast.

TI  - Analysis on the water quantity changes from Jiangsu section entering Lake Taihu from 1990 to 2019
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to carry out a quantitative analysis and research on the main reasons for the amount of water entering Lake Taihu in Jiangsu, we conducted mutation tests on the amount of water entering the lake, construction land, rainfall and evaporation, and the amount of water diversion from the river in the past 30 years, using Mann-Kendall trend test and mutation test method, Envi5.3 and Pearson coefficient method, based on the meteorological data, remote sensing data, and water diversion data along the river from 1990 to 2019. Furthermore, taking the amount of water entering the lake as the dependent variable, we quantitatively evaluate the correlation and contribution of each factor. The results show that the amount of water entering the lake in the study area has risen to 95% in the past 30 years. The urbanization rate, meteorological conditions, and the amount of water along the river are the main reasons for its changes. Among them, human interference (urbanization rate and amount of water along the river) and natural influences (weather conditions) each account for 50%. In the future, it is recommended to strengthen the construction of sponge cities, and rationally and scientifically dispatch and use water resources along the river to reduce the impact of the increase in urbanization and external water diversion.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Modeling of Spatio-Temporally Varying Responses of Rainfed Corn Yield to Climate, Soil, and Management in the U.S. Corn Belt
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Better understanding the variabilities in crop yield and production is critical to assessing the vulnerability and resilience of food production systems. Both environmental (climatic and edaphic) conditions and management factors affect the variabilities of crop yield. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive data-driven analysis in the U.S. Corn Belt to understand and model how rainfed corn yield is affected by climate variability and extremes, soil properties (soil available water capacity, soil organic matter), and management practices (planting date and fertilizer applications). Exploratory data analyses revealed that corn yield responds non-linearly to temperature, while the negative vapor pressure deficit (VPD) effect on corn yield is monotonic and more prominent. Higher mean yield and inter-annual yield variability are found associated with high soil available water capacity, while lower inter-annual yield variability is associated with high soil organic matter (SOM). We also identified region-dependent relationships between planting date and yield and a strong correlation between planting date and the April weather condition (temperature and rainfall). Next, we built machine learning models using the random forest and LASSO algorithms, respectively, to predict corn yield with all climatic, soil properties, and management factors. The random forest model achieved a high prediction accuracy for annual yield at county level as early as in July (R-2 = 0.781) and outperformed LASSO. The gained insights from this study lead to improved understanding of how corn yield responds to climate variability and projected change in the U.S. Corn Belt and globally.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Surface Phytoplankton Carbon and Carbon-to-Chlorophyll a Ratio in the South China Sea Based on Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal variability of phytoplankton biomass has been widely studied because of its importance in biogeochemical cycles. Chlorophyll a (Chl-a)-an essential pigment present in photoautotrophic organisms-is widely used as an indicator for oceanic phytoplankton biomass because it could be easily measured with calibrated optical sensors. However, the intracellular Chl-a content varies with light, nutrient levels, and temperature and could misrepresent phytoplankton biomass. In this study, we estimated the concentration of phytoplankton carbon-a more suitable indicator for phytoplankton biomass-using a regionally adjusted bio-optical algorithm with satellite data in the South China Sea (SCS). Phytoplankton carbon and the carbon-to-Chl-a ratio (theta) exhibited considerable variability spatially and seasonally. Generally, phytoplankton carbon in the northern SCS was higher than that in the western and central parts. The regional monthly mean phytoplankton carbon in the northern SCS showed a prominent peak during December and January. A similar pattern was shown in the central part of SCS, but its peak was weaker. Besides the winter peak, the western part of SCS had a secondary maximum of phytoplankton carbon during summer. theta exhibited significant seasonal variability in the northern SCS, but a relatively weak seasonal change in the western and central parts. theta had a peak in September and a trough in January in the northern and central parts of SCS, whereas in the western SCS the minimum and maximum theta was found in August and during October-April of the following year, respectively. Overall, theta ranged from 26.06 to 123.99 in the SCS, which implies that the carbon content could vary up to four times given a specific Chl-a value. The variations in theta were found to be related to changing phytoplankton community composition, as well as dynamic phytoplankton physiological activities in response to environmental influences; which also exhibit much spatial differences in the SCS. Our results imply that the spatiotemporal variability of theta should be considered, rather than simply used a single value when converting Chl-a to phytoplankton carbon biomass in the SCS, especially, when verifying the simulation results of biogeochemical models.

TI  - Monitoring Subsidence Deformation of Suzhou Subway Using InSAR Timeseries Analysis
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Subway subsidence and the consequent geological hazards have become one of the major concerns especially in China's large cities. Large spatial-scale and temporally continuous measurements of surface deformation due to subway subsidence is the basis of the intelligent management for urban transit, as well as the guarantee for the early warning of geological disasters. In this paper, we used persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS InSAR) measurements to study and characterize the deformation process resulted from subway-induced subsidence in the construction and operation periods of Suzhou subway using 24-scene high-resolution TerraSAR data (from December 2009 to April 2015) and 19-scene low-resolution Sentinel-1A SAR data (from May 2017 to February 2020). Our results indicate spatially different subsidence rates at different segments along the Suzhou subway lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. TerraSAR data indicate the maximum subsidence rate of -13 mm/yr, while Sentinel-1A data demonstrate the maximum subsidence rate of -20 mm/yr. The decadal-scale subway subsidence deformation is generally characterized by its multistage dynamic processes. The significant subway subsidence is mainly distributed around interchange hubs at the intersection area of railway lines. The Peck function model is used to fit the subway subsidence displacement profiles, which reveals the normal distribution characteristics of the subway surface subsidence. Based on our timeseries analysis in different time periods, the logistic cycle function is used to invert the subway subsidence timing, which reveals four first-order stages during subway subsidence: slow acceleration period, fast acceleration period, decay period and steady-state period.

AB  - Aiming at the feature that the cloud detection algorithm using cloud area features can take parallel computing at many places, combined with the advantage of pipeline parallel processing of FPGA processing data, this paper proposes a method for achieving high-speed real-time cloud detection based on FPGA development on the remote sensing camera side. And it designs logical architecture for the parallel computing and extraction of multiple cloud area features in the cloud detection algorithm. In addition, a method for solving the difference and comparison probability of image entropy is developed, which can achieve the rapid and accurate detection of cloud layers in remote sensing images. The hardware test results show that the proposed method can realize cloud detection processing on remote sensing images with an input resolution of 512*512 on the Xilinx z7020clg400 series FPGA platform, at the 12th pixel clock cycle after image transmission (the pixel clock is: 65MHz) to obtain the discrimination result and the accuracy of cloud area discrimination for the Landsat8 remote sensing atlas can reach 85.38%. Besides, the processing efficiency is greatly improved, which can meet the real-time cloud discrimination requirements of the spaceborne platform.

TI  - Influence of AOD remotely sensed products, meteorological parameters, and AOD-PM<sub>2.5</sub> models on the PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution has emerged as one of the most urgent problems worldwide over the past few years. Especially, fine particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) has seriously endangered the human life and health worldwide. Thus, monitoring accurate and spatio-temporal continuously PM2.5 concentrations is essential for controlling air pollution. The key to accurately estimating PM2.5 concentrations is to build a reliable aerosol optical depth (AOD)-PM2.5 model, which is mainly determined by the AOD remotely sensed products, meteorological parameters, and estimating methods. However, no systematic evaluation and analysis of the influence of these three variables on AOD-PM2.5 model has yet been reported. Based on Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer AOD products, reanalysis meteorological data, and ground-based PM2.5 data during 2014-2015 in eastern China, we analyzed the influence of above mentioned variables on the accuracy of the AOD-PM2.5 model. The four modeling methods investigated are stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), classification and regression tree (CART), and random forest (RF). Adjusted R-2, mean absolute error (MAE), product index (PI), spatial resolution index (SRI), and Taylor diagrams are used to assess the accuracy of models. The results show that adding meteorological elements that vary with time and height can improve the accuracy by 4.97% over eastern China. The average PI of Terra AOD products increased by 0.15 compared with that of Aqua AOD products. Most SRIs have positive values, suggesting that AOD products with a spatial resolution of 10 km can lead to a more accurate AOD-PM2.5 model. The Taylor diagram indicates that RF model > BPNN model > CART model > SMLR model in terms of performance. Therefore, Terra AOD products with spatial resolution of 10 km and RF are more suitable for use with the AOD-PM2.5 model in eastern China.

AB  - Sparse signal processing is widely used in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging with the development of compressed sensing. As a typical sparse reconstruction method, L-1 regularization generally causes bias effect. In this paper, we linearly combine the nonconvex penalty and the total variation (TV)-norm penalty as a compound regularizer in the imaging model, which can improve the reconstruction accuracy of targets as well as maintain the continuity of the backscattering coefficient in uniform regions. Simulations and experiments based on real data from Gaofen-3 are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - An Accurate Sparse SAR Imaging Method for Enhancing Region-Based Features Via Nonconvex and TV Regularization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of compressed sensing theories and applications, sparse signal processing has been widely used in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging during the recent years. As an efficient tool for sparse reconstruction, l(1) optimization induces sparsity the most effectively, and the l(1)-norm penalty is usually combined with the total variation norm (TV-norm) penalty to construct a compound regularizer in order to enhance the point-based features as well as the region-based features. However, as a convex optimizer, the analytic solution of l(1) regularization-based sparse signal reconstruction is usually a biased estimation. Aiming at this issue, in this article, we quantitatively analyzed the variation of reconstruction bias with respect to the complex reflectivity of targets, the undersampling ratio and the noise power. In order to reduce the bias effect and improve the reconstruction accuracy, we adopted the nonconvex regularization-based sparse SAR imaging method with a nonconvex penalty family. Furthermore, we linearly combined the nonconvex penalty and the TV-norm penalty to form a compound regularizer in the imaging model, which can improve the reconstruction accuracy of distributed targets and maintain the continuity of the backscattering coefficient. Simulation results showed that compared with l(1) regularization, nonconvex regularization can reduce the average relative bias from 10.88% to 0.25%; compared with the matched filtering method and l(1) and TV regularization, nonconvex & TV regularization can reduce the variance of the uniformly distributed targets by80% without losing of reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on Gaofen-3SARdata are also exploited to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - A Distribution Independent Ship Detector for PolSAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection with polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, modeling the distribution of clutter is a complicated task. This article introduces a distribution independent ship detector for PolSAR images. First, in order to improve the detection performance, the multichannel PolSAR data are projected onto a 1-D space utilizing an adaptive linear filter. The design of linear filter is modeled as a nonconvex optimization problem with the principle of maximization target-to-clutter ratio, which is solved by an iteration optimization algorithm. Then, the convergence and computational complexities of the proposed algorithm are theoretically analyzed. After that, a distribution independent detector with a bounded constant false alarm rate property is proposed to distinguish ships from sea clutter. The detection threshold is calculated based on the Markov inequality without modeling the statistical distribution of clutter. Experiments are carried out on real Radarsat-2 and AirSAR data to test the proposed detector. The results demonstrate that the proposed detector, which takes the distribution independent and unsupervised properties as the main advantages, also achieves comparable detection performance with state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, additional experiments verify the robustness of the proposed detector to the initialization of the algorithm, even though the optimization problem is nonconvex. Finally, the effects on detection results caused by polarization characteristics are investigated to give a further explanation about linear polarization enhancement.

TI  - Water Body Automated Extraction in Polarization SAR Images With Dense-Coordinate-Feature-Concatenate Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) water body extraction is of great significance for many applications, such as flood disaster monitoring, coastline change detection, and water resources management. However, the previous research works have mainly focused on single-polarization SAR images, and the dual-polarimetric information has not been comprehensively utilized, which result in the problem of incomplete water body extraction. In this article, we propose a model called dense-coordinate-feature-concatenate network to extract and fuse the water features of dual-polarimetric SAR images, overcome the influence of ground interferences, and improve the accuracy and generalization of the model. In this model, the improved dense block module is used to extract and transfer the water features in the dual-polarimetric data, a coordinate attention module is used to reduce the loss of water body boundary, and a feature concatenate module is proposed to avoid information redundancy. Experimental results show that our proposed model can not only overcome the influence of roads and hill shades and achieve 98.4%, 84.62%, and 91.67% water body extraction accuracy in overall accuracy, intersection over union, and F1, respectively, on Gaofen-3 SAR images but also be directly applied to the water body extraction of Sentinel-1 SAR images.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Grassland Development in Inner Mongolia after Implementation of the First Comprehensive Nation-Wide Grassland Conservation Program
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Protection of the grassland's ecological environment and improvement of people's livelihoods are major tasks for the management of pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia. The comprehensive program for grassland conservation in China, the Subsidy and Incentive System for Grassland Conservation (SISGC), was launched in 2011. To comprehend the effects of this major step towards sustainable grassland development, this study focuses on the spatio-temporal development of grasslands in Inner Mongolia since 2011. Through the combination of MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data with up to date meteorological data, we used the indicators of Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) to analyze qualitative and quantitative grassland changes. A classification system on the pixel level, reflecting change trends and fluctuations of both FVC and NPP, was applied to monitor and analyze the grassland development from 2011 to 2019. In particular, the spatial transfer matrix of the recent two years (2018 to 2019) was analyzed to reveal the latest potential issues and random impact factors. The results show a positive overall but spatially unbalanced effect of SISGC, with a prominent positive impact in the semi-desert grassland area. The potential threats from both social and natural aspects as well as the importance of a forecast system for local stakeholders in the pastoral area are discussed.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Nowadays, it is observed that there is a visible drastic rise in number of vehicles in fast growing cities. With uncontrolled growth of urbanisation and due to increased population, pollution load has been increased. Presently in India air quality is being monitored in 456 air quality monitoring stations covering 190 cities in 26 states and 5 union territories as on 31st March 2011, where as in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh only 60 AAQM (Ambient Air Quality Monitoring) stations and in Warangal only four AAQM stations are being operated by PCB (Pollution Control Board) which are very less in number in terms of growth of city and increasing pollution load in Warangal. Limited number of AAQM stations limits the representative concentration in areas of high population density.There is a need of strengthening air quality monitoring stations. The present research has been carried out to generate the air pollution map for the urban area of Warangal by using Remote Sensing and GIS (Geographical Information System) techniques. Literature shows that these techniques can be used to monitor air pollution spatially RSPM (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter) and TSPM (Total Suspended Particulate Matter). Landsat 7 Enhance Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) image and four AAQM stations data are used to determine the relationship between Raster Value (RV) and four pollutants parameter i.e. RSPM, TSPM, SO2 and NO2. With four AAQM stations data, study has been made to correlate the pollutants and RV and it was found that the coefficient of determination, R-2 varies from 0.7783 to 0.8802, the highest coefficient of determination being found between RSPM concentration and the RV. Due to limited number of AAQM stations available, virtual stations have been generated to get detailed concentration map. Kriging interpolation has been used to generate pollution map. Highest concentration of RSPM and TSPM has been found in unmonitored area by four AAQM stations in the Warangal. SO2 and NO2 in the city were found very low as compared to National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS).

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately assessing the biomass of tropical forests is a challenge for the scientific community. This study has determined the canopy height and above-ground biomass of Indian tropical forest plantation by the space-borne TanDEM-X Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data using the physical scattering model and machine learning. The complex coherence estimated using TanDEM-X datasets of December month was found most appropriate for inversion of canopy height. The best canopy height accuracy (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 1.66 m) was achieved by the TanDEM-X pair with vertical wavenumber (K-z) 0.18 at a 27.31. incidence angle in Random Volume over Ground model. The Random Forest model selects 12 optimal parameters from 42 variables (e.g. Canopy height, alpha angle, and coherence, etc.) for spatial prediction of AGB. Observed and predicted AGB showed R-2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 27 Mg ha(-1). The canopy height explained the maximum variation in AGB than other TanDEM-X variables in the ML algorithm.

TI  - Bisphenol-A Induced Changes in Blood Indices of Channa punctatus and Alleviation with Vitamin C.
T2  - Scientific Temper
M3  - Article
AB  - Bisphenol A, a suspected endocrine disrupting chemical, is widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. With increasing industrialisation, the release of Bisphenol A in the environment is increasing in India. Bisphenol A is released in the environment from landfill leachates, industrial point sources, municipal sewage and by burning. Water bodies are the ultimate sink for Bisphenol A. People consuming fish captured from water bodies polluted with Bisphenol A can be exposed to the chemical through the fish. Channa punctatus, is an important food fish of India and neighbouring areas. In this study the effect of 30 days Bisphenol A exposure on the haematological parameters of Channa punctatus was assessed. Vitamin C, a known antioxidant, was shown to improve the changes in almost all haematological indices tested except at the highest concentrations of Bisphenol A used in this study. This study shows that Channa punctatus can be used as a useful sentinel species to assess pollution of water bodies by Bisphenol A and that the deleterious effects of Bisphenol A are probably caused by increasing oxidative stress in tissues which can be offset by vitamin C.

TI  - Investigating net primary production in climate regions of central Zagros, Iran, using MODIS and meteorological data
T2  - CLIMATE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland production is sensitive to climate conditions. In this study, we monitored actual and potential production in the climate zones of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province in central Zagros, Iran, from 2000-2016. Net primary production (NPP), light use efficiency (LUE) and rain use efficiency (RUE) were extracted from climatic and MODIS satellite data using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) and Miami models. The accuracy of the modeled NPP maps was assessed using regression analysis, based on field data collected at 750 sites under different rangeland conditions. The spatial distribution of NPP and RUE indicated that annual production and photosynthetic efficiency in degraded rangelands with poor and very poor conditions have decreased compared to those of moderate-good classes. The highest relationship between the field and modeled NPP was associated with the Astragal us spp.-Ferula spp. (R-2 = 0.865, p < 0.001) in the humid and cold climate zone with good rangeland conditions while the lowest was observed in the annual grasses-annual forbs (R-2 = 0.198, p < 0.001) vegetation type with very poor rangeland conditions within the semi-arid and cold climate zone. Furthermore, the highest and lowest NPP values were observed in the Daphne mucronata-Prangos ferulacea (48.38 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and annual grasses-annual forbs (3.42 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) vegetation types with LUE values of 0.13 and 0.02 g C MJ(-1) within the humid and cold and the semi-humid and cold climate zones, respectively. According to these findings, remote sensing-based differences between actual and potential NPP can be used as a valuable tool for identification of human impacts on broad rangeland ecosystems.

TI  - Characterization of D-Type Spectra Based on Hyperspectral Remote Sensing of the Lunar Surface
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - We surveyed dark, red-sloped, and featureless visible and near-infrared spectra on the lunar surface, similar to those of D-type asteroids. Using the hyperspectral data obtained by Spectral Profiler onboard SELENE, we examined the distribution of sites showing low albedo and high spectral redness, irrespective of absorption features. We found that regions around several dark mantle deposits, such as Sinus Aestuum, Rimae Bode, Vaporum, Sulpicius Gallus, Oppenheimer, and Taurus Littrow, are the darkest, reddest sites on the lunar surface. In addition, dark mare regions (albedo < 4%) are shown to be high in TiO2 abundance, while red mare regions (spectral redness > 2.3) are low in TiO2 abundance. Interestingly, according to the criterion of asteroidal taxonomic classification used in previous studies, most of these geological features are classified as D-type, which are characterized by featureless spectra, although they show absorption bands at visible, 1 mu m, and/or 2 mu m regions. This is because the asteroidal taxonomic classification relies on a small number of spectral bands of scaled reflectances, while the presence of absorption bands should be identified based on the continuum-removed reflectance of the hyperspectral data. Thus, our results suggest that the D-type group classified in previous studies consists not only of primitive objects of carbonaceous chondritic materials but also differentiated objects composed of rocky materials that may be found on the Moon. To provide better constraints for D-type bodies regarding their composition from remote-sensing data, a quantitative assessment based on an analysis of the continuum-removed reflectance of hyperspectral data may be required.Plain Language Summary D-type bodies are characterized by dark, red, and featureless spectra. The spectral characteristics of D-type hint at a carbonaceous chondrite composition, being indicative of primitive objects in the Solar System. We conducted a data mining analysis based on hyperspectral data obtained by remote-sensing of the Moon to examine the distribution of sites showing spectra resembling those of D-type asteroids on the lunar surface. We found that regions around several dark mantle deposits (DMDs) with pyroclastic origins are the darkest, reddest sites on the lunar surface. The DMDs show clear absorption bands, suggesting that their spectra are not featureless. However, according to the criterion of asteroidal taxonomic classification used in previous studies, all the DMDs are classified as being D-type. This is because the standard asteroidal taxonomic classification relies on a small number of spectral bands of scaled reflectance data, while the presence of absorption bands should be examined based on a detailed analysis of the continuum-removed reflectance of the hyperspectral data. Our results suggest that the D-type group classified in previous studies may contain not only primitive objects of carbonaceous chondritic materials but also differentiated objects composed of rocky materials that may be found on the Moon.Key PointsKeyWe qualitatively assessed lunar spectra similar to those of D-type asteroidsWe found that even the darkest, reddest pyroclastic materials showing absorption bands can be classified as having D-type spectraThis suggests that D-type contains not only carbonaceous chondritic objects but also differentiated objects composed of rocky materials

AB  - Remote sensing is useful to extract damages due to natural disasters. In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired from PALSAR-2 sensor onboard ALOS-2 satellite were used to observe damage situations due to the 13 February 2021 Off-Fukushima, Japan, earthquake. Landslides and rockfalls were reported at the Joban Expressway, a motor racing circuit, and seaside cliffs. Change detection using pre- and post-event PALSAR-2 intensity images was carried out and the results were compared with airborne optical images and field survey data. The landslide at the expressway and the motor circuit were recognized from the SAR intensity data, but rockfalls and other small-scale damages could not be identified due to the limitation of spatial resolution.

TI  - Quantifying the Long-Term Expansion and Dieback of <i>Spartina Alterniflora</i> Using Google Earth Engine and Object-Based Hierarchical Random Forest Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The overwhelming spread of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) (smooth cordgrass) over recent decades has put many native plant communities and coastal environments at risk. Therefore, long-term monitoring of S. alterniflora dynamics is necessary to better understand and manage the invasion of the species. However, it is difficult to map Spartina saltmarshes in China on an annual or multiyear epoch basis. To address this issue, we developed a classification approach integrating Google Earth Engine (GEE) and object-based hierarchical random forest (RF) classification, and we applied this approach to quantify the expansion and dieback of S. alterniflora at Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve, Jiangsu, China during 1993-2020. Results showed that the area of S. alterniflora expanded from 24.48 ha in 1993 to 1564.96 ha in 2010. However, after ecological hydrological engineering and an increase in Elaphures davidianus (Pere David's deer) numbers in 2011, the S. alterniflora area decreased significantly to 944.28 ha in 2020. During 2011-2020, the S. alterniflora area decreased substantially at a rate of 67 ha per year and by 86% in one area studied in Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve. In 2020, the 944.28 ha of S. alterniflora in the reserve was mainly distributed in mudflats by the sea. Overall, these results show that it is feasible to identify S. alterniflora using the GEE platform and object-based hierarchical RF classification; moreover, this approach could improve understanding and management of this invasion species.

TI  - An Operational Method for Validating the Downward Shortwave Radiation Over Rugged Terrains
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of downward shortwave radiation (DSR) is of great importance in global energy budget and climatic modeling. Although various algorithms have been proposed, effective validation methods are absent for rugged terrains due to the lack of rigorous methodology and reliable field measurements. We propose a two-step validation method for rugged terrains based on computer simulations. The first step is to perform point-to-point validation at local scale. Time-series measurements were applied to evaluate a three-dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer model. The second step is to validate the DSR at pixel-scale. A semiempirical model was built up to interpolate and upscale the DSR. Key terrain parameters were weighted by empirical coefficients retrieved from ground-based observations. The optimum number and locations of ground stations were designed by the 3-D radiative transfer model and Monte Carlo method. Four ground stations were selected to upscale the ground-based observations. Additional three ground stations were set up to validate the interpolated results. The upscaled DSR was finally applied to validate the satellite products provided by MODIS and Himawari-8. The results showed that the modeled and observed DSR exhibited good consistency at point scale with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.995. The average error was around 20 W/m(2) for the interpolated DSR and 10 W/m(2) for the upscaled DSR in theory. The accuracies of the satellite products were acceptable at most times, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.94. From an operational point of view, our method has an advantage of using small amount of ground stations to upscale DSR with relatively high accuracy over rugged terrains.

TI  - An Efficient Organization Method for Large-Scale and Long Time-Series Remote Sensing Data in a Cloud Computing Environment
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical earth observation (EO) data have played an important role in long-term scientific and environmental monitoring. The effective organization of large-scale and long-term remote-sensing data to achieve efficient retrieval and access has become one of the important issues. However, inherent big data characteristics, such as a large scale, and asymmetrical temporal and spatial distributions, have caused problems with the efficiency of data retrieval and access. Therefore, this study proposes an efficient data organization method for use in a cloud-computing environment that has two aims. First, it addresses the problem of low retrieval efficiency. An asymmetrical index model for the image metadata is constructed that is based on a unified spatio-temporal grid coding; a prepartitioning mechanism under the HBase architecture is established to realize the uniform storage of the metadata with an asymmetrical spatiotemporal distribution and to avoid retrieval efficiency bottlenecks caused by a load imbalance. Second, it addresses low access efficiency. By dividing the remote-sensing image into tiles, a unified spatio-temporal code is established for each tile, and a consistent hash operation is performed; tiles with similar hash values are stored in the same or adjacent Hadoop Distributed File System nodes. In this way, tiles with temporal or spatial correlations can be gathered and stored, and lots of disk seeks can be avoided during retrieval, thereby greatly improving the data access efficiency. Comparative experiments showed that the data organization method can effectively improve the retrieval and access efficiencies of large-scale and long time-series remote-sensing data in a cloud-computing environment.

TI  - Improving Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) geolocation by least-squares-adjustment based time-series co-registration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data sensed by the Landsat 1-5 satellites make up a significant portion of the early Landsat data record. However, accurate MSS image geolocation has been difficult to achieve systematically due to a number of factors associated primarily with the older sensor and satellite technology. As of August 2019, only 49% of the Landsat MSS archive could be processed at the highest-level L1TP (precision and terrain corrected) level, and the remainder were processed as L1GS (systematically corrected) with inaccurate geolocation and no terrain correction. This paper presents a methodology to improve the geolocation of MSS time series. The methodology uses an areaand feature-based least-squares matching scale-space algorithm, with a time series registration implementation, that we developed previously using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The methodology requires that at least three L1TP images in the time series acquired over a given path/row are available. A linear combination of a polynomial transformation and multiple radially symmetric radial-basis functions (RBFs) to model local uncorrected terrain relief effects present in the L1GS images are used. The processing is automated and applied in two passes. The first pass screens L1TP images to select the well-aligned ones that are used as references. The second pass registers the target images, including the L1GS images and any misaligned L1TP images, to all the reference L1TP images. The transformation coefficients for each registered target image are derived by least-squares adjustment using densely-matched tie-points between the target and the reference images. The methodology is demonstrated using 12 months of Landsat-4 MSS images at four Landsat path/row locations that contain agricultural, mountainous, and coastal regions, including a total of 43 L1TP and 31 L1GS images. There were sufficient tie-points to characterize the degree of misregistration of 14 L1GS images that had significant mean misregistration shifts ranging from 7.33 to 17.42 60 m pixels. In addition, at one site, two L1TP images were found to be misaligned and have mean misregistration shifts of 1.27 and 2.20 60 m pixels. The methodology provides sub-pixel registration accuracy after registration, the mean misregistration shifts for the 14 L1GS and two misaligned L1TP images varied from only 0.10 to 0.41 60 m pixels. The methodology does not use a digital elevation model, and examples illustrate that although the RBF transformations can compensate terrain relief distortion effects, larger (similar to 0.5 to 1.0 pixel) misregistration errors can remain in areas with highly variable terrain relief. Results are also provided for Landsat-1 MSS imagery to demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to even the earliest part of the Landsat record. Detailed qualitative and quantitative results are presented and indicate the potential of the methodology to improve the geolocation of the Landsat MSS data record that is discussed with recommendations for future research.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most important steps in classification and mapping research, sample acquisition and updating cost a lot of time and energy of researchers. The high temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of wetland make the reliable wetland sample selection more challenging. It is especially important for time series wetland classification to address the problem of how to apply sample sets to images with different periods. This article evaluated the reliability of the historical samples by using optical and synthetic aperture radar remote sensing data from the perspective of water inundation frequency, and three sample migration methods based on rule set, reclassification, and spectral similarity were proposed to carry out wetland classification experiment in the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the relationship between the number of samples and classification accuracy is analyzed. The migration and reuse of sample sets can quickly obtain accurate wetland sample sets, which lays the foundation for the study of wetland mapping in time series.

AB  - Wuda District of Wuhai City in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is rich in mineral resources, with proven coal reserves of 660 million tons. It is of great significance for local economic development and industrial production safety to monitor and study the dynamic settlement of Wuda Mining Area. The small baseline subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology has been widely used in surface deformation monitoring for its easy to realize long-term monitoring. In this paper, the 20 scene ascending orbit Sentinel-1A images from August 2019 to November 2020 are used. The geographical coordinate of the study area is 39 degrees 20'-39 degrees 40'N, 106 degrees 30'-106 degrees 50'E and the total area is 219.716 square kilometers. The displacement results show that the maximum subsidence velocity is about 198 mm/yr. The terrain subsidence mainly occurs in the west of Wuda District, which is mainly mountain areas and mining areas, including Wuhushan coal mine, Huangbaici coal mine and Suhaitu Coal Mine and the surface of the mining areas showed a long-term subsidence trend. The southeastern part of the study area is mainly residential area, and the surface uplift is closely related to human production activities.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF INUNDATION AREA AND WATER LEVEL OF THE TONLE SAP LAKE USING MULTI-SOURCE REMOTE SENSING DATA BETWEEN 2008 AND 2018
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest freshwater lake located in the most controversial transboundary river in Asia, the Tonle Sap Lake is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world. However, uncertainty remains because of the inability to measure nonlinear inundation dynamics in remote lakes at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, let along the water levels. This research attempted to explore the reliability of radar altimetry data to detect the inland water level of inundation areas, like that of Tonle Sap Lake over the past decade. The results indicated that the Jason-2 and Jason-3 radar altimetry data were able to retrieve water level with high accuracy (R-2 = 0.9232 and confidence coefficient of 98%), and the composite index was proven to be the optimal method to identify inundation area of the Tonle Sap Lake compared to the single-band threshold method and modified normalized difference water index by applying Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Surface Reflectance products MOD09A1. The fluctuation trend of inundation area and water level were basically consistent with the precipitation, presenting a distinct lagging relationship. More important was the truth that the downstream water level had poor correlation with the upstream runoff both in flood period and non-flood periods (R-2 = 0.0542 and 0.2873, p < 0.01), which indicated that the upstream explorations over Lancang- Mekong River had little effects on the downstream water volume.

TI  - Determining Suitable Spaceborne SAR Observations and Ground Control Points for Surface Deformation Study in Rugged Terrain With InSAR Technique
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We aim to address two primary issues using the multitemporal (MT) spaceborne SAR observations and InSAR technique to monitor slope stability in rugged terrains. One is how to maximize the observation and application effectiveness based on the geometric distortion in an area of interest for determining appropriate ascending- and descending-orbit SAR observations. The other is how to optimize the selection of ground control points (GCPs) to correct orbital phase errors and reference in deriving valid ground surface displacements in the SBAS InSAR analysis. Four criteria were proposed to identify valid GCPs efficiently and effectively. The 2017 Xinmo landslide event, China, was showcased. The tear-away zone was 100% and similar to 50% distorted when imaged by ascending- and descending-orbit Sentinel-1A/B SAR sensors. The descending SAR datasets were preferred. Then, we identified four spatially dispersed GCP clusters with the selection criteria using the SBAS InSAR technique and 45 descending-orbit MT SAR datasets. One GCP per cluster was chosen. With the four GCPs and SBAS analysis, we successfully detected the stable status in the landslide-free area and the prelandslide acceleration movement within the tear-away zone. Valid InSAR-derived results have been obtained. In turn, the GCP selection criteria have been validated, and the two issues resolved.

As a typical karst region, the Chuanshan Town in Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County, Guangxi was selected as the study area. Firstly, the plant species Richness Index, Simpson Index and Shannon-Wiener Index of 16 sample plots were calculated based on ground measurements. Secondly, the Difference Vegetation Index, the Enhanced Vegetation Index, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, the Optimised Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index, the Ratio Vegetation Index and the Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index were obtained from Landsat images. Then, regression analysis was performed between the three plant diversity indices and the six vegetation indices. The results indicated that the best correlation was between the Simpson Index and the Optimised Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (R-2 = 0.857, P < 0.01). The exponential regression model was established based on this relationship to inverse the plant diversity. The plant diversity was divided into five grades, namely, non-forest, first grade, second grade, third grade, and fourth grade. The diversity thematic map was expected to provide references for the protection of regional biodiversity.

AB  - To select adaptive InSAR data source for difficult area to improve the deformation results, an InSAR data selection strategy is proposed in this paper. The topographic factors and InSAR data source parameters are combined to integrate the sensor's viewing angle, terrain slope and aspect into a local incident angle, then the backscattering coefficients from 8 scenes of Sentinel-1 data in the study area is extracted, and the average value of the backscattering coefficients according to the classification results of the local incident angle is calculated. By analyzing the relationship between the origin InSAR data and the local incident angles, a local incident angle threshold is obtained. Finally, the credible area which is the important evidence in data source selection is obtained, which can be used as the mask data in the subsequent data processing to assist in improving the accuracy of the monitoring result.

TI  - STAT2-dependent restriction of Zika virus by human macrophages but not dendritic cells
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses significant threats to global public health. Macrophages and dendritic cells are both key sentinel cells in the host immune response and play critical roles in the pathogenesis of flavivirus infections. Recent studies showed that ZIKV could productively infect monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), but the role of macrophages in ZIKV infection remains incompletely understood. In this study, we first compared ZIKV infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and moDCs derived from the same donors. We demonstrated that while both MDMs and moDCs were susceptible to epidemic (Puerto Rico) and pre-epidemic (Uganda) strains of ZIKV, virus replication was largely restricted in MDMs but not in moDCs. ZIKV induced significant apoptosis in moDCs but not MDMs. The restricted virus replication in MDMs was not due to inefficient virus entry but was related to post-entry events in the viral replication cycle. In stark contrast with moDCs, ZIKV failed to inhibit STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation in MDMs. This resulted in the lack of efficient antagonism of the host type I interferon-mediated antiviral responses. Importantly, depletion of STAT2 but not STAT1 in MDMs significantly rescued the replication of ZIKV and the prototype flavivirus yellow fever virus. Overall, our findings revealed a differential interplay between macrophages and dendritic cells with ZIKV. While dendritic cells may be exploited by ZIKV to facilitate virus replication, macrophages restricted ZIKV infection.

TI  - An Improved Method for Retrieving Aerosol Optical Depth Using Gaofen-1 WFV Camera Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The four wide-field-of-view (WFV) cameras aboard the GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite launched by China in April 2013 have been applied to the studies of the atmospheric environment. To highlight the advantages of GF-1 data in the atmospheric environment monitoring, an improved deep blue (DB) algorithm using only four bands (visible-near infrared) of GF-1/WFV was adopted to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at similar to 500 m resolution in this paper. An optimal reflectivity technique (ORT) method was proposed to construct monthly land surface reflectance (LSR) dataset through converting from MODIS LSR product according to the WFV and MODIS spectral response functions to make the relationship more suitable for GF-1/WFV. There is a good spatial coincidence between our retrieved GF-1/WFV AOD results and MODIS/Terra or Himawari-8/AHI AOD products at 550 nm, but GF-1/WFV AOD with higher resolution can better characterized the details of regional pollution. Additionally, our retrieved GF-1/WFV AOD (2016-2019) results showed a good agreement with AERONET ground-based AOD measurements, especially, at low levels of AOD. Based on the same LSR dataset transmitted from 2016-2018 MODIS LSR products, R-ORT of 2016-2018 and 2019 GF-1/WFV AOD retrievals can reach up to 0.88 and 0.94, respectively, while both of RMSEORT are smaller than 0.13. It is indicated that using the ORT method to deal with LSR information can make GF-1/WFV AOD retrieval algorithm more suitable and flexible.

TI  - Spatial-temporal heterogeneity of landscape ecological risk of large-scale open-pit mining area in north Shanxi
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of mineral resources has severely disturbed the ecological environment, which intensifies environmental risk in the mining area and seriously threatens the regional sustainable development. From the perspective of landscape ecology, the ecological environment of the mining area could be evaluated by combining landscape pattern and ecological risk , which could reveal the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of landscape ecological risk in the mining area and promote the sustainable utilization of land resources. Based on the land use data of seven issues of Landsat TM images from 1990 to 2018 , the landscape ecological risk index was constructed , and the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of landscape ecological risk in Pingshuo mining area from 1990 to 2018 was explored by combining spatial statistics and geostatistical theories. The results showed that the spatial distribution of landscape ecological risk in Pingshuo mining area from 1990 to 2018 was concentrated. Moran' s I index ranged from 0.53 to 0.68. The Z score was much higher than the threshold of 1.96. The spatial agglomeration effect of risk was obvious. The landscape ecological risk level of Pingshuo mining area was dominated by medium-low, medium, and medium-high, accounting for 70%-90% of the total area in the whole region. The low risk areas were mainly distributed in Jingping Town and the large woodland of Baitang Town and Xiangyangbao Town. Arable land was the main distribution areas of medium risk , while the high risk areas gradually shrank to the mining core areas within the mine boundary. The random variation in the spatial heterogeneity of landscape ecological risk in Pingshuo mining area was less than the spatial autocorrelation variation from 1990 to 2018. The spatial heterogeneity caused by the spatial autocorrelation was dominant. These results indicated that at the scale of 0.50 kmx0.50 km, landscape ecological risk in Pingshuo mining area had strong spatial-temporal heterogeneity from 1990 to 2018, with a temporal trend of increasing first and then decreasing , and with significant spatial correlation and obvious spatial differentiation characteristics.

TI  - Joint Observations of Vertical Distribution of Aerosols in Hefei Area by Spaceborne and Ground-Based Lidars
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective As aerosols easily spread biological organisms (such as viruses and germs) and exert an extinction effect, they pose serious threats to public health and travel. In addition, with the rapid development of China's economy, intensive industrial carbon emissions and automobile exhaust caused the increase of the amounts of man-made aerosols in many areas of China. Therefore, monitoring these aerosols by remote sensing is necessitated. Joint observations by space-borne and ground-based lidars can capture the temporal and spatial changes in aerosol emissions. The comparative studies under various weather conditions were rarely reported. The differences among the different weather conditions are still unclear. In this paper, we filtered the observation Aerosol-lidar data by matching the time at which the spaceborne CALIOP transits through Hefei under four typical weather conditions: dusty, cloudy, moderately polluted without clouds, and moderately polluted with clouds. We conducted joint aerosol observations in Hefei, and analyzed the types of aerosols, their changes, and the causes and sources of aerosol pollution.Methods We compared the vertical distributions and profiles of the aerosols in the observation data of Aerosol-lidar and CALIOP. Using the PM2.5 and PM10 concentration data at the ground stations, we also determined the changes, vertical distributions, and causes of aerosols. The horizontal aerosol distributions were determined from the remote-sensing true-color images of MODIS. The causes of aerosol changes were deduced from the wind speeds and directions near the ground. Finally, the backward trajectories in the four study cases were analyzed in HYPSLIT mode. The lidar equation by the traditional Fernald algorithm was used in this article.Results and Discussions According to the joint observations, the polluted dust aerosol in dusty ( lightly polluted) weather was concentrated in the 0.8- to 1.6-km height range, and the dust type were dust and polluted dust. The depolarization ratio was concentrated in the 0. 18-0.20 range. In cloudy weather, the main dust type was polluted continental type concentrated in the 0. 4- to 1.2-km height range, with depolarization ratios between 0. 015 and 0.020. The aerosol content was very small and the particles were fine and spherical. In moderately polluted cloudless weather, polluted dust coexisted with polluted continental-type aerosols. The particles were concentrated in the 0.3- to 1.3-km height range, and the depolarization ratio was below 0. 080, indicating an obvious spherical attribute. In moderately polluted cloudy weather, polluted dust coexisted with polluted continental-type aerosols again, but the main height range was 0.8-1.4 km, and the depolarization ratio ranged from 0. 075 to 0. 100, indicating small-sized spherical particles. Small aerosols showed the properties of spherical particles with low depolarization ratios. The joint observations of space-borne and ground-based lidar more accurately captured and characterized the aerosol distributions at different time and from different locations than single observations. Although the ground-based lidar results were more accurate, the space-borne lidar provided better resolution for observing the spatial changes of aerosols. NOAA provided the HYSPLIT backward trajectory model for analyzing the sources and transport paths of the aerosols in the four weather cases. The HYSPLIT results confirmed different sources of the aerosols, to determine different conditions of aerosol formation by combining with the wind speeds and directions.Conclusions Cloudy weather conditions affected the detection of the bottom aerosols by the space-borne lidar. To better obtain the aerosol content and the characteristics of its change, the range-corrected signal was continuously observed at fixed point by the ground-based lidar. The aerosol changes largely differed under different weather conditions, and the types, causes and sources of aerosols were also highly variable. When the stratification of the atmosphere is stable, aerosols tend to accumulate locally and cannot diffuse; in contrast, when the atmospheric fluidity is strong, a small amount of pollutant dust mixes with the local aerosols and the weather becomes hazy, resulting from the change and transmission of aerosols. The combination of various data, such as lidar observations and ground particle-concentration data, wind speed, and wind direction, can explain the changes and causes of aerosols. In future work, we should combine these data into comprehensive observations of weather changes, and thereby build a model for monitoring urban aerosol pollution.

TI  - Interferometric Phase Retrieval for Multimode InSAR via Sparse Recovery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features a capacity of multiple imaging modes. It comes with Earth-observation data archives consisting of SAR images acquired in various modes with different resolutions and coverage. In this context, in addition to using single-mode images for SAR interferometry (InSAR), exploiting images acquired in different imaging modes for InSAR can provide extra interferograms and, thus, favors the retrieval of interferometric information. The interferometric processing of multimode image pairs requires special considerations due to significant variations in the Doppler spectra. Conventionally, the InSAR technique only uses the spectral band common in both master and slave images, and the remaining band is discarded before interferogram formation. Therefore, conventional processing cannot make full use of the observed data, and the interferogram quality is limited by the common band spectra. In this article, by exploiting the conventionally discarded spectrum, we present a new interferometric phase retrieval method for multimode InSAR data to improve interferogram quality. To this end, first, we propose a linear model to characterize the interferometric phase of a multimode image pair based on image spectral relation. Second, we adopt a sparse recovery method to inverse the linear model for the retrieval of the interferometric phase. Finally, we present real-data experiments on TerraSAR-X staring spotlight to sliding spotlight interferometry and Sentinel-1 strip map to Terrain Observation by Progressive Scan (TOPS) interferometry to test the proposed method. The experiment results show that the proposed method can provide interferograms with reduced phase noise and defocusing effect for multimode InSAR.

TI  - Changes in aquatic vegetation communities based on satellite images before and after pen aquaculture removal in East Lake Taihu
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve water quality and enhance ecological management, all the net-pen aquaculture facilities in the East Lake Taihu have been removed by the end of 2018. Understanding the impact of this activity on lake ecosystem health is critical to promote efficient ecological management. Aquatic vegetation, especially submerged aquatic vegetation is an essential component of healthy lake ecosystem, as they provide food and shelter, help to secure and stabilize shorelines and modulate nutrient circulation. Additionally, submerged aquatic vegetation can improve water clarity by competing for nutrient with algae. Monitoring submerged aquatic vegetation is fundamental to lake ecosystem health evaluation. In this study, we leverage Sentinel-2 data to map the temporal change of different types of aquatic vegetation types ( i.e., emergent vegetation, floating-leaved vegetation and submerged aquatic vegetation), as well as the dominant submerged aquatic vegetation species. We found that the dominant vegetation shifted from submerged to floating-leaved vegetation after the pen aquaculture removal in East Lake Taihu. Meanwhile, the total coverage of submerged aquatic vegetation and its diversity significantly decreased, suggesting environmental degradation in this area. Our research indicated that removing net-pen culture has negative effect on lake ecosystem health. Efficient ecological management of this critical lake system requires comprehensive evaluation before they implement any management activities.

TI  - Radial Velocity Estimation of Ships on Open Sea in the Azimuth Multichannel SAR System
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The azimuth multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system can meet the requirements of high resolution and wide swath (HRWS) simultaneously, which overcomes the constraint of the traditional single-channel SAR. However, for a moving target illuminated by the azimuth multichannel SAR system, its radial velocity will lead to ambiguous components and mislocation in the image. Therefore, the radial velocity estimation plays an important role in improving the image quality and moving target relocation, especially for large ships on the open sea. However, as the pulse repetition frequency of a single channel is less than the Doppler spectrum, the traditional velocity estimation methods working in the image domain are out of action. This article suggests an idea that the issue of velocity estimation is converted into that of the linear phase errors estimation combining the linear fitting method, and it is assumed that the target has been already detected before applying the velocity estimation algorithms. To estimate the linear phase errors, two algorithms operating in the Doppler domain are introduced and compared, namely the subspace-based method and the modified frequency correlation method. The advantages of the proposed approaches are free from iteration operation and high accuracy. Besides, the effectiveness of the methods is demonstrated via simulation data and GaoFen-3 real data from ultra-fine stripmap mode. Finally, this article analyzes the velocity estimation accuracy of the two methods and the influence of channel imbalance through substantial experiments.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on AOPC - Optical Spectroscopy and Imaging
CL  - Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Atmospheric correction is the basis for quantitative analysis of satellite remote sensing images, such as monitoring land surface changes. However, precise atmospheric correction is still challenging. Landsat 8 is a satellite used for surface monitoring launched by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 2013, with good spatial resolution. Rich spectral information. In this paper, an improved dense dark vegetation(DDV)aerosol retrieval algorithm is developed, and the retrieved AOD map will be used to process the aerosol impact factor of remote sensing images. Atmospheric correction is performed based on a lookup table generated by the 6SV model. Validation with the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) algorithm produced atmospheric correction images, correction images of the paper algorithm showed a good agreement with high correlation(Correlation R exceeds 95%). Meanwhile, a reliable software prototype system for processing atmospheric correction on Landsat 8 OLI images was developed. This system is based on C++ language and can perform atmospheric correction automatically, low-latency, and accuracy. The data products corrected by the software prototype are helpful for the widespread application of remote sensing data in emergency response, environmental monitoring, and national defense.

TI  - Design of a Novel Fully Automatic Ocean Spectra Acquisition and Control System Based on the Real-Time Solar Angle Analyzing and Tracking
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current manual spectra acquisition for monitoring water constituents has resulted in discontinuous data acquisition, insufficient amount of data, and small ocean coverage. This article presents the design of a novel fully automatic ocean spectra acquisition and control system based on the real-time solar angle analyzing and tracking. To ensure that the requirements for spectra acquisition are met, the system is capable of accurately calculating the solar angle by collecting the information of latitude, longitude, date, time and direction, and automatically adjusting the position of instrument observation plane and the pointing angle of fiber optic probe in real-time. It achieves full automation of collecting the downward radiance of skylight, the upward radiance from reference panel and seawater separately through controlling the rotation of fiber optic probe. A 188-day observation experiment was carried out at the coastal ocean experimental station in Qingdao from September 11, 2018 to March 17, 2019. After that, the system was conducted onboard the Dongfanghong 3 scientific research vessel for a one-month demonstration and sea trial in June 2019. Comparative experiments including manual spectra collection, chlorophyll-a sensor measurement, and water samples collection were carried out. The experimental results show that the relative error of the spectra between the system and manual collection is less than 5%, and the relative error of the remote sensing reflectance calculated by the spectra is less than 4%. Considering the chlorophyll-a concentration obtained by the sensor and the water samples as the true value, the relative error of the chlorophyll-a concentration obtained by the system is 10% and 25% respectively. The results show its full and reliable capacity in collecting spectra of seawater automatically and continuously in real-time, with satisfactory accuracy and timeliness.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the relationship between platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and axillary lymph node metastasis in cT1N0 breast cancer patients. Methods: The clinicopathological data of 154 patients with cT1N0 breast cancer from January 2015 to June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. The differences of PLR and NLR levels among groups with different clinicopathological factors (age, tumor size, ER, PR, HER-2, Ki67, p53 expression levels, vascular tumor thrombus and SLN metastasis) were compared. The relationship between clinicopathological factors and metastasis of SLN and non-SLN was analyzed. Results: There were 32 patients with SLN metastasis. The cut-off values of PLR and NLR for the whole group were 142.91 and 2.84. The PLR level was higher in patients with vascular tumor thrombus and SLN metastasis (P<0.05), and the NLR level was higher in patients with P53 negative and SLN metastasis groups (P<0.05). According to univariate analysis, there were significant differences in SLN metastasis among different tumor sizes, vascular tumor thrombus states, PLR and NLR levels (P 0.05), but there was no significant difference in SLN metastasis among patients with different ages, ER, PR, HER-2, Ki67, p53 expression groups (P 0.05). The difference was not significant in SLN metastasis status among patients with different ages and ER, PR, HER-2, Ki67, p53 expression and NLR level (P 0.05). Conclusion: High level of PLR and vascular tumor thrombus are the risk factors for SLN metastasis.

To understand the spatiotemporal patterns of LST change, this article conducted a spatiotemporal analysis using the Mann-Kendall trend analysis method with time series of mean annual surface temperature extracted from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer/Terra daily LST product from 2000 to 2018. The analysis indicated that both daytime and nighttime MASTs show an obvious warming trend with the average rates of 0.028 K/year and 0.069 K/year, and the nighttime variation has larger spatial coverage. Areas ranging from 4500 to 5000 m exhibited the strongest warming effect. The geodetector method was applied to detect the impacts from seven factors, including elevation, land cover type, latitude, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation, air temperature, and solar radiation on the spatial distribution of LST. The controlling effects of these factors were generally stronger in the nighttime than those in the daytime, and elevation was the most important factor with the contribution scores of 27.12% and 62.98% in the daytime and nighttime, respectively. In addition, the analysis revealed that the temporal changes of LST were mainly caused by surface properties (vegetation, snow cover, and water surface area) changes, radiant flux changes induced by cloud amount changes, and climate warming. In general, this article provides important insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of LST in the TP since 2000 and helps to reveal the impact of climate change on ecoenvironmental conservation.

AB  - This paper is a literary analysis of the prose work Gimong(記夢) written by Hakpo Jeong Hwon, a writer who was active in the western part of Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea in the first half of the 17th century. In the study of Korean classical literature, neither this work nor the person Jeong Hwon is mentioned. So, first of all, basic information about the author and his work was summarized and presented. Based on this, attention was directed at the two issues, and Jeong Hwon's inner consciousness and orientation, and the concerns of the creative process accordingly were examined in various ways.One is the background and motivation for the creation of this work. This work was created in 1638 when the Qing Dynasty demanded that 5,000 soldiers be conscripted to Joseon. Because of his relationship with Jeong Inhong, Jeong Hwon was extremely restraining his remarks on real politics, living near his hometown and maintaining an attitude of avoiding the world throughout his life. However, the situation in which China's central order collapsed after the Manchu Invasion of Korea was something he could not ignore. In response to this, the result of expressing his worldview and solution is Hakpo-Gimong. Another issue is the stylistic feature of this work. Although Hakpo-Gimong has the characteristics of Mong-gi(夢記), the content of the dream is long and it has the character of an editorial on social issues, so the characteristics of Mongyurok(夢遊錄) are also sensed at the same time. Therefore, by examining the characteristics of both sides in detail, it was revealed that it was basically created as Mong-gi and was partially influenced by Mongyurok during the writing process. It was also confirmed that it was a pioneering work of ‘Editorial-oriented Mong-gi’ that appeared later. Through this, it was confirmed that Hakpo-Gimong was a work that showed the dynamism of the literary creation based on dreams and the literary tradition during the traditional era.

TI  - Integration of Crop Growth Model and Random Forest for Winter Wheat Yield Estimation From UAV Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crop yield estimation is critical for food security and sustainable development. The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers a new approach to acquire high spatio-temporal resolution imagery of farmland at a low cost. In order to realize the full potential of UAV platform and sensor, machine learning has been introduced to estimate crop yield, but the shortages of field measurements have troubled researchers. In this article, the CW-RF model, a new wheat yield estimation model suitable for the North China plain, was established using random forest, and the crop growth model (the CERES-wheat model) was chosen to simulate abundant training samples for random forest at field plot scale. According to CERES-wheat model simulation, the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) at the wheat jointing and heading stages were selected as the most sensitive parameters, and were retrieved from UAV hyperspectral imagery using the directional second derivative and angular insensitivity vegetation index methods, respectively. Then the retrieved LAI and LNC results were input into the CW-RF model to estimate winter wheat yield. The field validation in Luohe, Henan showed that the root-mean-squared error of the retrieved LAI and LNC were 6.27% and 12.17% at jointing stages, 9.21% and 13.64% at heading stages, respectively. The RMSE of estimated yield was 1,008.08 kg/ha, and the mean absolute percent error of estimated yield was 9.36%, demonstrating the available of the CW-RF model in wheat yield estimation at field plot scale. Apart from Luohe, validations in some other fields (e.g., Xiaotangshan, Beijing), prove the wide applicability of the CW-RF model. In addition, the UAV hyperspectral data were found to significantly improve the retrieval accuracy, and further improve CW-RF model estimation accuracy. In conclusion, this article showed that the CERES-Wheat model simulation can be important data source for machine learning-based wheat yield estimation model at field plot scale, and the hyperspectral sensor mounted on a UAV is a feasible remote sensing data acquisition mode for winter wheat growth monitoring and yield estimation.

AB  - In Contemporary society, w ith the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), a “relational worldview” in which people, people, and objects are connected to the Internet to communicate and exchange information is emerging. As a process being, various relationships are organically connected, and the concept of creation w ith the potential for change is becoming important. Architecture should also be viewed as a process that gradually changes in relationships, not as independent beings. As Louis I. Kahn said of "the society of rooms", the value of architecture lies in fostering relationships in space. This is to be investigated through “The Philosophy of Organism”, thought by Alfred North Whitehead, a process philosopher. This is a process of evolution in which the system creatively advances as a structure in w hich the relationship between complex events is regularized. And this point is similar th contemporary architecture, w hich is built according to the human behavior in that space.Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine ‘the generative structure of events’ through Whitehead’s organic philosophy, and based on this, to study the possibility of contemporary architecture as an event generation structure built in the complex relationship of the urban environment. In particular, the analysis was focused on the works of 4 architects, Rem Koolhaas(OMA), SANAA, M V R D V , T oyo I to, w hich w ere discussed from an event and structure perspective in contemporary architecture. Through this, it can be seen that multi-layered relationships in contemporary architecture are mutual involvemented to form order and become a place in space. We hope that architecture will be an invisible system for rapidly changing and complex social relations in the contemporary information society, and that an organic system will be establisched to continuously create events in the process of becoming a place to adapt and evolve according to the environment

AB  - Over the last few decades, deforestation and climate change have caused increasing number of forest fires. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia has been the most affected country by tropical peatland forest fires. These fires have a significant impact on the climate resulting in extensive health, social and economic issues. Existing forest fire prediction systems, such as the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, are based on handcrafted features and require installation and maintenance of expensive instruments on the ground, which can be a challenge for developing countries such as Indonesia. We propose a novel, cost-effective, machine-learning based approach that uses remote sensing data to predict forest fires in Indonesia. Our prediction model achieves more than 0.81 area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, performing significantly better than the baseline approach which never exceeds 0.70 area under ROC curve on the same tasks. Our model's performance remained above 0.81 area under ROC curve even when evaluated with reduced data. The results support our claim that machine-learning based approaches can lead to reliable and cost-effective forest fire prediction systems.

TI  - A Generic Model to Estimate Ozone Concentration From Landsat 8 Satellite Data Based on Machine Learning Technique
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As ground-level O-3 has become one of the major pollutants affecting air quality in recent years, monitoring and revealing the spatial distribution pattern of O-3 are of great significance to study air-pollution characteristics. Based on the multilayer backpropagation neural network, one O-3 estimation model is proposed to obtain the continuous spatial distribution of O-3 concentrations, where the Landsat 8 images, meteorological parameters, and air quality data have been integrated together as the input for the model training and validation. In order to enhance the estimation accuracy, the proposed model has been optimized with respect to the influencing factors and spatial extent. In the test areas of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang of China, the proposed O-3 estimation model has demonstrated quite satisfactory performance-with the average coefficient of determination (R-2) larger than 0.90 and root-mean-square error smaller than 19.0 mu g/m(3). It is worth mentioning that all the data employed in this research are freely available and can be applied nationwide in the mainland of China. Taking advantage of the generic nature and the positive O-3 estimation results with high accuracy and spatial resolution, the proposed model can be expected to be a new way for studying air-pollution characteristics and, thus, support the decision making for environmental governance.

TI  - Study of Antarctic Blowing Snow Storms Using MODIS and CALIOP Observations With a Machine Learning Model
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a common phenomenon over Antarctica, blowing snow (BLSN), especially the large BLSN storms, play an important role in the Antarctic surface mass balance, radiation budget, and planetary boundary layer processes. This study presents the work on BLSN storm identification and analysis with observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite. Spectral analysis shows that BLSN identification is feasible with MODIS daytime data. A random forest machine learning model is developed and observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization are used for training. Model performance results show that machine-learning based classification can achieve over 90% overall accuracy when classifying MODIS pixels into cloud, clear, and BLSN categories. The machine learning model is applied to MODIS observations during the month of October 2009 for BLSN storm analysis. Results show that the size of BLSN storms has a large spectrum and can reach hundreds of thousands km(2). The MODIS based BLSN storm frequency map extends the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations coverage limit from 82 degrees S to the South Pole. A BLSN storm belt, which extends from the South Pole region to the coastal area between 130 degrees E and 160 degrees E along the Transantarctic Mountains, provides a potential pathway of snow transport. These results are important in improving the understanding of BLSN impact on Antarctic surface mass balance and boundary layer processes.

AB  - Monitoring can always be concerned as a vital part of completing a project successfully. In this paper, we illustrate approaches to detecting the construction process of the Hong Kong-ZhuhaiMacao Bridge from a remote sensing perspective. By applying multisources remote sensing data, we found that for establishing Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, more lands are reclaimed from the sea and farmland instead of greenery areas. Also, we use high-resolution images to record the construction process of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. In that case study, many remote sensing datasets and techniques are mentioned and explained. Working together with remote sensing is suggest helping engineers to discover some environmental and engineering problems in time.

TI  - MCNet: Multi-Scale Feature Extraction and Content-Aware Reassembly Cloud Detection Model for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection plays a vital role in remote sensing data preprocessing. Traditional cloud detection algorithms have difficulties in feature extraction and thus produce a poor detection result when processing remote sensing images with uneven cloud distribution and complex surface background. To achieve better detection results, a cloud detection method with multi-scale feature extraction and content-aware reassembly network (MCNet) is proposed. Using pyramid convolution and channel attention mechanisms to enhance the model's feature extraction capability, MCNet can fully extract the spatial information and channel information of clouds in an image. The content-aware reassembly is used to ensure that sampling on the network can recover enough in-depth semantic information and improve the model cloud detection effect. The experimental results show that the proposed MCNet model has achieved good detection results in cloud detection tasks.

TI  - AXIOLOGICAL ASPECT OF MODERN GERMAN ETHNOSYMBOLS IN TEACHING GERMAN LANGUAGE
T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the axiological approach, it has been established that the moral-ethical orientations of the German society have been internalized in the minds of the ethnos and verbalized by the ethnosymbols. An ethnosymbol is a motivated, conventional linguistic sign with multiple meaning that embodies important cultural meaningful concepts. The reasons for the formation of ethnosymbols are the specificity and duration of interethnic contacts, social, political and economic conditions for the development of ethnic groups. The semantic structure of the ethnosymbol is formed on the basis of national associative relationships commonly used in a particular sociolinguistic system of agreements. The aim of the article is to establish the value dominants of German culture on the basis of the analysis of ethnic symbols as important components of the linguistic picture of the world. Symbolic meaning as an associative rethinking of the direct and figurative meanings of the word involves taking into account the social function and ethnocultural specifics of the denoted object. National verbal associations are a prerequisite for the formation of symbolic semantics of the word, but the involvement of only linguistic methods does not provide a thorough and comprehensive study. The connection between language and language consciousness can be explored through an associative experiment. The results of such an experiment make it possible not only to establish the features of verbal memory, mental lexicon, cultural stereotypes, but also to reflect the specifics of the worldview of the language community. Most German ethnic symbols objectify such concepts as order, punctuality, purity, diligence, thrift. The set of the value dominants creates a certain type of the culture that has been maintained in the language and is transferred from generation to generation.

AB  - This Flood disasters, with their high frequency and major hazards, seriously endanger the safety of human life and property. Therefore, flood monitoring is of great importance. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is not affected by clouds and rain, and obtain effective data for flood monitoring. In July 2021, Weihui City encountered heavy rainfall, causing severe flooding. This paper selects the Sentinel-1A SAR data of Weihui City before the flood (July 15), during the flood (July 27) and after the flood (August 8), and uses the object-oriented threshold method to extract the water body information, and conduct the flood inundation area monitoring and analysis. The results demonstrate that the use of Sentinel-1A data based on the object-oriented threshold method can achieve rapid monitoring of flood areas. Before the flood occurred in the main urban area of Weihui City, the water body coverage area is 4.18 km(2), and the water body coverage area is 45.72 km(2) during the flood disaster. After the flood receded, the coverage area of the water body is reduced to 15.98 km(2). This indicates that the method proposed in this paper can effectively extract the coverage of water body and provide a reliable technical means for flood monitoring.

TI  - A near-real-time approach for monitoring forest disturbance using Landsat time series: stochastic continuous change detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances greatly affect the ecological functioning of natural forests. Timely information regarding extent, timing and magnitude of forest disturbance events is crucial for effective disturbance management strategies. Yet, we still lack accurate, near-real-time and high-performance remote sensing tools for monitoring abrupt and subtle forest disturbances. This study presents a new approach called 'Stochastic Continuous Change Detection (S-CCD)' using a dense Landsat data time series. S-CCD improves upon the 'COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD)' approach by incorporating a mathematical tool called the 'state space model', which treats trends and seasonality as stochastic processes, allowing for modeling temporal dynamics of satellite observations in a recursive way. The quantitative accuracy assessment is evaluated based on 3782 Landsat-based disturbance reference plots (30 m) from a probability sampling distributed throughout the Conterminous United States. Validation results show that the overall accuracy (best F1 score) of S-CCD is 0.793 with 20% omission error and 21% commission error, slightly higher than that of COLD (0.789). Two disturbance sites respectively associated with wildfire and insect disturbances are used for qualitative map-based analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that S-CCD achieves fewer omission errors than COLD for detecting those disturbances with subtle/gradual spectral change. In addition, S-CCD facilitates a better real-time monitoring, benefited by its complete recursive manner and a shorter lag for confirming disturbance than COLD (126 days vs. 166 days for alerting 50% disturbance events), and reached up to similar to 4.4 times speedup for computation. This research addresses the need for near-real-time monitoring and large-scale mapping of forest health and offers a new approach for operationally performing change detection tasks from dense Landsat-based time series.

TI  - Sea Surface Temperatures Derived From COCTS Onboard the HY-1C Satellite
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the key payloads onboard the HY-1C satellite, the Chinese ocean color and temperature scanner (COCTS) was designed for global sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean color detection. In this study, a nonlinear SST algorithm (NLSST) is applied to derive SSTs from the brightness temperatures (BTs) of the two COCTS thermal infrared bands at 10.8 and 12.0 mu m. The SST retrieval results from the multichannel SST algorithm (MCSST) are used as the first guess for the input of the NLSST algorithm. The coefficients of both the MCSST and NLSST algorithms are regressed from the matchup datasets of the COCTS BT observations and the measurements from the in situ quality monitor system (iQuam), which were collected from September 10 to December 31, 2018. The retrieval SSTs from January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 are evaluated by the in situ measurements from iQuam with root mean square errors of 0.84 degrees C for daytime and 0.97 degrees C for nighttime and robust standard deviations (RSDs) of 0.73 degrees C for daytime and 0.72 degrees C for nighttime. Daily gridded retrieval SSTs from September 10, 2018 to March 31, 2020 are compared with SSTs from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra satellite. The cross comparison RSDs are 0.56 +/- 0.05 degrees C for daytime and 0.67 +/- 0.05 degrees C for nighttime.

AB  - The transportation network between mines and ports in North Korea considering flood susceptibility was analyzed for sustainable mining and cooperation with North Korea. It was confirmed that Nampo Port and Songnim Port on the west coast can cover a wide area from Hwanghaenam-do to Pyonganbuk-do and have good connectivity. To evaluate the spatial vulnerability to flooding of North Korea, GIS analysis was conducted considering topographical and meteorological factors. In order to verify the calculated flood susceptibility, change detection analysis about water surface was performed by Sentinel-1B SAR images before and after August, 2020 when the typhoon and local heavy rain occurred. As a result, the water surface area expanded by about 19.4% to the vicinity of the water system and the flooded area increased as the degree of flood susceptibility increased. Through the analysis, the expected flood damage of transportation infrastructure was quantitatively identified during a typhoon or torrential rain.

TI  - Fusion of High-Resolution SAR and Optical Imageries Based on a Wavelet Transform and IHS Integrated Algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH IN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor remote sensing data can significantly improve the interpretation and usage of large volume data sources. A combination of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and optical sensors enables the use of complementary features of the same image. In this paper, SAR data is injected into optical image using a combining fusion method based on the integration of wavelet Transform and IHS (Intensity, Hue, and Saturation) transform. Not only to preserve the spectral information of the original (MS) image, but also to maintain the spatial content of the high-resolution SAR image. Two data sets are used to evaluate the proposed fusion algorithm: one of them is Pleiades, Turkey and the other one is Boulder, Colorado, USA. The different fused outputs are compared using different image quality indices. Visual and statistical assessment of the fused outputs displays that the proposed approach has an effective translation from SAR to the optical image. Hence, enhances the SAR image interpretability.

TI  - Commodification of Art: The Tragic Vision in Sam Shepard’s The Tooth of Crime
T2  - Modern Studies in English Language and Literature

M3  - research-article
AB  - The Tooth of Crime (1972) by Sam Shepard (1943-2017) centers around a showdown between an established artist and a new usurper―Hoss and Crow respectively. These two artists―more specifically, pop musicians―are metaphorically portrayed as gunmen fighting for a broader market share. Even though Crow seems to win Hoss’s fame and territory in the end, he quickly becomes skeptical of his dim and precarious future. In this regard, the duel between Hoss and Crow returns no winner but rather two losers troubled with tragic perspectives.Such a tragic vision of the play is evidently related to the capitalist ideology and postmodern pop culture of the late twentieth century. In the case of Hoss, the usurped, his weakness is associated with the fact that his proletariat past has been forgotten and dissolved by the seductive aspect of capitalistic pop culture. In a society where art becomes a mere commodity, he simply seeks to accumulate wealth and fame. As for Crow, his tragic worldview is closely linked to his character as a master adapter. His only weapon as an artist in the metaphoric gun fight is the ability to copy and adapt himself to what others have already achieved. Thus, he is far from a creator but a master of parody or pastiche characteristic of postmodern art. As such, The Tooth of Crime, through a fictionalized duel of two pop artists, delves into the plight into which artists in general are driven in a highly capitalized, postmodernized society.

TI  - An Epipolar Resampling Method for Multi-View High Resolution Satellite Images Based on Block
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the basis of stereo observation, epipolar resampling is a critical technology for 3D reconstruction. With the development of the 3D reconstruction using multi-view satellite images, the epipolar resampling of the multi-view satellite images has become a new challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an epipolar resampling method for multi-view high resolution satellite images based on block. Firstly, we establish the relationship between the vertical parallax and image block size for the epipolar resampling based on block. Using this relationship, we can choose the block size to limit the maximum vertical parallax in epipolar resampling. Secondly, we use the rational function model (RFM) to generate virtual corresponding points for fundamental matrix estimation, so image pairs with large stereo angles and poor consistency in multi-view satellite images which are difficult to extract feature matching point can be rectified. Experiments with multi-view satellite images demonstrated the universality and effectiveness of the proposed method. All the image pairs in the multi-view satellite image dataset were rectified successfully. The average epipolar resampling error is only 0.25 pixels when we rectify the multi-view satellite images acquired by WorldView-3 with the block size of 3000*3000 pixels, significantly less than the similar method.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIATION OF NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY IN A RAPIDLY EXPANDING ARTIFICIAL WOODLAND AREA BASED ON REMOTE-SENSING DATA
T2  - ERDKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of artificial woodlands in China has contributed significantly to regional land-cover changes and changes in the regional net primary productivity (NPP). This study used Ximeng County in the Yunnan Province as a case study to investigate the overall changes, associated amplitude, and spatio-temporal distribution of NPP from 2000-2015.The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach was used in the rapidly expanding artificial woodland area based on MODIS-NDVI data, meteorological data, and Landsat 5 TM data to calculate the NPP. The results show that (1) artificial woodlands experience a 10fold increase and account for 93 % of the land cover transfer, which was mainly from woodland areas. (2) The NPP was 906.2x10(9) gC.yr(-1) in 2000 and 972.0 x10(9) gC.yr(-1) in 2015, presenting a total increase of 65.8x 10(9) gC.yr(-1) and a mean increase of 52.4 gC.m(-2).yr(-1) in Ximeng County. (3) The most notable NPP changes take place in the central and the western border regions, with the increasing NPP of artificial woodlands and arable land offsetting the negative effects of the decrease in woodland NPP. (4) The total NPP in the study area kept increasing, primarily due to the growing area of artificial woodlands as well as the stand age of the woods, whereas the mean value change of the NPP is mostly related to the increasing stand age. (5) The artificial woodlands increase the NPP value more than natural woodlands. While protecting and promoting ecologically valuable natural forests at the same time, it seems quite advantageous to establish regional plantations and coordinate their development on a scientific basis with a view to increasing NPP, economic development, but also the ecological stability of this mountain region. Our study reveals the changes in NPP and its distribution in a rapidly expanding area of artificial woodland in southwest China based on remote-sensing data and the CASA model, providing a decision-making basis for rational land-use management, the optimal utilization of land resources, and a county-scale assessment approach.

TI  - Freezing Tolerance and Chilling Fulfillment Differences in Cold Climate Grape Cultivars
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grapevine sustainability is impacted by the timing of dormancy initiation and freezing tolerance in fall and winter and chilling fulfillment and bud break in the spring. These traits have genetic and local temperature contributing factors; therefore, this study was undertaken to develop an understanding of these characteristics in four recently developed cold climate cultivars. The cold hardiness and chilling fulfillment profiles were monitored in Brianna, Frontenac gris, La Crescent and Marquette using differential thermal analyses and bud break assays. Bud cold hardiness of all cultivars increased with the declining temperatures from November through February, after which the buds began to lose freezing tolerance. There were significant differences in cold hardiness and chilling fulfillment between cultivars during the endodormant and ecodormant period of winter. Marquette had the greatest freezing tolerance from early November through midwinter suggesting it has potential as a sentinel cultivar for comparisons of new cold climate selections. Brianna was slower to acclimate and deacclimated more rapidly than the other cultivars. Chilling fulfillment under natural field or constant 4 degrees C conditions showed no main effect differences for chilling accumulation condition; however, there were significant cultivar, condition, and time point interactions, indicating the cultivars differed in chilling fulfillment responses.

AB  - The FY-3E GNOS II GNSS Reflectometry is focus on sea surface wind speed retrieval. Data affected by sea ice should be removed, the monthly averaged sea ice coverage dataset was used to generate the sea ice look-up table. However, the sea ice coverage is constantly changing, a better alternative is to distinguish between sea ice and open water with real-time observed delay-doppler maps. In this paper, we mainly discussed the sea ice detection with GNSS-R signals from spaceborne GNOS II GNSS-R reflectometry. Several parameters derived from delay-doppler maps were analyzed and related to the sea ice concentration. The sea ice coverage was obtained by determining the threshold and weight of the parameters. Comparison of GNOS II sea ice coverage retrieval results with the OSI SAF sea ice concentration data showed good consistence. Analysis showed that the algorithm provides an accurate estimate of sea ice coverage in real time.

CP  - 7th Symposium on Novel Photoelectronic Detection Technology and Applications
CL  - Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Spectral quantitative fusion is a new direction of hyperspectral remote sensing fusion model and algorithm research in recent years, which is an urgent problem of multi-source hyperspectral remote sensing data processing driven by the application of time series global land cover monitoring. China has two high-resolution hyperspectral satellites in space orbit operating GF5 and ZY1E, and the planed hyperspectral satellites are expected to launch in next few years. Hyperspectral remote sensing data has shown a strong growth trend. High quality quantitative fusion is necessary for hyperspectral remote sensing images of large scale, time series and multiple coverage. Traditional remote sensing fusion models and algorithms mainly solve the problem of panchromatic and multispectral remote sensing image fusion. Hyperspectral fusion is more complex than traditional panchromatic and multispectral fusion. This paper investigates the three key difficulties in hyperspectral reflectance fusion. First, the spectral bands mapping of hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing is fuzzy, which have great differences in the spectral band range, band center wavelength, spectral resolution, spectral response characteristics between hyperspectral and multispectral; second, the hyperspectral remote sensing image contains multi-dimensional information such as ground spectrum, aerosol, water vapor, etc., which reflect the time-phase characteristics and time-series changes of spatial spectral characteristics in different places. The use of multi-dimensional time-series information in fusion processing is unknown, so the systematic error of reflectivity value cannot be detected and the random error is difficult to control; third, the traditional fusion method generally destroys the physical characteristics of quantitative hyperspectral data. This paper focuses on the key problem mentioned above, and takes the hyperspectral reflectance as the image fusion's physical quantity, puts forward a quantitative fusion scheme of temporal hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance based on observation confidence, to realize the high spatial resolution's breakthrough of hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance fusion with the reflectance physical truth value maintained and refined accuracy improvement of temporal hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance. This paper studies a quantitative fusion scheme which could be applied in hyperspectral reflectance refine and improvement for large-scale, discrete-time series hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance data set, and will be helpful for maximizing the quantitative ability of hyperspectral remote sensing data and improve the numerical accuracy of hyperspectral remote sensing reflectivity.

TI  - Ecological and Environmental Effects of Estuarine Wetland Loss Using Keyhole and Landsat Data in Liao River Delta, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An estuarine wetland is an area of high ecological productivity and biodiversity, and it is also an anthropic activity hotspot area, which is of concern. The wetlands in estuarine areas have suffered declines, which have had remarkable ecological impacts. The land use changes, especially wetland loss, were studied based on Keyhole and Landsat images in the Liao River delta from 1962 to 2016. The dynamics of the ecosystem service values (ESVs), suitable habitat for birds, and soil heavy metal potential ecological risk were chosen to estimate the ecological effects with the benefit transfer method, synthetic overlaying method, and potential ecological risk index (RI) method, respectively. The driving factors of land use change and ecological effects were analyzed with redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that the built-up area increased from 95.98 km(2) in 1962 to 591.49 km(2) in 2016, and this large change was followed by changes in paddy fields (1351.30 to 1522.39 km(2)) and dry farmland (189.5 to 294.14 km(2)). The area of wetlands declined from 1823.16 km(2) in 1962 to 1153.52 km(2) in 2016, and this change was followed by a decrease in the water area (546.2 to 428.96 km(2)). The land use change was characterized by increasing built-up (516.25%), paddy fields (12.66%) and dry farmland (55.22%) areas and a decline in the wetland (36.73%) and water areas (21.47%) from 1962-2016. Wetlands decreased by 669.64 km(2). The ESV values declined from 6.24 billion US$ to 4.46 billion US$ from 1962 to 2016, which means the ESVs were reduced by 19.26% due to wetlands being cultivated and the urbanization process. The area of suitable habitat for birds decreased by 1449.49 km(2), or 61.42% of the total area available in 1962. Cd was the primary soil heavy metal pollutant based on its concentration, accumulation, and potential ecological risk contribution. The RDA showed that the driving factors of comprehensive ecological effects include wetland area, Cd and Cr concentration, river and oil well distributions. This study provides a comprehensive approach for estuarine wetland cultivation and scientific support for wetland conservation.

TI  - Thermodynamic response of precipitation extremes to climate change and its impacts on floods over China
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the planet warms, shifts in the thermodynamic and dynamic environments of the climate system exert substantial impacts on the energy budget and water cycle. Understanding the response of precipitation extremes to climate change is essential for mitigating weather-related hazards and facilitating adaptive water resources management. The moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere, governed by the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relationship, increases with temperature at a rate of about 7%/degrees C. Thermodynamically, precipitation intensity is expected to increase exponentially and worsen flood conditions with atmospheric warming. However, both observational and satellite data have revealed a nonmonotonic (hook) scaling of precipitation and storm runoff, in which extremes strengthen with warming temperature up to a peak point (T-pp) and decline thereafter. Few studies have yet considered whether and why the hook structure might change in a future warming climate. Moreover, existing studies have largely failed to detect and attribute changes of extreme precipitation to atmospheric thermodynamics versus dynamics, limiting reliable projection of future hydrological hazards and climate simulations. Here, we build upon existing studies to understand how precipitation and storm runoff scaling might change over Chinese mainland. We use gridded observational data to examine the temperature scaling of precipitation and storm runoff extremes, extending the C-C relationship. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we diagnose the impacts of total column water vapor (TCWV), convective available potential energy (CAPE) and relative humidity on precipitation extremes. After partitioning the thermodynamic and dynamic contributions of precipitation extremes based on the energy budget and water vapor balance, we quantify the underlying physical mechanisms of hook structures. Future climate scenarios are projected by using a large ensemble from 21 global climate models (GCMs) within Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase-6 (CMIP6). Future streamflow series of 151 basins are projected by forcing hydrological model with bias-corrected climate model outputs. We quantify changes in the hook structures and their T-pp, and investigate implications of these shifts for future storms and flooding. The results show that relative humidity usually decreases with warming near-surface temperatures over most areas of China, while the TCWV and CAPE exhibit positive scaling rates with temperatures. The ERA5 reanalysis data over China reveals that atmospheric dynamics are responsible for the intensification of precipitation extremes and even flooding under very warm temperatures. The daily bias correction method reduces the systematical biases of GCMs outputs adequately, and captures extreme precipitation and temperatures well. By using four different hydrological models, we find that the Xinanjiang model typically exhibits the best performance in simulating daily streamflow over Chinese mainland. Projections of future hydro-climatological scenarios indicate that the hook structures do not set a firm upper-bound constraint on the intensification of extremes; rather, both the hook structure and the T-pp shift toward warmer temperatures in a warming climate. Alongside the shifts in T-pp, future storm and flooding extremes are projected to intensify by 20%-30%.These findings highlight the urgency in enhancing societal resilience to climate change, and understanding how the intensification of weather-related hazards might affect existing infrastructure and ecosystems.

TI  - Identification of Poverty Areas by Remote Sensing and Machine Learning: A Case Study in Guizhou, Southwest China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As an objective social phenomenon, poverty has accompanied the vicissitudes of human society, which is a chronic dilemma hindering human civilization. Remote sensing data, such as nighttime lights imagery, provides abundant poverty-related information that can be related to poverty. However, it may be insufficient to rely merely on nighttime lights data, because poverty is a comprehensive problem, and poverty identification may be affected by topography, especially in some developing countries or regions where agriculture accounts for a large proportion. Therefore, some geographical features may be necessary for supplements. With the support of the random forest machine learning method, we extracted 23 spatial features base on remote sensing including nighttime lights data and geographical data, and carried out the poverty identification in Guizhou Province, China, since 2012. Compared with the identifications using support vector machines and the artificial neural network, random forest showed a better accuracy. The results supported that nighttime lights and geographical features are better than those only by nighttime lights features. From 2012 to 2019, the identified poor counties in Guizhou Province showed obvious dynamic spatiotemporal characteristics. The number of poor counties has decreased consistently and contiguous poverty-stricken areas have fragmented; the number of poor counties in the northeast and southwest regions decreased faster than other areas. The reduction in poverty probability exhibited a pattern of spreading from the central and northern regions to the periphery parts. The poverty reduction was relatively slow in areas with large slope and large topographic relief. When poor counties are adjacent to more non-poor counties, they can get rid of poverty easier. This study provides a method for feature selection and recognition of poor counties by remote sensing images and offers new insights into poverty identification and regional sustainable development for other developing countries and areas.

TI  - Polarimetric Decomposition With an Urban Area Descriptor for Compact Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can alleviate the drawbacks of the fully polarimetric (FP) SAR and provide more target information as compared to the conventional single polarimetric and dual polarimetric mode. However, the present decomposition methods for CP SAR have the problem of overestimation of volume scattering (OVS) among urban areas, especially the obliquely oriented buildings (OOBs). The OVS can cause considerable OVS which leads to the misinterpretation of the scattering mechanism. In this article, a new descriptor of OOBs for the CP SAR is introduced to reduce the volume scattering in the urban areas. And a new model-based decomposition method, which is applicable for both the pi/4 mode and the circular transmit and liner receive mode, is proposed based on the descriptor. The Radarsat-2 FP SAR data are used to simulate the CP SAR data to validate our algorithm. The proposed method improves the double-bounce scattering component in different types of urban areas by about 10%.

TI  - Night-Time Light Imagery Reveals China's City Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic Period in Early 2020
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic has posed a serious impact on human life and health. Facing this unknown, unexpected, and devastating disease, China launched a resolute battle to prevent and control its spread. This study focused on assessing the recovery of city activity of 17 administrative regions in China around the COVID-19 pandemic period in early 2020. The night-time light (NTL) satellite remote sensing data, NPP-VIIRS dataset, was applied to evaluate the NTL changes during the coronavirus epidemic to understand the impact of the epidemic on city activity and the economy of China. A series of median composites was first constructed to analyze short-term NTL changes. Based on these median composites, the ratio map, difference map, wave index, and recovery ratio (RR) were defined to indicate the NTL recovery pattern and its spatial distribution characteristics. The results are as follows:first, the adopted median composites are able to describe the NTL changes in the short term; second, the recovery of city activity could not be exactly described by RR of a single year but could be evaluated by the comparison of RR between two adjacent years; third, a partial and spatially heterogeneous recovery of city activity is observed after the 2020 holiday compared to 2019, fourth, a better degree of recovery is observed after China announced its fully work resumption.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation and distribution characteristics of crop residue burning in China from 2001 to 2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we integrated a remote-sensing fire product (MOD14A1) and land-use product (MCD12Q1) to extract the number of crop-residue burning (CRB) spots and the fire radiative power (FRP) in China from 2001 to 2018. Moreover, we conducted three trend analyses and two geographic distribution analyses to quantify the interannual variations and summarize the spatial characteristics of CRB on grid (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) and regional scales. The results indicated that CRB presents distinctive seasonal patterns with each sub-region. All trend analyses suggested that the annual number of CRB spots in China increased significantly from 2001 to 2018; the linear trend reached 2615 spots/year, the Theil-Sen slope was slightly lower at 2557 spots/year, and the Mann-Kendal tau was 0.75. By dividing the study period into two sub-periods, we found that the five sub-regions presented different trends in the first and second sub-periods; e.g., the Theil-Sen slope of eastern China in the first sub-period (2001-2009) was 1021 spots/year but was 1599 spots/year in the second period (2010-2018). This suggests that summer CRB has been effectively mitigated in eastern China since 2010. Further, the average FRP of CRB spots presented a decreasing trend from 27.5 MW/spot in 2001 to only 15.8 MW/spot in 2018; this may be attributable to more scattered CRB rather than aggregated CRB. Collectively, the fire spots, FRP, and average FRP indicated that spring, summer, and autumn CRB had dropped dramatically over previous levels by 2018 due to strict mitigation measures by local governments.

TI  - Primary lymphoma of the breast: A case report and review of the literature.
T2  - Radiology case reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Primary lymphoma of the breast is a rare disease, accounting for about 0.5% of all primary breast tumors. Often found as a solitary indolent mass, it is difficult to distinguish from breast cancer on imaging and is often diagnosed for the first time based on histological findings. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common histological subtype. A 48-year-old woman visited our hospital because of a painless mass in the left breast. Breast cancer was suspected based on the imaging findings. A core needle biopsy was performed, and the invasive ductal carcinoma was diagnosed. Partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. The resected specimen was finally diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma based on immunohistochemical staining. The patient was treated with R-CHOP and intrathecal injection of methotrexate. The patient remains alive without recurrence 4 years later. Awareness of primary breast lymphoma is essential for accurate and timely diagnosis and avoidance of unnecessary surgery.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The problem of environmental pollution is a phenomenon such as global warming, fine dust, and a pandemic, which has a great impact on our lives. These problems go beyond the deterioration of the quality of life to the problem of survival. The intuition of these serious problems in advance has heightened the importance of ecology by modern and contemporary Western scholars. Nevertheless, as Western philosophy cannot escape from anthropocentrism, many scholars are trying to find ecological answers in Eastern philosophy.In order to compare and analyze the ecology of the two ideas[Confucianism and Buddhism], the first thing to be done is a comparison of the worldviews of the two ideas. First, Confucianism divides the composition of nature into ‘principle and matter[理氣]’. ‘principle[理]’ means natural principle, and matter means matter. On the other hand, Buddhism denies absolute material things and independent material things, although everything in the universe is always changing. In the end, it all boils down to ‘emtinessss[空]’. Therefore, Buddhism denies material things. Therefore, in Buddhism, it is called ‘ignorance[無明]’ to cling to matter while thinking of it as ‘being[有]’. Therefore, the worldview of Confucianism has a mixed conception of materialism and spiritualism, whereas Buddhism has a spiritualistic worldview.Due to the difference in the world view of these two ideas, the logic of the ecology view is also different. In Confucianism, all things and ‘I’ share the same ‘matter[氣]’ within the same natural ‘principle[理]’. This means that nature and I have a relationship of organic sharing and communication. Accordingly, in Confucianism, human beings were interpreted as beings with moral responsibility to nurture all things in nature. Buddhism, on the other hand, denies the 'I', believing that there is no boundary between everything and me. Buddhism sees that all things and ‘I’ are not different. Therefore, from the point of view of Buddhism, to protect the ecology is to protect oneself.Both Confucianism and Buddhism saw that religious or ideological purposes were completed when practice was made based on the above theory. In both of these ideas, ecological practices are not due to compulsion such as codes or precepts, but ecological practices based on understanding nature and ‘I’. In Confucianism, this is expressed as ‘Ren[仁]’, and in Buddhism it is expressed as ‘Pu-Sa-Xing L[菩薩行]’. This ecological practice has potential as a sustainable ecological practice because it is based on an understanding of nature and humans.

TI  - Evaluating FY3C-VIRR reconstructed land surface temperature in cloudy regions
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Missing values in land surface temperature (LST) data are often observed in the cloud-sheltered area, thereby seriously limiting the spatiotemporal continuity of LST. In this work, Remotely Sensed Daily Land Surface Temperature Reconstruction model(RSDAST) is used to gap-fill the pixels sheltered by clouds in FY-3 C/VIRR LST. Result shows that the cloud pixels in VIRR and MODIS original LST (OLST) product can be reconstructed accurately, but the reconstruction accuracy of MODIS LST is better compared to VIRR based on the RSDAST model. In addition, the reconstruction accuracy of VIRR and MODIS LST decreases with the increase in cloud coverage, and the reduction of the reconstruction accuracy of VIRR LST is larger than that of MODIS data. The number of effective dry-wet edge fitted by VIRR RLST/NDVI scatterplot was higher than that of OLST/NDVI, and the number of clear sky pixels in Reconstructed TVDI (RTVDI) images increased significantly, indicating that the RSDAST expands the temporal resolution and spatial coverage of infrared remote sensing data under cloudy conditions. Moreover, in DOY150-DOY243, the correlation between RTVDI and soil moisture is better than that of Original TVDI (OTVDI), indicating that the RSDAST improves the monitoring ability of soil moisture in these conditions.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Kurt Vonnegut’s worldview was a product of the Great Depression and World War II. These events affected his outlook on the meaning of existence and on the way the world worked. He was convinced that industrialization and the mechanization of humanity would lead to more problems as history progressed. Vonnegut produced The Sirens of Titan as a means for exploring the philosophical implications of modern science as he focues on the significant problem of the meaning or lack of it in human history. Many critics have strived to identify The Sirens of Titan in relation to postmodernism, and in particular to poststructuralist point of view by considering its thematic elements and contextual components. I suggest an alternate approach that acknowledges existential and moral aspects of the novel. In fact, Vonnegut in The Sirens of Titan offers a new perspective in the analysis of realitynamely, an acknowledge of a chronosynclastic paradigm that accounts for a postmodernist chaotic scientific paradigm and a modern Newtonian paradigm. In order to explore these issues, I will be using the Bakhtin’s theory of the chronotope as a site that elaborates the image of man in association with time-space. This will allow us to fully appreciate Vonnegut’s vision of humanity. I argue that Vonnegut proposes a chronosynclastic paradigm of the universe that allow readers to explore Vonnegut’s existential and moralistic vision of humanity.

AB  - Until now, the study of perception of the world in the Korean historial academic community has been widely used as a Perception to express its independent sphere of influence on par with China in order to counter the Chinese-centered tribute policy theory(朝貢冊封論). However, in the case of Silla, Buddhist worldviews had a significant impact rather than Huai-Gwan(華夷觀), the perception of central and subordinate countries.The purpose of this article is to examine the perception of the “Four-way territorial military commander(四方軍主)” and the unified world by the Cakravarti-rajan(轉輪聖王) based on King Jinheung’s Buddhist worldview in the monuments of King Jinheung, including the Changnyeong Monument.The tombstone of King Munmu in later times also shows the unified world by Silla based on the Buddhist worldview, which was found in the Monuments of King Jinheung. This article sought to emphasize Silla’s own historical experience and Buddhist worldview, breaking away from the existing study of the world based on the perception of Huai-Gwan.

TI  - Improved Accuracy of Velocity Estimation for Cruising Ships by Temporal Differences Between Two Extreme Sublook Images of ALOS-2 Spotlight SAR Images With Long Integration Times
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for improving the estimation accuracy of the velocity of cruising ships is proposed using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sublook images in the spotlight mode. The main purpose of spotlight SAR is to obtain high resolution utilizing longer integration times than those of other imaging modes, and the proposed method is based on these long integration times. The principal methodology is to produce successive N sublook images of a cruising ship, where N is more than approximately 10. The positions of the look-1 and look-N subimages differ by a substantial distance proportional to the cruising speed and the long interlook time difference. The distance, and hence the velocity of the cruising ship, can be computed from the cross-correlation function of these two sublook images with improved accuracy compared with other modes. We tested using PALSAR-2 spotlight subimages with N = 2, 10, and 20, and the results are compared with the automatic identification system data. Five images of ships cruising close to the azimuth direction were tested; the best result was obtained for the 10-look images with an average error of 13.8%, followed by 17.9% and 40.5% errors for the 20- and 2-look images, respectively. The reason is also given for the best result of the 10-look case over the 20-look case.

AB  - The naturally opened Han river estuary is a place where the flows of the Han river, Imjin river, Yaesung river meet with West Sea of Korea, so the hydrodynamic mechanism(Impact-Response) structure of Han river estuary is complex. Continuous observation and measurement due to the morphological characteristics at the estuary are required to maintain the estuary environment and river management facilities. However, the Sannam wetland(the study area) is in the military operation area. Therefore, Sannam wetland has the limited access under the control from military office. In 2020, there had a natural disaster due to flooding in August and COVID-19, and it made a survey hard. The noncontact survey technique, the analysis of LANDSAT images at Sannam wetland, was applied to analyze riverbed fluctuation and morphological transformation around Sannam wetland. LANDSAT images obtained from EarthExplorer, USGS and analyzed by QGIS. The analysis was performed based on the area and the distance near Sannam wetland. As a result, an erosion was happened on the downstream of the study area, and the upstream of the study area did not have any serious sediment transport. Considering the resolution of LANDSAT images, this noncontect survey technique is applicable to manage the study area. From the analysis of LANDSAT images, it is assumed that the tidal effect is greater than the inflow from the upstream. The pattern change of tidal response causes the damage of the river facilities near the Hangang river estuary.

AB  - A recent report cited environmental issues, including climate change, as the most likely threat to Earth in the 2020s. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize that environmental problems today are not just problems of any particular region or country, but also problems of the future, and problems of the present day in which we live. Various interests and research on environmental issues have been conducted within Christianity based on the Christian worldview based on creation, degradation, and restraint. This interest began mainly in the Catholic camp in the early days, but gradually efforts have been made to link global care to Christian responsibility in evangelical Christian camps, including the World Council of Churches (WCC). At a time when interest in earth care is growing, the study suggested as follows for the Christian community: First, it is necessary to change from environmental protection and ecological preservation to life theology. Second, there is a need for a change of understanding of ecology that looks at nature. Third, at the Christian level, there should be a genuine recovery movement that is differentiated from secular environmentalism. Fourth, the church should be able to realize a society that can realize a true community with the world of creation while looking forward to the kingdom of God.

AB  - This article mainly deals with the Punjab Christian relief work for partition refugees in 1947 India while dealing with Punjab Christian experience of the Indian partition in general. The partition of India in 1947 was a tragic event in modern Indian history. As Punjab, a Northwest region of India, was divided into two (East Punjab to India and West Punjab to Pakistan) Christians in Punjab had to experience a division of land and people along with communal violence. Although Punjabi Christians were socially and politically marginalized due to their outcaste origin and numerical weakness, they were major participants in the relief work for partition refugees. There were several elements that allowed them to focus on the relief work. Firstly, they were communally neutral in position amidst the communal violence. Secondly, they were prepared for providing relief in terms of their biblical worldview, facilities, and previous relief experience. Thirdly, western and Punjab Christian leaders worked cooperatively for the cause. The refugee relief work of Punjab Christians in 1947 India suggests missional insights for contemporary churches facing the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.

TI  - A paradigm of GIS and remote sensing for crop water deficit assessment in near real time to improve irrigation distribution plan
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study comprehensively used Remote Sensing (RS) and GIS for independently monitoring crop water adequacy in response to existing irrigation management system in Bari Doab, Pakistan. Canals' rotation plan is developed before start of each cropping season to distribute water on fixed turn basis. The study combines the moderate (Landsat-8) and low resolution (MODIS) satellite imagery to assess near real time crop water deficit in canal command areas (CCAs) of the study area. Landsat imagery were used to develop crop classification and determine cropping pattern using time series of NDVI. MODIS' NDVI product was employed to monitor the current crop health and develop annual reference NDVI cycle based on last 13 years' imagery. Climatic data of WMO stations combined with DEM have also been used to determine reference evapotranspiration based on Penman-Monteith method. These inputs were combined to estimate average crop water deficit in CCAs for ongoing cropping season on 08-day interval, the interval parallel to the canal rotation plan. RS based reflectance crop coefficients (K-CR) of current and reference crop cycle were developed to calculate potential and actual evapotranspiration, and then translated their difference into crop water deficit. Lag time of 08-10 days is limitation of the study due to satellites overpass time, but it can still prove very helpful considering the crop season spanned over 160-180 days. Results revealed that maximum crop water deficit (up to 9 mm) occurred in CCAs during crop growing (mid) stage. Crop water deficit showed inverse relation when plotted against intense rainfall months. Crop water deficit results could be helpful for irrigation managers to modify canals' rotation plan in near real time according to crop health and growing stage. It would not only help in achieving equitable water distribution but also assuring supplies when required by the crops.

TI  - The devastating flood in the arid region a consequence of rainfall and dam failure: Case study, Al-Lith flood on 23th November 2018, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - On November 23, 2018, cascading rainfall events that occurred in the upstream section of wadi Al-Lith, which is located in the western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, caused a failure in the Al-Lith earthen dam. This event was followed by a large-scale devastating flood that inundated the area downstream of the dam, damaging infrastructure and property. The main scope of this work was to identify the causes of catastrophic flooding and ways to prevent and mitigate the potential consequences of a future flood occurrence in the study area. For this purpose, remote sensing images, DEM, field observations, and rainfall data were used. A geospatial integrated approach using a GIS, remote sensing, hydromorphological analysis, and rainfall-runoff modeling was utilized to provide a better understanding of the hydrology of the wadi Al-Lith catchment. Various methods were used for rainfall frequency analyses; supervised classification was applied on Landsat (OLI), in which land-use types were classified to identify the curve number values. Rainfall-runoff modeling was conducted using the catchment characteristics and rainfall analysis to calculate flood volumes and peak discharges. Peak discharge results at the flood event on November 23, 2018, and at 5- and 100-year return periods were used for the prediction of flood extent using the 2D HEC-RAS model. Water inundated depth and velocity were mapped. The result of the 5-year return period simulated model showed a good correlation with the flood extent of the event on November 23, 2018 that extracted from the sentinel-2 image. This model was validated using field observation data and remote sensing interpretation at the real flood event of November 2018. The flood model indicated that a dam failure with the substantial release of an enormous amount of water in a short period created exacerbates the problem. Also, the simulated model of the 100-year return period showed high-risk of the whole floodplain area of Wadi Al-Lith and the urbanized zone, where utterly devastation could be occurred. Finally, the results showed that a new dam proposal is urgently required to prevent the area from future flood events to replace the failed dam with a 45 m high dam. In this case, the reservoir capacity is estimated to be similar to 147.4 million m(3), which is above the runoff volume for a 200-year return period.

AB  - Darwin can be evaluated as a person who caused a change in perception in the existing scientific revolution at the end of the 19th century. Scientific philosophers called it the 'Darwin Revolution'. Darwin neutralized the reason for identity, essentialism, and the traditional worldview that had dominated the West, such as teleology, determinism, and mechanical theory, at once. Since then, the theory of evolution has expanded its influence beyond the biological level to the field of humanities, including literature. This paper categorizes the evolutionary theories discussed in our modern history into four categories, specifies their characteristics, and examines the path of acceptance of East Asia in Korea, China, and Japan. Considering the acceptance of evolutionary theory as a "key axis" of the formation of modern East Asian discourse, I think it can be a methodology that tracks which evolution theory was used as the basis for their epistemology and how writers responded to the discourse of the times.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Green Tide From GF-3 SAR Images Based on Feature Selection and Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and accurate monitoring of green tide is of great significance to marine disaster prevention and marine environment protection. A method is proposed in this article for the automatic extraction of the green tide from Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which is based on feature selection and deep learning. In this article, since SAR images contain rich polarization information, we first employ H/A/alpha decomposition and other methods for the extraction of high-dimensional features from GF-3 SAR images. Second, a novel feature selection method for SAR images is designed by using the Bhattacharyya distance and the Separability index, which can select the optimal features subset with a strong ability for recognizing green tide and without correlation between features from the high-dimensional features of SAR. Then, to alleviate the model training burden and improve the prediction efficiency, a lightweight semantic segmentation network, called Mobile-SegNet, is designed based on MobileNets and SegNet. Finally, the selected optimal features and their labels are sent to Mobile-SegNet for training and obtaining the automatic recognition model of green tide, and in turn, the automatic extraction of green tide is achieved through model prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed green tide extraction method, GF-3 SAR remote sensing images taken in 2020 that covered the Yellow Sea are collected and used in the green tide extraction experiment. The results show that the proposed method is available for an effective reduction of the feature dimension required for green tide extraction, and the improvement of the accuracy and efficiency of green tide detection. The overall accuracy, F1-score, mean intersection over union, and the kappa coefficient of the proposed method reached 99.52%, 95.76%, 92.19%, and 0.92, respectively.

TI  - Construction of an evapotranspiration model and analysis of spatiotemporal variation in Xilin River Basin, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface evapotranspiration is a water exchange process between the atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere. Accurate evapotranspiration estimations in arid and semi-arid regions are important for monitoring droughts and protecting the ecological environment. The main objective of this study is to build an evapotranspiration estimation model suitable for an effective scientific and objective evaluation of water consumption in the arid and semi-arid regions of the Xilin River Basin based on comprehensive parameters, including meteorological parameters, vegetation coverage, and soil water content. In this study, the community evapotranspiration model was initially constructed using field data, which was then expanded for applicability to the Xilin River Basin based on Geographic Information System technology and spatial heterogeneity characteristics of remote sensing data; both models were significant at the 0.05 level. The monthly evapotranspiration values in July during 2000-2017 and those from April to September (growing season) during the dry, normal, and wet years were calculated using the model at the basin scale. The evapotranspiration showed a generally increasing trend, which was consistent with the fluctuation trend in precipitation in July during 2000-2017. The trend curve for evapotranspiration was gentle during the growing season in dry years, but steep during wet years. The evapotranspiration was the lowest in April, with negligible spatial variations throughout the Xilin River Basin. During May-July, the evapotranspiration was higher than that in other months, in the following order: upper reaches > middle reaches > lower reaches; this was consistent with the vegetation coverage. The evapotranspiration declined and spatial variations were not evident during August-September. The results of this study provide a reference for evapotranspiration model construction and a scientific basis for evaluating regional water resources and protecting the ecological environment.

CL  - Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - As a new multi-sensor satellite, GaoFen-5 (GF-5) has gradually attracted more attention. Especially, the GF-5 hyperspectral sensor has shown good prospects in geological applications, such as mineral mapping, geological body identification, and mining environment analysis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness of GF-5 hyperspectral data relative to airborne hyperspectral images (HSI) in geological applications. In this paper, the characteristics and preprocessing steps of GF-5 HSI were introduced. The HyMap data in the Subei area was employed for comparative experiments to evaluate the application performance of GF-5 in gossan identification. The experimental results show that the diagnostic spectral characteristics of limonite can be observed through GF-5 data. The distribution trends of limonite in both hyperspectral data are consistent, and the concentration of the limonite area directly indicated the gossan information, indicating that GF-5 HSI has promising potential for mineral mapping and may have important significance in large-scale geological applications.

TI  - Environmental deterioration in rapid urbanisation: evidence from assessment of ecosystem service value in Wujiang, Suzhou
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change is the most prominent feature of Chinese urbanisation. In China, the expansion of land consumed for urban development is inevitable given the rapid increases in the urban economy and urban population, but also in meeting the population's increasing demand for better quality of life. This paper is based on a research study of Wujiang district in Suzhou, which is considered representative of many of the rapid urbanisation areas within the nation. The objective is to develop an in-depth understanding of the characteristics of land use change and how this change contributes to environmental deterioration, as assessed by changes in the ecosystem service value (ESV). In this study, ESV is defined as the environmental products and functions provided for human well-being. Based on local planning documents, Landsat TM remote-sensing images and field surveys, the research analyses the cost to the environment when traditional land uses are transformed into urbanisation. The research demonstrates that conversion to urban land use which ignores the limit and capacity of the environment can generate significant environmental costs, as assessed by ESV, which in turn, can lead to a deterioration of quality of life for inhabitants, the exact opposite of the original intention. The research demonstrates that by mapping the spatial distribution of ecological service values, ESV can be used as a guide to urban sustainable development.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of PM2.5 pollution on the ecological environment and human health and safety has attracted worldwide attention. Previous analyses of large-scale PM2.5 spatiotemporal distribution have mainly been based on satellite observations. Due to the limitations of inversion methods, the real temporal and spatial variation of PM2.5 concentrations cannot be obtained from satellite data. Using PM2.5 data from 2014 to 2017 inversed from the daily PM2.5 data in Shandong Province and employing time series, spatial autocorrelation, and geographical detector methods, the temporal and spatial evolution of PM2.5 concentrations in Shandong Province and their driving factors are revealed. The results show that the annual variation trend in the PM2.5 concentration in Shandong Province is downward, with an average annual concentration of 57.6 mu g/m(3), while the monthly and winter months show significant high-level u-type changes, with small changes in spring and summer, and the number of days for air compliance in 2017 was 294. Linyi and Dezhou have the largest annual decline in air quality, while coastal cities have a small decline in air quality. From 2014 to 2017, PM2.5 of Shandong Province showed obvious spatial agglomeration and disparity patterns. The correlation between PM2.5 and other elements differs significantly by month, and soot emission has the most significant effect on PM2.5 concentration. Geographic detection analysis indicates that the main driving factors for the change in PM2.5 concentration in Shandong Province are crop broadcast area and soot emissions.

AB  - The presentations of the landscape in Herta Mueller's works are characterized by their pejorative onedimensionality, because they are constantly connotated with the fear of death. Mueller's view of nature is consistent with her existential attitude and in turn shapes her relationship with the world and her fellow human beings. It proves to be equivalent to her worldview and is therefore of fundamental importance at an epistemological and socio-political level. In addition, as a figure of poetic reflection in her texts, nature is used to illustrate allegorically Mueller's aesthetic concept concerning the motivation, functions, and characteristics of writing and language. In the description of nature, Mueller's poetics, anthropology, ontology, and ethics are lucidly illustrated.

TI  - Interannual Spatiotemporal Variations of Land Surface Temperature in China From 2003 to 2018
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a comprehensive embodiment of surface energy balance and land surface processes. The spatial and temporal variation of LST is of great significance for studying surface characteristics and climate change. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations of LST in China from 2003 to 2018 is examined by using the continuous and derivable annual temperature cycle model. The trends of the annual mean and annual amplitude of LST is detected using the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen estimator. In addition, we have further revealed the correlation between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LST in different land cover types. The results show that the annual mean LST presents a spatial distribution pattern of high values in the southern regions and low values in the northern regions and that the factors of altitude and land cover type also affect the LST's spatial distribution. The annual amplitude of the LST presents a spatial distribution pattern of high values in the northern regions and low values in the southern regions. In the majority of instances, the phase of LST in China was positioned between the 175th and 205th day of each year. Both the annual mean and annual amplitude of the LST have a mean increasing trend in China with a rate of 0.02 K/year, and the areas with large significant changes accounted for 8.6% out of the total area, with a mean rate of approximately 0.05 K/year, in this period. Significant changes in the annual mean LST were correlated with the change in vegetation coverage and the impact of land cover types on the interannual variations of LST is also determined in this study. While the increase in vegetation coverage in barren land exhibits a clearly recognizable upward trend in the annual mean LST, the improved vegetation coverage in the grassland region presents a downward trend in annual mean LST.

TI  - Research on the Lake Surface Water Temperature Downscaling Based on Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is an important factor of water ecological environment. As global warming, LSWT is also on the rise. Research on the main reasons of LSWT rising is the basis for controlling and improving the regional ecological environment. However, it is difficult for the existing remote sensing images to take into account the temporal and spatial resolution. Low-resolution images have a serious impact on data accuracy and even produce incorrect results. Therefore, obtaining high temporal and spatial resolution images by downscaling is of great significance to more accurately analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of LSWT. In this article, Dianchi Lake is selected as research area, and the high spatial resolution image (Landsat) and high temporal resolution image (MODIS) are taken as data. Based on the downscaling algorithm of statistics and learning, DisTrad- super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) downscaling model is proposed, and the monthly average dataset of LSWT with 50 m resolution is constructed. The results showed 1) DisTrad-SRCNN can reflect the most distribution characteristics of LSWT (SSIMday = 0.96, PSNRday = 23.97; SSIMnight = 0.95, PSNRnight = 24.99). 2) LSWT had an overall upward trend (CRday = 0.22 degrees C/10a, CRnight = 0.21 degrees C/10a), showing a cyclical change of cold-warm-cold about 4 years. 3) The northern and lakeshore area were basically in the high temperature, and the whole lake presents a 4-5-year warm-cold-warm periodic change; the LSWT closer to the urban and residential areas and its change rate were relatively high, which indirectly reflected the serious impact of human activities on LSWT.

TI  - The impact of water content on the assimilation of GNOS occultation bending angle
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the impact of multi-phase water content is introduced into a RO (radio occultation) bending angle forward operator based on two-dimensional ray tracing algorithm, and then performed to 3DVAR assimilation for FY-3c GNOS bending angle based on WRFDA. The evaluation shows that the impact of multi-phase water content cannot be ignored when the RO plane passes through the thick cloudy region of typhoon. Thus, an improved forward operator is established based on an algorithm that contains the effect of water content, and the bending angle is respectively calculated in clear sky and cloudy region. Then several experiments were performed to GNOS bending angle data assimilation for typhoon No. 24 in 2018. The original bending angle forward operator was used for a test, and the new operator was used for another one. It is shown that the simulation of typhoon's track and sea-level center pressure is improved in both tests, and the sea-level maximum wind speed increase as well. However, the shape and magnitude of the analysis increments for geopotential height, temperature, vertical velocity, and water vapor mixing ratio exhibit significant differences between the use of original and new operators. The test using new operator produces more accurate analyses and more improvements of deviation Gaussian distribution when compared with observations, enhances typhoon warm core structure in middle and low level, increases the asymmetry of typhoon humidity distribution, and optimizes the vertical velocity in typhoon region. Also, the adjustments of environment fields outside typhoon region are more effective, and the mean distance error of 96 h track simulation is reduced by 14% when the new operator was used. As expected, an operator that includes the effect of multi-phase water content is much beneficial for GNOS bending angle data assimilation.

AB  - Global land cover product and extraction technology with remote sensing images are the common methods to obtain the information of surface water. This paper selects the GLC_FCS30-2020 (GLC-2020) product and two results of water extraction by Sentinel-1A SAR images on different date and analyzes the consistence and accuracies of them. Verifying by the experiments, the consistence between the results of GLC-2020 and SAR method is higher than 80%, and the values of UA and PA of them are all more than 90% and 85%, respectively. The three results of surface water extraction all meet the needs of general applications. Considering the convenience and continuity, GLC-2020 is adopted in more applications and the SAR method is more suitable for time series observation.

TI  - Assessment of the Ecological Impacts of Coal Mining and Restoration in Alpine Areas: A Case Study of the Muli Coalfield on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface mining inevitably impacts the ecological environment, especially in alpine and fragile mining areas. Thus, it is worth discussing the dynamic impact process of mining on regional land use and landscapes. In this study, we took the Muli coalfield, a typical alpine mining area on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), as an example and analyzed the changing characteristics of the eco-environment in 2003-2010 (low-intensity mining), 2010-2014 (large-scale mining), and 2014-2020 (restoration) through a land use transfer matrix, landscape fragmentation index and vegetation cover based on remote sensing data, and discussed the problems and lessons learned. The results show that: (1) the land use transfer process changed from active to basically stable. During the mining phase, the land use transfers were complex and mainly consisted of the transfers of grassland to production land. The land use transfers during the restoration phase were not obvious. (2) Natural landscape types (e.g., river and grassland) were separated by surface mining. In terms of landscape fragmentation, the patch densities showed an increasing trend, while the patch shape fragmentation index showed first decreased and then increased. Additionally, the level of landscape fragmentation during the restoration phase did not change significantly. (3) The changes in average vegetation cover in the gangue fields occurred in four stages: i) gradually decreases from 2003 to 2010, ii) rapid decreases from 2010 to 2014, iii) increases from 2014 to 2017, and iv) further decreases again after 2017. (4) We summarized the lessons learned from the mining and restoration processes and provided a reference for addressing the conflict between mineral exploitation and environmental protection in ecologically fragile alpine mining areas.

TI  - Deep-Learning-Based Multispectral Satellite Image Segmentation for Water Body Detection
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated water body detection from satellite imagery is a fundamental stage for urban hydrological studies. In recent years, various deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based methods have been proposed to segment remote sensing data collected by conventional RGB or multispectral imagery for such studies. However, how to effectively explore the wider spectrum bands of multispectral sensors to achieve significantly better performance compared to the use of only RGB bands has been left underexplored. In this article, we propose a novel DCNN model-multichannel water body detection network (MC-WBDN)-that incorporates three innovative components, i.e., a multichannel fusion module, an Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, and Space-to-Depth/Depth-to-Space operations, to outperform state-of-the-art DCNN-based water body detection methods. Experimental results convincingly show that our MC-WBDN model achieves remarkable water body detection performance, is more robust to light and weather variations, and can better distinguish tiny water bodies compared to other DCNN models.

TI  - The histone demethylase KDM2B regulates human primordial germ cell-like cells specification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Germline specification is a fundamental step for human reproduction and this biological phenomenon possesses technical challenges to study in vivo as it occurs immediately after blastocyst implantation. The establishment of in vitro human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) induction system allows sophisticated characterization of human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) development. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of hPGCLC specification are not fully elucidated. Here, we observed particularly high expression of the histone demethylase KDM2B in male fetal germ cells (FGCs) but not in male somatic cells. Besides, KDM2B shared similar expression pattern with hPGC marker genes in hPGCLCs, suggesting an important role of KDM2B in germ cell development. Although deletion of KDM2B had no significant effects on human embryonic stem cell (hESC)'s pluripotency, loss of KDM2B dramatically impaired hPGCLCs differentiation whereas ectopically expressed KDM2B could efficiently rescue such defect, indicating this defect was due to KDM2B's loss in hPGCLC specification. Mechanistically, as revealed by the transcriptional profiling, KDM2B suppressed the expression of somatic genes thus inhibited somatic differentiation during hPGCLC specification. These data collectively indicate that KDM2B is an indispensable epigenetic regulator for hPGCLC specification, shedding lights on how epigenetic regulations orchestrate transcriptional events in hPGC development for future investigation.

AB  - Sea surface current is a research hotspot in oceanography. Space-borne along-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (along-track InSAR, ATI) is a promising sensor for measuring high-resolution sea surface current field, and there is no operational system in orbit yet. To support future space-borne ATI systems, based on the ATI experimental mode of the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite, the first sea surface current observing experiment was conducted in the Jiaozhou Gulf in China, in 2019. Meanwhile, SAR observations and in situ instrument measurements of the current are obtained in the experiments. The data is first preprocessed by a processor specially developed for the GF-3 ATI data. Then, the current is extracted based on the M4S mode. The retrieved current of the Jiaozhou Gulf is compared with ground-based high frequency surface wave radar data. The results show that the root mean square error of the surface current observed by the GF-3 satellite is less than 0.2 m/s.

AB  - Aerosols can have an important impact on human society. Remote sensing method plays an important role in the aerosol retrieval. The aerosol retrieval SARA algorithm isn't required a lot of prior knowledge and look-up table comparing with the traditional aerosol retrieval algorithms. However, the retrieval results of SARA algorithm are affected by the acquisition time differences and instability of MODIS data and AERONET data. In order to improve SARA algorithm, this paper studies the nonlinear optimization methods to construct the three-parameter model and the five-parameter model. And used the model to optimize the input parameters to improve the accuracy of aerosol retrieval. The correlation of five-parameter optimization results with AERONET sites Beijing and XiangHe is 0.7454 and 0.701 respectively, which is better than that of three-parameter optimization model's 0.6012, 0.6479, and both are higher than SARA's 0.3844 and 0.526.

TI  - Improvement in the Accuracy of the Postclassification of Land Use and Land Cover Using Landsat 8 Data Based on the Majority of Segment-Based Filtering Approach.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Improvement in the accuracy of the postclassification of land use and land cover (LULC) is important to fulfil the need for the rapid mapping of LULC that can describe the changing conditions of phenomena resulting from interactions between humans and the environment. This study proposes the majority of segment-based filtering (MaSegFil) as an approach that can be used for spatial filters of supervised digital classification results. Three digital classification approaches, namely, maximum likelihood (ML), random forest (RF), and the support vector machine (SVM), were applied to test the improvement in the accuracy of LULC postclassification using the MaSegFil approach, based on annual cloud-free Landsat 8 satellite imagery data from 2019. The results of the accuracy assessment for the ML, RF, and SVM classifications before implementing the MaSegFil approach were 73.6%, 77.7%, and 77.5%, respectively. In addition, after using this approach, which was able to reduce pixel noise from the results of the ML, RF, and SVM classifications, there were increases in the accuracy of 81.7%, 85.2%, and 84.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the method that has the best accuracy RF classifier was applied to several national priority watershed locations in Indonesia. The results show that the use of the MaSegFil approach implemented on these watersheds to classify LULC had a variation in overall accuracy ranging from 83.28% to 89.76% and an accuracy improvement of 6.41% to 15.83%.

AB  - The utilization of high temporal Sentinel-1 satellite imagery with radar sensors for identification paddy growth stage monitoring had been used. The Sentinel-1 can provide data for one specific area with the same orbit in every 6 days and freely available to be downloaded. This advantage can be used to identify paddy growth stages that usually have approximately 120 days life cycles. In addition, radar satellite is suitable for tropical region like Indonesia which is cloud free and promises for operational level in monitoring. This paper describes a study of Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm of paddy growth stage based on Sentinel-1 data. Sentinel-1 data for Indramayu region in West Java from January 2021 to April 2021 are downloaded and processed using SNAP software. It is found that the CART algorithm can estimate the spatial distribution of the next paddy growth stages based on previous data. It shows that the paddy growing stage between terrestrial estimates and CART-based SAR image data processing shows a similarity trend and pattern. Total area obtained by CART estimates (pixel based) always larger compares to area obtained by terrestrial estimates which is point based.

TI  - Coming to Terms with Defeat: Sir James Turner’s Understanding of Warfare and Divine Providence

AB  - In an era accustomed to interpreting defeat as a sign of divine displeasure, the outcomes of warfare present a difficult conundrum for the losing side. The need to answer this charge prompted various responses from the defeated Royalists in the British Civil Wars (1642-1651). This paper examines the writing of one such soldier, Sir James Turner, and compares his way of understanding defeat against other contemporary responses. It argues that neither Turner nor his compatriots’ stances were particularly ‘modern’ as they were all on one hand products of a worldview based mostly on Classical and Biblical study and the extension of medieval precedents, and on the other hand the most fundamental human responses in the face of adversity. These responses represent the basic defensive mechanism to overcome deeply traumatic situation, largely unchanged throughout human history. This paper further posits that Turner’s way of thinking represents a minority view among the Royalists, reflecting both his somewhat unorthodox military and political career and the theological tradition he inherited, as represented by the Biblical Book of Ecclesiastes.
